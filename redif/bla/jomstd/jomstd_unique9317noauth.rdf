Title: The Timing of International Expansion: Information, Rivalry and Imitation Among Japanese Firms, 1980-2002 
Abstract:
 Sociological-based information theory and economics-based competitive
 rivalry theory operate as the dominant theories of interorganizational
 mimetic behaviour. Recent work has sought to integrate the ideas in these
 theories, or determine which has greater explanatory power. In this study,
 we juxtapose the concepts in these two theories, to illustrate the
 complementary nature of information-based and rivalry-based theories of
 mimetic behaviour. Specifically, we consider how the predictions of
 information-based theories are moderated by the home competitive context
 of the industry of a firm making an international expansion. Using a 1980
 to 2002 sample of 4949 manufacturing plant entries made into 71 foreign
 countries by 783 publicly-listed Japanese manufacturing firms, we find
 that the competitive context in the home industry influences the
 propensity of a focal firm to imitate the actions of rival firms. Our
 results support our contention that the two theoretical approaches are
 complementary, with the complementarities extending from the limitations
 of each approach. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2007.

Title: Ordering Top Pay: Interpreting the Signals 
Abstract:
 Boardroom reward continues to attract controversy, despite the structural
 changes in corporate governance arrangements over the past decade. This
 study responds to Pettigrew's (1992) call to eschew over-ambitious
 attempts to demonstrate causality in the area of executive management and
 firm performance, in favour of redressing the overwhelmingly prescriptive
 bias in the literature. A simple but important task is to 'begin to
 provide some basic descriptive findings about boards and their directors',
 and open up 'the black box of board behaviour'- in this case, that of
 board remuneration committees. Interpretations of comparative market
 signals play a part in deliberations between the leading actors
 responsible for determining executive directors' salary, bonuses and other
 emoluments. But the position is more deeply textured than the reified
 influence of (global) market forces sometimes implied in the normative
 literature. The study reported, based on qualitative interviews, taps in
 to the nuances of decision taking in respect of boardroom reward
 management, including remuneration committee members' reactions to
 corporate governance reforms. Such initiatives locate non-executive
 directors in the role of intermediaries in the principal-agent
 relationship, explicitly assigned to resolve the conflict of interest
 inherent in boardroom remuneration systems, while simultaneously they are
 expected to play a team role as board members responsible for the overall
 strategy and operation of the company. The study is indicative: an attempt
 to open up research questions around the context and process of boardroom
 reward management that earlier analyses may have ignored or overlooked. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005.

Title: Practical Idealism: An Oxymoron? 
Abstract:
 Prasad and Elmes (2005) provide an appealing critique of the ways in which
 current 'green' rhetoric may be used to deliver programmes which do little
 to protect the natural environment. The following paper will present
 evidence in support of their argument through reference to recent UK
 government proposals for the aviation industry. At the same time, it will
 be suggested that there are a variety of limitations with Prasad and
 Elmes' (2005) thesis, including a failure to address critique of the
 constructionist treatment of nature, an inappropriate use of Alvesson and
 Karreman's (2000) concept of mega-discourse, and a lack of attention to
 the tension between idealism and praxis. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005.

Title: Stakeholder Influences in Organizational Survival 
Abstract:
 Although much has been written on declines and turnarounds, virtually no
 research has examined stakeholders' influence in an existence threatening
 crisis of an organization. This paper provides a theory and a historical
 case study that show how the most influential stakeholders can be
 identified and managed during an organizational survival. The proposed
 model demonstrates how stakeholders' influence in organizational survival
 consists of both direct resource dependence- and structure-based forms of
 power. The case analysis then describes an examination of actual
 stakeholder influences and changes in them during the decline and
 turnaround process. Finally, based on the findings of the case analysis
 and the influence identification, propositions are developed. They relate
 specific types of behaviours of influential stakeholders to the
 probability of organizational survival, showing how stakeholder management
 can be operationalized in an organizational turnaround. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2006.

Title: Incentive Asymmetries in the Mergers and Acquisitions Process 
Abstract:
 This paper focuses on the relationship between incentive asymmetries and
 some potentially undesirable outcomes along the mergers and acquisitions
 (M&A) process which could potentially destroy the shareholder value of the
 merged corporate entity. Incentive asymmetries are seen as belonging to
 the three categories of 'risk-antecedent', 'information-antecedent' and
 'pure self-interest antecedent'. We propose that incentive asymmetries are
 responsible for increases in the number of M&A projects and that they
 might create a 'lemons problem' with M&A candidates. Incentive asymmetries
 are also suggested to lead to prolonged contract-writing phases, biased
 financial evaluations and acquisition price escalation, as well as
 undermined post-M&A integration plans. If resolutions to these problems
 are sought, the use of high- and low-powered incentive schemes will need
 to reflect risk, information and pure self-interest. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2007.

Title: Strategy Creation in the Periphery: Inductive Versus Deductive Strategy Making 
Abstract:
 &emsp;Although strategy process research has provided careful and in-depth
 descriptions and examinations of strategy, micro-level processes and
 activities have been less commonly evaluated, especially as regards
 strategy creation and development. This paper examines how managers create
 and develop strategy in practice. A dual longitudinal case methodology,
 including a single in-depth study combined with a multiple retrospective
 study is used, involving four multinational companies. The findings show a
 twofold character of strategy creation, including fundamental different
 strategy activities in the periphery and centre, reflecting their diverse
 location and social embeddedness. Strategy making in the periphery was
 "inductive", including externally oriented and exploratory strategy
 activities like trial and error, informal noticing, experiments and the
 use of heuristics. In contrast, strategy making in the centre was more
 "deductive" involving an industry and exploitation focus, and activities
 like planning, analysis, formal intelligence and the use of standard
 routines. Copyright 2003 Blackwell Publishers Ltd..

Title: Comprehensiveness versus Pragmatism: Consensus at the Japanese-Dutch Interface 
Abstract:
 By comparing the views of managers working at the interface of two
 consensus-oriented societies, Japan and the Netherlands, we show important
 differences between the consensus decision-making processes as seen by
 Japanese and Dutch managers. These differences relate to how complete the
 agreement of opinion should be in order to speak of consensus, with the
 Japanese managers demanding a more complete consensus than the Dutch. The
 processes and conditions that Japanese and Dutch managers see as leading
 to consensus also differ. Japanese consensus is based on a more ordered,
 sequential process than Dutch consensus. Our respondents differed deeply
 regarding the role of the hierarchy in their own and the others' consensus
 processes, with both Japanese and Dutch managers seeing their own
 consensus process as less hierarchical. Our findings show that the concept
 of consensus is interpreted quite differently by Japanese and Dutch
 managers. This is an important warning for companies operating at the
 interface of these two societies. More in general our research illustrates
 the usefulness for international management research of detailed
 comparative studies focusing not on stark contrasts but on more subtle
 differences between management practices. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2007.

Title: Belbin's Team Role Model: Development, Validity and Applications for Team Building 
Abstract:
 This paper brings together research into and using the team role model
 developed by Belbin (1981, 1993a) in an attempt to provide an exhaustive
 assessment of construct validity in light of the conflicting evidence so
 far produced. Role theory is used to contextualize the origins of the
 model. The psychometric properties of the Team Role Self-Perception
 Inventory used to assess a person's likely behaviour in a team are
 examined along with 43 empirical studies that have tested theoretical
 associations between team roles and other cognitive or behavioural traits.
 While the evidence is mixed, we conclude that, on balance, the model and
 its accompanying Inventory have adequate convergent validity. However,
 strong associations between some team roles are observed, indicating weak
 discriminant validity among some scales in the Inventory. Through its
 coverage of important areas of teamworking, the paper contributes to the
 practitioner and research communities by providing fresh insights into
 aspects of teamworking and by suggesting new research agendas. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2007.

Title: Corporate Entrepreneurship and Real Options in Transitional Policy Environments: Theory Development 
Abstract:
 We develop a theoretical framework for describing, modelling, and
 predicting entrepreneurial strategies by corporations in transitional
 public policy environments. Drawing on research in entrepreneurship, real
 options, and strategic management under uncertainty, we demonstrate how
 corporations affected by government policy can use entrepreneurial
 strategies to exploit discontinuities generated by uncertain and unstable
 public policy environments. We argue that specific strategies will be
 effective depending on the degree and slope/inflection profile of policy
 change. Four strategies are identified: preemptive, optioned,
 synchronized, and adaptive. We develop propositions and provide
 illustrations to show how each of these strategies has helped firms
 respond to transitional policy environments. We conclude by offering a
 discussion of the utility and limitations of the framework and its
 potential application to other managerial circumstances in which
 uncertainty is pervasive, and by describing opportunities for further
 research, including empirical testing of our model. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2004.

Title: Social Structure and Intermediation: Market-making Strategies in International Exchange 
Abstract:
 Information gaps between markets create opportunities for international
 trade intermediaries to negotiate cross-border exchanges. Faced with the
 prospect of eventually being eliminated from these exchanges,
 intermediaries must continually search for new opportunities to mediate
 international exchange. In this paper an original explanation is derived
 from the core principles of structural hole theory to explain how these
 market-making firms operate in the tension found between the inevitable
 decay of existing exchange relationships and the uncertainty of finding
 replacement sources of income. Copyright 2003 Blackwell Publishing Ltd..

Title: Understanding Business Group Performance in an Emerging Economy: Acquiring Resources and Capabilities in Order to Prosper 
Abstract:
 The prevalent organizational form in most emerging markets is business
 groups. These groups have typically been viewed through a transaction cost
 economics perspective where they are perceived as responses to
 inefficiencies in the market. However, the evidence to date on what
 generates a positive business group-performance relationship in such
 environments is not well understood. This study expands the understanding
 of business groups by employing the resource-based and institutional
 theoretical perspectives to examine how groups acquire resources and
 capabilities to prosper. The empirical evidence is based on over 224
 business groups in the emerging economy context of China and shows that
 most of the endowed government resources do not help business groups to
 create a competitive edge. Instead, those business groups with strategic
 actions to develop a unique portfolio of market-oriented resources and
 capabilities are most likely to prosper. The results provide critical
 insights on the relationship between the initiation of institutional
 transformation and the desired outcome to be realized by organizational
 transformation, thus enriching our understanding of institutions and
 strategic choices facilitated or constrained by organizational resources
 in emerging economies. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005.

Title: Organizational Identity and Place: A Discursive Exploration of Hegemony and Resistance 
Abstract:
 This paper analyses how three distinct cohorts of workers in a recently
 merged UK-based College of Further Education understood their group and
 their organization's identities. We focus in particular, but not
 exclusively on how the groups' shared understandings of 'place' informed
 their identity accounts. Identities are theorized as being constituted
 within discursive regimes, and place treated as a discursive resource on
 which individuals and groups may draw in their attempts to author versions
 of their selves. In our case, understandings of place were also a resource
 on which some people drew in nostalgic reminiscence, and others used to
 fantasize about their preferred futures for the college. Framed by our
 intention to identify plurivocal native interpretations of place and
 identity in ways that promote the reading of polysemy back into case
 research, the contribution this paper makes is threefold. First, it adds
 to efforts to theorize organizations and identities as unstable social
 constructions constituted through acts of languaging. Second, it
 illustrates how different groups of local actors with distinct histories
 and value preferences may draw on their place of work in order to author
 contrasting versions of their organization's identity. Finally, our paper
 analyses the attempts made by senior managers and groups of other staff to
 define their organization in particular ways, as hegemonic 'moves' in an
 ongoing struggle for control over the organization as a discursive space. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2006.

Title: In the Name of the Practical: Unearthing the Hegemony of Pragmatics in the Discourse of Environmental Management 
Abstract:
 A prominent feature of the rapidly growing field of Environmental
 Management (EM) is its strong emphasis on pragmatic considerations. Much
 of EM's legitimacy stems from its own identity as having practical
 relevance in resolving contemporary environmental problems. With the help
 of Critical Discourse Analysis, our paper engages closely with the
 language of practicality in Environmental Management. We show how the
 message of practicality emerged through three core messages in the
 discourse, viz. economic utilitarianism, compromise and
 inter-organizational collaboration. We further contend that in the actual
 material context of the complex biospheric environment, these messages may
 have less than pragmatic implications. We conclude with a discussion of
 ecological rationality in redefining the discourse of pragmatics in
 Environmental Management. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005.

Title: Rooted in Supervision, Branching into Management: Continuity and Change in the Role of First-Line Manager 
Abstract:
 It is frequently argued that, as a consequence of radical organizational
 change, the role of first-line manager (FLM) has shifted from supervision
 to team leadership/co-ordination or business unit management. After
 reviewing the nature of these claims and the debate about the relationship
 between first-line management and supervision, evidence is presented from
 a survey of 135 organizations in London and the South East on how the role
 of FLM is presently defined and how it has changed. The findings paint a
 picture of a stable, consistent FLM role where a common
 performance-oriented supervisory core is surrounded by a penumbra of
 additional managerial responsibilities relating to stewardship,
 translating strategy into operations, unit management and, exceptionally,
 business management. The FLM role remains part of a hierarchical system of
 individual managerial responsibility and vertical accountability, with
 narrow spans of control, vertical and internal contacts and authority,
 participation in decisions and accountability confined largely to
 operating routines. Changes to the FLM role have been as much towards a
 strengthening of the supervisory core as a broadening into business
 management responsibilities. It is argued that the persistence and
 prevalence of the supervisory core stems from the continued location of
 FLMs within systems of external, hierarchical supervision. Far from being
 weakened, the supervisory core of the FLM role has often been strengthened
 by the adoption of more stringent controls over work practice in order to
 cope with a growth in business activity or comply with a greater range of
 external regulations. In some cases, however, a re-division of managerial
 labour has led to formerly middle management responsibilities and
 accountability being added to the supervisory core to produce an extended
 FLM role. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005.

Title: Normalized Intensity: The New Labour Process of Middle Management 
Abstract:
 Based on qualitative interviews (n&thinsp;&equals;&thinsp;64) within five
 UK organizations that have embarked on large-scale restructuring
 (including delayering, downsizing, culture change, role redesign, lean
 production) we argue that middle managers are currently experiencing
 significant and progressive work and personal pressures. Performance is
 monitored more closely, hours and intensity of work are increasing, roles
 and tasks are changing frequently, and prospects for promotion are
 downscaled within flattened hierarchies. Whereas middle managers report
 increased levels of autonomy and skill, are often well remunerated, and
 frequently appear motivated (at least in the private sector), we suggest
 their burgeoning grievances over working hours, role pressures and
 promotion prospects have worrying implications for the future performance
 of UK industry. We argue further that the motivation for corporations to
 embark on such large-scale restructuring is best understood with reference
 to the incessant demands of international capitalism. We conclude that
 such restructuring, and the personal managerial experiences that result
 from it, is in keeping with many, but crucially not all, of the trends
 predicted by Bravermanian labour process theory. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2008.

Title: Seeing the Need for ISO 14001 
Abstract:
 Many firms worldwide have adopted environmental management systems, and
 some have taken the extra step and had their systems certified for the
 international standard ISO 14001. While institutional pressures and market
 demand often motivate firms to adopt an EMS, the reasons why they certify
 for ISO 14001 are less clear. In this study, we interviewed members of the
 Canadian pulp and paper industry who had either an EMS or ISO 14001
 certification to understand why they may have become ISO 14001 certified.
 We found that task visibility and environmental impact opacity lead to
 differences in a firm's approach to ISO 14001 certification in the absence
 of coercive pressures. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2003.

Title: The Ethics of Shifting Ties: Management Theory and the Breakdown of Culture In Modernity 
Abstract:
 Despite a long tradition of documenting unethical practices in
 organizations, the sociology of organization literature has seldom
 addressed the question of management ethics. One early work in the field,
 Melville Dalton's "Men Who Manage" (1959), did develop a contingent
 approach to ethics that is seen as a precursor to contemporary discussions
 in modern and postmodern organization theory. In this essay, Dalton's work
 is interpreted in terms of a premodern or traditional view of moral
 theory. It is concluded that Dalton and those who have followed him have
 reduced morality to politics and have provided an intellectual rationale
 for the contemporary dark ages of moral behaviour with its worship of the
 cult of the individual. Copyright 1996 Basil Blackwell Ltd.

Title: The Inside Track: On the Important (But Neglected) Role of Customers in the Resource-Based View of Strategy and Firm Growth 
Abstract:
 This paper argues for the important role of customers as a source of
 competitive advantage and firm growth, an issue which has been largely
 neglected in the resource-based view of the firm. It conceptualizes
 Penrose's (1959) notion of an 'inside track' and illustrates how in-depth
 knowledge about established customers combines with joint problem-solving
 activities and the rapid assimilation of new and previously unexploited
 skills and resources. It is suggested that the inside track represents a
 distinct and perhaps underestimated way of generating rents and securing
 long-term growth. This also implies that the sources of sustainable
 competitive advantage in important respects can be sought in idiosyncratic
 interfirm relationships rather than within the firm itself. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005.

Title: Meanings on Multiple Levels: The Influence of Field-Level and Organizational-Level Meaning Systems on Diffusion 
Abstract:
 This study considers how organization-level and field-level meaning
 systems affect when firms adopt administrative innovations. We use a
 sample of over 1200 manufacturing sites to test hypotheses regarding the
 timing of adoption of Manufacturing Best Practice programmes. The results
 indicate that compatibility of the diffusing practice with the
 organization's internal meaning system is an important predictor of when
 firms adopt such programmes. However, the influence of such compatibility
 declines for later adopters - consistent with institutional pressures in
 the form of field-level meaning systems playing an increasing role over
 time. We also find that this decline occurs for sites with high exposure
 to institutional pressures, but not for sites with lower exposure. The
 findings suggest that internal meaning systems and differential exposure
 moderate the role of institutional pressures in the diffusion of
 administrative innovations. We discuss implications for theory and
 research on institutionalization and the diffusion of innovations. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2007.

Title: An Action Pattern Model of Inter-firm Cooperation 
Abstract:
 An action pattern model was developed and applied to the examination of
 inter-firm cooperative processes. The model considered cooperation as a
 continuous cycle of actions and reactions between cooperating partners.
 The building blocks of the model include cooperative equilibrium,
 disruptive events, action types and action patterns. Three action pattern
 variables were proposed to describe the interactions. It was hypothesized
 that action patterns are contingent on partner relationships and the
 transaction cost characteristics of a partnership. The hypotheses were
 tested on a sample of 263 partnerships in the construction industry in
 Hong Kong. The quantitative study was supplemented by four in-depth case
 studies. The results show that: (1) trust was an important antecedent of
 action patterns; and (2) transaction cost variables moderate the
 relationships between partner relationships and action patterns. These
 findings suggest that future research should give more attention to the
 interaction of partners during cooperation. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005.

Title: Buyer-Supplier and Supplier-Supplier Alliances: Do They Reinforce or Undermine One Another? 
Abstract:
 Previous research has portrayed buyer-supplier and supplier-supplier
 alliances as important mechanisms to foster learning and exchange
 efficiencies. Controversy remains, however, as to how these alliances
 interact. While some propose they reinforce one another (e.g. learning in
 horizontal ties generates positive spillovers to vertical ties), others
 propose a negative interplay (e.g. when increasing vertical-tie intensity,
 suppliers may weaken horizontal ties to avoid retaliation from buyers who
 wish to preserve bargaining power). We empirically test these competing
 views using survey data from the Brazilian auto-parts industry. In an
 attempt at reconciliation, we propose that the positive or negative
 interaction between vertical and horizontal alliances depends on the level
 of technological uncertainty of goods exchanged. Vertical ties seem to
 inhibit horizontal ties when technological uncertainty is low; when
 technological uncertainty is higher, vertical and horizontal ties do not
 seem to have any meaningful form of interaction. We discuss implications
 for theory and practice. Copyright (c) Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2007.

Title: Firing Blanks? An Analysis of Discursive Struggle in HRM 
Abstract:
 We revisit Karen Legge's (2001) critique of HRM in which she argues that
 the attempt of modernist/positivist HRM research to show that HRM improves
 organizational performance is a 'spent round'. We note that despite
 spirited challenges by Legge and others, the discourse of HRM is becoming
 increasingly dominant. Accordingly, we use discourse analysis to examine
 why this might be the case. Specifically, we analyse the texts produced in
 the engagement between Karen Legge and David Guest to show how
 modernist/positivist texts like those of Guest have been successful in
 constructing an identity for HRM and embedding it in the broader academic
 discourse concerning the employment relationship, while critical
 researchers like Legge face a number of difficulties in producing
 'counter-texts'. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2004.

Title: The Development of Corporate Charitable Contributions in the UK: A Stakeholder Analysis 
Abstract:
 This paper investigates the determinants of corporate charitable donations
 within a comparative study of corporate behaviour in two time periods,
 1989-90 and 1998-99. The analysis is based on a longitudinal data set that
 includes over 400 UK listed companies. The determinants of corporate
 charitable donations are explored within a stakeholder model and the
 relationship between corporate charitable donations and a set of firm and
 industry variables is estimated using OLS. Particular emphasis is placed
 on industry effects and the impact of social and environmental
 stakeholders. The results highlight a significant change in behaviour
 between 1989-90 and 1998-99 that may reflect a strategic response by
 corporate decision-makers to external concerns over corporate social
 responsibility. In the early period corporate charitable donations were
 substantially determined by profits. However, this relationship has
 weakened during the 1990s as firms have become increasingly responsive to
 stakeholder influences. The results for the later period emphasize the
 increasing importance of corporate visibility, and the development of
 social and environmental influences on corporate charitable contributions. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2004.

Title: Surviving on the Margins of the Economy: Working Relationships in Small, Low-Wage Firms 
Abstract:
 How do small low-wage firms continue to survive on the margins of a modern
 economy? Continuous restructuring provides a set of spaces but what sorts
 of firm occupy them and how far do these firms exercise active choice?
 Four research projects, embracing data on 123 firms, have offered
 empirical analysis. The present paper draws together these projects and
 derives an analytical framework linking the product and labour market
 contexts of small firms with their family context. Survival reflects the
 continued supply of labour through kinship networks and the ability of
 firms to respond actively to product market opportunities. The value of
 the framework for small-firm research generally is illustrated through
 discussion of further lines of inquiry. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2006.

Title: Middle Managers' Divergent Strategic Activity: An Investigation of Multiple Measures of Network Centrality 
Abstract:
 Using a sample of 89 mid-level managers in a US based urban hospital, this
 study investigates relationships among three measures of network
 centrality and managers' divergent strategic activity. While prior work
 has demonstrated a relationship between managers' boundary-spanning
 responsibilities and strategic activity, inadequate attention has been
 paid to managers' internal network position. Drawing from established
 theory, we consider expected network flows associated with three elements
 of the strategic renewal process. From this, we hypothesize and test
 relationships among managers' divergent activity and three measures of
 network centrality. Our findings suggest specific relationships between
 alternative forms of network centrality and particular elements of the
 strategic renewal process. Consistent with existing research, the findings
 also show boundary-spanning managers to be more strategically active than
 their non-boundary-spanning counterparts. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2007.

Title: A Methodology for Assessing Organizational Core Values 
Abstract:
 The goal of this study is to offer a methodology for empirically assessing
 the core values of an organization. It uses means-end analysis in order to
 determine those values that organization members manifest in their daily
 behaviour, and which are not just espoused 'truisms'. The method is based
 on the sense members of an organization make of what they do. Sensemaking
 follows a means-end pattern, through which individual actions converge
 into central values. The values most central in this means-end structure
 are the core values that effectively motivate organization members in
 their job. Our method works in two steps: first, exploratory interviews
 using the laddering-technique establish the values potentially most
 central to the organization; then, a follow-up survey assesses the
 complete pattern of means-end relations among the potential values.
 Validity tests show that the most central values derived from this survey
 data are the most important to organization members. These values are also
 the most stable over time. We make a comparison of this method with
 traditional value surveys and we discuss its implications for the study of
 organizational behaviour. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2006.

Title: Does the Natural-Resource-Based View of the Firm Apply in an Emerging Economy? A Survey of Foreign Invested Enterprises in China 
Abstract:
 This study explores whether enterprises operating in China benefit from
 the practice of the tenets of the natural-resource-based view of the firm
 (NRVF). To this end, a conceptual model is proposed that depicts the major
 determinants and consequences of the practice of NRVF. By and large, the
 survey data collected from foreign invested enterprises (FIEs) in China
 confirm the validity of the proposed model, and suggest that the NRVF is
 applicable in the world's largest and fastest-growing emerging economy.
 These results remind FIEs in China of the opportunities to enhance
 corporate environmental and financial performance through the adoption of
 environmental strategies. Various regression and multi-group analyses
 conducted in this study further reveal significant moderating influences
 of perceived environmental uncertainties, operating mode, and firm size on
 the process of achieving company-wide ecological sustainability. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005.

Title: The Relationship Between Task Interdependency and Role Stress: A Revisit of the Job Demands-Control Model 
Abstract:
 Drawing from Karasek's job demands-control model, this study investigated
 how perceived amount and clarity of interdependency in managers' jobs
 affect role stress, and the extent to which job control moderates these
 relationships. Results show that amount of interdependency was positively
 associated with role conflict, and clarity of interdependency was
 negatively associated with role ambiguity. There was also support for the
 job demands-control model as greater job control reduced role ambiguity
 when clarity of interdependency was low. Although higher job control
 produced lower role ambiguity when both clarity and amount of
 interdependency were low, higher job control did not produce lower role
 ambiguity when clarity of interdependency was low and amount of
 interdependency was high, suggesting that the buffering value of job
 control on reducing role stress is contingent on the task
 interdependencies that managers confront. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2007.

Title: Conceptualizing Knowledge Creation: A Critique of Nonaka's Theory 
Abstract:
 Nonaka's proposition that knowledge is created through the interaction of
 tacit and explicit knowledge involving four modes of knowledge conversion
 is flawed. Three of the modes appear plausible but none are supported by
 evidence that cannot be explained more simply. The conceptual framework
 omits inherently tacit knowledge, and uses a radically subjective
 definition of knowledge: knowledge is in effect created by managers. A new
 framework is proposed suggesting that different kinds of knowledge are
 created by different kinds of behaviour. Following Dewey, non-reflectional
 behaviour is distinguished from reflective behaviour, the former being
 associated with tacit knowledge, and the latter with explicit knowledge.
 Some of the implications for academic and managerial practice are
 considered. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2006.

Title: Offshore Outsourcing: Implications for International Business and Strategic Management Theory and Practice 
Abstract:
 In this essay, I discuss the implications of the debate over offshoring
 for our collective understanding of international business and management
 theories. I review several core theories in international business
 expansion and management strategy to assess which elements of these
 theories may need to be re-specified in light of the offshoring phenomenon
 and which aspects remain relevant. I then present normative implications
 and recommendations for public policy and corporate strategy, drawing from
 emerging insights regarding the global responsibilities of corporations. I
 suggest that international labour and environmental standards and
 corporate codes of conduct could mitigate some of the most intense
 concerns raised about offshoring but conclude that offshoring is likely to
 present challenges to societies, corporations, and stakeholders for many
 decades. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005.

Title: Survival and Failure of Small Businesses Arising Through Government Privatization: Insights from Two New Zealand Firms 
Abstract:
 Redundancies of personnel arising from the corporatization and even
 subsequent privatization/closure of several federal departments have
 contributed to the number of small businesses in New Zealand, a phenomenon
 that will likely be mirrored at least partially as other nations
 progressively liberalize their economies. Small businesses with such
 origins would appear to be especially prone to failure in a progressively
 liberalized trading environment; their precursors in the parent government
 departments or agencies would have been cocooned from immediate market
 conditions through budgetary allocations and a lack of competition.
 However, the scholarly literature on the behaviour of such small
 businesses is scant. Accordingly, we report the findings from a
 comparative investigation of two businesses that arose in the wake of the
 failure/closure of a corporatized federal service agency in New Zealand;
 one of the two businesses was much more successful than the other. Our
 major finding is that a small firm with such origins is likely to survive
 to the extent it avoids becoming complacent and being 'stuck in the mud'
 of the legacy of the failed federal parent. A predictor of such ability is
 the "timing" of small business formation: a small business that is formed
 by members who depart from the dying federal parent organization when the
 latter's closure is apparent, is more likely to survive than a business
 whose formation is precipitated by the demise of the federal parent and
 whose members remain in the parent organization until its formal closure. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2004.

Title: Commercializing Open Science: Deep Space Communications as the Lead Market for Shannon Theory, 1960-73 
Abstract:
 Recent research on the commercialization of scientific discoveries has
 emphasized the use of formal intellectual property rights (notably
 patents) as a mechanism for aligning the academic and entrepreneurial
 incentives for commercialization. Without such explicit intellectual
 property rights and licensing, how is such open science commercialized?
 This paper examines the commercialization of Claude Shannon's theory of
 communications, developed at and freely disseminated by Bell Telephone
 Laboratories. It analyses the first 25 years of Shannon theory, the role
 of MIT in developing and extending that theory, and the importance of deep
 space communications as the initial market for commercialization. It
 contrasts the early paths of two MIT-related spinoffs that pursued this
 opportunity, including key technical and business trajectories driven by
 information theory. Based on this evidence, the paper provides
 observations about commercializing open science, particularly for
 engineering-related fields. Copyright (c) Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2008.

Title: HRM and Critical Social Science Analysis 
Abstract:
 In her early work on personnel management, Karen Legge showed the way
 forward for a non-prescriptive and critical analysis of employment
 management practices. Legge has developed this concern in subsequent work
 and given it a wider focus by setting her analysis of HRM in its broad
 socio-political context. A great deal of the academic HRM literature has
 tended not to follow this lead, however, and often remains prescriptive,
 functionalist and uncritical. Even when HRM analysis does set out to be
 critical, it can be seen as out of touch with important developments in
 social science thinking. A scheme for undertaking critical social
 scientific analysis is developed to overcome some of these difficulties
 and this is applied to a narrative of HRM strategy-making in "Moddens
 Foods". Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2004.

Title: Entrepreneurship and Firm Boundaries: The Theory of "A "Firm 
Abstract:
 In this paper, we consider how a better understanding of entrepreneurial
 activities can help explain how firm and industry boundaries change over
 time and how a more comprehensive understanding of boundary setting can
 explain where entrepreneurial activities are directed. We start from the
 premise that while entrepreneurs believe themselves to have superior ideas
 in one or multiple parts of the value chain, they are characteristically
 short of cash, and of the ability to convince others to provide it. This
 premise motivates a simple model in which the entrepreneur has a
 value-adding set of ideas for 'upstream' and 'downstream' parts of a value
 chain, as well as for the ways to make these two parts of the value chain
 work better when joined under unitary control. Assuming that the
 entrepreneur's objective is to maximize her wealth, we observe that even
 in the presence of transactional risks or other factors that might make
 integration preferable to specialization, initial scope depends also on
 relatively unexplored factors such as (a) how severe the entrepreneur's
 cash constraint is, and (b) how much value the entrepreneur's ideas add at
 each part of the value chain. Entrepreneurs will focus on the areas that
 provide the maximum profit yield per available cash - a criterion which
 implies that scope choices depend on cash availability and the depth of
 the demand for the new idea along the value chain. We also note that
 entrepreneurs make money not only from the operating profits of their
 firms, but also from the appreciation of the assets the firm has
 accumulated. This consideration can change the optimal choice of the
 firms' boundaries, as entrepreneurs must be sensitive to choosing the
 segment that will enable them to benefit not only in terms of profit, but
 also in terms of asset appreciation. We propose that, in the
 entrepreneurial context especially, it is helpful to focus on the multiple
 considerations affecting the choice of boundaries for 'a' firm - the
 context faced by an individual entrepreneur - rather than on generic
 considerations affecting 'the' (representative) firm. Scope choices
 reflect the entrepreneur's own theory of 'how to make money'. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2007.

Title: Offshoring: Value Creation through Economic Change 
Abstract:
 In this essay, I analyse the economic and managerial dimensions of
 offshoring, drawing from recent research by the McKinsey Global Institute.
 I argue that offshoring, like other forms of trade, creates enormous value
 for both companies and the economy as a whole. However, in the case of
 countries with less flexible labour markets such as Germany, findings are
 more nuanced. While the potential cost savings for companies from
 offshoring appear impressive, our research suggests that companies are
 leaving billions of dollars behind when they offshore. We propose several
 ways companies could make capital-labour trade-offs to create new markets
 and services. By maximizing gains from offshoring, companies can both cut
 costs and generate revenue. Given the benefits offshoring, the challenge
 is how to make the transition to a global economy less painful for workers
 and increase the participation in the wealth creation. Hence, I also
 identify options to help policymakers and companies manage the changes
 offshoring requires. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005.

Title: Value Chain Envy: Explaining New Entry and Vertical Integration in Popular Music 
Abstract:
 The concepts of value creation, value capture, and value protection are
 employed to explain new entry and vertical integration. It is posited that
 if, at one stage of the value system, the share of value captured is
 disproportionally higher than the share of value created, value chain envy
 will ensue. This value chain envy will result in new entry and vertical
 integration towards that desirable stage provided that the means of value
 protection available to the incumbents can be overcome. Within the popular
 music industries, the value created at the stage of music publishing has
 diminished steadily over the course of the 20th century, but the value
 captured has remained high. This has triggered value chain envy both
 inside and outside of the value system. The data presented in this paper
 show high levels of vertical integration into that stage originating
 primarily from the stages upstream in the value system, while the level of
 new entry has been comparatively low. At the same time, the data indicate
 that the recent introduction of new information communication technologies
 (ICT) have not significantly affected the levels of new entry and vertical
 integration into music publishing. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005.

Title: Political Hybrids: Tocquevillean Views on Project Organizations 
Abstract:
 For the past decade, project organization has become increasingly central
 to management and organization studies, particularly as these seek to
 discern the contours of post-modern organizations. Yet, these contours
 frequently seem to be sighted without bearings on the current realities of
 project management. In this paper we take such bearings, using data
 derived from detailed qualitative, ethnographic enquiry into the
 experience of project management. From this data we construct the contours
 of project management more sharply. Rather than being a harbinger of an
 autonomous and more democratic future, free from extant bureaucratic
 organization controls, we find that project management has distinct
 modalities of control that we outline in the paper: reputational,
 calculative, and professional. Indeed, rather than foreshadowing a future
 transformational form, we find traces of a much older design: that of de
 Tocqueville. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2004.

Title: Ring a Ring o' Roses: Quality Journals and Gamesmanship in Management Studies 
Abstract:
 A paper in one of the quality journals of Management Studies is much more
 important as a unit of measurement than as a contribution to knowledge. It
 measures academic performance and determines much academic funding. There
 is consequently some pressure to publish in quality journals. But quality
 journals are defined in terms that are themselves defined in terms of
 quality journals - a circularity that explains both the paper's title and
 the frustration of those who do not mix in these circles. We examine the
 gamesmanship of publishing in quality journals. Findings from a survey of
 heads of Management Studies departments in UK universities suggest that
 such gamesmanship is common. Cunning and calculation now support
 scholarship in Management Studies. Gamesmanship will remain common until
 the rewards for publishing attach to the content of papers, to "what" is
 published rather than "where" it is published. We propose a 'Tinkerbell
 Solution': without belief in the value of a paper in a quality journal,
 the game is no longer worth playing. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2007.

Title: Components of CEO Transformational Leadership and Corporate Social Responsibility 
Abstract:
  We use transformational leadership theory to explore the role of CEOs in
 determining the extent to which their firms engage in corporate social
 responsibility (CSR). We test this theory using data from 56 US and
 Canadian firms. CEO intellectual stimulation (but not CEO charismatic
 leadership) is found to be significantly associated with the propensity of
 the firm to engage in 'strategic' CSR, or those CSR activities that are
 most likely to be related to the firm's corporate and business-level
 strategies. Thus, studies that ignore the role of leadership in CSR may
 yield imprecise conclusions regarding the antecedents and consequences of
 these activities. We also critique transformational leadership theory, in
 terms of its overemphasis on charismatic forms of leadership. This leads
 to a reconceptualization of transformational leadership, which emphasizes
 the intellectual stimulation component in the context of CSR. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2006.

Title: Effects of Firm R&D Investment and Environment on Acquisition Likelihood 
Abstract:
 R&D investments contribute to the development of firm technology
 resources, and the possession of such resources often increases a firm's
 attractiveness as a potential acquisition target. However, the value
 ascribed to a firm's technology resources by would-be acquirers may be
 moderated by its industry's environmental characteristics. Using data from
 2886 firms, we find that investments in R&D predict acquisition likelihood
 and that R&D investments are most strongly associated with acquisition of
 firms under conditions of high environmental munificence and dynamism.
 Theoretical and managerial implications are discussed. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2006.

Title: Continuity and Change in Mergers and Acquisitions: A Social Identity Case Study of a German Industrial Merger 
Abstract:
 It is crucial from an employee's point of view to perceive some degree of
 stability even in times of major organizational change. This paper
 examines the role of a sense of continuity for organizational
 identification after an organizational merger. We argue that mergers and
 acquisitions so often end in failures partly because the change is
 designed in discontinuous ways and employees do not feel they are doing
 the same job after the merger as before. Such discontinuous change
 engenders a critical tension between positive and negative effects of
 identification that has not yet been fully understood. To deepen the
 understanding of this tension, in-depth interviews were conducted in a
 recently merged German industrial company. Based on these qualitative data
 we demonstrate how features of the post-merger company structure and the
 way it was implemented may have eroded organizational identification.
 Finally, we propose a parsimonious model to be tested by future research,
 in which the sense of continuity is consisting of both "observable" as
 well as "projected" continuity. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005.

Title: Defining and Measuring Servant Leadership Behaviour in Organizations 
Abstract:
 This paper examines the development and initial validation of a
 multidimensional measure of servant leadership behaviour (Servant
 Leadership Behaviour Scale). Both qualitative and quantitative studies are
 reported to establish preliminary psychometric properties for the new
 35-item, six-dimension measure. The resultant servant leadership model is
 characterized by its service orientation, holistic outlook, and
 moral-spiritual emphasis, thereby extending current models of servant
 leadership and existing works on contemporary leadership approaches.
 Theoretical contributions, practical implications, and future research
 directions are discussed in the concluding section of the paper. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2008.

Title: Failure to Mobilize in Reliability-Seeking Organizations: Two Cases from the UK Railway 
Abstract:
 There is a considerable line of research on organizations dealing with
 large scale, intrinsic hazards. We know a good deal, as a result, about
 both the causation of catastrophic failure and its avoidance. Past work
 has explained failure in terms of (for example) structural vulnerabilities
 and organizational degradation - and reliability in terms of collective
 mindfulness, rigorous enculturation and high levels of social redundancy.
 This paper presents a study, based on a qualitative analysis of two
 disastrous collisions on the UK railway, of organizations that are
 strongly reliability seeking yet ultimately experience catastrophic
 failure. It argues that these cases implicated an organizational
 incapacity to mobilize systemic reform. The possibility of the two
 failures had been well-known in the organizations before their occurrence,
 but this knowledge could not be converted into modification. A model is
 presented to explain how processes of systemic reform co-exist with a set
 of phenomena that tend to undermine them. It is these that need to be the
 principal focus of efforts at managing catastrophic failure risks. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2006.

Title: THE DETERMINANTS OF RESEARCH GROUP PERFORMANCE: TOWARDS MODE 2? 
Abstract:
 This paper explores the determinants of performance of research groups in
 the context of the emergence of knowledge as a key intangible asset. It
 focuses specifically on how best to configure knowledge producers for
 optimal effectiveness in the current research environment. It explores the
 under-researched area of the organization and management of research
 groups located in and at the interface of university research and focuses
 on medical and medical-related research groups. The discussion is embedded
 within the current debate concerning modes of organization in knowledge
 production. Factors identified with high-achievement are: strong
 leadership; finding, motivating and retaining talent; strategies of
 related diversification; strongly linked theory and practice and, in
 particular, network connectedness. Such groups exhibit an increasingly
 complex internal environment, facilitating a flexible response to an
 increasingly complex external environment. It finds evidence of Mode 2
 working, with increasing use of collaborative strategies and some evidence
 of a thematic emphasis emerging, although to a lesser extent than the
 literature suggests, since participants are still working from a strongly
 disciplinary base. Driven by the more competitive environment, both
 intellectual and commercial forms of entrepreneurship are present. At the
 hub of this complex web of inter-related factors is network connectedness,
 which proves to be centrally facilitative in mobilizing the other
 necessary resources. Copyright 2002 Blackwell Publishers Ltd..

Title: The Visible Hands of Hierarchy within the M-Form: An Empirical Test of Corporate Parenting of Internal Product Exchanges 
Abstract:
 In this paper, we dismiss the traditional contingency argument that
 corporate staff should have minimal involvement with the decisions that
 its divisions make, because predictability, which underlies this
 contingency logic, is erroneous for most large corporations at this time.
 We offer an alternative theory of corporate involvement for the M-form:
 under unpredictable environments greater interdependence of corporate
 staff with divisional operating decisions may be necessary to create value
 for the corporation. Since corporate staff cannot be involved in all
 divisional affairs, we empirically explore when corporate involvement is
 most likely. Building on transaction cost economics and the strategy
 literature, we reason that corporate staff may selectively involve itself
 in business level strategy and operating decisions when product
 characteristics signal threats to effective inter-divisional coordination
 as well as opportunities for value creation. To explore this topic, we
 surveyed corporate managers of Fortune 500 companies. The results suggest
 some initial support for our theoretical argument: corporate staff is more
 likely to involve itself in business-level decisions for uncertain
 products. We further find that when corporate staff is responsible for the
 capital investments used for the divisional venture, it is more likely to
 guide and influence product strategy decisions and inter-divisional
 conflicts. We do not find, however, consistent evidence that specialized
 assets or brand-name reputation trigger corporate involvement.
 Implications and limitations are further discussed. Copyright 2003 Blackwell Publishing Ltd..

Title: Edith Penrose's Contributions to the Resource-based View: An Alternative Perspective 
Abstract:
 Edith Penrose's work has been widely acknowledged to have played a central
 role in providing the intellectual foundations of the resource-based view.
 This position, however, was recently challenged in a paper by Rugman and
 Verbeke (2002). In this paper we address the three main arguments of
 Rugman and Verbeke and, by drawing on her writings, demonstrate that their
 arguments are materially incorrect. While readily conceding that Penrose's
 primary goal was to explain the growth of firms, we show that her analysis
 of path-dependent firm evolution anticipated many key propositions of the
 resource-based view. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2004.

Title: Alliance Capability as a Mediator Between Experience and Alliance Performance: An Empirical Investigation into the Alliance Capability Development Process 
Abstract:
 This study centres around the way in which firms can enhance alliance
 performance through the development of alliance capabilities. Whereas most
 research has focused on inter-firm antecedents of alliance performance,
 research on intra-firm antecedents pointing to prior experience and
 internal mechanisms to foster knowledge transfer has only recently
 emerged. As little is known about how firms develop alliance capabilities,
 this study aims to uncover how differences in sources of alliance
 capabilities explain performance heterogeneity. The data are derived from
 a detailed survey held among alliance managers and Vice-Presidents of 151
 firms. The survey covers over 2600 alliances for the period 1997-2001.
 This study not only finds that alliance capabilities partially mediate
 between alliance experience and alliance performance, but also yields
 novel insights into the micro-level building blocks underlying the process
 of alliance capability development. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2006.

Title: The Relevance of the Institutional Underpinnings of Porter's Five Forces Framework to Emerging Economies: An Epistemological Analysis 
Abstract:
 Using the Toulmin method, we present an epistemological analysis of
 Porter's Five Forces Framework (FFF) in light of the increasing evidence
 pertaining to the institutional context in emerging economies. The
 analysis reveals three key qualifiers in the theoretical structure of FFF
 - transaction costs, capital flows and laws governing rivalry. Evidence
 from emerging economies indicates that FFF's assumptions about the
 qualifiers are not met in these economies. Indeed, firms in these
 economies adopt strategies not derivable from FFF to tackle their unique
 institutional contexts. Our Toulmin analysis helps pinpoint the directions
 for further research in emerging economies. Specifically, the three
 qualifiers provide a meaningful way of building typologies and taxonomies
 to accommodate the diversity of institutional contexts and to link them to
 firm-level strategies. Our discussion also highlights the need to turn the
 spotlight on laws governing rivalry, a relatively under-explored topic in
 emerging economies, and the effectiveness of different network strategies. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005.

Title: Corporate Governance, Strategy and Survival in a Declining Industry: A Study of UK Cotton Textile Companies 
Abstract:
 Building on the strategic flexibility perspective, this paper examines the
 influences of organizational diversity, ownership structure and board
 characteristics on strategic responses to industrial decline in firms from
 the UK textile industry. Using samples of exiting and surviving companies
 it shows that, in line with the predictions of the strategic flexibility
 framework, the surviving companies tended to have a higher level of
 organizational diversity. They also tended to have larger institutional
 ownership and more diverse boards. These factors are associated with
 higher investment, financial performance, and growth. The results are
 consistent with the resource and service roles of the corporate governance
 factors. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2003.

Title: Generic Product Strategies for Emerging Market Exports into Triad Nation Markets: A Mimetic Isomorphism Approach 
Abstract:
 Based on the concept of mimetic isomorphism, we theorize that, by
 imitating the home country MNE modal generic product strategy in each
 Triad nation, emerging market firms (EMFs) can improve their export
 performance satisfaction. We hypothesize that EMFs which: (1) target the
 EU and use a Premium strategy, (2) target Japan and use a Superior Value
 strategy, or (3) target the USA and use an Economy strategy will, on
 average, achieve higher levels of satisfaction with export performance
 than EMFs that enter emerging markets or EMFs that employ other product
 strategies in Triad nation markets. Our hypothesis is tested and supported
 on a sample of Romanian and Chinese exporters. Managerial implications of
 our theory and findings are discussed. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005.

Title: Trustworthiness, Risk, and the Transfer of Tacit and Explicit Knowledge Between Alliance Partners 
Abstract:
 The transfer of knowledge in alliances entails risk to partners, whose
 willingness to accept it presumably relies on the trustworthiness that
 they perceive in their partners. We investigate the extent to which the
 perceptions of trustworthiness and the willingness to take risk determine
 the transfer of knowledge between alliance partners and their ultimate
 impact on alliance success. The results show that the transfer of tacit
 versus explicit knowledge have very different trust and risk profiles.
 Whereas explicit knowledge is closely associated with the firm's
 willingness to take risk, tacit knowledge is intimately related to high
 trustworthiness. The results support the important role of trust and the
 transfer of tacit knowledge on the success of learning alliances. Copyright (c) Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2008.

Title: Role of Knowledge in Value Creation in 
Abstract:
 This paper focuses on the role of knowledge in intentionally created
 business networks called nets. Nets are seen to offer firms collective
 benefits beyond those of a single firm or market transaction. We propose
 that the types of knowledge and learning required in the management of
 different types of business net are dependent on the value creation
 characteristics of the net types. Based on this we suggest a
 classification of three generic net types -'current business nets',
 'business renewal nets', and 'emerging new business nets'- and argue that
 they pose different conditions for management in nets. Using this
 framework and integrating notions from the industrial network approach,
 strategic management and dynamic capabilities view, and organizational
 learning we make a number of observations and propositions about the role
 of knowledge and learning in the three types of business net. The paper
 contributes to the emerging theory of network management. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2006.

 competencies in both these areas. In studies of the US retail food
 industry, we find that while a general dynamic capability affects firms'
 competence in supply chain management (a business competency), it does not
 affect their competence in environmental management (a social competency).
 Firm mission and the extent to which firms obtain technical assistance are
 found to affect the acquisition of this latter competency. These findings
 offer insights into the resource-based view (RBV) of the firm and provide
 lessons for corporate social responsibility. They reveal more precisely
 what a general dynamic capability yields and how far its reach extends,
 suggesting that the factors that drive competitive advantage are not the
 same as those that drive social responsibility. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2006.

Title: Metaphor and the Dynamics of Knowledge in Organization Theory: A Case Study of the Organizational Identity Metaphor 
Abstract:
 Despite the increased salience of metaphor in organization theory, there
 is still very little conceptual machinery for capturing and explaining how
 metaphor creates and/or reorders knowledge within organization theory.
 Moreover, prior work on metaphor has insufficiently accounted for the
 context of interpreting a metaphor. Many metaphors in organization theory,
 including the 'organizational identity' metaphor, have often been treated
 in singular and monolithic terms; seen to offer a similar or largely
 synonymous interpretation to theorists and researchers working along the
 entire spectrum of disciplines (e.g. organizational behaviour,
 organizational psychology) in organization theory. We argue in this paper
 that contextual variation however exists in the interpretation of
 metaphors in organization theory. This argument is developed by proposing
 and elaborating on a so-called image-schematic model of metaphor, which
 suggests that the image-schemata (abstract imaginative structures) that
 are triggered by the metaphorical comparison of concepts may vary among
 individuals. Accordingly, once different schemata are triggered the
 completion and interpretation of a metaphor may equally vary among
 different individuals or, indeed, research communities. These points
 associated with the image-schematic model of metaphor are illustrated with
 a case study of the 'organizational identity' metaphor. The case study
 shows that this particular metaphor has spiralled out into different
 research communities and has been comprehended in very different ways as
 different communities work from very different conceptions, or
 image-schemata, of 'organization' and 'identity', and use different
 theoretical frameworks and constructs as a result. The implications of the
 image-schematic view of metaphor for knowledge development and theoretical
 progress in organization theory are discussed. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2006.

Title: Co-evolutionary Dynamics Within and Between Firms: From Evolution to Co-evolution 
Abstract:
 The extensive selection-adaptation literature spans diverse theoretical
 perspectives, but is inconclusive on the role of managerial intentionality
 in organizational adaptation. Indeed this voluminous literature has more
 to say about selection and sources and causes of structural inertia than
 about self-renewing organizations that might counteract such inertia. In
 this introductory essay, we identify four co-evolutionary generative
 mechanisms (engines) - naïve selection, managed selection, hierarchical
 renewal and holistic renewal - which illustrate the extensive range of
 evolutionary paths that can take place in a population of organizations.
 In particular, the managed selection engine provides the foundations of
 the underlying principles of co-evolving self-renewing organizations:
 managing internal rates of change, optimizing self-organization, and
 balancing concurrent exploration and exploitation. However, it is
 altogether clear that empirical co-evolution research represents the next
 frontier for empirically resolving the adaptation selection debate. The
 essay concludes with a discussion of requirements for co-evolutionary
 empirical research and introduces the empirical papers in this Special
 Research Symposium. Copyright 2003 Blackwell Publishing Ltd..

Title: Strategy Research in Emerging Economies: Challenging the Conventional Wisdom 
Abstract:
 This review and introduction to the Special Issue on 'Strategy Research in
 Emerging Economies' considers the nature of theoretical contributions thus
 far on strategy in emerging economies. We classify the research through
 four strategic options: (1) firms from developed economies entering
 emerging economies; (2) domestic firms competing within emerging
 economies; (3) firms from emerging economies entering other emerging
 economies; and (4) firms from emerging economies entering developed
 economies. Among the four perspectives examined (institutional theory,
 transaction cost theory, resource-based theory, and agency theory), the
 most dominant seems to be institutional theory. Most existing studies that
 make a contribution blend institutional theory with one of the other three
 perspectives, including seven out of the eight papers included in this
 Special Issue. We suggest a future research agenda based around the four
 strategies and four theoretical perspectives. Given the relative emphasis
 of research so far on the first and second strategic options, we believe
 that there is growing scope for research that addresses the third and
 fourth. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005.

Title: AFTER THE INK DRIES: THE INTERACTION OF TRUST AND CONTROL IN US-BASED INTERNATIONAL JOINT VENTURES 
Abstract:
 This study empirically examines the moderating effects of age and partner
 trust on the relationship between control mechanisms and perceptions of
 performance in 129 US-based international joint ventures (IJVs). A
 reliance on formal control mechanisms and general managers' perceptions of
 IJV performance were found to be positively related in younger IJVs, but
 this relationship became negative in more mature IJVs. In addition, social
 control mechanisms and perceptions of IJV performance were positively
 related, but only in the presence of affect-based trust between the
 parents. Copyright 2002 Blackwell Publishers Ltd..

Title: When Production and Consumption Meet: Cultural Contradictions and the Enchanting Myth of Customer Sovereignty 
Abstract:
 The central cultural contradiction of capitalism, argued Bell some 25
 years ago, was the existence of rationalized, disciplined production
 alongside free and hedonistic consumption. This paper argues that this
 thesis, although overstated, has resonance within contemporary capitalism.
 The paper then considers the question of how this contradiction is managed
 when production and consumption meet directly within the service
 interaction. On the production-side rationalization is joined by
 customer-orientation, and on the consumption-side management promotes
 consumption of the enchanting myth of sovereignty. Here the customer is
 meant to experience a sense of being sovereign. At the same time the space
 is created for the customer to be, potentially, substantively directed and
 influenced to follow the requirements that flow from the rationalized
 elements of production. Key aspects of the service interaction, including
 the menu and its presentation, the display of empathy and aesthetic
 labour, and the use of naming within the service interaction, are analysed
 in terms of the promotion of the enchanting myth of sovereignty.
 Consumption, however, is a fragile process, and remains, to an important
 degree, 'unmanageable'. The analysis, therefore, also examines how the
 promotion of the enchanting myth of sovereignty systematically creates the
 conditions for the myth's negation. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2004.

Title: A Simple Matter of Control? NHS Hospital Nurses and New Management 
Abstract:
 Over the past two decades the National Health Hospital Service has been
 subjected to considerable changes in is organization. 'New' public sector
 management (NPM) has been given the task of changing hospital culture and
 making service provision more efficient. Nurses, as the largest
 occupational group within the National Health Service (NHS), have
 attracted considerable management attention and there are two distinct
 accounts concerning how NPM has supposedly gained control of the nursing
 labour process. Firstly, it is proposed that the physical division of
 labour of health care professionals is now firmly in the hands of hospital
 management through the use of Tayloristic techniques. Secondly,
 alternative accounts suggest that public sector organization cultures have
 been successfully orientated toward a customer service ethos, and that the
 convincing discourse of 'quality' is achieving some success as a normative
 control device. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2004.

Title: Conflict Management for Effective Top Management Teams and Innovation in China 
Abstract:
 Top management teams may be critical for developing organizations that can
 keep abreast of marketplace changes and innovate. Several streams of
 strategy research have argued that conflict and diversity promote top
 management team effectiveness. This study proposes that how top management
 teams manage conflict can greatly contribute to their effective leadership
 of organizational innovation. A total of 378 executives from 105
 organizations in China completed measures of conflict management
 (cooperative, competitive, and avoiding) and productive conflict (an
 outcome of conflict). Separately, 105 CEOs from these firms indicated
 their team's effectiveness and their organization's innovativeness.
 Results support the theory that conflict management can contribute to
 making top management teams effective. Structural equation analysis
 suggests that cooperative conflict management promotes productive conflict
 and top management team effectiveness that in turn result in
 organizational innovation. These results, coupled with previous research,
 were interpreted as suggesting that cooperative conflict management is an
 important contributor to effective top management teams even in the
 collectivist culture of China. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005.

Title: Sensemaking on the Shop Floor: Narratives of Knowledge in Organizations 
Abstract:
 This paper explores the role of narratives in organizational inquiry and
 knowledge work. Following the tenets of the phenomenological method, the
 paper digs into the 'life world' of organizations in order to capture the
 taken for granted stream of everyday routines, interaction, and events
 that constitute both individual and social practices. An empirical case
 study examines the narrative-based processes of sensemaking and knowledge
 acquisition in the setting of a traditional pressing plant at Fiat Auto,
 Italy. The focus of analysis is on how a best performing team engages in
 the resolution of disruptive occurrences on the shop floor. Through the
 deconstruction of narratives underlying problem-solving activities, the
 case identifies a distinctive mode of investigation conceptualized as
 'detective stories'. The detective's method highlights the interplay
 between time and narrative in shaping the interconnected processes of
 organizational knowledge creation, utilization, and institutionalization.
 More generally, the findings of the paper stress the importance of
 conjectural knowledge and common-sensical wisdom in the everyday life of
 organizations. Copyright 2003 Blackwell Science Asia Pty. Ltd..

Title: Toward a Model of Organizational Co-Evolution in Transition Economies 
Abstract:
 The paper presents a model of organization-environment co-evolution, which
 portrays the joint impact of organizational and environmental
 characteristics on organizational survival. The four organizational
 characteristics included in the model are: (a) control structure, (b)
 product strategy, (c) exchange strategy, and (d) distance to the market.
 The three environmental characteristics are: (a) control structures, (b)
 competitive structures, and (c) exchange structures. In line with the
 general co-evolutionary approach, the model highlights the
 interrelationship between micro and meso level phenomena, specifically,
 between firm-level adaptation and industry-level selection of
 organizational forms. The paper focuses on transition economies and uses
 the empirical evidence from these economies to illustrate the model's
 potential. The model, however, is sufficiently general to be applied in
 other organizational environments. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2006.

Title: Complexity, Identity and the Value of Knowledge-intensive Exchanges 
Abstract:
 Researchers studying the structural embeddedness of firms in networks have
 focused on its effects on economic behaviour, strategic action and
 competitive behaviour, but network embeddedness as a source of firm value
 per se has been largely overlooked. I argue that neglecting the network
 context in which firms are embedded leads to an incomplete understanding
 of the value of the firm. I seek to understand how a focal firm's
 structural embeddedness network characteristics function as mechanisms
 that elucidate the value of its knowledge-intensive exchanges. This paper
 presents a framework that identifies two processes of knowing exchange
 value, namely knowing through a learning bandwagon and knowing through a
 fad bandwagon. I argue that knowing value as a learning bandwagon is
 enabled by the normative and cognitive proximity of exchange partners, and
 that this is facilitated by the embeddedness of the focal firm in dense
 network structures. Knowing value as a fad bandwagon is based on a
 positional construction of the focal firm's status, which is determined by
 the centrality of the focal firm's network partners in their corresponding
 networks. This is a ranking system based on positional network data, whose
 efficacy stems from the inability of firms to manipulate their network
 positions. Copyright 2003 Blackwell Publishing Ltd..

Title: Transformation Networks in Innovation Alliances - The Development of Volvo C70 
Abstract:
 This paper addresses an important gap in the literature intersection
 between network theory and networked innovation by developing a
 theoretical framework on how to leverage learning alliances across extra-
 and intra-corporate levels to support both exploration and exploitation of
 innovation to secure its creation "and" its implementation. A detailed
 case of the Volvo C70 development is analysed with focus on how the full
 innovation from exploration to exploitation of innovation seem to rely on
 fundamentally different types and structures of networks. Our detailed
 description and analysis of how a 'transformation network' was established
 and operated across different organizational levels to secure not only
 transfer, but also transformation and integration of knowledge into
 commercialized innovation makes an important contribution to extant theory
 on inter-organizational knowledge transfer and networking. Copyright (c) Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2008.

Title: The Definition of Strategic Liabilities, and their Impact on Firm Performance 
Abstract:
 Strategic Liabilities are processes and tangible and intangible holdings
 that are firm-specific, context-specific and create competitive
 disadvantage. They are scarce, inconvertible, costly, and appropriated.
 The concept of Strategic Liabilities contrasts and complements the
 resource-based view's Strategic Assets. A firm is likely to possess
 Strategic Liabilities at some time because these liabilities can originate
 from endowments, from bad luck, from Strategic Assets, from rival actions,
 and from unfavourable changes in context. They represent the other side of
 the firm's ledger often implicitly ignored in the strategy literature.
 Thus, the formal definition and analysis of Strategic Liabilities is
 warranted. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2004.

Title: Spirals of Silence: The Dynamic Effects of Diversity on Organizational Voice 
Abstract:
 When will individuals speak up about organizational issues, and when will
 they remain silent? We suggest that organizational voice will be
 significantly influenced by individuals' perceptions of the attitudes
 towards an issue within their workgroup. In particular, individuals will
 be more likely to speak up when they believe that their position is
 supported by others, and remain silent when they believe that it is not.
 We explain this using the 'spiral of silence' proposed by Noelle-Neumann
 (1974, 1985, 1991) and widely used in public opinion research, which
 explains how majority opinions become dominant over time and minority
 opinions weakened. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2003.

Title: Employee Shareholders Or Institutional Investors? When Corporate Managers Replace Their Stockholders 
Abstract:
 During the past decade, the shares of publicly traded companies moved
 increasingly into the hands of institutional investors. As large investors
 pressed companies to restructure, companies were observed in turn to
 restructure their shareholder base. Drawing on a 1989 survey of 761 US
 publicly traded companies, firms facing a hostile takeover environment or
 with large institutional holdings are found to seek greater employee
 stockholding. Large firms and those that had adopted takeover defences are
 more likely when threatened with takeovers or short-term pressures to seek
 more employee and less institutional stockholding. Though managers are
 employed by owners, investor efforts to discipline their managers can lead
 the latter to replace the former. Copyright 1996 Basil Blackwell Ltd.

Title: Do You See What I Mean? An Entrepreneurship Perspective on the Nature and Boundaries of the Firm 
Abstract:
 In answering the questions 'why does the firm exist?' and 'what determines
 its boundaries?', established theories of the firm have focused on
 boundary choice in a context of relatively easily identified and evaluated
 alternatives. This paper starts by asking the kindred question 'why does
 the firm come into existence?', shifting attention to the circumstances
 and choices surrounding new firm formation and the exploitation of new and
 untried business ideas. It proceeds to delineate an entrepreneurship
 perspective on the nature and boundaries of the firm, where boundary
 decisions are driven by the difficulty of implementing new, subjective
 means-ends frameworks in sometimes very unreceptive markets. A set of
 propositions developing the concepts of cognitive incongruence and
 cognitive incompleteness suggests that activities are internalized when
 other market participants are unable to accept or understand the
 entrepreneur's subjectively perceived means-ends framework. In conclusion,
 the paper supports the development of theory that explains choice of modes
 of action based on subjective world views and the emerging notion of a
 distinctive entrepreneurship-based theory of the firm. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2007.

Title: Strategies as Discursive Constructions: The Case of Airline Alliances 
Abstract:
 In this paper, we argue that by examining the discursive elements in
 strategy talk we can contribute to our understanding of the myriad of
 micro-processes and practices that make up strategies. We focus on airline
 alliances as a particularly illustrative case. Based on a critical
 discourse analysis of an extensive material of strategy talk on airline
 alliances, we point to five types of discursive practices that
 characterize strategizing in this context in 1995-2000: (1)
 problematization of traditional strategies; (2) rationalization,
 objectification and factualization of alliance benefits; (3) fixation of
 ambiguous independence concerns; (4) reframing of cooperation problems as
 'implementation' issues; and (5) naturalization of alliance strategies.
 While we want to emphasize the context-specificity of these practices, we
 claim that similar types of discursive practices are also likely to be an
 inherent part of strategizing in other settings. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2004.

Title: Placing Knowledge Management in Context 
Abstract:
 We welcome the increased emphasis on practice-based theories of knowing as
 an alternative to the more representational, knowledge-as-object
 approaches which have characterised many organizational attempts at
 'knowledge management' to date. Building on the findings of a short
 empirical study into the 'knowledge management' initiatives of a global
 software organization, which highlighted the value of rich context in the
 generation of meaning, we seek to shed some light on a perceived confusion
 about the nature of organizational context. We show such context to be an
 inseparable part of knowing, which it creates and by which it is defined,
 and re-use Blackler's (1995) taxonomy of 'knowledge types' to illustrate
 the relational interaction between shared and deeply personal components
 of context. Finally, we use these insights to suggest a way in which
 organizations may be able to derive more value from their investments in
 internal initiatives by increasing their ability to support knowing - and
 hence the generation of meaning - amongst their employees. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2004.

Title: HRM and Performance: A Plea for Reflexivity in HRM Studies 
Abstract:
 In this Counterpoint, we build on Paauwe's suggestions to take the field
 of HRM and Performance further. Rather than aiming for a synthesis or
 proposing a radical alternative, we argue that
 R(econstructive)-reflexivity is needed for theorizing HRM. In particular,
 we bring in insights from critical studies on the notion of HRM, on the
 notion of performance, and on the theoretical relationship between them as
 a way to open up new research avenues and lines of interpretation. For
 each of these three aspects, we indicate how studying the employment
 relationship can be reframed. In particular, we emphasize
 practice-oriented research as one possible research path for the field of
 HRM as it allows for an examination of HRM as a set of practices, embedded
 in a global economical, political and socio-cultural context. We end our
 counterpoint by reflecting on reflexivity, proposing three practices that
 can guide HRM scholars in becoming reflexive in the ways they study HRM. Copyright (c) Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2009.

Title: Rationality and Its Symbols: Signalling Effects and Subjectification in Management Consulting 
Abstract:
 In service sectors such as management consulting, it is very difficult to
 measure the impact or success of a service even after it has been
 delivered. In these markets of goods between experience and credence,
 symbolic value is helpful and necessary to complement quality perceptions.
 The leading management consulting firms, in particular, do not only
 deliver data-driven analyses but also represent and symbolize the rational
 approach to business issues. This article looks at the role of personnel
 selection in the context of quality symbolization. It argues that the
 predominant tool for personnel selection in the consulting sector, the
 case study, accounts for both a signalling effect of rationality to the
 business environment and a subjectification of consulting staff to the
 consulting culture and rationality beliefs. The case is made that, rather
 than leading to a valid selection of high-performance personnel, the
 process of personnel selection has latent effects, which nonetheless
 contribute to the consulting industry's success. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2004.

Title: Encouraging Consensus-Challenging Research in Universities 
Abstract:
  Drawing from self-efficacy theory and transcriptions of in-depth
 interviews, we construct a conjoint experiment that we then administer to
 54 tenure-tracked assistant professors from two Research-I universities in
 the United States. Findings from their 1728 nested decisions show that the
 administrative effectiveness of outcome expectations and time constraints
 in encouraging highly uncertain, consensus-challenging research depends on
 the research self-efficacy of scholars. As expected, we find that
 increases in anticipated credit are more effective at encouraging
 consensus-challenging research when scholars perceive themselves to be
 highly competent in the line of research being pursued. Surprisingly,
 however, we also find that increases in both blame and time pressures are
 more discouraging of consensus-challenging research when scholars perceive
 themselves to be highly competent in a research area. We conclude by
 discussing the findings and their implications for research and practice. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2006.

Title: 'Sameness' and 'Difference' Revisited: Which Way Forward For Equal Opportunity Initiatives? 
Abstract:
 Recent interest in 'managing diversity' has reopened debates about forms
 of equality in the workplace. Approaches to equality developed in the
 1970s and 1980s have been characterized as an attempt to ensure that if
 individuals bring the same abilities to work, or perform in the same way,
 they should receive the same access to jobs and employment benefits,
 regardless of social group membership. Managing diversity appears to be
 about a more positive valuing of difference. Benefits are seen to derive
 from different perspectives and approaches and these should be nurtured
 and rewarded rather than suppressed. Feminists have long argued about the
 extent to which women are the same as, or different from, men, and about
 the political consequences of adopting these positions. Recent theoretical
 developments have led to some novel solutions to this dilemma. These
 include asserting claims to both 'sameness' and 'difference', the
 deconstruction of 'difference', and the reconstruction of 'sameness' on
 women's terms. This paper explores approaches to equal opportunities
 through both established and novel theoretical perspectives. It argues
 that existing practice cannot be fitted neatly into the conventional
 distinctions between 'sameness' and 'difference', and explores the
 potential characteristics and strengths and weaknesses of equality
 initiatives based on the new theoretical perspectives. Copyright 1996 Basil Blackwell Ltd.

Title: Dynamics of Cooperation: At the Brink of Irrelevance 
Abstract:
 Alliances have become commonplace. This has led to a considerable number
 of academic and professional publications on alliances and, more recently,
 on the dynamics of cooperation. However, the body of knowledge on the
 dynamics of cooperation developed so far is characterized by
 fragmentation, lack of coherence and non-comparable research output. There
 is no consensus on paradigmatic beliefs, which hampers theoretical
 progress. As a result, there is what we call an "academic gap". Moreover,
 the literature on the dynamics of cooperation often studies research
 questions that are irrelevant to managers' needs. As a consequence, there
 is also a "managerial relevance gap". The emergence of these two gaps is
 primarily due to the choice of assumptions, the emphasis on originality,
 and the use of a variety of methodological approaches. Nevertheless, we
 believe it is still possible to reverse the trend and make the literature
 on the dynamics of cooperation more relevant. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2006.

Title: Contracts to Communities: A Processual Model of Organizational Virtue 
Abstract:
 In the face of systemic challenges to corporate legitimacy, scholars and
 managers alike have been rethinking traditional answers to the question:
 What does it take to be a good company? We approach this question in two
 novel ways. We offer a normative answer, grounded in virtue ethics, by
 introducing a threefold typology of organizational forms. The moral
 goodness of each form depends on the congruence between its purpose and
 virtues. But we also offer a positive answer in the form of a processual
 model which traces corporate goodness to its empirical antecedents and
 consequences. The model defies a view of organizations as innately good or
 evil, but rather portrays virtue as the sediment of a value infusion
 process. We predict that if managers succeed in establishing in their
 organizations the kind of virtues necessary to support collective moral
 agency, they can expect to reap gains like enhanced effectiveness and
 legitimacy. However, when they neglect their moral responsibilities, the
 result will likely be organizational demise. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2007.

Title: Strategy in the Public Sector: Management in the Wilderness 
Abstract:
 The central question addressed in this paper is 'Why have organizational
 strategies emerged in the public sector?' Two broad answers are suggested.
 First, 'strategies' profile the organization through identifying aims,
 outputs and outcomes. Public services must, now, provide such transparency
 in order to secure on-going funding from government bodies. Once
 'strategies' are being produced, they also offer an organizational vision
 that potential additional funding agencies can buy into (with both
 commitment and money). And public services are short of resources. Second,
 'strategies' signal greater devolved responsibility in the public sector
 for both acquiring resources and achieving results. They enable the
 inclusion of managerial priorities and values in setting the direction of
 public services. And politicians desire more control over the
 professionals that dominate public services whilst, simultaneously,
 wanting to make them more responsible for outcomes. This article explores
 the growth of strategic planning in a particular area of the public sector
 - the national parks. Strategies as 'dormant documents' and strategies as
 'funding pitches' are discussed. It is suggested that, in the public
 sector, strategies should be the object of strategy. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2003.

Title: Corporate Governance and Financial Constraints on Strategic Turnarounds 
Abstract:
 The paper extends the Robbins and Pearce (1992) two-stage turnaround
 response model to include governance factors. In addition to retrenchment
 and recovery, the paper proposes the addition of a realignment stage,
 referring specifically to the realignment of expectations of principal and
 agent groups. The realignment stage imposes a threshold that must be
 crossed before the retrenchment and hence recovery stage can be entered.
 Crossing this threshold is problematic to the extent that the interests of
 governance-stakeholder groups diverge in a crisis situation. The severity
 of the crisis impacts on the bases of strategy contingent asset valuation
 leading to the fragmentation of stakeholder interests. In some cases the
 consequence may be that management are prevented from carrying out
 turnarounds by governance constraints. The paper uses a case study to
 illustrate these dynamics, and like the Robbins and Pearce study, it
 focuses on the textile industry. A longitudinal approach is used to show
 the impact of the removal of governance constraints. The empirical
 evidence suggests that such financial constraints become less serious to
 the extent that there is a functioning market for corporate control.
 Building on governance research and turnaround literature, the paper also
 outlines the general case necessary and sufficient conditions for
 successful turnarounds. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2006.

Title: Agency Problems in Diverse Contexts: A Global Perspective 
Abstract:
 Bruce, Buck and Main (2005) offer two criticisms of agency theory as a
 valid model of executive behaviour. First, they suggest that because
 researchers have failed to find a strong empirical link between executive
 pay and firm performance, and since this research generally rests on
 models derived from agency theory, then we must question the theory.
 Second, they suggest that agency theory is under-socialized and therefore
 lacks generalizability to settings where social solutions would seem to
 eliminate the agency problem. In our response we make three points. First,
 agency theory rests on an assumption of self-interest that does not
 necessarily reflect opportunism. Second, agency theory does not make any
 reference to pay-performance sensitivity, and the failure of this research
 can be attributable to a variety of problems with the research. Third, we
 agree that agency theory does not explicitly recognize contextual factors,
 but suggest that this abstraction from context, gives agency theory
 greater generalizability. Finally, we review the UK and German contexts
 discussed by Bruce, Buck and Main to show that socialized solutions do not
 prevent the occurrence of agency problems. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005.

Title: Beyond Self-Interest Revisited 
Abstract:
 We revisit the self-interest view on human behaviour and its critique, and
 propose a framework, called self-love view, that integrates self-interest
 and unselfishness and provides different explanations of the relationship
 between preferences, behaviour, and outcomes. Proponents of self-interest
 as the only valid behavioural assumption argue for simplified assumptions
 and clear models in order to propose precise prescriptions, while critics
 to this self-interest view argue for realistic assumptions and rich
 descriptions in order to reach better explanations. This debate inhibits
 theoretical development because it faces the problem of incommensurability
 of standards for choosing among paradigms. We propose the concept of
 self-love, or the inclination of human beings to strive for their own good
 and perfection, to remove the assumption "self-interest vs.
 unselfishness". Self-love distinguishes between the object and the subject
 of motivation and therefore creates a bi-dimensional motivational space.
 This framework replaces the unidimensional continuum
 "self-interest-unselfishness", specifies eight interrelated motives, and
 provides different expected relationships between preferences, behaviour,
 and outcomes. We show that a better understanding of motivational
 assumptions, their embodiment in theories, and their influence on the very
 behaviours these theories assume provides managers and policymakers more
 alternatives for the designing of motivational contexts than in the case
 of assuming either self-interest or a permanent conflict between
 self-interest and unselfishness. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2006.

Title: East Meets West: A Cross-Cultural Comparison of Charismatic Leadership Among Canadian and Iranian Executives 
Abstract:
 This study first develops an empirically based Western charismatic
 leadership profile. Using confirmatory factor analysis, the profile is
 compared with a profile of Iranian managers. The results demonstrate that
 despite major cultural differences in the two countries, there are core
 similarities in the profiles across the two cultures. The Canadian
 charismatic profile of vision, tenacity, intellectual challenge,
 self-sacrifice, and eloquence is substantially confirmed within the
 Iranian sample. But we also show that Iranian managers' ratings are
 significantly lower than those of the Canadian managers, indicating
 potentially different behavioural manifestations. The paper speculates
 that while the differences are probably due to cultural differences, the
 similarities may be due to universal intrinsic human desire for morality,
 autonomy, and achievement. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2004.

Abstract:
 A "strategic exchange" framework for the analysis of the relationship
 between the personal strategies of strategists and the strategic direction
 followed by organizations is presented. The exchange relationship that
 strategists have with their organization and the exchange relationship
 between the organization and the constituencies upon which it is resource
 dependent is examined and some of the processes and practices that this
 can entail are illustrated with the case of Strath Guitars. The case study
 also illustrates the value of "ethnographic fiction science" as an
 innovative type of research account which is especially appropriate for
 the reporting of studies of the detailed interpersonal and social
 processes associated with organizational strategy-making. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2003.

Title: The Politics of Standards in Modern Management: Making 'The Project' a Reality 
Abstract:
 In this paper, we explore the standardization of contemporary management
 knowledge, focusing in particular upon the role of 'standards' in creating
 and reifying 'organizational objects', with powerful consequences and with
 often unrecognized ethical implications. It is our argument that modernist
 beliefs in 'general, abstract and timeless ideas' (Brunsson et&thinsp;al.,
 2000, p. 173), enshrined in a universal and abstract rationality, results
 in the marginalization of more reflexive forms of rationality and the
 suppression of autonomy, creativity and discretion in organizations. To
 investigate the consequences of standardization, we take as the focus of
 our analysis a specific management model which has a significant and
 growing impact on many sectors of contemporary industry; that of project
 management. Drawing on the work of Timmermans and Berg (1997), Bowker and
 Star (1999) and Brunsson et&thinsp;al. (2000), we draw attention to the
 reification of the object of management; in this case, the project itself,
 as a transhistorical, 'real world' object. By tracing efforts to establish
 and institutionalize 'standards' in this and other fields of management,
 in particular through the creation and dissemination of a universal 'body
 of knowledge' for this field, we draw attention to the political and moral
 significance of the 'blackboxing' of knowledge. It is our broader
 intention here to help to denaturalize this organizational object, to
 legitimize other modes of knowledge and practice in the field, and thereby

Title: Building Better Theory by Bridging the Quantitative-Qualitative Divide 
Abstract:
  Qualitative methods for data collection and analysis are not mystical,
 but they are powerful, particularly when used to build new or refine
 existing theories. This article provides an introduction to qualitative
 methods and an overview of tactics for ensuring rigor in qualitative
 research useful for the novice researcher, as well as more experienced
 researchers interested in expanding their methodological repertoire or
 seeking guidance on how to evaluate qualitative research. We focus our
 discussion on the qualitative analytical technique of grounded theory
 building, and suggest that organizational research has much to gain by
 coupling of use of qualitative and quantitative research methods. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2006.

Title: Geographic and Industrial Diversification of Developing Country Firms 
Abstract:
 This paper examines the impact of the industrial and geographical
 diversification activities of developing country firms on their
 performance, and draws attention to the unique attributes of these firms
 and of the circumstances under which their diversification activities take
 place. The empirical analysis is based on data from 345 developing country
 firms. The findings suggest significant and positive association between
 industrial and geographic diversification and performance, and
 considerable variation of these relationships across developing regions
 and diversification strategies. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2004.

Title: Early Career Outcomes of Graduate Employees: the Effect of Mentoring and Ingratiation 
Abstract:
 Underpinned by the growing recognition of influence processes or a
 careerist orientation in the determination of career success, this study
 examined the effect of career-oriented mentoring, ingratiation and their
 interaction term on the career success measures of salary, number of
 promotions received and career satisfaction. Data were obtained through
 structured questionnaires from graduate employees ("N"&equals; 432)
 working full-time in Hong Kong. Results of the ordinary least-squares
 regression analyses revealed a non-significant effect of career-oriented
 mentoring, ingratiation and their interaction term on salary.
 Career-oriented mentoring was, however, significantly positively related
 to number of promotions received and career satisfaction. Although the
 results reinforced the dominance of the traditional determinants of career
 success, the significant effect of career-oriented mentoring on two of the
 career success measures may help to paint a more realistic picture of the
 process of career success in organizations. Limitations of the study,
 directions for future research and implications of the findings are
 discussed. Copyright 1996 Basil Blackwell Ltd.

Title: Discourse and Audience: Organizational Change as Multi-Story Process 
Abstract:
 This article is critical of monological research accounts that fail to
 accommodate polyvocal narratives of organizational change, calling for
 more fully informed case studies that combine elements of a narrative
 approach with processual/contextual analysis. We illustrate how
 contrasting versions of the same change event by different stakeholders
 and by the same stakeholder for different audiences, raise theoretical and
 methodological issues in the analysis and presentation of data on
 organizational change. Our argument is that research narratives (that seek
 to develop understanding of change processes) are necessarily selective
 and sieved through particular discourses that represent different ways of
 engaging in research. They are authored in a particular genre and written
 to influence target audiences who become active co-creators of meaning.
 Organizational change viewed from this perspective is a multi-story
 process, in which theoretical accounts and guides to practice are authored
 consistent with pre-selected narrative styles. These, in turn, are
 purposefully chosen to influence target audiences, but this subjective
 crafting is often hidden behind a cloak of putative objectivity in the
 written and oral presentations of academic research findings. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2007.

Title: Do Managers and Strategies Matter? A Study In Crisis 
Abstract:
 Highly interactive, tightly coupled, high-risk technological systems have
 introduced the potential for catastrophic events. Although many people
 consider crises and disasters to be inevitable, our results suggest that
 firms that are better able to avoid crisis events have top-management
 teams with a higher level of functional team heterogeneity, higher
 education levels, shorter organizational tenures, and more tenure
 heterogeneity. These characteristics serve as proxies for deeper
 underlying cognitive processes such as more complex thinking, quality
 decision making, dialectical inquiry, and multiple perspectives in solving
 potential catastrophic problems. These cognitive and social processes
 appear to be successful in addressing interactive complexity in high-risk
 technologies, and may be associated with fewer faulty assumptions about
 firms' vulnerability to crises. In addition, firms whose top managers'
 time and energy is devoted to managing acquisition and divestment
 activities are more likely to experience crisis events. Highly diversified
 firms emphasizing financial and bureaucratic controls appear to develop
 threat-rigidities, a lack of firm specific knowledge, and decreased
 information processing capabilities making them increasingly vulnerable to
 systemic crisis events. Copyright 1996 Basil Blackwell Ltd.

Title: Incentives Management During Privatization: An Agency Perspective 
Abstract:
 This paper explains, through a field study and from an agency perspective,
 how monitoring and incentive alignment mechanisms change to support the
 interests of a privatized firm's new ownership. In this case,
 privatization led to important changes in the board of directors and to
 more formal performance evaluation and compensation systems for top
 managers, as profitability and financial control gained relevancy with the
 firm ownership change. Our results show that differences in incentives
 management before and after privatization are due to different agency
 relations in the two periods. We also argue that in a privatization
 framework the relation between monitoring and incentive alignment
 mechanisms is complex, not simply substitutive as agency theory would
 predict, and this finding allows us to refine and extend agency theory for
 this specific context. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2007.

Title: Interpartner Legitimacy in the Alliance Development Process 
Abstract:
 We propose a framework to understand interpartner legitimacy in strategic
 alliances. Interpartner legitimacy is the mutual acknowledgment by the
 alliance partners that their actions are proper in the developmental
 processes of the alliance. We argue that interpartner legitimacy is needed
 for cooperation to achieve alliance objectives. We propose three types of
 interpartner legitimacy - pragmatic, moral, and cognitive legitimacy - and
 discuss the dynamics of these three types in the formation, operation, and
 outcome stages of alliance development. Further, we discuss the salience
 of interpartner legitimacy in different alliance types. Finally, we derive
 propositions for further research, and discuss strategies that alliance
 managers can adopt to develop interpartner legitimacy. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2007.

Title: Conflict for Mutual Gains? 
Abstract:
 This paper adopts Walton and McKersie's Behavioral Theory of Labor
 Negotiations to examine the outcomes of industrial relations negotiations
 to implement teamworking. Negotiations from 21 departments across two
 integrated steelworks are classified into four negotiation patterns, each
 producing different outcomes from teamworking for managers and employees.
 Managers secured lower manning and increased productivity in negotiations
 both in departments characterized throughout by cooperation and those
 characterized by conflict. However, mutual gains were secured only where
 union negotiators pursued conflict tactics during bargaining. In those
 departments where union negotiators adopted more conflictual bargaining
 tactics, more employees reported pay increases and greater satisfaction
 with teamworking agreements, compared with employees in more 'cooperative'
 departments. 'Mixed' bargaining approaches in other departments were less
 successful, particularly for union negotiators. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2007.

Title: Tricks of the Trade: The Performance and Interpretation of Authenticity 
Abstract:
 This paper discusses a Tokyo advertising agency's preparation of campaign
 ideas for a competitive presentation made to a Japanese multinational
 corporation planning to advertise in both Germany and the United States,
 and the part played therein by the author as authentic foreign other.
 Based on anthropological fieldwork, the paper gives details of the
 client's orientation and the agency's subsequent market analysis and
 creative interpretations, while following the back-stage interpretations
 of key personnel's tastes by the agency's account team as a means towards
 making their final selection of campaign ideas for the presentation. This
 description gives rise to two complementary analyses of authenticity. One
 concerns advertising as 'authentic reproduction' in the context of the
 interpretation of cultural stereotypes. The other analyses back stage
 strategy and front stage performance to show how the performance and
 interpretation of authenticity are tricks of the trade that enable
 Japanese business organizations to be seen as professional and credible in
 the eyes of their clients, competitors, customers and partners. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005.

Title: Kurt Lewin and the Planned Approach to Change: A Re-appraisal 
Abstract:
 The work of Kurt Lewin dominated the theory and practice of change
 management for over 40 years. However, in the past 20 years, Lewin's
 approach to change, particularly the 3-Step model, has attracted major
 criticisms. The key ones are that his work: assumed organizations operate
 in a stable state; was only suitable for small-scale change projects;
 ignored organizational power and politics; and was top-down and
 management-driven. This article seeks to re-appraise Lewin's work and
 challenge the validity of these views. It begins by describing Lewin's
 background and beliefs, especially his commitment to resolving social
 conflict. The article then moves on to examine the main elements of his
 Planned approach to change: Field Theory; Group Dynamics; Action Research;
 and the 3-Step model. This is followed by a brief summary of the major
 developments in the field of organizational change since Lewin's death
 which, in turn, leads to an examination of the main criticisms levelled at
 Lewin's work. The article concludes by arguing that rather than being
 outdated or redundant, Lewin's approach is still relevant to the modern
 world. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2004.

Title: The Dynamics of Delayering: Changing Management Structures in Three Countries 
Abstract:
 The 1990s witnessed significant changes in organizational design
 philosophy. Unique to the 1990s were prescriptions for restructuring
 involving delayering (the planned vertical compression of managerial
 levels of hierarchy) (Keuning and Opheij, 1994; Peters, 1992). What did
 this mean in practice? The current understanding of delayering can be
 encapsulated in a 'delayering thesis'. However, outside of the USA and UK
 there has been limited study and measurement of the extent and effects of
 delayering. This paper delineates trends in delayering based on surveys of
 2964 organizations across three countries and assesses the effects in
 terms of management structures, workloads, productivity, and the notion of
 'survivor syndrome'. The extent of a subsequent phase of 'relayering' is
 examined. It concludes that delayering has been widespread as an
 organizational strategy; that there are few signs of a
 delayering-relayering cycle, but the effects in relation to managers was a
 collapse of commitment in Australia and South Africa. However, there were
 significant differences in New Zealand. A downsizing/delayering model is
 discussed. Copyright 2003 Blackwell Science Asia Pty. Ltd..

Title: Managerial Collective Cognitions: An Examination of Similarities and Differences of Cultural Orientations 
Abstract:
 Using the context of market orientation, we examine how an exemplary
 business's market orientation culture is reflected in managers' mental
 models, evaluate how mental models and perceived behaviours differ across
 hierarchical levels and functions, and compare the cognitive values and
 beliefs or the cognitive aspects of market orientation culture with
 behavioural aspects. Results from a rich, multi-method, case study suggest
 that while managers in the business share core beliefs regarding the
 customer dimension of market orientation, their beliefs regarding
 competitors, technology and inter-functional coordination dimensions vary
 widely across the levels and functions of the business. We found
 differences in terms of both the integration between the four dimensions
 of market orientation and the depth of knowledge within the dimensions.
 Our findings reveal that customer rather than competitor beliefs are the
 most important commonly shared beliefs in successful companies, leading us
 to encourage cognitive researchers to move beyond competitor analysis when
 examining managerial cognition. Another implication for future research is
 that a strong market orientation implies common core beliefs regarding
 customer dimensions but does not imply that all beliefs will be or should
 be shared. From the methodological standpoint, we find that cognitive
 mapping techniques provide rich insights into a business's market
 orientation culture that are not gained from behavioural methods alone. Copyright (c) Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2008.

Title: The Denial of Slavery in Management Studies 
Abstract:
 American slavery has been wrongfully excluded from histories of
 management. By 1860, when the historical orthodoxy has modern management
 emerging on the railroads, 38,000 managers were managing the 4 million
 slaves working in the US economy. Given slaves' worth, slaveholders could
 literally claim 'our people are our greatest asset.' Yet a review of
 histories of management shows ante-bellum slavery excluded from managerial
 modernity as pre-capitalist, unsophisticated in practice, and without
 non-owner managers identified as such. These grounds for exclusion are
 challenged. First, it is shown slavery is included within capitalism by
 many historians, who also see plantations as a site of the emergence of
 industrial discipline. Second, ante-bellum slavery is demonstrated to have
 been managed according to classical management and Taylorian principles.
 Third, those doing the managing are shown to have been employed at the
 time as 'managers'. In the idea of the manager, and of scientific and
 classical management slavery has therefore left an ongoing imprint in
 management practice and thought. A strong argument is made for not just
 for postcolonialist accounts of management, but for management histories
 in which anti-African-American racism is a continuing strand. The
 fundamental significance of the article however is its identification of
 slavery as of intrinsic, but hitherto denied, relevance to management
 studies. Copyright 2003 Blackwell Publishing Ltd..

Title: Governance of the Entrepreneurial Threshold Firm: A Knowledge-based Perspective 
Abstract:
 By building on a knowledge-based view of the firm, this paper addresses a
 relatively unexplored area of roles and dynamics of corporate governance
 in younger, threshold firms that are undergoing a transition from the
 emergence to the professional management stage. Our analysis is focused on
 the process of capability development, exploring the effect of the
 asymmetry in knowledge that often exists between directors and senior
 managers on the governance of threshold firms. We examine the key sources
 of this asymmetry, explore ways directors and senior executives learn, and
 then discuss the implications of this learning on the evolution of
 governance systems in the threshold firm. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2004.

Title: Micro-Practices of Strategic Sensemaking and Sensegiving: How Middle Managers Interpret and Sell Change Every Day 
Abstract:
 This paper looks at the workings of ongoing primary sensemaking and
 sensegiving micro-practices by which middle managers interpret and sell
 strategic change at the organizational interface. Through middle managers'
 routines and conversations related to the implementation of a strategic
 change in a top-of-the-line clothing company, the article shows how they
 contribute to renewing links with stakeholders, in particular clientele,
 by drawing on their tacit knowledge. Interpretative analysis of these
 routines and conversations highlights four micro-practices of strategic
 sensemaking and sensegiving: translating the orientation, overcoding the
 strategy, disciplining the client, and justifying the change. The paper
 outlines a practice perspective of sensemaking and sensegiving. It ends by
 suggesting the necessity of looking at middle managers' role as
 interpreters and sellers of strategic change at the micro level for a
 better understanding of their contribution in sustaining competitive
 advantage through their everyday activities. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005.

Title: Effects of Psychological Contract Breach on Organizational Citizenship Behaviour: Insights from the Group Value Model 
Abstract:
 Research on psychological contract breach has referenced social exchange
 as its dominant theoretical foundation. In this study, we draw insights
 from the group value model as a theoretical extension to explain
 employees' negative responses to psychological contract breach. According
 to the group value model, fair treatment by group members communicates
 symbolic messages about the relationship between the organization and the
 employee, and has implications for whether employees can take pride in
 their organizational membership. When people are treated unfairly, they
 lose trust in the organization and dis-identify from the group. This in
 turn results in less willingness on the part of the employees to engage in
 organizational citizenship behaviours (OCBs). We tested these
 relationships across three studies. In Study 1, we conducted a
 longitudinal test of the role of trust as a mediator between breach and
 organizational identification. In Studies 2 (cross-sectional) and 3
 (longitudinal), we tested the complete model in which we examined the role
 of trust and identification in mediating the link between breach and OCBs.
 All three studies provided support for the mediated model. Furthermore, as
 predicted by the group value model, the hypothesized relationships emerged
 in response to relational but not transactional contract breaches.
 Theoretical and applied implications are discussed. Copyright (c) Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2008.

Title: Building a Strong Foothold in an Emerging Market: A Link Between Resource Commitment and Environment Conditions 
Abstract:
 This study examines how MNEs align resource commitment with environmental
 conditions (challenges and opportunities) when they invest in a foreign
 emerging market. MNEs often face a dilemma in allocating resources to this
 environment: without this commitment, they cannot build a strong
 competitive foothold; yet with over-commitment, there is excessive
 economic exposure. Our analysis of MNEs in a major emerging market
 suggests that resource commitment is an inverse function of market
 uncertainty and this inverse link is stronger for less strategically
 proactive MNEs. Resource commitment is also an increasing function of
 market opportunities and this function is stronger for firms emphasizing
 demand-side (as opposed to cost-side) gains. In addition, in a highly
 volatile industry, resource commitment is negatively associated with
 cultural distance, but in a relatively stable industry, it is positively
 associated with cultural distance. And finally, as foreign subsidiaries
 become older, the influence of cultural distance on resource commitment is
 weakened. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2004.

Title: The Failure of the Sport7 TV-channel: Controversies in a Business Network 
Abstract:
 During 1996, TV viewers in the Netherlands witnessed the rise and fall of
 Sport7: a dedicated sports TV channel. Apparently, Sport7 did not succeed
 to become part of the business network of television and sports. This
 paper describes and explains why the venture failed. It builds on earlier
 insights from research on the outcomes of joint ventures and the business
 networks perspective. These insights are combined and utilized within the
 framework of the theory of social becoming (Sztompka, 1991). As such, for
 a new venture like Sport7, the outcome depends on the settlement of a
 number of controversies that arise with the establishment of a new actor
 in an existing business network. In the case of Sport7, the settlement of
 these controversies appeared to go against this new venture, ultimately
 leading to the demise of this new TV channel. Copyright 2003 Blackwell Publishing Ltd..

Title: Coordination Networks Within and Across Organizations: A Multi-level Framework 
Abstract:
 There are important organizational phenomena that cannot be fruitfully
 examined without crossing levels of analysis, as others have shown. We
 argue that coordination of patient care in the current institutional
 environment is one such phenomenon. As organizations vertically
 disintegrate and outsource services that were once produced internally,
 coordination with external organizations becomes increasingly important
 for achieving desired performance outcomes. We describe the efforts of one
 hospital to extend the intra-organizational coordination of patient care
 to encompass coordination with its external partners. The organization
 design and network perspectives are both conducive to spanning multiple
 levels of analysis. We show that the two perspectives together serve as a
 useful vehicle for developing a framework that links intra- and
 inter-organizational coordination. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2004.

Title: Effectiveness and Efficiency of Cross-Border Knowledge Transfer: An Empirical Examination 
Abstract:
 Based on a sample of 102 US organizations, this study examines the impact
 of knowledge characteristics, recipient learning intent, source
 attractiveness, and relationship quality on the effectiveness and
 efficiency of knowledge transfer from the international business
 affiliates of these organizations. Findings indicate that recipient
 learning intent and source attractiveness positively impact the
 effectiveness of knowledge transfer. In addition, recipient learning
 intent was found to have a positive effect on knowledge transfer
 efficiency. In particular, results highlight the strong positive impact
 that the quality of the relationship between the source and the recipient
 has on both the efficiency and effectiveness of cross-border knowledge
 transfer. The study also indicates that knowledge value is positively
 associated with recipient learning intent and that knowledge value, rarity
 and non-substitutability influence source attractiveness. Finally,
 findings suggest that the relationship between knowledge characteristics
 and knowledge transfer is partially mediated by recipient learning intent
 and source attractiveness. Copyright (c) Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2008.

Title: Metonymy in Language about Organizations: A Corpus-Based Study of Company Names 
Abstract:
 In this paper, I examine the use of metonymies in people's talk about
 organizations. Drawing upon a corpus of natural talk extracted from the
 British National Corpus (BNC) I identify recurring categories of
 metonymies that appear to be a central part of people's talk about
 organizations. These categories of metonymies involve substitutions where
 an organization stands in for its members, its products, its facilities,
 its stock or shares or a company-related event. I also found that
 metonymies in each of these categories are used as basic metonymic
 expressions that are only partially connected to metaphorical expressions
 and interpretations of organizations. Where those connections exist, the
 use of metonymies follows a metaphor-from-metonymy linguistic pattern
 (where a metaphorical meaning arises from the use of a metonymy) rather
 than a metonymy-within-metaphor pattern (where a metonymy is part of a
 metaphorical expression). I elaborate on the implications of these
 findings for our understanding of how organizations are discursively
 constructed and understood through metonymic language. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2007.

Title: Unpacking Commitment: Multiple Loyalties and Employee Behaviour 
Abstract:
 We present findings from three UK studies on the nature and consequences
 of employees' multiple commitments in the workplace, with samples drawn
 from private manufacturing, private services and the public sector.
 Co-workers, the union, the union representative, customers, and the
 immediate boss emerge as separate foci of commitment, distinct from
 'global' commitment to the organization as a whole. Consistent with social
 exchange theory, attitudinal and behavioural outcomes are predicted by
 commitment to those foci that might be expected to benefit from the
 outcome in question. There is evidence that global organizational
 commitment mediates the relationship between foci-specific commitments and
 organization-related outcomes, but there is no mediation in the case of
 those foci and outcomes that are more cognitively distant from the
 organization. A comparison of the studies suggests that the pattern and
 outcomes of commitment are influenced by the nature of the job and of the
 work context. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005.

Title: Predicting the Performance of International Joint Ventures: An Investigation in China 
Abstract:
 Organizational learning, resourcing and control have been identified in
 the literature as potential firm-level influences on the performance of
 international joint ventures (IJVs). The study reported here examines the
 impact of these factors on the performance of Sino-foreign IJVs. Their
 performance is assessed in terms of both 'goal' and 'system' criteria. The
 hypothesized performance determinants are found to be more strongly
 associated with variance in system performance than in goal performance.
 The main performance predictors are the parent companies' experience with
 international business and joint ventures, and the quality of resources
 they provide to the joint ventures in respect of capital investment, new
 facilities and operational inputs. When good quality resourcing is
 provided, the sharing of control with local partners also predicts higher
 IJV performance. The performance effects of these factors appears to be
 cumulative, implying that further research should examine them together
 rather than singularly. Copyright 2003 Blackwell Publishing Ltd..

Title: Corporate Governance in Emerging Economies: A Review of the Principal-Principal Perspective 
Abstract:
 Instead of traditional principal-agent conflicts espoused in most research
 dealing with developed economies, principal-principal conflicts have been
 identified as a major concern of corporate governance in emerging
 economies. Principal-principal conflicts between controlling shareholders
 and minority shareholders result from concentrated ownership, extensive
 family ownership and control, business group structures, and weak legal
 protection of minority shareholders. Such principal-principal conflicts
 alter the dynamics of the corporate governance process and, in turn,
 require remedies different from those that deal with principal-agent
 conflicts. This article reviews and synthesizes recent research from
 strategy, finance, and economics on principal-principal conflicts with an
 emphasis on their institutional antecedents and organizational
 consequences. The resulting integration provides a foundation upon which
 future research can continue to build. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2008.

Title: A Dual Networks Perspective on Inter-Organizational Transfer of R&D Capabilities: International Joint Ventures in the Chinese Automotive Industry 
Abstract:
 Acquisition of capabilities is both imperative and difficult in emerging
 economies. This study adopts a duel network perspective to examine how the
 source networks and recipient networks in which international joint
 venture (IJV) partners operate influence inter-organizational transfer and
 diffusion of capabilities. We study multiple cases in the Chinese
 automotive industry to investigate how various factors of MNE source
 networks and the local recipient networks (business groups in China or
 qiye jituan) affect knowledge transfer from the MNE source networks into
 IJVs and knowledge diffusion from IJVs to their local recipient networks.
 The study suggests ways that the dual networks influence both types of
 knowledge transfer. We found both positive and negative effects of
 recipient and source networks on knowledge inflow to the IJVs and
 knowledge outflow from IJVs. The dual networks perspective is particularly
 relevant for emerging economies where the asymmetry between the knowledge,
 power and motivations of the recipient and source networks may
 significantly affect the knowledge transfer outcome. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005.

Title: Expanding the Tension-Reduction Model of Work Stress and Alcohol Use: Comparison of Managerial and Non-Managerial Men and Women 
Abstract:
 The tension-reduction model that links workplace stress to alcohol use and
 problems has received mixed support in previous investigations. Following
 recommendations that this model include moderated mediated relationships
 (Frone, 1999) using more specific forms of workplace stress, we examine
 the impact of gender ratio, generalized workplace abuse, and stereotype
 threat in an effort to predict alcohol use and problems particularly for
 managerial women. A total of 1410 (57 per cent response rate) employees
 completed a survey containing items on job stress, escapist reasons for
 drinking, and alcohol consumption and problems, and SEM analyses were
 conducted separately for managerial and non-managerial men and women.
 Results revealed that: (a) these three workplace stressors were
 differentially related to general workplace stress for the four groups;
 and (b) the contributions of the three stressors and of general work
 stress to the alcohol-related variables varied by group. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2007.

Title: Boardroom Strategizing in Professional Associations: Processual and Institutional Perspectives 
Abstract:
 This study examines strategic decision-making at the boardroom level of
 two non-profit professional associations, penetrating directors' strategic
 orientations, discourse and decisions in their holistic context. In
 comparison with the predominantly survey and interview based literature on
 board level strategy behaviour, this study employs a longitudinal complete
 member researcher, participant observer methodology. Its findings are
 analysed from an institutional theory perspective and reveal selective
 championing of strategies by directors, the evaluation of strategic
 proposals and progress in predominantly financial resource/outcome terms,
 and directors' attention to navigating strategic initiatives through
 organizational politics. Also revealed are private sector philosophies
 imported into the non-profit boardroom, the predominantly ceremonial role
 of formal strategic plans, and an informally enacted strategic discourse.
 This study offers a unique insider view of strategizing at the highest
 organizational level. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2007.

Title: Two Dimensions of the Internationalization of Firms 
Abstract:
 The paper argues that there are two dimensions of internationalization:
 one which refers to the production activities of firms abroad and one
 which focuses on the corporate governance dimension of firms. While the
 first one is well known in the literature on internationalization, the
 financial dimension has not yet been addressed empirically. At the same
 time there are indicators that financial internationalization is gaining
 importance. Using a sample of the 100 largest German companies it shows
 that both dimensions, the real and the financial dimension, do not co-vary
 and therefore cannot be combined into one index. Copyright (c) Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2003..

Title: Exploring the Political Side of Board Involvement in Strategy: A Study of Mixed-Ownership Institutions 
Abstract:
  This article reports on a comparative study of strategic decision-making
 and board functioning in nine firms. Findings indicate that the
 heterogeneity of interests represented on the board, members' possession
 of relevant knowledge, and the presence of ex-ante conflict resolution
 mechanisms combine in shaping if and how board members engage in
 strategy-related activities and how strategic decisions are taken.
 Findings extend current understandings about the strategic functions of
 the board (monitoring, advice, and resource-dependence), suggesting how,
 under certain conditions, boards may act as negotiation forums where
 directors search for a reconciliation between diverging shareholders'
 interests and views. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2006.

Title: Introduction: Organizations, Risk and Regulation 
Abstract:
 Risk, regulation and practices of organizing are interrelated in a myriad
 of ways. Natural disasters, technical failures, and also processes of
 organizing are sources of risk to which organizations must respond and for
 which new managerial and regulatory practices are demanded. In this
 introduction we highlight three salient features of risk management: the
 (un)intended production of risk by organizations; the complex
 interrelationship between risk management and regulation; and the evolving
 and often contested nature of risk management knowledge. Each of these
 three themes is evident in the different contributions to this themed
 section. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2006.

Title: Corporate Entrepreneurship Activities through Strategic Alliances: A Resource-Based Approach toward Competitive Advantage 
Abstract:
 Corporate entrepreneurship (CE) activities may significantly benefit from
 interfirm strategic alliances, although such benefits have not been
 sufficiently examined in the literature. In this paper, a resource-based
 framework is presented to examine how strategic alliances offer
 entrepreneurial firms needed resources that may not otherwise be
 available. We argue that CE activities are likely to lead to resource
 gaps. We compare various options to fill resource gaps, and identify the
 pros and cons of the alliance approach. We then discuss the resource
 conditions that provide competitive advantage for a firm, if alliances are
 properly used to help implement CE. Finally, we examine how different
 types of alliance (e.g. joint ventures, R&D alliances, and learning
 alliances) facilitate various CE activities, including innovation,
 corporate venturing, and strategic renewal. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2006.

Title: The Role of Micro-Strategies in the Engineering of Firm Evolution 
Abstract:
 This paper proposes a model of strategic evolution as a sequence of
 intentional recombinations of a company's "Core Micro-strategy" with new
 resources and organizational routines. A Core Micro-strategy is defined
 here as the established system of interconnected routines,
 micro-activities and resources that can be traced through most of a
 company's strategic initiatives. The paper is based on two comparative
 case studies and on theories of evolution in social and cultural systems,
 intraorganizational ecology and the resource-based view of the firm. The
 resulting model advances the existing literature on strategy evolution by
 (1) incorporating a more direct and salient role of managerial leadership
 within processes of strategic evolution, (2) incorporating a central role
 for micro-level processes through which management can directly and
 intentionally shape strategic evolution, and (3) proposing recent
 developments in the resource-based view of the firm as a suitable
 theoretical framework with which to explain the processes in which
 strategic evolution is rooted. The model also contributes to the dynamic
 capabilities perspective by offering a microprocessual interpretation of
 their workings. The resulting view of dynamic capabilities suggests that
 they operate more through repeated recombination patterns of stable
 organizational factors, than through disruption of existing practices. The
 paper describes the empirical evidence which emerges from analysis of the
 two case studies; the two descriptive models of strategy evolution
 inductively built on the cases; the theoretical model resulting from
 cross-case analysis and iteration between the two grounded models and
 theoretical frameworks. Copyright 2003 Blackwell Publishers Ltd..

Title: Guest Editors' Introduction 
Abstract:
 In this introductory article to the Special Issue we make a case for the
 study of 'field-configuring events' (FCEs). We begin with a discussion of
 the nature and character of FCEs. We next situate the study of FCEs in the
 context of ongoing research addressing the growth and evolution of
 institutional, organizational, and professional fields. We follow this
 with an overview of the relationship between FCEs and the evolution of
 fields, paying particular attention to how FCEs link field evolution at
 the macro level with individual action at the micro level. We then examine
 the unique methodological advantages that the study of FCEs offers to
 researchers who are interested in studying dynamic field processes. We
 conclude with a summary of the five papers that make up this Special
 Issue. Copyright (c) Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2008.

Title: Health Among Leaders: Positive and Negative Affect, Engagement and Burnout, Forgiveness and Revenge 
Abstract:
 The health of an organization's leader has profound implications not only
 for the leader, but also for the organization itself and for its members.
 This study focused on three indicators (positive affect, engagement,
 forgiveness behaviours) of eustress, the positive stress response, and
 three indicators (negative affect, burnout, revenge behaviour) of
 distress, the negative stress response, in relation to the health of
 pastors, whose jobs closely parallel those of leaders in all types of
 organizations. Results indicated that both positive affect and revenge
 behaviour were significantly related to health. A post-hoc analysis
 indicated that work-family conflict was negatively related to revenge
 behaviour, while family-work conflict was positively related to revenge
 behaviour, and that engagement was negatively related to revenge
 behaviour. These results are discussed in terms of their implications for
 future studies of leader health, and their practical applications for
 promoting leader health while preventing distress. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2007.

Title: Revisiting the Emergence of the Modern Business Enterprise: Entrepreneurship and the Singer Global Distribution System 
Abstract:
 This paper approaches the question of why entrepreneurial firms exist from
 a broad business historical perspective. It observes that the original
 development of the modern business enterprise was very strongly associated
 with entrepreneurial innovation rather than an extension of managerial
 routine. The widely-used theory of the entrepreneur as a specialist in
 judgmental decision making is applied to the particular point in time when
 entrepreneurs had to develop novel organizational designs in what Chandler
 described as the prelude to the 'managerial revolution'. The paper
 illustrates how the theory of entrepreneurship then best explains the rise
 of the modern corporation by focusing on the case study of vertical
 integration "par excellence", Singer. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2007.

Title: Ownership Structure of Cooperatives as an Environmental Buffer 
Abstract:
 In this paper, we propose that the ownership structure in the cooperative
 form acts as an environmental buffer. It is a mechanism to obtain stronger
 linkages with suppliers by internalizing them, and in this way, obtaining
 fundamental resources. Using this strategy, the cooperative form can
 isolate itself from adverse environments and from competition from other
 organizational forms. Although cooperatives have higher survival
 probability in any economic context, in rival ideological environments
 they have less support than other organizational forms. To test these
 ideas, we have chosen data from the Spanish olive oil milling industry for
 1944-98. During this period, Spain changed from a dictatorial to a
 democratic regime and from a self-subsistence economy in the post
 civil-war period to a broad liberal international economy. The results
 show that, whereas other organizational forms are affected by economic and
 ideological influences, the cooperative form isolates itself by changing
 the competition level. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2004.

Title: Post-Acquisition Restructuring as Evolutionary Process 
Abstract:
 The transformation and integration of acquired businesses is subject to
 tensions between implementing radical change to match the strategy and
 corporate culture of the acquirer, and promoting what is valuable in
 resources and cultural attributes in the acquired organization. Analysts'
 disagreement arises from different conceptualizations of the nature of
 resources. We present an evolutionary perspective that demonstrates not
 only the merits of competitive selection, but of local adaptation of
 transferred resources and of stimulating the development of local ones. Copyright 2003 Blackwell Publishing Ltd..

Title: From the Critics' Corner: Logic Blending, Discursive Change and Authenticity in a Cultural Production System 
Abstract:
 Drawing on an analysis of critics' reviews of Atlanta Symphony Orchestra
 (ASO) performances, we investigate how broader shifts in institutional
 logics shape the discourse of critics and their judgment of performances.
 We highlight how the aesthetic logic that traditionally informs the
 practices of the symphony yielded, in the face of declining orchestral
 resources, to a more commercially oriented market logic. As
 institutionalists have argued, shifts in logics are often catalysed by
 exogenous shocks. In the ASO, this blending of aesthetic and market logics
 became salient in the wake of a pivotal organizational event, the 1996
 musicians' strike. Qualitatively comparing pre- and post-strike reviews of
 ASO performances, we find that the discourse of critics shifted to capture
 the changing logic of the symphony: post-strike reviews were more attuned
 to market than aesthetic aspects of the symphony. Nonetheless, their
 reviews suggested that judgments based on notions of cultural authenticity
 were virtually unaffected. Although our results echo existing claims that
 art world critics often act in a ritualistic fashion, serving as
 gatekeepers for the authenticity of cultural genres, we extend scholarship
 by highlighting how critics' stories are embedded in broader discursive
 fields that reveal how they patrol the boundaries of genres. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005.

Title: Towards a Theory of Organizational Improvisation: Looking Beyond the Jazz Metaphor 
Abstract:
 This paper calls for research on organizational improvisation to go beyond
 the currently dominant jazz metaphor in theory development. We recognize
 the important contribution that jazz improvisation has made and will no
 doubt continue to make in understanding the nature and complexity of
 organizational improvisation. This article therefore presents some key
 lessons from the jazz metaphor and then proceeds to identify the possible
 dangers of building scientific inquiry upon a single metaphor. We then
 present three alternative models - Indian music, music therapy and role
 theory. We explore their nature and seek to identify ways in which the
 insights they generate complement those from jazz. This leads us to a
 better understanding of the challenges of building a theory of
 organizational improvisation. Copyright 2003 Blackwell Publishing Ltd..

Title: Stories from the Front-line: How they Construct the Organization 
Abstract:
 Drawing on social constructionist theory this paper applies discourse
 analysis to ten narratives told by service delivery staff in one
 distribution network. The analysis looks at how the narratives construct
 the organization through their constructions of self (the narrator),
 customer and manufacturer and their constructions of the relationships
 linking these three sets of actors. The paper argues that the narrators
 construct the self either as an organizational customer or an
 organizational partner. The two constructions locate conflict either
 within the organization or at the customer-organizational boundary
 respectively. The implications of this are suggested. Contrasts between
 the manner in which organizational members construct the self as customer
 or partner and the construction of the organizational member in the
 internal customer literature are highlighted and briefly discussed. Copyright 2003 Blackwell Publishing Ltd..

Title: Foucault, HRM and the Ethos of the Critical Management Scholar 
Abstract:
 This discussion reviews begins with a review of the uses to which
 Foucault's thought has been put in the study of human resource management,
 going on to consider - and to reject - a number of major criticisms of
 Foucault and Foucauldian studies of human resource management. Yet there
 remains much in Foucault's project that we seem often to ignore.
 Accordingly, the discussion considers the question of the articulation
 between Foucault's intellectual work and the practical, political spheres.
 Foucault conceives his own critical intellectual practice as part of a way
 of life analogous to the classical conception of an ethos. Adopting a
 loose and critical relationship to Foucault, the argument of the paper is
 that Foucault's ethos demands further attention as the possibilities for
 more practical and engaged forms of critical intellectual work have begun
 to be debated in management studies. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2003.

Title: Peering at the Past Century's Corporate Strategy Through the Looking Glass of Time-Series Analysis: Extrapolating from Chandler's Classic Mid-Century American Firms? 
Abstract:
 This study has a dual thrust. "Substantively", it revisits Chandler's
 pragmatic fit-performance directive (Chandler's 'efficiency thesis') or
 his assertion that firms whose structure matches their strategy become
 more effective than mismatched firms. It is important to revisit the
 empirical origin of this result in view of its gradual international
 extrapolation beyond the time and place in which it originated. By
 gathering the financial data relevant to the firms cited as examples by
 Chandler, we identify whether the change to the multidivisional structure
 did indeed lead to improved financial performance in the mid-twentieth
 century American firms he described. "Methodologically", it explores a
 novel approach to the empirical validation of basic theories. Using
 historical replication, it undertakes a longitudinal, time-series analysis
 of a classic theory based on twentieth-century data, and thus investigates
 the testing of classic data with a modern tool. We undertake multiple
 replications. Three separate longitudinal studies are performed,
 consisting of two forecasting methods applied to 11 individual time
 series, and a comparison technique applied to the same. These are used
 with the three most common measures of performance at the time of
 Chandler's writing. All three methods reveal that the differences
 predicted by his theory are not borne out by the longitudinal analysis of
 a core group of Chandler's own exemplary firms. The three sets of
 longitudinal analyses we present raise some substantive questions
 regarding this cornerstone of classical theory, and carry positive
 methodological portents regarding the use of "historical replication" as a
 stepping-stone for twenty-first-century research. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2003.

Title: Corporate Social Responsibility: Three Key Approaches 
Abstract:
 Corporate social responsibility remains an embryonic and contestable
 concept. This paper assesses three key approaches and offers a perspective
 gauging little prospect of theoretical synthesis. Ethical responsibility
 theory advocates strong corporate self-restraint and altruism duties and
 expansive public policy strengthening stakeholder rights. Economic
 responsibility theory advocates market wealth creation subject only to
 minimalist public policy and perhaps customary business ethics. These two
 viewpoints embed competing moral frameworks and political philosophies.
 Any theoretical synthesis must discover some subset of ethical principles
 yielding corporate competitive advantage. Corporate citizenship language
 invokes a political metaphor providing neither true intermediate
 positioning nor theoretical synthesis. Two conflicting interpretations
 abandon responsibility language without adopting the economic viewpoint.
 An instrumental citizenship interpretation expands philanthropy as a
 strategic lever for increasing corporate reputation and market
 opportunities while retaining managerial discretion. An ideal citizenship
 interpretation restates ethical responsibility into voluntarism language
 intended to influence managerial discretion concerning universal human
 rights. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2006.

Title: Towards a Socio-Cognitive Approach to Knowledge Transfer 
Abstract:
 Dominant research streams in the knowledge transfer field, such as the
 positivist and social constructionist approaches, largely assume that
 knowledge transfer is accomplished through instructions and/or socially
 constructed practices. Underlying these views is the belief that texts and
 practices carry with them the codes necessary for their own decoding and
 therefore enable an unproblematic knowledge transfer. In contrast, we
 argue that the decoding of information into meaningful knowledge is always
 mediated by people's private and cultural models, which are created from
 the unique combination of their cognitive dispositions (i.e. acumen,
 memory, creativity, volitions, emotions) and socio-cultural interaction.
 The degree to which people apply these models reflectively and/or
 categorically (i.e. automatically) depends on the need for cognition as
 well as environmental demands and feedback. Therefore, knowledge transfer
 is always tentative, because it depends on the application of private and
 cultural models along the continuum that goes from reflective to
 categorical processing. We present first a critique of the positivist and
 social constructionist positions; then we introduce a socio-cognitive
 model that captures and explicates socio-cognitive processes involved in
 sense making during knowledge transfer. Finally, we explore future
 research streams and managerial implications. Copyright (c) Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2008.

Title: Corporate Reputation and Social Performance: The Importance of Fit 
Abstract:
 Utilizing data on a sample of large firms, we estimate a model of
 corporate reputation. We find reputation, derived from the assessments of
 managers and market analysts, to be determined by a firm's social
 performance, financial performance, market risk, the extent of long-term
 institutional ownership, and the nature of its business activities.
 Furthermore, the reputational effect of social performance is found to
 vary both across sectors, and within sectors across the various types of
 social performance. Specifically, our results demonstrate the need to
 achieve a 'fit' among the types of corporate social performance undertaken
 and the firm's stakeholder environment. For example, a strong record of
 environmental performance may enhance or damage reputation depending on
 whether the firm's activities 'fit' with environmental concerns in the
 eyes of stakeholders. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2006.

Title: Conferences as Venues for the Configuration of Emerging Organizational Fields: The Case of Cochlear Implants 
Abstract:
 I examine how conferences can be occasions for the configuration of
 emerging organizational fields by describing three that I attended during
 the development and commercialization of cochlear implants. These
 conferences served as venues for a variety of activities to unfold,
 ranging from the exchange of information to the enactment of technological
 possibilities. A full appreciation of conferences as holistic events, I
 argue, offers us a particularly valuable entry point into gaining a deeper
 understanding of how new fields are assembled in real time. Copyright (c) Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2008.

Title: Global Standardization of Organizational Forms and Management Practices? What New Institutionalism and the Business-Systems Approach Can Learn from Each Other 
Abstract:
 The debate as to the effects of globalization on organizational forms and
 management practices is well known. Our paper focuses on two
 institutionalist traditions in organization theory which make a
 significant contribution to this discussion: new institutionalism and the
 business-systems approach. Both emphasize the adaptation of organizations
 to their institutional environments but come to very different conclusions
 as to the global standardization of organizational forms and management
 practices. Our paper aims to move them beyond the convergence-divergence
 dichotomy to account for signs of both global standardization and
 continued persistence of national differences. We do so by systematically
 comparing the two traditions, suggesting how they can be cross-fertilized
 and developing an agenda for future empirical research. We also highlight
 that they cannot learn from each other on the issue of agency and point to
 structuration theory as a way in which they can integrate agency into
 their accounts of the global standardization debate. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2006.

Title: The Development of Corporate Identity: A Political Perspective 
Abstract:
 A corporate identity denotes a set of attributes that senior managers
 ascribe to their organization. It is therefore an organizational identity
 articulated by a powerful interest group. It can constitute a claim which
 serves "inter alia" to justify the authority vested in top managers and to
 further their interests. The academic literature on organizational
 identity, and on corporate identity in particular, pays little attention
 to these political considerations. It focuses in an apolitical manner on
 shared meanings when corporate identity works, or on cognitive dissonance
 when it breaks down. In response to this analytical void, we develop a
 political analysis of corporate identity and its development, using as
 illustration a longitudinal study of successive changes in the corporate
 identity of a Brazilian telecommunications company. This suggests a
 cyclical model in which corporate identity definition and redefinition
 involve power relations, resource mobilization and struggles for
 legitimacy. Copyright (c) Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2007.

Title: Stewardship vs. Stagnation: An Empirical Comparison of Small Family and Non-Family Businesses 
Abstract:
 Two major perspectives can be construed in the literature concerning the
 nature of family owned businesses (FOBs). The first implies that these
 enterprises have unique characteristics of stewardship. FOB owners are
 said to care deeply about the long-term prospects of the business, in
 large part because their family's fortune, reputation and future are at
 stake. Their stewardship is said to be manifested by unusual devotion to
 the "continuity" of the company, by more assiduous nurturing of a
 "community" of employees, and by seeking out closer "connections" with
 customers to sustain the business. The second perspective is less
 flattering. It proposes that FOBs are unusually subject to stagnation:
 they are said to face unique resource restrictions, embrace conservative
 strategies, eschew growth, and be doomed to short lives. This paper
 develops and examines the merits of the two perspectives, neither of which
 has been systematically articulated or researched. It does so in an
 empirical study of only small firms that are owned and managed by their
 founder. Within this sample, it compares firms that are FOBs, that is,
 family owned and managed, with non-FOBs, that is, owned and managed by a
 founder with no other relative involved in the business. The findings show
 significant support for all three aspects of the stewardship perspective
 of FOBs, and no support for any elements of the stagnation perspective. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2007.

Title: Capabilities in Motion: New Organizational Forms and the Reshaping of the Hollywood Movie Industry 
Abstract:
 This paper looks at the evolution of capabilities in the Hollywood movie
 industry in the aftermath of the transition from a studio era dominated by
 integrated hierarchies to a post-studio era dominated by flexible hub
 organizations supplied by networks of resource providers. Adopting a
 dynamic capabilities perspective we argue that two industry capabilities -
 mobilizing and transforming capabilities - play a crucial role in
 assembling and transforming resource bundles into feature films. We
 further argue that the transition to new organizational forms shifts the
 co-evolutionary process, with practices and routines that make up
 mobilizing capabilities changing faster and becoming more important to box
 office success than practices and routines that make up transforming
 capabilities. We test our hypotheses using a sample of 400 films split
 between the studio and post-studio eras. The results support our
 hypotheses, pointing to the influence of centralized control versus
 dispersed access to resources. The strategy of integrated hierarchical
 organizations depends on ownership of resources that reduces incentives to
 develop mobilizing capabilities, and increases incentives to develop
 transforming capabilities. The advent of new organizational forms, by
 contrast, increases returns to new practices and routines that mobilize
 resources at the expense of returns on exploring practices and routines
 that make up transforming capabilities. Copyright 2003 Blackwell Publishing Ltd..

Title: The Impact of Managerial Environmental Perceptions on Corporate Entrepreneurship: Towards Understanding Discretionary Slack's Pivotal Role 
Abstract:
 This study seeks to further delineate how a firm's competitive environment
 influences the firm's pursuit of entrepreneurial activities. To do so, we
 develop and test a parsimonious model that establishes the role of
 discretionary slack as a salient mediating mechanism through which
 managerial environmental perceptions influence corporate entrepreneurship.
 In addition, we examine two contingencies that further explain
 discretionary slack's impact on corporate entrepreneurship, including
 managements' market sensing capacity and use of outcome-based incentives.
 Using single- and multi-source survey data from 495 small- to medium-sized
 firms, we find support for our model and its associated hypotheses.
 Specifically, we find that discretionary slack is significantly influenced
 by managerial perceptions of environmental munificence and dynamism and,
 in turn, mediates the impact of these perceptions on corporate
 entrepreneurship. In addition, we find that discretionary slack's impact
 on corporate entrepreneurship is significantly enhanced by managements'
 market sensing capacity but, interestingly, not by outcome-based
 incentives. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2007.

Title: Psychological Contract Breach in a Chinese Context: An Integrative Approach 
Abstract:
 This study examined the antecedents and outcomes of psychological contract
 breach as well as why and how psychological contract breach is related to
 these outcomes. Respondents were Hong Kong Chinese employees (N=152).
 Results showed organizational change and history of contract breach to be
 related to psychological contract breach which, in turn, was related to
 turnover intentions, psychological withdrawal behaviour, and civic virtue.
 Further, trust in employer fully mediated the relationship between
 psychological contract breach and the work outcomes of psychological
 withdrawal behaviour and civic virtue but partially mediated the
 psychological contract breach-turnover intentions relationship. Lastly,
 interactional justice failed to moderate the relationship between
 psychological contract breach and the work outcomes. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2003.

Title: The Impact of Organizational Culture and Reshaping Capabilities on Change Implementation Success: The Mediating Role of Readiness for Change 
Abstract:
 It was hypothesized that employees' perceptions of an organizational
 culture strong in human relations values and open systems values would be
 associated with heightened levels of readiness for change which, in turn,
 would be predictive of change implementation success. Similarly, it was
 predicted that reshaping capabilities would lead to change implementation
 success, via its effects on employees' perceptions of readiness for
 change. Using a temporal research design, these propositions were tested
 for 67 employees working in a state government department who were about
 to undergo the implementation of a new end-user computing system in their
 workplace. Change implementation success was operationalized as user
 satisfaction and system usage. There was evidence to suggest that
 employees who perceived strong human relations values in their division at
 Time 1 reported higher levels of readiness for change at
 pre-implementation which, in turn, predicted system usage at Time 2. In
 addition, readiness for change mediated the relationship between reshaping
 capabilities and system usage. Analyses also revealed that
 pre-implementation levels of readiness for change exerted a positive main
 effect on employees' satisfaction with the system's accuracy, user
 friendliness, and formatting functions at post-implementation. These
 findings are discussed in terms of their theoretical contribution to the
 readiness for change literature, and in relation to the practical
 importance of developing positive change attitudes among employees if
 change initiatives are to be successful. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005.

Title: The Saliency of Synecdoche: The Part and the Whole of Employment Relations 
Abstract:
 Literary and rhetorical tropes invoke a transference of meaning from the
 common usage of a word or phrase. Organizational analysis research and
 writing in this area has concentrated upon the trope of metaphor. In this
 article it is argued that we should extend our attention to other tropes.
 To that end, the article identifies and illustrates the saliency of the
 trope of synecdoche through a discussion of employment relations.
 Following a brief identification of metaphor within writings on employment
 relations, the article goes onto discuss synecdoche as one of the 'four
 master tropes'. We then argue that the trope is important in relation to
 how we write about and understand employment relations. Use of the trope
 is then illustrated through analysis of interview comments on local pay in
 the National Health Service. Finally, the saliency or prominence of
 synecdoche is argued through two related arguments, the nature of the
 rhetorical setting and the rhetorical nature of the employment relations
 setting. Copyright 2003 Blackwell Publishing Ltd..

Title: Cultural Readjustment After Crisis: Regulation and Learning from Crisis Within the UK Soccer Industry 
Abstract:
 Challenging Turner's (1976, 1978) implicit assumption that cultural
 readjustment typically follows a crisis, this paper examines the evolution
 of the regulation of safety management within the UK soccer industry since
 1946. Employing a longitudinal case study approach, the industry's
 response to four crises is examined. This study explores the industry's
 response to changes in the regulatory framework, through the lens of
 Gouldner's (1954) patterns of industrial bureaucracy and institutional
 theory. The persistence of indulgent and mock patterns of behaviour,
 following a series of disasters, challenges Turner's implicit assumption.
 Although a move towards a punitive approach to regulatory behaviour
 effected some changes, there was limited evidence of cultural readjustment
 due in part to a 'mindset of invulnerability' (Wicks, 2001). This included
 the fixed belief that hooligan behaviour was the primary problem facing
 the industry. Our findings suggest that more participative forms of
 regulation encourage more effective learning from crisis because they
 challenge core organizational and individual assumptions. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2006.

Title: Learning to Build a Car: An Empirical Investigation of Organizational Learning 
Abstract:
 This study provides a longitudinal empirical examination of the basic
 elements of Nonaka's (1994) dynamic theory of organizational knowledge
 creation. First, the data illustrate the notion that knowledge creation in
 organizations proceeds through an intertwined four-phase process: (1)
 "socialization" (tacit knowledge amplification); (2) "externalization"
 (tacit knowledge is transformed into explicit knowledge); (3)
 "combination" (explicit knowledge amplification); and (4)
 "internalization" (explicit knowledge is transformed into tacit
 knowledge). Second, the study extends Nonaka's theory by comparing the
 relative amount of intra-organizational knowledge transfer occurring
 during periods of product redesign with the amount of knowledge transfer
 occurring during steady-state periods. The "questionnaire" data suggest
 that the overall level of knowledge transfer is higher during periods of
 product redesign than it is during the steady state, whereas the
 "interview" data indicate that there were more mentions of knowledge
 transfer during the steady state. Third, the data suggest that there may
 be benefit in adding "tacit error correction" as a fifth phase in the
 learning cycle. This phase is characterized by a dual emphasis on
 externalization and internalization. Implications of these findings are
 discussed. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005.

Title: All in All, it's Just Another Plaque on the Wall: The Incidence and Impact of the Investors in People Standard 
Abstract:
 The Investors in People Standard was introduced in 1991 in order to
 provide a national benchmark of training and development activity. This
 article, using data from the 1998 Workplace Employee Relations Survey
 (Department for Trade and Industry, 1999), conducts five tests with regard
 to the incidence and impact of the Standard. The first test evaluates the
 types of workplace that have secured accreditation. The second and third
 tests compare the nature of training practice in accredited and
 non-accredited workplaces, based on data from the WERS 98 main management
 survey and also the survey of employees. The fourth test evaluates the
 proportion of workplaces that have secured accreditation, yet are failing
 to engage in good practice. The final test evaluates the characteristics
 of workplaces that fall into this latter category. The results demonstrate
 considerable variation between different types of workplace with regard to
 the likelihood of accreditation having been secured. They also demonstrate
 that, on average, training practice is better in accredited workplaces
 than in non-accredited workplaces, but a large minority of accredited
 workplaces are failing to engage in good practice. Among workplaces that
 have accreditation, smaller workplaces stand out in particular as failing
 to engage in good training practice. Copyright Blackwell Publishers Ltd 2003.

Title: Real Options, International Entry Mode Choice and Performance 
Abstract:
 Recent scholarship suggests that combining insights from real option
 theory with transaction cost economics may improve decision-making models.
 In response to this suggestion we develop and test a model of
 international entry mode choice that draws from both perspectives.
 Examining samples of Dutch and Greek firms entering Central and Eastern
 European markets, we found that adding real option variables to a
 transaction cost model significantly improved its explanatory power.
 Additionally, firms that used the combined real option/transaction cost
 predicted choices had significantly higher levels of subsidiary
 performance satisfaction than firms that did not. Our results suggest that
 effective managerial decision-making may involve more than mere
 transaction cost minimization considerations; real option value creation
 insights also appear to influence the success of decision outcomes. Copyright (c) Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2007.

Title: Knowledge Levels and their Transformation: Towards the Integration of Knowledge Creation and Individual Learning 
Abstract:
 This paper shows the link between knowledge creation and individual
 learning, and the coherence that exists between the knowledge creation
 view and single and double-loop learning models. It does so by examining
 differences in levels of knowledge and their relationship with creativity
 and knowledge creating behaviours. The analysis shifts the focus from the
 abstract notion of tacit knowledge to a more specific discussion on
 creative human cognition. The paper is unique in adopting an endogenous
 perspective to the analysis of individual learning. The analysis is
 distinct from previous discussions on knowledge creation in three ways:
 (a) explicit and tacit knowledge are analysed in terms of the nature and
 degree of inter-dependence that exists between the two; (b) knowledge
 levels are defined in terms of their applications rather than as abstract
 concepts; and (c) a distinction is made between shifts and movements in
 knowledge to separate, and subsequently integrate, the information
 processing and creative dimensions of learning. Further, the paper
 highlights specific challenges and limitations/costs that are associated
 with the transfer/acquisition of knowledge levels, and argues that in the
 absence of a conscious effort, knowledge levels are acquired through
 mistakes and failures. Following that, various theoretical and managerial
 implications to facilitate knowledge creation are discussed. Copyright 2003 Blackwell Publishing Ltd..

Title: Differentiating Good Soldiers from Good Actors 
Abstract:
 In a qualitative interview study, 20 Hong Kong Chinese informants were
 asked to report stories about colleagues who were either 'good soldiers'
 or 'good actors'. In stories about good soldiers, informants attributed
 their colleagues' organizational citizenship behaviour (OCB) primarily to
 prosocial or pro-organizational motives. Informants' stories about good
 actors broke down into three major subcategories of citizenship-related
 impression management: OCB attributed primarily to impression management
 motives; alleged pseudo-OCB concomitant with minimal compliance; and
 alleged pseudo-OCB concomitant with counterproductive behaviour. When
 distinguishing good soldiers from good actors, informants adopted two
 criteria for attribution: wilful behavioural inconsistency, i.e. low
 generality of behaviour across contexts; and alleged false pretence, i.e.
 discrepancy between claims or allusions and actual deeds. Our findings
 partially supported a prior hypothesis from attribution theory, that
 consistency was a criterion for attribution, but indicated that consensus,
 i.e. correspondence between the focal colleague's behaviour and other
 employees' behaviour, failed to differentiate good soldiers from good
 actors. Informants generally regarded OCB as socially desirable only when
 it was attributed primarily to prosocial/pro-organizational motives. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2007.

Title: Inter- and Intra-Organizational Knowledge Transfer: A Meta-Analytic Review and Assessment of its Antecedents and Consequences 
Abstract:
 Research on organizational knowledge transfer is burgeoning, and yet our
 understanding of its antecedents and consequences remains rather unclear.
 Although conceptual and qualitative reviews of the organizational
 knowledge transfer literature have emerged, no study has attempted to
 summarize previous quantitative empirical findings. As a first step
 towards that goal, we use meta-analytic techniques to examine how
 knowledge, organization and network level antecedents differentially
 impact organizational knowledge transfer. Additionally, we consolidate
 research on the relationship between knowledge transfer and its
 consequences. We also demonstrate how the intra- and inter-organizational
 context, the directionality of knowledge transfers, and measurement
 characteristics moderate the relationships studied. By aggregating and
 consolidating existing research, our study not only reveals new insights
 into the levers and outcomes of organizational knowledge transfer, but
 also provides meaningful directions for future research. Copyright (c) Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2008.

Title: Contract Law and the Governance of Inter-Firm Technology Partnerships - An Analysis of Different Modes of Partnering and Their Contractual Implications 
Abstract:
 This paper studies some major legal implications of inter-firm technology
 partnering through equity joint ventures, non-equity partnerships, and
 licensing contracts. These different partnerships are placed within the
 classical and relational contracting perspectives, while also considering
 intellectual property rights issues. Samples of contracts of partnerships
 in bioscience, fine chemicals, biotechnology and biopharmaceuticals are
 analysed, in detail, with reference to the distribution of property
 rights, major contractual clauses, and measures for conflict resolution.
 Equity joint ventures and non-equity partnerships are found to largely
 follow a relational contracting perspective, while licensing contracts are
 governed by a classical contracting perspective. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2007.

Title: The Lack of Impact of Dissensus Inspired Analysis on Developments in the Field of Human Resource Management 
Abstract:
 Mainstream HRM journals have largely ignored critical perspectives on HRM.
 This is the main finding from our study examining trends in publishing on
 HRM through an analysis of published work in the period 1995 to 2000.
 Using the 'dissensus-consensus' dimension of a framework developed by
 Deetz (1996) we examine the role of academic journals in constructing HRM
 knowledge in what turns out to be largely consensus oriented ways. We
 survey HRM articles in nine journals over a six year period, and conclude
 that HRM is primarily constituted from a consensus perspective in the
 mainstream HRM journals while European based general management and
 organization theory journals construct HRM in both dissensus and consensus
 oriented ways. We propose reasons why the critical debates in HRM have
 largely been ignored in the mainstream journals as well as what this might
 mean for HRM theory and practice given the lack of critical and dissenting
 voices so evident in leading HRM journals. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2006.

Title: POLITICIZED MANAGERIAL CAPITALISM: ENTERPRISE STRUCTURES IN POST-SOCIALIST CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPE 
Abstract:
 The paper contributes to the sociological tradition of comparative
 institutional analysis. It argues that a distinctive form of capitalism is
 emerging in post 1989 Central and Eastern Europe, politicized managerial
 capitalism. This is a bifurcated system, one sub-system internationally
 oriented, a still peripheral but increasingly integrated part of global
 capitalism, and a second sub-system, more nationally oriented, dominated
 by managerial élites allied with weak states. Politicized managerial
 capitalism is founded upon the inherited practices of late Socialism,
 moulded by the post Socialist development process and congruent with the
 stage of development of capital, labour and product markets. It is unclear
 as to whether this is a transient or long-term structure. Copyright 2002 Blackwell Publishers Ltd..

 influential board members. By contrast, in a survey of all the board
 members in 14 companies we found that ties to others in a network of
 strong ties among those who meet outside of board meetings were more
 important predictors of social influence than human capital or ties across
 boards. These ties within the board represent the social capital of
 members in the form of prior relationships with other directors, ties to
 others on the board, and membership in cliques within the board's network
 of ties. These results support a social capital perspective on influence
 that emphasizes relationships with others on the board as important
 factors in the social dynamics of board decision-making. Copyright (c) Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2008.

Title: The False Promise of Organizational Culture Change: A Case Study of Middle Managers in Grocery Retailing 
Abstract:
 The strategic importance of managing organizational culture has been a
 central theme in organizational literature over the past two decades. But
 relatively little attention has been given to the impact of culture change
 initiatives on managers. This paper reports on the impact of a programme
 of culture change on managers at one of Britain's leading grocery retail
 chains. Based on a series of detailed interviews with managers together
 with examination of company documents and an understanding of trends in
 grocery retailing, we explain the purpose and content of change, and
 document and analyse the reactions of those managers who are expected to
 change their own cultural orientations as well as persuade their
 subordinates to change. We conclude that in this case at least changes in
 managerial behaviour, as with previously documented changes in the
 behaviour of shopfloor workers, are related more to surveillance, direct
 control and the threat of sanction than any transformation of managerial
 values. Indeed, the situation and experiences of managers - one of reduced
 autonomy, close monitoring and control, and perceived career insecurity -
 are explained less in relation to 'organizational culture', more in
 relation to organizational (re-)structuring intended to create a more
 centralized form of organizational control. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2003.

Title: Resources, Capabilities and Entrepreneurial Perceptions 
Abstract:
 We review and develop a subjectivist theory of entrepreneurship that
 focuses on individuals, their knowledge, resources and skills, and the
 processes of discovery and creativity, which constitute the heart of
 entrepreneurship. First, we establish the fundamental importance of
 subjectivity in entrepreneurial discovery and creativity. Second, we build
 on Penrose (1959) to elaborate how entrepreneurs' perceptions and personal
 knowledge shape a firm's "subjective productive opportunity set". Third,
 we explain that entrepreneurial perceptions and knowledge partly originate
 from entrepreneurs' experiences in specific business settings such as the
 firm, the management team, and the industry. Fourth, we highlight the
 causal connections between subjectivity in entrepreneurship and observed
 heterogeneity in firm-level economic performance. Lastly, we suggest
 directions for further advancing a subjectivist resource-based approach to
 future entrepreneurship research. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2007.

Title: Building External Corporate Venturing Capability 
Abstract:
 How firms build new capabilities to adapt to changing environments is at
 the core of strategic management. However, research has addressed this
 question only recently. In this paper, I propose a model that describes
 how firms develop a capability to create and develop ventures through
 corporate venture capital, alliances, and acquisitions. The model is based
 on two longitudinal case studies of large corporations operating in the
 information and communication technology sector in Europe. At the core of
 this model are learning processes that enable the firm to build up an
 external corporate venturing capability, by utilizing learning strategies
 both within and outside venturing relationships. To build this new
 capability, firms engage in acquisitive learning. Critical to deepening
 the capability acquired is adaptation of all knowledge to the firm
 specific context through experiential learning mechanisms. I also discuss
 the important role that initial conditions and knowledge management
 practices play in determining the direction and effectiveness of specific
 learning processes that lead to an external corporate venturing
 capability. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2004.

Title: Inter-Organizational Knowledge Transfer: Current Themes and Future Prospects 
Abstract:
 Many papers have been published recently in the fields of strategy and
 international business research incorporating the role of organizational
 knowledge as a basis of firm competitive advantage. While such knowledge
 is normally developed within the firm, it is important that firms possess
 the ability to learn from others in order to meet the increasing pace of
 competition. Knowledge transfer, defined here as an event through which
 one organization learns from the experience of another, has thus become an
 important research area within the broader domain of organizational
 learning and knowledge management. This paper presents a theoretical
 framework, identifies key themes covered by the six articles included in
 the Special Issue on Inter-Organizational Knowledge Transfer, and then
 discusses priorities for future research. Copyright (c) Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2008.

Title: Finding a Working Balance Between Competitive and Communal Strategies 
Abstract:
  This paper presents a dynamic framework that describes how firms allocate
 limited resources between improving their competitive position relative to
 rivals and their communal position shared with rivals. This dynamic
 framework outlines how organizational field-level dynamics influence
 industry attractiveness and thereby alter a firm's incentive to engage in
 communal strategy relative to competitive strategy. Communal strategy, in
 turn, can influence the institutions governing an organizational field and
 thereby shape industry attractiveness. Overall, the interplay between
 factors exogenous and endogenous to an industry cause change in an
 organizational field and so determine the nature of the communal
 environment shared by a firm and its rivals over time. Analysis of this
 interplay provides insight into the micro-level drivers of macro-level
 change and furthers understanding of the conditions under which rivalrous
 firms voluntarily contribute to collective betterment of their industry
 despite collective rationality. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2006.

Title: Being Taken Over: Managers' Emotions and Rationalizations During a Company Takeover 
Abstract:
 The theme of this paper is the relationship between emotion, management
 and organization, specifically, how emotions are transformed by
 rationalizations, and vice versa. It is argued that managers' tendency to
 rationalize emotion creates additional "emotional" dynamics, and that
 these provide opportunities for organizing reflection. This idea also
 points to a limitation of approaches that are concerned with how emotions
 can be managed through emotional intelligence. The study took place during
 a turbulent period in the history of a company, while it was being taken
 over. Managers in Hyder plc, formerly the largest stock market listed
 corporation in Wales, UK, carried a tension into their work roles. This
 was created from particular emotions (pain and shame) and their
 rationalizations of, or detachment from, these emotions (self-interest and
 disinterest). Such tension was a necessary part of maintaining their
 managerial role under difficult and emotionally charged circumstances. The
 study also showed how fears about personal position undermined the ability
 of managers to enact their authority and to act collectively within the
 organization. The conclusion discusses the relationship between collective
 emotional dynamics (political relatedness) and the organization of
 reflection, as well as providing questions for further research. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2006.

Title: Reflecting on Reflexivity: Reflexive Textual Practices in Organization and Management Theory 
Abstract:
 This paper identifies four sets of textual practices that researchers in
 the field of organization and management theory (OMT) have used in their
 attempts to be reflexive. We characterize them as multi-perspective,
 multi-voicing, positioning and destabilizing. We show how each set of
 practices can help to produce reflexive research, but also how each
 embodies limitations and paradoxes. Finally, we consider the interplay
 among these sets of practices to develop ideas for new avenues for
 reflexive practice by OMT researchers. Copyright (c) Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2008.

Title: 'We Are All Customers Now&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;.' Rhetorical Strategy and Ideological Control in Marketing Management Texts 
Abstract:
 This paper critically appraises the rhetoric of marketing management
 texts. Its interpretive frame is informed respectively by critical
 management and discourse analytic theoretical traditions. Its main data
 set is drawn from popular textbooks written for taught university courses
 but it also draws attention to similar rhetorical strategies in leading
 academic marketing journals. In addition, parallels are drawn with other
 popular management and consulting fields. In this way the paper attempts
 to mark out an initial topology of the ideological influence that is
 enabled and mobilized by marketing's rhetorical strategies. Marketing
 rhetoric often escapes critical attention precisely because it is
 platitudinous. Marketing management axioms have become slogans and the
 slogans have become clichés regularly employed in organizational,
 educational and political settings. But the prevalence of platitudinous
 rhetoric in management consulting schemes does not necessarily hinder
 their popularity or inhibit the deployment of their rhetorical/ideological
 strategies in other settings. Popular marketing management rhetoric is a
 special case because it positions itself not only as a prescriptive
 management-consulting framework but also as a legitimate academic field.
 It is in the latter guise that the success of managerial marketing's
 rhetorical/ideological strategies has proved most striking. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2003.

Title: Strategic Choice and Performance in Late Movers: Influence of the Top Management Team's External Ties 
Abstract:
 This work examines how the strategic choice and performance of late movers
 are influenced by the top management team's external ties, inside and
 outside the firm's industry. Using a multiyear sample of firms from the
 computer industry, we found that intra-industry trade-association ties of
 top managers led to the adoption of a resource-imitation strategy by late
 movers while extra-industry importation and professional-association ties
 led to the adoption of a resource-substitution strategy. We also found
 that trade association ties had a negative effect on the performance of
 late movers using resource-substitution, while top managers' service on
 other firms' boards had a positive influence on the performance of those
 firms. Our findings not only confirm the importance of the role of fit in
 strategy and performance, but they also highlight the importance of the
 management and control of boundary-spanning activities. Copyright (c) Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2008.

Title: Is a Long-term Business Relationship an Implied Contract? Two Views of Relationship Disengagement 
Abstract:
 Current knowledge of business-to-business relationship dissolution centres
 upon definitions of relationship dissolution, models of dissolution,
 antecedents for dissolution, and dissolution strategies. In this paper an
 empirical case example of a terminated business relationship in the
 aftermath stage of the dissolution process is presented. William Baird
 sued Marks and Spencer for &pound;53.6&thinsp;m for breach of contract.
 The relationship between the actors was long-term, exclusive, and involved
 substantial investment in specific assets. There was no written contract
 in place, yet one actor considered that the relationship was equal to an
 implied contract. The contribution of the paper is to discuss the
 possibility for legal redress using the transaction cost economics,
 relational contracting, and industrial networks literatures. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2004.

Title: Board Characteristics and Involvement in Strategic Decision Making: Evidence from Swiss Companies 
Abstract:
 Boards of directors have a number of roles. The board's monitoring
 function has been the subject of much work. Less examined is the role that
 the board has in setting company strategy. This paper uses agency and
 network perspectives in developing and testing the relationship between
 board characteristics and involvement in strategic decision making. Using
 primary and secondary data, our results suggest that the level of board
 involvement in strategic decision making is related to a number of
 governance variables. We demonstrate that involvement is generally lower
 where boards are highly interlocked. We also show that certain types of
 board interlocks - namely horizontal (same industry) and those involving
 direct links with the banking sector - are particularly associated with
 this negative effect. There is weaker evidence that board strategic
 involvement is lower where the roles of company chief executive and chair
 are combined. We find no evidence that factors such as board size, or the
 percentage of outside directors per se are related to board involvement in
 strategic decision making. In doing so, this paper adds to the growing
 literature synthesizing the structural features and processes of boards. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2006.

Title: Alliance Dynamics for Entrepreneurial Firms 
Abstract:
 Small firms are thought to encounter various difficulties implementing
 strategic alliances. Due to these problems, they may be less able to reap
 the benefits of alliance adaptation, and the changes that do occur in
 alliances may not coincide with a small firm's interests. The evidence we
 present on contractual renegotiations in alliances suggests that small
 firms are no more or less likely to adjust their alliances' contracts in
 general. However, small firms tend to bear inefficiencies of two kinds in
 their collaborations. First, they are less likely to adapt alliances in
 the presence of governance misalignments. Second, our sampled small firms
 were more prone to make transaction-specific investments, which can
 stimulate "ex post "hold-up in the form of contractual renegotiations. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2008.

Title: Changing Vertical Integration Strategies under Pressure from Foreign Competition: The Case of US and German Multinationals 
Abstract:
 This study contributes to the emerging body of research into the influence
 of foreign competition on firm scope. Industrial organization economics,
 the resource-based view of the firm, and transaction cost economics
 consistently predict vertical de-integration in the face of intensifying
 pressure from imports and foreign direct investment. We show this was the
 case for 407 US firms between 1987 and 2003. Results for a panel of 95
 German firms reveal a similar reaction to pressure from an increase in
 imports, but show no reaction to increased exposure to incoming foreign
 direct investment during the same time frame. Copyright (c) Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2008.

Title: Minority Employees Engaging with (Diversity) Management: An Analysis of Control, Agency, and Micro-Emancipation 
Abstract:
 This study analyses how minority employees engage with control in
 organizations. Differently from most critical studies of diversity
 management, which focus on how minority employees are discursively
 controlled, we approach (diversity) management as a constellation of both
 identity-regulating discourses and bureaucratic controls. We assume that
 minority employees are agents who actively resist and/or comply with the
 constellation of controls they are subject to. Based on qualitative data
 collected in a technical drawing company and a hospital, the specific
 constellation of controls in each organization is first reconstructed.
 Four interviews with minority employees are then analysed in depth,
 showing how their engagement with material and discursive controls creates
 both constraints and possibilities of micro-emancipation. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2007.

Title: Sensemaking and the Distortion of Critical Upward Communication in Organizations 
Abstract:
 Most research into feedback has focused on communication from managers to
 non-managerial staff. To a lesser extent, it has more recently addressed
 upward and 360 degree appraisal systems. In contrast, the role of informal
 upward communication continues to be largely neglected, especially when it
 concerns the transmission of opinions critical of managerial orthodoxy.
 There has been little examination of the sensemaking heuristics employed
 by both managers and non-managerial staff that stimulates the former to
 disregard much of the already muted critical upward communication they
 receive, and the latter to suppress its transmission in the first place.
 We therefore suggest that managers often over commit to particular courses
 of action, irrespective of whether they bode ill or well for the
 organization concerned. In so doing, they frequently demonize those who
 belong to stigmatized outgroups or who hold contrary value systems. We
 argue that the consequent elimination of critical upward communication
 (CUC) leads to iatrogenic phenomena - i.e. organizational problems that
 are derived from the treatment regime that has been prescribed, rather
 than from a pre-existing condition. Implications for practice and further
 research are considered. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2006.

Title: Aspiring for, and Achieving Growth: The Moderating Role of Resources and Opportunities 
Abstract:
 In this article, we use the theory of planned behaviour to develop a model
 of small business managers' growth aspirations and the level of growth
 achieved. We empirically test this model on a large longitudinal data set
 of small firms using hierarchical regression. Consistent with previous
 findings and others' assumptions, we find that small business managers'
 aspirations to expand their business activities are positively related to
 actual growth. However, the relationship between aspirations and growth
 appears more complex than stated. It depends on the level of education and
 experience of the small business manager as well as the dynamism of the
 environment in which the business(es) operates. Education, experience and
 environmental dynamism magnify the effect that one's growth aspirations
 have on the realization of growth. Copyright 2003 Blackwell Publishing Ltd..

Title: Rethinking the Business School 
Abstract:
 It is ironic that at a moment in history when the business school seems to
 be enjoying unparalleled success, the role of the business school is being
 increasingly questioned by some of its leading professors. We examine the
 debate about the business school and its evolution. While sympathetic to
 the criticisms levied against the business school we nevertheless suggest
 a positive future if the business school can build upon its potentially
 unique position as knowledge space. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2004.

Title: Heterogeneity and Specificity of Inter-Firm Knowledge Flows in Innovation Networks 
Abstract:
 Literature on innovation networks reveals little of to what extent
 different types of knowledge are exchanged and combined by collaborating
 firms to foster innovation. Based on field research in the aerospace
 industrial cluster of Rome, this study investigates the exchange of
 technological, market and managerial knowledge. Using social network
 analysis, the paper shows that the three types of knowledge are unevenly
 distributed and exchanged, thus revealing that the process of exchange is
 knowledge-specific. Further, it is found that in most collaborative
 relationships, partners exchange technological knowledge together with
 market and managerial knowledge, emphasizing the complex nature of the
 innovation process which requires access to and recombination of diverse
 knowledge. This phenomenon concerns not only large companies, but also
 small-to-medium enterprises. The reconsideration of the relative salience
 of the three types of knowledge has remarkable managerial and theoretical
 implications, which are developed in terms of propositions offered for
 further research. Copyright (c) Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2008.

Title: The Role of Networks In the Diffusion of Technological Innovation 
Abstract:
 This research considers the diffusion of computer-aided production
 management (CAPM) technology in the UK manufacturing sector during the mid
 to late 1980s, focusing on the role of inter-organizational networks in
 the diffusion process. Research on innovation diffusion has tended to
 adopt a 'pro-innovation bias' such that adoption of prescribed best
 practice technologies is always considered to be the best policy. In the
 UK, one particular form of CAPM (MRP/MRPII) has been heavily promoted by
 technology suppliers as best practice. However, the notion of 'best
 practice' de-emphasizes the importance of decisions about technology
 design when users attempt to develop firm-specific solutions. Crucial to
 these decisions are the inter-organizational networks through which
 potential adopters learn about relevant technologies. Using three case
 companies, where the introduction of CAPM occurred at approximately the
 same time, decisions regarding adoption, design and subsequent
 implementation, are explored in order to establish the influence of
 inter-organizational networks on the diffusion and subsequent
 appropriation of CAPM technologies. These cases revealed that potential
 adopters engaged in a range of inter-organizational networks through which
 they learned about new technologies. However, the knowledge diffused
 through many of these networks was shaped by technology suppliers who were
 promoting similar ideas about best practice. Thus, while involvement in
 inter-organizational networks gave potential adopters access to
 information about new technology, this information tended to reinforce
 supplier images of best practice and did not always lead these firms to
 develop appropriate technological solutions. Problematic relationships
 between the suppliers of the technology and the users was seen here to
 limit the redesign and further diffusion of CAPM. Copyright 1996 Basil Blackwell Ltd.

Title: Resourceful Sensemaking in an Administrative Group 
Abstract:
 In this study, we present the concept of resourceful sensemaking as an
 extension of Weick's sensemaking theory. Resourceful sensemaking extends
 Weick's theory by carefully examining the influence of the lifeworld on
 organizational sensemaking practices. Lifeworld factors that affect
 organizational sensemaking are brought out in a dialectical method wherein
 a working definition of the resourceful sensemaking concept is compared
 with the sensemaking practices of an administrative group. We then show
 how this dialectical method can help develop a more robust formulation of
 the resourceful sensemaking concept. The paper ends by discussing the
 strengths and shortcomings of the concept and suggesting directions for
 future organizational sensemaking research. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2004.

Title: Conceptualizing Employee Silence and Employee Voice as Multidimensional Constructs 
Abstract:
 Employees often have ideas, information, and opinions for constructive
 ways to improve work and work organizations. Sometimes these employees
 exercise voice and express their ideas, information, and opinions; and
 other times they engage in silence and withhold their ideas, information,
 and opinions. On the surface, expressing and withholding behaviours might
 appear to be polar opposites because silence implies not speaking while
 voice implies speaking up on important issues and problems in
 organizations. Challenging this simplistic notion, this paper presents a
 conceptual framework suggesting that employee silence and voice are best
 conceptualized as separate, multidimensional constructs. Based on employee
 motives, we differentiate three types of silence (Acquiescent Silence,
 Defensive Silence, and ProSocial Silence) and three parallel types of
 voice (Acquiescent Voice, Defensive Voice, and ProSocial Voice) where
 withholding important information is not simply the absence of voice.
 Building on this conceptual framework, we further propose that silence and
 voice have differential consequences to employees in work organizations.
 Based on fundamental differences in the overt behavioural cues provided by
 silence and voice, we present a series of propositions predicting that
 silence is more ambiguous than voice, observers are more likely to
 misattribute employee motives for silence than for voice, and
 misattributions for motives behind silence will lead to more incongruent
 consequences (both positive and negative) for employees (than for voice).
 We conclude by discussing implications for future research and for
 managers. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2003.

Title: Corporate Social Responsibility in Management Research: Focus, Nature, Salience and Sources of Influence 
Abstract:
 In this paper we investigate the status of corporate social responsibility
 (CSR) research within the management literature. In particular, we examine
 the focus and nature of knowledge, the changing salience of this knowledge
 and the academic influences on the knowledge. We present empirical
 evidence based on publication and citation analyses of research published
 from 1992 to 2002. Our results demonstrate that, for CSR research
 published in management journals, the most popular issues investigated
 have been environmental and ethics; the empirical research has been
 overwhelmingly of a quantitative nature; the theoretical research has been
 primarily non-normative; the field is driven by agendas in the business
 environment as well as by continuing scientific engagement; and the single
 most important source of references for CSR articles was the management
 literature itself. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2006.

Title: Service Climate in Self-Managing Teams: Mapping the Linkage of Team Member Perceptions and Service Performance Outcomes in a Business-to-Business Setting 
Abstract:
 Drawing from the organizational behaviour and services marketing
 literature, we develop a conceptual model of self-managing team (SMT)
 service climate, taking into account characteristics of the organizational
 context, the SMT, and the individual employee. In order to assess the
 impact of SMT service climate, we include a number of internal
 consequences (i.e., in-company performance data) and external service
 performance outcomes (i.e., customer-perceived service quality). As a
 result of the hierarchically nested data-structure (i.e., groups and
 individuals), we investigate the antecedents of SMT service climate in
 service groups using a multi-level approach. Our results reveal that
 organizational and group factors have a significant cross-level influence
 on individual employee perceptions of SMT service climate. Furthermore, we
 demonstrate that employee perceptions of SMT service climate are

Title: On the Review Process and Journal Development 
Abstract:
 This paper describes the editorial and review process currently operating
 at "JMS" and offers the Editors' perspective on the journal's growth over
 the past three years. We first outline what we think is the essence of a
 "JMS" article. Then, we describe the review process from the editor's
 initial decision, to the reviewers' comments, to the editor's final
 editorial decisions, and including the process of accepting a paper. We
 suggest four main reasons for rejecting a paper: lack of contribution,
 failure to develop a theoretical contribution, fatal flaws in methods and
 deficiencies in analysis. With respect to the journal's progress, we show
 that "JMS" has significantly increased its position in the ISI rankings to
 19th and its impact factor to 1.180. In addition, the journal experienced
 a 222 per cent increase in submissions from 2003 to 2005. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2006.

Title: Encouraging Best Practice in Quantitative Management Research: An Incomplete List of Opportunities 
Abstract:
  The paper identifies some common problems encountered in quantitative
 methodology and provides information on current best practice to resolve
 these problems. We first discuss issues pertaining to variable measurement
 and concerns regarding the underlying relationships among variables. We
 then highlight several advances in estimation methodology that may
 circumvent issues encountered in common practice. Finally, we discuss
 approaches that move beyond existing research designs, including the
 development and use of datasets that embody linkages across levels of
 analysis, or combine qualitative and quantitative methods. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2006.

Title: The Structure and Management of Alliances: Syndication in the Venture Capital Industry 
Abstract:
 Syndicates are a form of inter-firm alliance in which two or more venture
 capital firms co-invest in an investee firm and share a joint pay-off.
 Syndication is a significant part of the venture capital market yet little
 research has been conducted into the process of structuring syndicate
 deals and the management of syndicates following deal completion. This
 paper analyses the neglected issues concerning the structuring and
 management of syndicated venture capital investments from the perspectives
 of both lead and non-lead syndicate members using two surveys of venture
 capital firms and examination of syndication documents. Lead investors
 typically have larger equity stakes and the syndicated investment
 agreement is a document that enshrines the rights of participants rather
 than specifying behaviour. Contractual arrangements typically serve as a
 back drop to relationships as non-legal sanctions are important and
 decisions are typically reached following discussion and consensus, but
 lead venture capital investors' residual and specific powers are important
 in ensuring timely decision-making. The findings extend previous work on
 alliances by emphasizing the importance of non-legal sanctions, especially
 reputation effects, in mitigating opportunistic behaviour by dominant
 equity holders. The paper also adds to the limited research on the
 dynamics of alliances by highlighting the role of repeat syndicates. Copyright 2003 Blackwell Publishing Ltd..

Title: Imbrication of Representations: Risk and Digital Technologies 
Abstract:
 Though emerging from different venues and backgrounds, risk management and
 digital applications are both based on sophisticated techniques of
 representation. This paper tracks the multiple overlappings and
 convergence between these two streams of representations. Initially
 digital technologies play a background role, as a tool to execute the
 algorithms of risk calculus. Then, they are useful in managing surveys and
 data analysis for those areas where risk management needs to store data
 on, for example, accidents. With the extension of markets for trading
 risk, computers and networks (or Information and Communication
 Technologies, ICT) become the tools of choice to allow the efficient
 functioning of industries like insurance. In other industries, like
 banking, where 'the business' is a vast archipelago of applications
 running on systems and networks, it is apparent that these integrated
 systems are inherently exposed to risk. Hence, these humble tools become
 both the infrastructure of the risk industry, and also the source of new,
 often incalculable risks; they move from a clear-cut subordinate
 relationship (as tool) to that of "imbrication". Risk representations
 become more calculable and formalized, but this is obtained at the price
 of an incalculability of the risks of the infrastructure itself. The
 analysis of the multiple patterns of imbrication of representations
 between risk and digital technologies is applied to a range of empirical
 domains: from software engineering and information systems (the
 subservient infrastructure); to operational risk in banking; and finally
 to the future scenario of the democratization of finance, whereby Global
 Risk Information Databases (GRIDs), become gigantic machines to represent,
 compute, and trade all sorts of individual and social risks.-super-[1]
 Overall, the paper seeks to characterize the multiple links between risk
 and digital technologies in organizations and draws in part on the
 phenomenology of representation and Heidegger's studies of Care and
 Concern and his later work on the essence of modern technology. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2006.

Title: Market Orientation, Generative Learning, Innovation Strategy and Business Performance Inter-Relationships in Bioscience Firms 
Abstract:
 We propose conceptual arguments to establish relationships between market
 orientation and generative learning and their respective impact on
 exploitative innovation strategy and explorative innovation strategy. We
 then consider the ambidextrous association between both forms of
 innovation strategy and business performance. This model is subject to an
 empirical test using data generated from 160 bioscience firms. Using
 structural equation modelling, two mutually exclusive paths are specified
 where market orientation leads to exploitative innovation strategy, while
 generative learning leads to explorative innovation strategy. We then find
 that the ambidexterity exhibited by firms in the form of exploitative
 innovation strategy and explorative innovation strategy significantly
 explains improvements in firms' business performance. Discussion is given
 to these findings and managerial implications are presented along with
 avenues for further research. Copyright (c) Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2008.

Title: Health in Organization: Towards a Process-Based View 
Abstract:
 This paper reports on a collaborative project involving organization
 scholars and clinicians to examine the ways in which individual and
 organizational health are conceptualized in the literature. We illustrate
 how the use of systems theories (in this case complexity theory) in
 relation to organizational health introduces problems such as the risk of
 promoting organizational health at the expense of individual well-being.
 The phenomena of organizational health and individual health are often
 presented as having a symbiotic relationship and we suggest some
 circumstances where this is not the case. Our central argument is that we
 need to move beyond current conceptual limitations and move towards a more
 process-based model of health in organization rather than organizational
 health. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2007.

Title: 'A Land of Milk and Honey'? Reengineering the 'Past' and 'Present' in a Call Centre 
Abstract:
 This article explores how managers, in the Call Centre of a Bank,
 (re)defined, and drew boundaries around 'past' cultural conditions, in
 relation to the introduction of a Business Process Reengineering (BPR)
 regime. Managers represented the 'past' negatively, in terms of conflict
 and coercion, whilst the 'present' was largely described as a Shangri-La
 of teams and consensus. This eschewing of the 'past' and sublimation of
 the 'present' stood in opposition to the representations of the staff.
 Both the 'staff' and 'managers' seemed to reject or embrace discourses
 that challenged or coincided with their understanding of how things are or
 should be. In view of this, their understanding of the past/present is
 inseparable from a consideration of power and identity. The article
 examines the interplay between discourses and individuals, arguing that it
 is bound up with fear and anxiety, hope and aspiration, memory and
 nostalgia, among other, everyday life experiences. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2004.

Title: Do Foreign Greenfields Outperform Foreign Acquisitions or Vice Versa? An Institutional Perspective 
Abstract:
 Prior studies of the comparative performance of greenfields and
 acquisitions have advanced competing arguments, with some arguing that
 greenfields should outperform acquisitions because acquisitions are
 costlier to integrate, and others that acquisitions should outperform
 greenfields because greenfields suffer from a liability of newness.
 Moreover, while the costs of integration and the liability of newness are
 at their greatest during a subsidiary's first years, prior studies have
 tested their competing arguments on samples containing older subsidiaries.
 We extend these prior studies by (1) developing an institutional
 theory-based framework that simultaneously considers the costs of
 integration and the liability of newness, (2) recognizing that both types
 of costs vary with the level of subsidiary integration, and (3) focusing
 on the stage of their life during which subsidiaries predominantly incur
 these costs. To measure subsidiary performance, we ask managers of Dutch
 multinationals how their "ex ante" performance expectations compare to the
 subsidiary's "ex post" performance during its first two years. Analysing a
 sample of 191 foreign subsidiaries and controlling for entry mode
 self-selection and other factors, we find that acquisitions outperform
 greenfields at low and intermediate levels of subsidiary integration, but
 that greenfields outperform acquisitions at higher integration levels. Copyright (c) Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2008.

Title: Towards A Critique of Managerialism: the Contribution of Simone Weil 
Abstract:
 This paper seeks to make a contribution to the critical literature on
 management and, more particularly, to the critique of managerialism. This
 is achieved via a consideration of the hitherto neglected writing of
 Simone Weil (1909-43) on management, work and organizations. Following an
 introduction to this work, attention is focused on Weil's notion of
 oppression, and detailed consideration is given to the conceptualization
 of management as a form of oppression. the bulk of the paper elaborates
 the significance of Weil's work for the critique of contemporary forms of
 managerialism. In particular, the development of new forms of managerial
 expertise, and the phenomenon of self-management, are analysed as forms of
 oppression. It is suggested that Weil offers the basis of a non-relativist
 post-Marxist form of ethically grounded critique in the field of
 management studies. Copyright 1996 Basil Blackwell Ltd.

Title: Resources, Knowledge and Influence: The Organizational Effects of Interorganizational Collaboration 
Abstract:
 Inter-organizational collaboration has been linked to a range of important
 outcomes for collaborating organizations. The strategy literature
 emphasizes the way in which collaboration between organizations results in
 the sharing of critical resources and facilitates knowledge transfer. The
 learning literature argues that collaboration not only transfers existing
 knowledge among organizations, but also facilitates the creation of new
 knowledge and produce synergistic solutions. Finally, research on networks
 and interorganizational politics suggests that collaboration can help
 organizations achieve a more central and influential position in relation
 to other organizations. While these effects have been identified and
 discussed at some length, little attention has been paid to the
 relationship between them and the nature of the collaborations that
 produce them. In this paper, we present the results of a qualitative study
 that examines the relationship between the effects of interorganizational
 collaboration and the nature of the collaborations that produce them.
 Based on our study of the collaborative activities of a small,
 nongovernmental organization (NGO) in Palestine over a four-year period,
 we argue that two dimensions of collaboration - embeddedness and
 involvement - determine the potential of a collaboration to produce one or
 more of these effects. Copyright 2003 Blackwell Science Asia Pty. Ltd..

Title: Internal Knowledge Development and External Knowledge Access in Venture Capital Investment Performance 
Abstract:
 We examine the performance effects of two knowledge-driven strategies -
 internal knowledge development and external knowledge access through
 inter-firm relationships - in the context of venture capital investing.
 Using longitudinal data on the investments, syndication, and performance
 of 200 US-based venture capital firms, we find that investing in
 industries in which a firm has more knowledge and investing with more or
 familiar external partners enhances investment performance. In addition,
 we reveal important interactions between the two strategies, such that
 access to external knowledge is particularly beneficial when the
 investment exposes gaps in the firm's own expertise. Thus, access to
 external knowledge is more effective when an incongruity exists between
 what the firm knows and what it intends to do. We discuss the study's
 implications for organizational knowledge and learning, strategic
 alliance, and venture capital literature. Copyright (c) Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2007.

Title: Political Interests and the Emergence of Commercial Banking in Transition Economies 
Abstract:
 This paper examines how interactions between government agencies and
 banking organizations led to the emergence of commercial banking in the
 Czech Republic and Hungary during the 1990s. We rely on interviews with
 bank managers at six large banks, government officers, and experts at
 other organizations to learn how actions based on different political
 ideologies shaped the banking field. We integrate prior research on
 institutional change, political interest, and transition economies to
 describe the emergence of commercial banking. Three important problems
 characterized commercial banking in the two countries: the disposal of bad
 loans, the privatization of banks, and the establishment of banking
 services. We argue that the solutions to these problems based on the
 changing political interests of organizational actors and regulators

Title: The Contestation of Archetypes: Negotiating Scripts in a UK Hospital Trust Board 
Abstract:
 This paper deals with the aftermath of the creation of a new governance
 structure in the UK National Health Service. We conceptualize this new
 governance structure as a 'Trust Hospital Archetype' in order to establish
 the promises and limitations of an archetype transition framework. We find
 that the 'reality' of the 'Trust Hospital Archetype' is one involving a
 high degree of contestation. This is confirmed by evidence drawn from
 interviews, documents, observation and participant observation. In order
 to analyse contestation, we distinguish between three interpretive schemes
 - Ideological-New Public Management, Executive Pragmatism and Medical
 Professionalism; and we outline five scripts - challenging, critiquing,
 mediating, cautioning and defending. This diversity casts doubt on the
 usefulness of simplistic managerialism-professionalism dichotomies
 prevalent in much of the literature. It also suggests modifications to
 archetype transition theory, which lends too much weight to the role of
 dominant interpretive schemes. Copyright 2003 Blackwell Publishing Ltd..

Title: Post-acquisition Integration as Sensemaking: Glimpses of Ambiguity, Confusion, Hypocrisy, and Politicization 
Abstract:
 Though many studies have examined post-acquisition integration challenges,
 they have mainly focused on rationalistic explanations for the
 difficulties encountered in post-acquisition integration. There remains
 little knowledge of how the 'irrational' features of post-acquisition
 decision-making may impede organizational integration. This study attempts
 to bridge that gap by examining post-acquisition decision-making from a
 sensemaking perspective. The paper presents an in-depth analysis of a
 merger between a large Finnish furniture manufacturer and three smaller
 Swedish furniture companies. By focusing on the sensemaking processes
 surrounding integration issues, we uncover four interrelated tendencies
 that illuminate why the frequent problem of slow progress during
 post-acquisition integration occurs: inherent ambiguity concerning
 integration issues; cultural confusion in social interaction and
 communication; organizational hypocrisy in integration decision-making;
 and the politicization of integration issues. Copyright Blackwell Publishers Ltd 2003.

Title: Governing Entrepreneurial Opportunity Recognition in MNEs: Aligning Interests and Cognition Under Uncertainty 
Abstract:
 Entrepreneurial activities contribute to the innovativeness and
 performance of subsidiaries and their parent multinational enterprises
 (MNEs). Though a strong multinational presence can spur the discovery and
 exploitation of entrepreneurial opportunities, it also creates uncertainty
 that complicates the alignment of cognition and interest in the governance
 of MNEs' multi-level entrepreneurial activities. We integrate economic and
 behavioural approaches to identify communicative, behavioural, and value
 uncertainties encountered in the MNEs' opportunity recognition phase. In
 addition, we discuss key contingencies that influence solutions to these
 uncertainties through delegation of authority, provision of incentives,
 promotion rules, and use of clan structures. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2007.

Title: Strategic Organizational Change: Exploring the Roles of Environmental Structure, Internal Conscious Awareness and Knowledge 
Abstract:
 We argue that strategic organizational change is best viewed as a
 multidimensional phenomenon consisting of various degrees of environmental
 structure and internal conscious awareness. And, by combining this
 conceptualization of change with a model of organizational knowledge
 transfer developed by Nonaka and Takeuchi (1995), we gain a better
 understanding of the types of change strategies that firms will pursue,
 the processes they should use to implement these strategies and the likely
 performance outcomes from these strategies. Specifically, we suggest that
 the levels of tacit and explicit knowledge needed to implement the new
 strategies are key determinants of firm performance following strategic
 organizational change. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2003.

Title: Information Gathering and Changes in Threat and Opportunity Perceptions 
Abstract:
 Managers need to make sense of emerging strategic issues that could
 significantly impact their businesses. While models of this sensemaking
 process suggest that information gathering affects interpretations (which
 affect action and performance), researchers have argued that our
 understanding of the role of information in changing interpretations is
 underdeveloped. This paper investigates the role of the time managers
 spend searching for information and the diversity of the information they
 find in changing managers' perceptions that an equivocal, strategic issue
 represents a threat and opportunity for their businesses. The methodology
 involves a longitudinal research design in which managers recorded
 multiple, process-oriented measures of their information gathering
 activity. Results suggest that time spent searching for information leads
 to changes towards seeing the issue as more of a threat, while the
 diversity of information found leads to changes towards seeing it as less
 of a threat. We found no effect of information gathering on opportunity
 perceptions. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2007.

Title: Post-Formation Processes in Eastern and Western European Joint Ventures 
Abstract:
 This study examines the post-formation processes that firms use to create
 successful international joint ventures (IJVs). Scholars have suggested
 that IJV performance is dependent on the post-formation processes firms
 institute to overcome barriers to success created by differences in
 national culture, trust, ownership positions and control mechanisms. Based
 on a longitudinal study of eight eastern/western European IJVs, our study
 provides insights into these post-formation processes, how these processes
 relate to each other, and how they relate to managers' evaluations of IJV
 success. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2006.

Title: Crafting Brand Authenticity: The Case of Luxury Wines 
Abstract:
 Authenticity is one of the cornerstones of contemporary marketing practice
 yet confusion surrounds the nature and use of authenticity in the brand
 arena. Examining the strategies of 26 luxury wine firms informs the
 authenticity of specific brands. Creating an impression of authenticity
 required creating a sincere story consisting of a creative blend of
 industrial and rhetorical attributes. Sincerity was achieved through the
 public avowal of hand crafted techniques, uniqueness, relationship to
 place, passion for wine production, and the simultaneous disavowal of
 commercial motives, rational production methods, and the use of modern
 marketing techniques. For the wineries, appearing authentic was critical
 in order to reinforce their status, command price premiums and ward off
 competitors. Images of authenticity were accomplished by developing a
 sincere story that enabled the firms to maintain quality and relevance
 while appearing above commercial considerations. This was achieved through
 the deliberate decoupling of their technical core from their espoused
 communications. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005.

Title: Sources of Fidelity in Purposive Organizational Change: Lessons from a Re-engineering Case 
Abstract:
 The debate between adaptation and inertia hinges on whether theorists
 believe that organizations can effect purposive organizational change in
 which the realized structures match the planned structures. To date,
 research on organizational change has yielded few insights into the
 conditions under which such change occurs. This longitudinal case study of
 a re-engineering programme at a medium-sized bank examined the conditions
 under which elements of the planned structure were faithfully implemented.
 Elaborating a model of change "fidelity", this paper argues that the
 features of the design elements themselves, attributes of the change
 process, and general contextual factors affect the likelihood that planned
 changes will occur. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2003.

Title: Sickness Presenteeism, Sickness Absenteeism, and Health Following Restructuring in a Public Service Organization 
Abstract:
 This study examined the relationship between sickness presenteeism,
 sickness absenteeism, organizational outcomes and employee health. In
 particular, we wanted to investigate to what degree employees were
 substituting sickness presence for sickness absence. Three hypotheses were
 tested to formalize this 'substitution proposition'. We surveyed a
 Canadian public service organization which was involved in a large scale
 downsizing initiative. For this study, 237 Personnel Corporation
 (pseudonym used) employees responded to the survey, representing a 66 per
 cent response rate. Survey results indicated that, while the workforce was
 of average health, sickness absenteeism was less than half that of the
 national average. The difference could be accounted for by sickness
 presenteeism - the average number of days employees attended work while
 ill or injured was greater than the number of days of sickness absence.
 The pattern of results supported the notion that employees were
 substituting presenteeism for absenteeism. The frequency and type of
 self-reported health problems were highly similar for presenteeism and
 absenteeism. Work factors (e.g. job security, supervisor support and job
 satisfaction) tested were significantly correlated with presenteeism.
 Presenteeism appears to be a stronger predictor of health than
 absenteeism, suggesting that efforts to improve workplace health may have
 a more immediate impact on presenteeism than on absenteeism. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2007.

Title: Language and the Circuits of Power in a Merging Multinational Corporation 
Abstract:
 We argue in this paper that corporate language policies have significant
 power implications that are easily overlooked. By drawing on previous work
 on power in organizations (Clegg, 1989), we examine the complex power
 implications of language policy decisions by looking at three levels of
 analysis: episodic social interaction, identity/subjectivity construction,
 and reconstruction of structures of domination. In our empirical analysis,
 we focus on the power implications of the choice of Swedish as the
 corporate language in the case of the recent banking sector merger between
 the Finnish Merita and the Swedish Nordbanken. Our findings show how
 language skills become empowering or disempowering resources in
 organizational communication, how these skills are associated with
 professional competence, and how this leads to the creation of new social
 networks. The case also illustrates how language skills are an essential
 element in the construction of international confrontation, lead to a
 construction of superiority and inferiority, and also reproduce
 post-colonial identities in the merging bank. Finally, we also point out
 how such policies ultimately lead to the reification of post-colonial and
 neo-colonial structures of domination in multinational corporations. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005.

Title: A Neo-Gramscian Approach to Corporate Political Strategy: Conflict and Accommodation in the Climate Change Negotiations 
Abstract:
 A neo-Gramscian theoretical framework for corporate political strategy is
 developed drawing from Gramsci's analysis of the relations among capital,
 social forces, and the state, and from more contemporary theories.
 Gramsci's political theory recognizes the centrality of organizations and
 strategy, directs attention to the organizational, economic, and
 ideological pillars of power, while illuminating the processes of
 coalition building, conflict, and accommodation that drive social change.
 This approach addresses the structure-agency relationship and endogenous
 dynamics in a way that could enrich institutional theory. The framework
 suggests a strategic concept of power, which provides space for
 contestation by subordinate groups in complex dynamic social systems. We
 apply the framework to analyse the international negotiations to control
 emissions of greenhouse gases, focusing on the responses of firms in the
 US and European oil and automobile industries. The neo-Gramscian framework
 explains some specific features of corporate responses to challenges to
 their hegemonic position and points to the importance of political
 struggles within civil society. The analysis suggests that the
 conventional demarcation between market and non-market strategies is
 untenable, given the embeddedness of markets in contested social and
 political structures and the political character of strategies directed
 toward defending and enhancing markets, technologies, corporate autonomy
 and legitimacy. Copyright Blackwell Publishers Ltd 2003.

Title: Intellectual Capital Profiles: An Examination of Investments and Returns 
Abstract:
 Using data collected from executives in 208 organizations, this study
 takes a configurational approach to examine how human, social, and
 organizational capital coexist to form distinct intellectual capital
 profiles across organizations. We then examine how investments in human
 resource management (HRM), information technology (IT), and research and
 development (R&D) differ across these intellectual capital profiles and
 investigate differences in financial returns and Tobin's q between the
 profiles. Results indicate that a relatively small group of superior
 performing organizations exhibit high levels of human, social, and
 organizational capital. Most firms, however, tend to focus primarily on
 only one form of intellectual capital, and a small group of
 underperforming organizations have very low levels of all three types of
 intellectual capital. At a general level, HRM and IT investments appear to
 influence intellectual capital development more than R&D investments. More
 specifically, HRM investments tend to be higher in firms with profiles
 high in human and social capital, while IT investments are stronger in
 firms with profiles high in social capital. Further, HRM, IT, and R&D
 investments are all very high in the group of superior performing
 organizations that have high levels of human, social, and organizational
 capital. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2004.

Title: Strategic Moves and Organizational Survival in Turbulent Environments: The Case of Spanish Banks (1983-97) 
Abstract:
 The main purpose of this paper is to examine the effect of 'strategic
 moves' (or strategic change) on the likelihood of organizational survival
 in a population of firms which has undergone radical transformations in
 its environment. To this end, we propose and test two competitive
 hypotheses which are the result of two other theoretical perspectives
 about the consequences of strategic change: the adaptation view (classic
 strategic management and dynamic capabilities) and the ecological
 approach. While from the former, in general, it is assumed that strategic
 change has a positive effect on the likelihood of organizational survival,
 from the ecological approach, it is frequently argued that attempts at
 reorganization in general and strategic change in particular tend to be
 associated with an increase in the likelihood of organizational
 extinction. The sample used to test the two proposed hypotheses is the
 Spanish bank population over the period 1983-97. The results confirm the
 positive and significant effect of strategic moves (or strategic change)
 on the likelihood of organizational survival, in line with the conclusions
 of the adaptive perspective and other empirical research carried out in
 different settings. This paper introduces two important methodological
 innovations: (a) the definition and measurement of 'strategic moves' (or
 strategic change) by using a new cluster algorithm, the MCLUST; and (b)
 the control of the non-observable heterogeneity using panel data models
 for 'probit' regression. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2006.

Title: How Critical is Employee Orientation for Customer Relationship Management? Insights from a Case Study 
Abstract:
 This paper explores the interface of employee orientation and the Customer
 Relationship Management (CRM) process based on an in-depth case study of a
 leading firm in the UK automotive services sector. Employee orientation is
 embedded in the Organizational Culture (OC) of the firm and manifested
 through its key elements, notably assumptions, values, behaviours and
 artefacts. CRM consists of four organizational activities: strategic
 planning, information, value creation, and performance measurement
 sub-processes. Based on the case study evidence, the widely postulated
 link between CRM success and employee orientation is empirically supported
 and the mechanisms underlying this association elucidated. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2007.

Title: Understanding Top Management and Organizational Change Through Demographic and Processual Analysis 
Abstract:
 Top management theory has been strongly influenced by demographic studies
 of top management teams (TMTs), but not by research into organizational
 adaptation to conditions of extreme institutional turbulence. This article
 analyses the transformation of a post-socialist enterprise through a
 combination of demographic and processual methods to develop an enriched
 account of the micro-processes through which top management constructed
 organizational change. Adding layers of narrative data and processual
 explanation directly addresses the well rehearsed problems in demographic
 TMT studies. From the findings, we propose a set of theoretical arguments
 that conceptualizes top management in terms of management regimes, to
 which TMTs are politically tied and through which they seek to realize
 their values and strategies in organizational outcomes. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2007.

Title: Strategic Groups, Frontier Benchmarking and Performance Differences: Evidence from the UK Retail Grocery Industry 
Abstract:
 In this paper we seek to advance the theory and practice of strategic
 group theory by means of powerful benchmarking tools that allow the
 composition of strategic groups on the basis of empirically derived
 production function frontiers. The relative performance of firms is
 assessed based on multiple inputs and outputs and as a result, firms are
 associated with different segments of the efficient frontiers. These
 segments constitute strategic facets and are used in the current paper as
 strategic group variables. The strategic facets are composed by outlier
 firms in the sense that they satisfy the Pareto dominance criterion when
 compared with other firms. Such advancement offers significant advantages
 compared to the 'average' firm that is used traditionally as a basis to
 define strategic groups. The proposed methodology for the formation of
 strategic groups has been applied on a panel of data from the grocery
 industry in the UK in the period 1987-93. The results of the study
 confirmed the existence of three stable strategic groups and one with a
 more volatile membership. Performance differences were also identifiled
 both between and within strategic groups using as criteria traditional
 accounting methods and also the relative efficiency indices obtained from
 the benchmarking methodology applied to the panel of data. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2003.

Title: Contract Formalization and Governance of Exporter-Importer Relationships 
Abstract:
 Exporting relationships between manufacturers and foreign importers pose
 unique coordination problems because, on the one hand, transactions are
 recurrent and both firms make non-trivial relationship-specific
 investments, but at the same time, the exchange partners maintain separate
 legal entities with individual profit claims. This study examines the role
 of contracts as a governance mechanism in these relationships that are
 neither market-based discrete transactions, nor can be governed through
 ownership-based hierarchies. Drawing upon recent research on contract law
 and interorganizational relationships, we develop and empirically test a
 model that incorporates both the antecedents and performance implications
 of the nature of contract governing exporter-importer relationships. Copyright (c) Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2007.

Title: The Conduct of Management and the Management of Conduct: Contemporary Managerial Discourse and the Constitution of the 'Competent' Manager 
Abstract:
 The character and conduct of the manager has formed a central focus of
 attempts to govern economic life throughout the present century. and
 current programmes of organizational change involve radical attempts to
 reconstitute the nature and conduct of management. This is attempted
 through the identification and implementation of management competencies.
 Discourses of organizational reform such as human resource management,
 total quality management and business process re-engineering all place a
 critical emphasis on anti-bureaucratic, organic and flexible forms of
 organization, which are also seen to require the development of particular
 capacities and predispositions among managers. Essential to their vision
 of 'managerial work' is a composite of 'entrepreneurial' attributes.
 Management competencies appear to offer a congenial method for the
 reconstitution of the manager along 'entrepreneurial' lines, not simply
 because they are inherently founded on managers'self-management and
 self-presentation of identified behaviours, but also because they
 represent individualized forms of business functions (and are often
 associated with the establishment of market relations within the
 organization). Copyright 1996 Basil Blackwell Ltd.

Title: Finding Form: Looking at the Field of Organizational Aesthetics 
Abstract:
 Organizational research has long focused on the instrumental sphere with
 its questions of efficiency and effectiveness and in recent decades there
 has been interest in the moral sphere with its questions of ethics. Within
 the last decade there has also emerged a field that draws on the aesthetic
 sphere of our existence in organizations. In this review we look at the
 field of organizational aesthetics in terms of content and method,
 suggesting four broad categories of organizational aesthetics research:
 intellectual analysis of instrumental issues, artistic form used to look
 at instrumental issues, intellectual analysis of aesthetic issues, and
 artistic form used to look at aesthetic issues. We then suggest how
 organizational scholars might pursue artistic aesthetic organizational
 research. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005.

Title: Strategy as Simulacra? A Radical Reflexive Look at the Discipline and Practice of Strategy 
Abstract:
 Over the past three decades strategic management has become a crucial
 aspect of business education and practice. At the core of strategic
 management - linking technique to worldview - is modelling (e.g. value
 chain, SWOT analysis) whereby the complex elements of strategic thinking
 are simplified. This accounts in large part for the apparent popularity of
 strategic management as complex interrelationships are pursued through
 relatively simple models. Yet has the field of strategic management
 realized the third order of simulacra? Is strategic management a model of
 simulation whereby reality has been replaced by hyperreality? A review of
 the extant literature on strategy explores the study and practice of
 strategy as a discourse, engulfed by its own truth effects. An examination
 of the concepts of reflexivity demonstrates the value of a postmodern
 radical reflexive account through the application of Baudrillard's (1983,
 1988, 1991, 1994) simulation and simulacra. It is through the development
 of a radical reflexive discourse of strategy as simulacra, this paper
 critically examines the study and practice of strategy and the lessons we
 can take from this perspective. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2004.

Title: Analysing the Influence of Institutional, Organizational and Interpersonal Forces in Shaping Inter-Organizational Relations 
Abstract:
 Much of the literature on inter-organizational relations assumes that
 firms operate as relatively autonomous and cohesive units that are (1)
 unimpeded by wider institutional norms governing the industry as a whole,
 and (2) allow little or no role for the boundary spanning agents who
 oversee and monitor 'contracts' on a daily basis. This perspective is not
 surprising given that so many studies rely solely on questionnaires
 completed by a single respondent within one or more of the organizations.
 Nor has there been much recognition of the dynamic interplay between
 forces at the institutional, organizational and interpersonal levels. In
 order to address these issues, we propose a framework that explicitly
 focuses on forces at these three levels, as well as the interplay between
 them, in order to analyse how and why inter-organizational relations take
 the forms they do. We argue that trusting, OCR-type relations are more
 likely to be produced and reproduced when there are strong institutional
 forces promoting common obligations on both parties, and there is a
 relative mutuality of power relations between the organizations. However,
 because the contract is maintained by boundary spanning agents, agreed
 norms at the institutional and organizational levels are a necessary but
 not sufficient factor for OCR to develop. Conversely, in the absence of
 these forces, there is less incentive for either organization to establish
 and maintain close interpersonal relations, and indeed ACR-type, distant
 relations may be beneficial for organizations and individuals that wish to
 dispense with existing contracts. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2004.

Title: The Development of Organizational Social Capital: Attributes of Family Firms 
Abstract:
 We develop and extend social capital theory by exploring the creation of
 organizational social capital within a highly pervasive, yet often
 overlooked organizational form: family firms. We argue that family firms
 are unique in that, although they work as a single entity, at least two
 forms of social capital coexist: the family's and the firm's. We
 investigate mechanisms that link a family's social capital to the creation
 of the family firm's social capital and examine how factors underlying the
 family's social capital affect this creation. Moreover, we identify
 contingency dimensions that affect these relationships and the potential
 risks associated with family social capital. Finally, we suggest these
 insights are generalizable to several other types of organizations with
 similar characteristics. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2007.

Title: The Role of Alliance Network Redundancy in the Creation of Core and Non-core Technologies 
Abstract:
 This paper studies the effect of a focal firm, and its partners' local
 alliance actions, on the creation of technological innovations by the
 former. More specifically, we study how two types of redundancy in a focal
 firm's ego network affect its ability to create new technologies in its
 technology core areas (exploitation) and/or non-core areas (exploration).
 We analyse this empirically in three different industry settings:
 chemicals, motor vehicles, and pharmaceuticals. One of our key findings is
 that individual firms can indeed boost both types of innovative output by
 shaping the degree of redundancy in their local alliance network, but that
 the way in which this should be done differs between the creation of core
 and non-core technologies. Next, we find that it is very useful to unpack
 the rather abstract notion of redundancy into more specific types of
 redundancy in ego networks. Overall, these findings reflect an
 action-oriented view on the role of individual firms in collaborative
 networks, which may complement the dominant view in the alliance
 literature emphasizing the role of the overall network structure and
 firms' network position within it. Copyright (c) Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2008.

Title: A Knowledge Accessing Theory of Strategic Alliances 
Abstract:
 The emerging knowledge-based view of the firm offers new insight into the
 causes and management of interfirm alliances. However, the development of
 an effective knowledge-based theory of alliance formation has been
 inhibited by a simplistic view of alliances as vehicles for organizational
 learning in which strategic alliances have presumed to be motivated by
 firms' desire to acquire knowledge from one another. We argue that the
 primary advantage of alliances over both firms and markets is in
 "accessing" rather than "acquiring" knowledge. Building upon the
 distinction between the knowledge generation ('exploration') and knowledge
 application ('exploitation'), we show that alliances contribute to the
 efficiency in the application of knowledge; first, by improving the
 efficiency with which knowledge is integrated into the production of
 complex goods and services, and second, by increasing the efficiency with
 which knowledge is utilized. These static efficiency advantages of
 alliances are enhanced where there is uncertainty over future knowledge
 requirements and where new products offer early-mover advantages. Compared
 with alternative learning-based approaches to alliance formation, our
 proposed knowledge-accessing theory of alliances offers the advantages of
 greater theoretical rigour and consistency with general trends in alliance
 activity and corporate strategy. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2004.

Title: 'Control - What Control?' Culture and Ambiguity Within a Knowledge Intensive Firm 
Abstract:
 This paper explores the distinctive culture that existed within a
 knowledge-intensive firm (KIF) and also attempts to explain the emergence
 and effects of this culture. The findings are based on a detailed case
 study that was conducted over two years within a consultancy firm that
 created and applied scientific knowledge and expertise to the invention of
 solutions for clients. The firm employed highly educated scientists,
 considered 'leading' in their respective disciplines and project work was
 inherently fluid, complex, and uncertain. These kinds of 'knowledge
 workers', and this kind of work, are expected to demand high levels of
 autonomy. This creates complex managerial dilemmas around how to balance
 autonomy with control and uncertainty and flexibility with efficiency. The
 analysis shows how a strong culture based on an acceptance of ambiguity
 (e.g. in roles, power relations, organizational routines and practices)
 promoted the development of a loyal, committed, effective workforce and
 sustained a fluid and flexible form of project working over time.
 Critically, ambiguity allowed individuals to sustain multiple identities
 as both 'expert' and 'consultant'. This, coupled with a corporate identity
 premised on 'élitism', helped to maximize commitment to the work and
 minimize tensions between control and autonomy. Thus the culture that
 embraced ambiguity (a consensus that there would be no consensus)
 engendered a form of normative control whereby consultants operated freely
 and at the same time willingly participated in the regulation of their own
 autonomy. Copyright Blackwell Publishers Ltd 2003.

Title: The Role of 'Good Conversation' In Strategic Control 
Abstract:
 Most current writers on strategic control, whether from the rational
 planning or processual schools, agree on the importance of dialogue and
 debate between the interested parties to the control process. This is
 particularly so when strategic control is regarded in a 'warning bell'
 sense, responding to a signal that all is not going according to plan,
 rather than as a behavioural constraint or as an element of agency theory
 practice. This paper advances a normative framework for ensuring the
 effectiveness of such discussions based on Bird's notion of a 'good
 conversation'. Bird argued that the discussion of business ethical
 problems should be vocal, reciprocating, issues-oriented, rational,
 imaginative, and honest. It is argued here that these characteristics
 should also apply to the discussions within the strategic control process
 if the process is not to be dysfunctional. Copyright 1996 Basil Blackwell Ltd.

Title: Senior Team Attributes and Organizational Ambidexterity: The Moderating Role of Transformational Leadership 
Abstract:
 Organizations capable of pursuing exploration and exploitation
 simultaneously have been suggested to obtain superior performance.
 Combining both types of activities and achieving organizational
 ambidexterity, however, leads to the presence of multiple and often
 conflicting goals, and poses considerable challenges to senior teams in
 ambidextrous organizations. This study explores the role of senior team
 attributes and leadership behaviour in reconciling conflicting interests
 among senior team members and achieving organizational ambidexterity.
 Findings indicate that a senior team shared vision and contingency rewards
 are associated with a firm's ability to combine high levels of exploratory
 and exploitative innovations. In addition, our study shows that an
 executive director's transformational leadership increases the
 effectiveness of senior team attributes in ambidextrous organizations and
 moderates the effectiveness of senior team social integration and
 contingency rewards. Hence, our study clarifies how senior executives
 reconcile conflicting demands and facilitate the balancing of seemingly
 contradictory forces in ambidextrous organizations. Implications for
 literatures on senior team attributes, transformational leadership and
 organizational ambidexterity are discussed. Copyright (c) Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2008.

Title: Research In Strategy, Economics, and Michael Porter 
Abstract:
 This article links up with recent discussions of the strategy/economics
 nexus. In contrast to most of the proponents and opponents of economics in
 strategy thinking, a balanced pluralist perspective is adopted. According
 to this, a discipline should strike a balance between the generation of
 new theoretical alternatives and the selection among them. Applying this
 general idea, I argue that the strategy field is too pluralistic, and that
 the unfortunate consequences of excessive pluralism and eclecticism may be
 remedied by economics playing a larger role in the conversation of
 strategy researchers. This does not necessarily mean standard neoclassical
 economics or new industrial organization economics; evolutionary
 economics, for example, is a serious contender, too. the evolution of
 Michael Porter's thinking is used as a case for demonstrating some of the
 advantages and some of the dangers of economics in the strategy field, and
 for illustrating points about eclecticism and pluralism. Copyright 1996 Basil Blackwell Ltd.

Title: Idea Management: A Systemic View 
Abstract:
 Ideas are a central ingredient of organizational life and ideation is an
 essential faculty that propels every day management action. Yet, little is
 known about how ideation is manifested and managed. We employ the
 philosophies of transcendentalism, process and interactionism to provide
 insights into the empirical referents of idea management. We use these
 referents as a point of departure in our interpretations. Rather than
 studying idea management in terms of lists of categories, continua of
 characteristics, or details about process, we explore its systemic nature
 and investigate the inter-relatedness of idea generation, problem solving
 and inquiry. Based on field interviews, we propose idea management
 archetypes that reflect managers' dominant approaches and a model of idea
 management based on patterns of behaviour. The study validates the notion
 of idea management and demonstrates the strengths of grounded theorizing.
 We discuss implications for theory and practice and identify possible
 strategies for future research. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2006.

Title: The Recontextualization of Management: A Discourse-based Approach to Analysing the Development of Management Thinking 
Abstract:
 Many analysts have sought to explain the development and growth of
 management ideas and discourse in recent years, using notions such as the
 diffusion and consumption of ideas, and analogies with the fashion
 industry. These frameworks have a number of weaknesses that inhibit their
 value. Conceptualizing management knowledge or ideas or thinking as a form
 of discourse leads us to alternative frameworks for examining developments
 in this field. Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) can be used to explore
 the social processes and structures from which discourse emanates and
 which discourse in turn underpins. Bernstein's concept of
 recontextualization can be employed to analyse the discursive relations
 between different social spheres or conjunctures within which human action
 takes place and how discourse is changed as it moves between conjunctures
 to meet the needs of different social agents. In this respect it can be
 used to analyse how management discourse unfolds as it is produced,
 distributed and acquired by agents within the academic, consultant and
 practitioner conjunctures. By doing so we can explore: the intertextual
 relations between the discourses; how the management discourse becomes
 technologized; and how hybrid forms of discourse, which mix genres and
 styles, emerge. Copyright Blackwell Publishers Ltd 2003.

Title: 'Totally Un-Australian!': Discursive and Institutional Interplay in the Melbourne Port Dispute of 1997-98 
Abstract:
 We examine how discourses are mobilized and deployed by actors in an
 inter-organizational domain during a critical industrial relations event.
 We identify the ways that business interests and union interests in the
 Melbourne Port industrial dispute of 1997-98 related to each other. We
 weave concepts from domain theory and organizational discourse theory in
 deriving the concept of the "discursively ordered domain". This suggests
 that the main processes that occur in a domain are actors''mapping' texts
 onto discourses and discourses onto interpretive schemes which make
 certain courses of action rational and sensible. Methodologically, we join
 an institutional-historical analysis and a text-based discourse analysis
 to gain a well-rounded understanding of the situation. We extract several
 discursive frameworks which the major actors mobilized to make sense of
 the situation, and draw linkages to the actions that those positions made
 possible. The main findings are that actors in the two networks performed
 complex mapping in different ways, the material and symbolic outcomes of
 the dispute are products of those mapping processes, and the material and
 discursive aspects of the domain interweave. We discuss the value of the
 concept of discursively ordered domain for mutually enriching domain
 theory and discourse analysis and for understanding critical events such
 as major industrial disputes in new ways. Copyright 2003 Blackwell Publishing Ltd..

Title: The Resource-Based View of Competitive Advantage in Two-Sided Markets 
Abstract:
 Using two-sided markets as a specific market context, we show that
 cross-group network effects can turn the participants of a two-sided
 network into critical resources. In two-sided markets such as payment
 cards and personal computer operating systems, two groups of agents
 interact with each other via a common network platform; the value of
 joining the network for agents in one group depends on the number of
 participants in the other group. In these markets, resource heterogeneity
 is represented by different sizes of existing networks; resource
 accumulation possesses all five characteristics of asset-stock
 accumulation summarized by Dierickx and Cool. The unique resource
 accumulation process provides an isolating mechanism for large networks to
 sustain their resource and competitive advantages. Using two dynamic
 systems models, we show that resource heterogeneity (i.e. varying initial
 network sizes) is a source of sustained competitive advantage for
 two-sided networks and has significant impact on long-term competition
 dynamics. The findings illustrate the importance of incorporating market
 context in the research of the resource-based view of competitive
 advantage. Copyright (c) Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2009.

Title: The Interaction of Top Management Group, Stakeholder, and Situational Factors on Certain Corporate Reputation Management Activities 
Abstract:
 This study examines when a firm's members are most likely to promote and
 defend its reputation. Building on past research in impression management
 theory and the upper-echelons perspective, I argue that firms facing
 increased visibility among different stakeholder groups will increase
 corporate reputation management activities towards those groups and
 decrease activities towards other groups. I further argue that top
 management group characteristics will moderate these relationships,
 suggesting that certain top management groups are more attuned to the
 situational needs of reputation management. A set of hypotheses are tested
 using pooled cross-sectional time-series data on a set of "Fortune 500"
 companies. Results indicate that firms generally directed reputation
 management activities towards their more visible stakeholders. However,
 the type and extent of reputation management behaviour varied.
 Specifically, for firms whose top management groups were more highly
 educated or output oriented, highly visible situations with the media were
 more likely to be associated with a higher use of press releases.
 Moreover, those same firms devoted more resources to mass media
 advertising under situations of high consumer visibility compared to firms
 whose top management groups were less educated or throughput oriented. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2006.

Title: Middle-earth Meets New Zealand: Authenticity and Location in the Making of "The Lord of the Rings" 
Abstract:
 In focusing on the making of a specific cultural project, "The Lord of the
 Rings" ("LOTR") film trilogy, this paper draws out the tensions between
 two sometimes divergent strands of authenticity: creative authenticity and
 national authenticity. This study is located in New Zealand, a small
 post-colonial country which was the location for "LOTR" and home to its
 key film-makers. The case is based on a discourse analysis of published
 texts on "LOTR" and New Zealand's film and tourism industries, exploring
 the paradoxical concept of 'fabricating authenticity' (Peterson, 1997) and
 its importance to cultural industries. In reviewing the media discourse of
 the "LOTR" project we ask: how are creative and national authenticity
 constructed? "Creative authenticity" refers to the claims of artistic
 integrity and merit that are made for the film. "National authenticity" is
 predicated on the idea of a national identity. In terms of "LOTR",
 national authenticity is based on claiming the trilogy as a local 'New
 Zealand' product. We highlight the theme of 'location' by linking "LOTR"
 with a national tourism campaign which has been developed side-by-side
 with the film project, forging connections between the Middle-earth of the
 "LOTR" trilogy, and the New Zealand of the present. We argue that "LOTR"
 has both shaped, and been shaped by, ideas of national identity, and that
 the success of "LOTR" as a flagship of the 'new' creative industries is
 central to emerging visions of nationhood. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005.

Title: Managerial (In)attention to Competitive Threats 
Abstract:
 We integrate the Attention Based View of the firm and Regulatory Focus
 Theory to propose a model of managerial (in)attention that explains why
 appeals by middle managers for top managers to attend to specific threats
 of emerging rivals go unheeded. By acknowledging that different regulatory
 foci are elicited by different structural positions within the firm, we
 suggest that these differences in regulatory foci influence the allocation
 of attention to competitive intelligence warning of an emerging threat. We
 conclude by discussing how top managers might better evaluate whether
 threats of emerging rivals are worthy of deeper consideration. Copyright (c) Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2008.

Title: Exploring Exploration Orientation and its Determinants: Some Empirical Evidence 
Abstract:
 Adopting an information-process perspective, this article conceptualizes
 exploration orientation in terms of scope of information acquisition. In
 line with this conceptualization, a multidimensional operational measure
 of exploration orientation is developed and its internal consistency
 established. The measure appears to have nomological validity in that it
 behaves as predicted with measures of variables hypothesized to be related
 to exploration orientation. Consistent with the emerging co-evolution
 framework, environmental pressures as well as managerial intentions are
 found to influence an organization's exploration behaviour. Specifically,
 empirical results indicate that more environmental dynamism, a stronger
 organization mission, a prospector orientation and larger slack resources
 are associated with a greater exploration orientation. Implications,
 shortcomings and future research directions are discussed. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2004.

Title: Corporate Venture Capital, Disembodied Experimentation and Capability Development 
Abstract:
 Studies invoking a capabilities lens often ascribe deliberateness in
 organizational decisions to develop new capabilities. Drawing on five
 longitudinal case studies of large, global firms in the information and
 communication technology sector, we examine how firms engender cognizance
 of their future capability needs in situations characterized by high
 decision-making uncertainty. We develop a theoretical account of how firms
 use investments in start-ups to actively engage in experimentation outside
 organizational boundaries, a learning process which we term as disembodied
 experimentation. Disembodied experimentation creates awareness of voids in
 the capability base of an incumbent and helps to overcome inertial
 restraints thereby influencing the decision to invest in capability
 development. The relationship between learning from disembodied
 experimentation and the decision to develop capabilities is moderated by
 knowledge brokering functions and adaptation complexity. Copyright (c) Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2008.

Title: Integrating Decentralized Strategy Making and Strategic Planning Processes in Dynamic Environments 
Abstract:
 Decentralized post-bureaucratic organizations are deemed to display
 superior performance in dynamic environments, but recent evidence
 indicates that centralized integrative cross-functional processes may be
 equally critical. Accordingly, this paper hypothesizes that organizational
 performance can be ascribed to the simultaneous emphasis on decentralized
 strategy making and strategic planning processes. This is investigated in
 a study of 185 manufacturing organizations operating in diverse industries
 spanning food processing and computer products. The study shows that both
 decentralized decision structure and planning activities are associated
 with higher performance in dynamic environments. These findings confirm
 that effective organizations engage in more complex strategy formation
 processes that complement the decentralized post-bureaucratic form with
 formal mechanisms of rational analyses and operational integration. The
 paper highlights a need to extend our understanding of the duality between
 decentralization and planning. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2004.

Title: Entry into Insular Domains: A Longitudinal Study of Knowledge Structuration and Innovation in Biotechnology Firms 
Abstract:
 We focus on the firm's decision to enter insular technology domains and
 its effect on the impact that its subsequent innovation has on the field.
 Insular domains are technical domains that rely heavily on prior
 innovations within the same domain for subsequent innovations. We show
 that the returns to entering insular domains vary with the firm's depth
 and breadth of knowledge. By analysing data from 128 biotechnology firms
 over a 20-year period, we find that the relationship between depth of
 technological capabilities and technology impact is nuanced: depth is
 necessary but not sufficient for high impact innovation. Firms whose
 knowledge is spread over disparate domains have negative returns from
 entering insular domains. The implications of these findings for theories
 of innovation and the discovery of entrepreneurial opportunities are
 discussed. Copyright (c) Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2008.

Title: Explaining Vertical Integration Strategies: Market Power, Transactional Attributes and Capabilities 
Abstract:
 We analyse vertical boundaries of firms by identifying and comparing
 industrial, transactional and firm-specific factors in such a way that
 industrial organization, new institutional economics and the
 capability-based view are all taken into account. After testing the model
 in 155 firms in the Spanish meat industry, we observe that only factors
 associated with both transaction costs and capabilities have a statistical
 and economic relevance for explaining vertical integration. Firms
 vertically integrate to create specific investment between stages of the
 value chain, to internally exploit their pool of knowledge and capacities,
 and to guarantee quality of inputs and services employed. On the other
 hand, firms avoid high levels of vertical integration in the presence of
 high demand changes in order to stay flexible. Finally, providers or
 clients with market power do not seem to affect vertical boundaries in any
 consistent way. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2007.

Title: Noise Trading and the Management of Operational Risk; Firms, Traders and Irrationality in Financial Markets 
Abstract:
 Efficient market models cannot explain the high level of trading in
 financial markets in terms of asset portfolio adjustment. It is presumed
 that much of this excessive trading is irrational 'noise' trading. A
 corollary is that there must either be irrational traders in the market or
 rational traders with irrational aberrations. The paper reviews the
 various attempts to explain noise trading in the finance literature,
 concluding that the persistence of irrationality is not well explained.
 Data from a study of 118 traders in four large investment banks are
 presented to advance reasons why traders might seek to trade more
 frequently than financial models predict. The argument is advanced that
 trades do not simply occur in order to generate profit, but it does not
 follow that such trading is irrational. Trading may generate information,
 accelerate learning, create commitments and enhance social capital, all of
 which sustain traders' long term survival in the market. The paper treats
 noise trading as a form of operational risk facing firms operating in
 financial markets and discusses approaches to the management of such risk. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2006.

Title: The Influence of Top Management Team International Exposure on International Alliance Formation 
Abstract:
 This study examines the effect of top management team (TMT) international
 exposure on the formation of international alliances. We develop our
 arguments based on relational capital theory to suggest that top
 executives with international exposure are critical to firms'
 international alliance formation. Supporting this view, we find that TMT
 international exposure is positively associated with the formation of
 international alliances. Moreover, we find evidence to suggest that the
 effect of TMT international exposure on international alliance formation
 is more positive as the level of environmental uncertainty increases. We
 discuss implications and directions for future research. Copyright (c) Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2008.

Title: Knowing What You Don't Know? Discourses and Contradictions in Knowledge Management Research 
Abstract:
 Even though knowledge management scholars generally advocate explicit
 management of knowledge, there is research that cautions against the
 unintended consequences of such efforts. Some researchers go as far as
 arguing that knowledge and management are contradictory concepts (Alvesson
 and Kärreman, 2001). This paper explores the apparent double-edged nature
 of knowledge management by developing a theory-based framework that
 highlights different fundamental assumptions about knowledge and its
 management. This framework, which is an adaptation of Burrell and Morgan's
 four paradigms of social and organizational inquiry, distinguishes among a
 neo-functionalist, a constructivist, a critical and a dialogic discourse. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2004.

Title: Complexity of Outsourcing Contracts and "Ex Post" Transaction Costs: An Empirical Investigation 
Abstract:
  In this article, we use Transaction Cost Economics (TCE) and the
 Resource-Based View (RBV) of the firm to study outsourcing agreements. We
 develop an original approach of contract complexity and analyse the links
 among exchange hazards (i.e. specificity and environmental uncertainty),
 the contractual aspects of outsourcing (control, incentives, penalties,
 price and flexibility clauses) and the level of "ex post" transaction
 costs. Both contract complexity and "ex post" transaction costs are
 operationalized and measured. Our empirical research analyses 82
 outsourcing contracts. This article uses three different dimensions
 (proximity to the core business, switching costs and adaptation costs) to
 assess the strategic importance of an outsourced activity. Our findings
 extend TCE's validity for the outsourcing of activities with a strategic
 value. Finally, this study offers an indirect measurement of "ex post"
 transaction costs. In short, to restrict vendor opportunism, contracts
 must contain incentives and penalties, as well as pricing and monitoring
 clauses. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2006.

Title: Acquisition Premiums, Subsequent Workforce Reductions and Post-Acquisition Performance 
Abstract:
 This study suggests that paying acquisition premiums leads to workforce
 reductions in the merged firm, which in turn results in poorer
 post-acquisition performance. This issue is important to scholars and
 practising managers given the pervasiveness and importance of knowledge
 and human capital to competitive advantage. In a sample of 174 major
 related acquisitions completed in the period 1992-98, results show a
 positive relationship between the premium paid for an acquisition and
 subsequent workforce reductions, controlling for a number of alternative
 explanations. Additionally, workforce reduction mediates the negative
 relationship between premiums and post-acquisition performance. The
 results suggest that the effects of workforce reductions following large
 premiums paid for the acquired firm can be detrimental to the interests of
 the organization. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2007.

Title: The Impact of Institutional Reforms on Characteristics and Survival of Foreign Subsidiaries in Emerging Economies 
Abstract:
 This study goes beyond the conventional notion of the institutional
 environment of emerging economies and investigates their dynamic context.
 It examines the complex influences of policy reforms on the
 characteristics and survival of foreign subsidiaries in emerging economies
 before and after the 1997 Asian Economic Crisis. This study proposes that
 FDI policy reforms during times of crisis may not only have a positive
 effect on institutional munificence for foreign firms, but such drastic
 reforms may also produce a negative effect (e.g. institutional volatility
 and complexity) on the environment. We consider how foreign firms
 effectively respond to the unfavourable forces of the post-crisis
 environments while taking advantage of the munificence of the policy
 reforms. We find that foreign subsidiaries tend to take the form of
 wholly-owned subsidiaries (versus joint ventures), majority joint-ventures
 (versus minority joint-ventures), or trading operations (versus
 manufacturing operations) in the post-crisis institutional environment.
 Consistently, foreign subsidiaries with these characteristics are more
 likely to survive in the post-crisis environment. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005.

Title: A Cognitive Model of CEO Dismissal: Understanding the Influence of Board Perceptions, Attributions and Efficacy Beliefs 
Abstract:
 Extant literature that examines the role of boards in the CEO dismissal
 process has focused on the impact of board composition. However, it has
 rarely considered the influence of sense making and interpretation on CEO
 dismissal. This paper draws on the strategic change literature, which
 demonstrates a link between cognitions and action, to develop a
 three-stage framework in which we articulate how sense making (stage 1)
 and interpretation (stage 2) impact the decision to dismiss a CEO (stage
 3). More specifically, the board's perception of performance, its
 attributions of performance and efficacy assessment of the CEO, and the
 board's composition impact the decision to dismiss the CEO. The resulting
 model illuminates the domain of board cognitions and board composition
 within CEO dismissal decisions and facilitates future empirical research. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2006.

Title: The Entrepreneurial Theory of the Firm and the Theory of the Entrepreneurial Firm 
Abstract:
 The entrepreneurial theory of the firm argues that entrepreneurship,
 properly understood, is a crucial but neglected element in explaining the
 nature and boundaries of the firm. By contrast, the theory of the
 entrepreneurial firm presumably seeks not to understand the nature and
 boundaries of 'the firm' in general but rather to understand a particular
 type of firm: one that is entrepreneurial. This paper is an attempt to
 reconcile the two. After briefly delving for the concept of
 entrepreneurship in the work of Schumpeter, Kirzner, and (especially)
 Knight, the paper makes the case for the entrepreneurial theory of the
 firm. In such a theory, the firm exists as the solution to a coordination
 problem in a world of change and uncertainty, including Knightian or
 structural uncertainty. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2007.

Title: Organizational Learning in Multinationals: R&D Networks of Japanese and US MNEs in the UK 
Abstract:
 The institutional approach treats organizational forms and behaviour as
 contingent upon institutions that are durable and socially embedded and so
 several authors have argued that the nature and modes of operation of
 multinational enterprises (MNEs) vary according to their national origins.
 This paper examines the ways in which national patterns of organization
 and innovation affect Japanese and US MNEs' global R&D networks and
 transnational learning, based on case studies of their R&D laboratories in

Title: A Narrative Approach to Collective Identities 
Abstract:
 From a narrative perspective, organizations' identities are discursive
 (linguistic) constructs constituted by the multiple identity-relevant
 narratives that their participants author about them, and which feature,
 for example, in documents, conversations and electronic media. By defining
 collective identities as the totality<br /> of such narratives I draw
 attention to their complex, and often fragmented and heterogeneous nature.
 My approach contrasts with much of the theorizing in this field which has
 tended to homogenize collective identities by emphasizing what is
 common<br /> or shared, failed to capture the interplay between different
 communities within organizations, and produced bland, undifferentiated
 empirical research. In particular, the theoretical framework that I
 outline focuses attention on the importance of "reflexivity, voice,
 plurivocity, temporality", and "fictionality" to an understanding of
 collective identities as locales for competing hegemonic claims. In
 combination, these notions form a unique conceptual model for theorizing
 and researching collective identities. This said, a narrative approach
 also has its limitations, and is proposed as an additional, not exclusive,
 interpretive lens. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2006.

Title: The Decision to Persist with Underperforming Alliances: The Role of Trust and Control 
Abstract:
 We draw on theories of persistence to develop a model of alliance
 managers' decisions towards persisting in underperforming alliances based
 on their concomitant consideration of the control and trust in those
 alliances. We test the model using experimental data based on 2,816
 decisions nested within 88 alliance managers. We find that output,
 behavioural and social control, competence and goodwill trust, and
 interactions between trust and control variables significantly explain
 alliance managers' decisions to persist in underperforming alliances. We
 discuss the implications of these findings for the control, trust and
 strategic alliance literatures. Copyright (c) Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2008.

Title: Dimensions of Social Capital and Firm Competitiveness Improvement: The Mediating Role of Information Sharing 
Abstract:
 This study investigates the mediating role of information sharing in the
 relationships between dimensions of social capital and firm
 competitiveness, thereby positing a possible explanation for the divergent
 empirical results of the social capital-performance relationship in the
 existing literature. The study uses a sample of 108 Hong Kong-based
 Chinese family-owned firms from the manufacturing sector. Largely
 supporting the theoretical predictions, the results from multiple
 regression and structural equation model tests show that information
 sharing plays a mediating role in the relationships between three
 dimensions of social capital (trust, network ties, and repeated
 transactions) and firm competitiveness improvement. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2007.

Title: A Tale of Three Discourses: The Dominant, the Strategic and the Marginalized 
Abstract:
 This study drew from a structurational view of discourse and employed a
 discourse analysis approach based on rhetoric and hermeneutics to analyse
 the organizational discourses operating in the UK operations of a global
 human resources consulting firm, People Associates. The aims were firstly
 to understand in what sense we can speak of 'modes of discourse' in
 organizational settings; secondly to explore the potential existence and
 nature of interrelations among different modes of discourse; and thirdly
 to explore the constructive potential of modes of discourse on their
 social and organizational contexts. The results suggest that modes of
 discourse can usefully be seen as rhetorical enthymemes constituted of
 relatively stable, normative structures and flexible, action-oriented
 structures; that modes of discourse can interrelate through their deeper
 structural features, and can have mutually co-optive or antagonistic
 relationships; and lastly that the constructive potential of discourse is
 based primarily on its deeper structures, and on the consonance of surface
 communicative actions with these structures. This research thus sheds
 light on fundamental definitional and substantive issues in organizational
 discourse; in particular offering a novel conceptualization of the nature
 of discourse, a further understanding of discursive interrelations, and
 finally one way to understand its constructive effects on social
 organizations. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2006.

Title: A Final Word on Edith Penrose 
Abstract:
 Rugman and Verbeke (2002) established that Edith Penrose's contribution to
 the resource-based view in strategic management has been misunderstood by
 many scholars in the field. The present paper augments this analysis, and
 demonstrates that Penrose did not view the pursuit of rents as a
 worthwhile endeavour. Penrose did build on a number of conceptual
 foundations of neo-classical economics, and accepted the profit-maximizing
 assumption as largely consistent with the pursuit of an optimal growth
 path. But optimal growth, not the pursuit of rents, was the focus of her
 analysis. In addition, Edith Penrose's real normative agenda was the
 increase of societal welfare at the macro-level through innovation at the
 firm-level. Penrose's work on multinational enterprises shows that she had
 a strong preference for eliminating rents that would accrue to large
 multinational firms at the expense of local firms in host countries. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2004.

Title: Offshoring in the New Global Political Economy 
Abstract:
 This essay challenges claims by economists and management scholars that
 'offshoring' is simply another form of trade with mutual benefits. I argue
 that reducing wages through offshoring leads to wealth creation for
 shareholders but not necessarily for countries and employees, and that
 many displaced workers have difficulty 'trading up' to higher skilled
 jobs. Offshoring is a new phenomenon that entails the organizational and
 technological ability to relocate specific tasks and coordinate a
 geographically dispersed network of activities. It decouples the linkages
 between economic value creation and geographic location. The result is the
 creation of global commodity markets for particular skills and a shift in
 the balance of market power among firms, workers, and countries. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005.

 How do incumbent firms and environments co-evolve and how are firm-level
 adaptation and selection at industry level interrelated? Can and do large
 established organizations renew themselves to adapt to their environment?
 Three single-lens theories, relating to environmental selection,
 institutional theory, managerial intentionality, and a co-evolutionary
 perspective are used to investigate strategic renewal of incumbent firms.
 We derive propositions and distinguish between three dimensions of
 strategic renewal and develop metrics to investigate our propositions in a
 multi-level, multi-country, longitudinal study of the European financial
 services industry. Copyright 2003 Blackwell Publishing Ltd..

Title: The Bridge to the 'Real World': Applied Science or a 'Schizophrenic Tour de Force'? 
Abstract:
 This article concerns those publications which have received considerable
 attention in an academic as well as in a practical context. In these rare
 cases, it seems that it was possible to transfer scientific findings more
 or less directly into managerial implications. This widely shared view is
 contrasted with a socials systems perspective. From this point of view
 there cannot be a direct application of scientific knowledge. This also
 holds true for the classic examples of applied science. It is argued that
 even in these cases there is no evidence of linear knowledge transfer but
 rather 'Applied Science Fiction' (ASF). ASF comprises all techniques with
 which the scientific system reacts to external application pressure
 without having to relinquish its own self-referential logic. Different
 forms of ASF are introduced. These are retrofitting, reputation, symbolic
 labels and undisciplined eclecticism. The ASF-concept will be illustrated
 by Michael Porter's "Competitive Strategy". Paradoxically, however, the
 conventional concept of application and ASF are a barrier for the
 sustainable relevance of management studies. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2004.

Title: Participative Leadership by American and Chinese Managers in China: The Role of Relationships 
Abstract:
  Developing participative leadership may be particularly challenging when
 managers are working cross-culturally and in China. One hundred and
 sixty-three Chinese employees from various industries in mainland China
 were surveyed about their relationships and the effectiveness of their
 participation with American and Chinese managers. Results, including
 structural equation analyses, support the hypotheses that cooperative, but
 not competitive or independent, goals helped Chinese employees and their
 foreign and Chinese managers strengthen their quality relationships as
 measured by supervisor-subordinate guanxi and leader-membership exchange;
 quality relationships in turn enhanced effective participative leadership
 as measured by the opportunity for joint decision-making and the
 open-minded discussion of opposing views (constructive controversy).
 Results suggest that cooperative goals and the Chinese value of guanxi may
 be important for overcoming obstacles and developing participative
 leadership within and across cultural boundaries. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2006.

Title: An Examination of the Factors that Influence Whether Newcomers Protect or Share Secrets of their Former Employers 
Abstract:
 This research investigated the factors that influence a decision that is
 often faced by employees who have made a transition from one organization
 to another: the decision about whether to protect secrets of their former
 employer or to share them with their new co-workers. A total of 111
 employees from two high-tech companies participated in interviews. Their
 comments were analysed and, based on both relevant literature and the
 results of that analysis, a theory of the factors that influence
 newcomers' protect vs. share decisions was developed. According to that
 theory, newcomers first decide whether or not information is a trade
 secret of their former employer by considering (1) whether the information
 is part of their own knowledge, and (2) whether the information is
 publicly available, general, and negative (about something that did not
 work). If newcomers decide the information is a trade secret, they then
 evaluate (1) the degree to which their obligations are biased towards
 their former or new employer, and (2) the degree to which they identify
 more strongly with their former or new employer. Newcomers whose
 obligations and identifications are biased towards a new employer are more
 likely to share secrets. If these obligations and identifications are
 balanced, newcomers may share information in a way that allows them to
 believe they are fulfilling their responsibilities to both their former
 and their new employers. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2007.

Title: Within and Beyond Communities of Practice: Making Sense of Learning Through Participation, Identity and Practice 
Abstract:
 Situated learning theory offers a radical critique of cognitivist theories
 of learning, emphasizing the relational aspects of learning within
 communities of practice in contrast to the individualist assumptions of
 conventional theories. However, although many researchers have embraced
 the theoretical strength of situated learning theory, conceptual issues
 remain undeveloped in the literature. Roberts, for example, argues in this
 issue that the notion of 'communities of practice'- a core concept in
 situated learning theory - is itself problematic. To complement her
 discussion, this paper explores the communities of practice concept from
 several perspectives. Firstly, we consider the perspective of the
 individual learner, and examine the processes which constitute 'situated
 learning'. Secondly, we consider the broader socio-cultural context in
 which communities of practice are embedded. We argue that the cultural
 richness of this broader context generates a fluidity and heterogeneity
 within and beyond communities. Finally, we argue that it is sometimes
 difficult to distinguish conceptually between the terms 'participation'
 and 'practice' because of occasional duplication of meaning. We propose,
 instead, a refinement of the definition to allow for greater conceptual
 clarity. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2006.

Title: Change, Change or Be Exchanged: The Discourse of Participation and the Manufacture of Identity 
Abstract:
 Promoting participation is an accepted and expected component of
 managerial activity, reflecting current management ideology and practice.
 This paper explores how one particular group of supervisors, within the
 same UK manufacturing organization, experience and make sense of
 participation practices and the role of identity in that process. Our
 findings show that whilst supervisors may utilize the managerial discourse
 in formal settings they also draw upon three alternative responses. Thus
 contrary to much of the literature they do not represent a homogenous or
 univocal grouping. Our study highlights the importance of the competing
 bases of identity formation that supervisors draw from, and the complexity
 and contradiction inherent in both the managerial discourse and in
 supervisors' responses to it. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2006.

Title: The Multiple Boundaries of the Firm 
Abstract:
 The notion of firm boundaries has received considerable attention in
 theories of the firm that address the problems of investment incentives
 and mitigation of hold-up problems. In this paper we attempt to develop a
 different approach to the problem of vertical firm boundaries, based on
 recent advances in the capabilities view of the firm. Our arguments rely
 on the pioneering insights of Penrose, Richardson and Loasby to elaborate
 a view of the boundaries determined by the interaction of the firm's
 direct and indirect capabilities with other actors. We develop the notion
 of indirect capabilities to highlight how firm boundaries respond to the
 distribution of capabilities in the economy as well as the modes of access
 to complementary and external capabilities. We conclude that the evolution
 of firm boundaries must be understood in the context of decisions on how
 the firm relates to other actors in its environment. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2003.

Title: Knowledge Stocks and Information Flows in New Product Development 
Abstract:
 Although firms increasingly invest in systems (e.g. ISO, knowledge
 centres, IT systems) for utilizing stored knowledge and acquiring market
 information during new product development, few manage to benefit from
 these investments. To explore this issue, we suggest that firms rely on
 two distinct types of "knowledge stocks"- procedural and declarative
 memory - that affect new product short-term financial performance and
 creativity in distinct ways. Additionally, we suggest that internal or
 external "information flows" can have distinct moderating impact on the
 memory types-product outcomes relationship. Our empirical study of product
 development activities indicates that there is an inverted U-shaped
 relationship between procedural memory and product outcomes as well as a
 positive relationship between declarative memory and financial
 performance. Also procedural and declarative memory may work in a
 "complementary" fashion enhancing both outcomes. Finally, procedural
 memory is found to reduce the value of internal or external information
 flows for product creativity. These findings have important implications
 for the organizational knowledge, capabilities, and product development
 literatures as well as for practice and they open ways for future
 research. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2004.

Title: Invoking Satan or the Ethics of the Employment Contract 
Abstract:
 Studies of mergers of organizations focus upon the financial and economic
 outcomes, with little attention paid to the effect on the people working
 in the merging organizations. This paper reports the findings of a study
 of the impact on managers of an organizational merger. Rather than the
 cool calculations of accountants and economists and the rational
 application of a managerial logic, we found the impact on these managers
 was upon their emotions, which seemed sometimes too buffeted to allow them
 to continue in their work. A narrative analysis of the stories told by
 these managers suggested they experienced their involvement with the
 merging organizations as akin to a Faustian contract, whereby they had
 sold their souls to the organizational devil and were now reaping the
 costs. When we came to write this paper we found that using the usual
 rubrics of academic writing suppressed the sheer emotionality of their
 experiences. We have therefore followed the imperative of our conclusions,
 and written our analysis in the form of a play, based upon Christopher
 Marlowe's "Dr Faustus", which allows us to use our interviewees' own words
 to illustrate the impact of the merger. The play is, of course, in the
 format of a tragedy: it has four main characters - the narrator, the
 manager, Faustus and Mephistopheles - and five acts. We use the Prologue
 to insert our own words, where we argue for a turn away from the 'hard'
 school of human resource management towards one that is ethically
 informed. Programme notes contain the technical details which justify our
 research methods. We remain totally unapologetic for intruding emotions
 into the rational world of academia. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2003.

Title: Framing the Field of Homeland Security: The Case of Norway 
Abstract:
 This paper takes as a point of departure a notion of reorganization as a
 way of managing risk. It examines the reorganization process in the
 Norwegian central administration for homeland security. As a central theme
 the paper explores why the proposal to radically reorganize the
 administration by replacing a network model with a hierarchical model
 resulted in a much more modest change to a hybrid agency model. The
 descriptive part of the paper traces the reorganization process, starting
 with the initiative taken by the Ministry of Justice in 1999 to establish
 a public commission and ending with the final parliamentary resolution in
 2002. Despite the 9/11 terrorist attack that occurred in the middle of the
 process and its implications for security, only minor changes were made to
 existing arrangements. A striking feature of the process was negative
 coordination, indicating that the wish to coordinate was greater than the
 willingness to be coordinated. To understand why this was so, we look at
 bureaucratic politics and bargaining between different interests, at
 institutional identities and strong cultures and traditions within
 different governmental bodies. We focus especially on framing processes
 within and between organizational fields. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2006.

Title: The Antecedents of Middle Managers' Strategic Contribution: The Case of a Professional Bureaucracy 
Abstract:
 Our study contributes towards a burgeoning literature that argues
 organizational performance is heavily influenced by what happens in the
 middle of the organization, rather than at the top. Examining the UK
 National Health Service, our study develops the work of Floyd and
 Wooldridge (1992, 1994, 1997, 2000). It utilizes role theory to
 conceptualize changing experiences of middle managers in organizations as
 a role transition. Associated with this are problems of role conflict and
 role ambiguity (Biddle, 1979, 1986; Biddle and Thomas, 1966; Kahn et al.,
 1964, 1966). Our study illustrates that there are limiting factors to a
 more strategic role for middle managers associated with the professional
 bureaucracy context. However, role conflict and ambiguity can be mediated
 by a socialization process, which values incoming identity and personal
 characteristics (Van Maanen and Schein, 1979). Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005.

Title: High Commitment Management and Payment Systems 
Abstract:
 This paper extends the analysis of high commitment management (HGM)
 reported in a previous "Journal of Management Studies" article (Wood and
 Albanese, volume 32, number 2) by examining its linkage to payment
 systems. It opens with an overview of what the literature on HCM portrays
 as the pay systems that are most compatible with it. Then it reports
 research, based on data from a representative sample of manufacturing
 plants in the UK, which examines what pay systems in practice are used in
 conjunction with HCM. It also assesses whether, as we might expect, plants
 using piecework and individual bonuses are less likely to adopt such an
 approach. Finally, the paper examines whether changes in payment systems
 are made as managements attempt to heighten their use of HCM. Copyright 1996 Basil Blackwell Ltd.

Title: Internal Market Failure: A Framework for Diagnosing Firm Inefficiency 
Abstract:
 The theory of market and government failure can be used to diagnose
 inefficiency within firms and to identify strategies to deal with these
 problems. Internal market failures (IMFs) - internal public good problems,
 internal negative and positive externalities, internal information
 asymmetries, internal monopolies, the presence of uncertainty - create
 inefficiencies within firms just as they do in normal markets. As well,
 self-interested behaviour by executives and internal interest groups
 (rent-seeking) are analogous to government, or governance, failures
 (IGFs). Associated with many of these internal market failure problems are
 generic solutions that can usefully inform executives in their efforts to
 improve efficiency within the firm. Internal governance failures, in
 contrast, normally require action by shareholders and boards of directors. Copyright 2003 Blackwell Publishing Ltd..

Title: The Moderating Effect of CEO Power on the Board Composition-Firm Performance Relationship 
Abstract:
 Prior studies of the relationship between the composition of boards of
 directors and firm performance offer equivocal results. Drawing on agency
 and power circulation theories, we attempt to reduce this equivocality by
 asserting that CEO power moderates the relationship. Specifically, an
 outside director dominated board is needed to check a powerful CEO, but
 monitoring by other executives provides sufficient constraints on CEOs
 with low power. We used event study methodology to test the effects of the
 interaction between board composition and CEO power on stock market
 reaction to 73 unexpected CEO deaths. We found support for our theorizing
 among two of three sources of CEO power. Thus, although regulatory trends
 increasingly support outside director dominated boards, our findings
 indicate that this may not always benefit shareholders and that CEO power
 should be considered when constructing boards. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2007.

Title: The Influence of Decision, Environmental and Firm Characteristics on the Rationality of Strategic Decision-Making 
Abstract:
 This paper develops an integrated model of strategic decision-making
 rationality. The model is informed by three perspectives that respectively
 identify decision, environmental and firm characteristics as influences on
 the rationality of decision processes. The results of a study in Egypt
 indicate that the rationality of strategic decision-making processes is
 shaped by variables identified by all three perspectives, and that such
 decision processes cannot adequately be modelled in terms of a single
 perspective only. However, the study also suggests that the three
 perspectives do not contribute in equal measure to explaining strategic
 decision making, and that the national setting is relevant for the extent
 to which strategic decision-makers take account of environmental
 characteristics. The location of the investigation in Egypt highlights
 some deviations from previous research that could be attributed to
 nation-specific factors, both cultural and institutional. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2007.

Title: Co-evolution in an Institutionalized Environment 
Abstract:
 This paper examines the extent to which co-evolution can take place within
 a heavily constrained environment and how changes in the degree of
 institutionalization are relevant to opportunities for exercising
 strategic choice at the level of the firm. It addresses these questions
 through a detailed case study of a major Brazilian telecommunications
 company, Telemig, covering its life span of 27 years from 1973 to 2000.
 The insights obtained advance the theory of co-evolution by incorporating
 a political dimension of how organizations are transformed into new forms.
 In the case studied, new forms arose with radical changes in the rules
 affecting competition and with de-institutionalization of the economic
 regime by coalitions of actors who were strategically located in networks
 that crossed system levels. Although the Telemig case presents
 circumstances different to those usually addressed by studies of
 co-evolution, it nevertheless points to the virtues of combining a
 strategic choice approach with one that focuses on the isomorphic effects
 of institutional constraints. Copyright 2003 Blackwell Publishing Ltd..

Title: Reflections on the 'Realist Turn' in Organization and Management Studies 
Abstract:
 This paper has three objectives. First, to provide an exposition of the
 'realist turn' in contemporary organization and management studies.
 Second, to assess the detailed implications of this incipient 'realist
 turn' for the underlying explanatory principles and practices that should
 inform organization and management studies as a social scientific field.
 Third, to evaluate the potential, longer-term, impact of these explanatory
 principles and practices in an intellectual context where anti-realist
 ontologies and epistemologies have been dominant. This will entail a
 critique of contemporary approaches that draw on a social constructionist
 ontology and a postmodernist epistemology. Overall, the paper concludes
 that the 'realist turn' creates a significant intellectual opportunity and
 space in which the historical sociology of dynamic organizational forms
 and managerial control regimes can be rediscovered and renewed. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005.

Title: The Diffusion of Management Innovations: The Possibilities and Limitations of Memetics 
Abstract:
 This paper applies a theory of memetics to help explain the diffusion of
 management innovations as a dynamic evolutionary process. Existing
 analyses of diffusion frequently note the variation, selection or
 replication of management innovations, yet few have linked these together
 with the common observation that some innovations seem to 'evolve'. This
 paper draws on qualitative evidence from two case-studies of BPR
 implementation to illustrate that the replication, selection and variation
 of management innovations can form evolutionary algorithms ('memes') which
 support diffusion processes, and, in doing so, clarifies the ways in which
 innovations contribute to their own replication and explains how the high
 'failure' rates associated with BPR can sometimes improve its chances of
 reproduction. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2007.

Title: Temporary Liaisons: The Commitment of 'Temps' Towards Their Agencies 
Abstract:
 The majority of research on organizational commitment has focused on
 commitment in traditional, ongoing and open-ended relationships. The
 commitment of employees in non-standard work arrangements such as
 temporary employment has been subject to much less theoretical and
 empirical investigation. In this study, we examine the affective and
 continuance commitment of temporary workers towards their agency and its
 determinants. We distinguish two groups of determinants: the process by
 which the temporary worker chose a particular agency and the support
 provided by the agency. The findings can be summarized as follows: (1)
 affective commitment among temps is generally higher than their
 continuance commitment; (2) having more alternative agencies to choose
 from (i.e., "volition") does not enhance the commitment of temporary
 workers; (3) a "public" choice for a particular agency raises both types
 of commitment, whereas the "perceived agency dependence created by the
 choice" increases continuance, but not affective commitment; and (4) both
 types of commitment are positively influenced by agency "supportiveness",
 reflected in the way the agency deals with problems, the career support it
 provides, and the way it keeps in close contact with its temporary
 workers. Finally, the results suggest that factors raising affective
 commitment may 'spill over' to increase continuance commitment. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005.

Title: Are German, Japanese and Anglo-Saxon Strategic Decision Styles Still Divergent in the Context of Globalization? 
Abstract:
 Issues of globalization and divergence in terms of national systems and
 cultures are equally contentious, yet equally important, in the context of
 increasing cross-continental co-operation. This article investigates
 comparative strategic decision styles in Britain, the USA, Germany and
 Japan. An industry at an advanced stage in terms of globalization, vehicle
 components manufacture, was selected in order to explore the extent of
 convergence and whether this has changed. Between 1989 and 1998, field
 case studies were made of 100 strategic investment decisions (SIDs) by
 manufacturers in these four countries. Longitudinal judgements were
 supplemented by earlier comparative strategy field research carried out in
 60 suppliers between 1980 and 1983, and two longitudinal case studies, one
 from the UK and one from Japan, interviewed throughout both these periods
 and again in 2002. Two competing hypotheses, derived from rich research
 literatures, are investigated. The first (H1) suggests that national
 institutional and cultural factors exert profound differences, and should
 therefore be afforded more significance as globalization proceeds further.
 The second (H2) is apparently contradictory and emphasizes that
 institutions and organizations are likely to respond to convergence
 pressures, spurred by global capital markets and competition on the one
 hand, and a diffusion of 'professional management' practices on the other.
 Japanese firms generally, and German family firms in particular, were
 still found to exhibit deep-rooted differences from the Anglo-Saxon model,
 which appears to confirm H1. However study of German public companies
 reveals that their strategic approaches are far less divergent from what
 is now an increasingly consistent Anglo-Saxon model than they were a
 decade ago, which appears to confirm the competing hypothesis H2. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005.

Title: A Multi-Theoretical Model of Knowledge Transfer in Organizations: Determinants of Knowledge Contribution and Knowledge Reuse 
Abstract:
 Knowledge has become one of the most important sources of competitive
 advantage for firms in many industries, particularly those in which firms
 provide knowledge services to their clients. Many knowledge intensive
 firms have spent enormous amounts of time and money trying to find ways to
 better manage their knowledge resources. Effective leveraging of knowledge
 resources through the transfer and reuse of existing knowledge is an
 important aspect of most knowledge management systems. In this study we
 argue that the effectiveness of intrafirm knowledge transfer based on the
 reuse of existing knowledge depends on two key factors: (1) the
 willingness of individuals to contribute their knowledge to the system;
 and (2) the rate at which individuals access and reuse knowledge within
 the system. Here we use social exchange theory to develop a model of the
 factors that will impact the frequency with which individuals contribute
 their knowledge to the system. Additionally, we use expectancy theory to
 develop a model of the factors that lead to knowledge reuse. Results of
 hypothesis tests using data collected from a multinational services firm
 support our multi-theoretical model, and suggest ways in which the model
 might be refined. We discuss the implications of these findings for
 further theory building and for managers engaged in the development and
 improvement of knowledge management systems. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2006.

Title: Human Resource Management and the Permeable Organization: The Case of the Multi-Client Call Centre 
Abstract:
 Despite the interest over recent years in the fragmentation of
 organizations and the development of contracting, little attention has
 been paid to the impact of the associated inter-organizational
 relationships on the internal organization of employment.
 Inter-organizational relations have been introduced primarily as a means
 of externalizing - and potentially rendering invisible - employment issues
 and employment relations. In a context where inter-organizational
 relationships appear to be growing in volume and diversity, this
 constitutes a significant gap in the literature that this paper in part
 aims to fill. The purpose of the paper is two-fold: to develop a framework
 for considering the internal and external organizational influences on
 employment and to apply this framework within a case study of a
 multi-client outsourcing call centre. We explore the interactions between
 internal objectives, client demands and the use of external contracting in
 relation to three dimensions of employment policy: managing the
 wage-effort bargain, managing flexibility and managing commitment and
 performance. It is the interplay between these factors in a dynamic
 context that provides, we suggest, the basis for a more general framework
 for considering human resource policy in permeable organizations. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2004.

Title: CEO Portraits and the Authenticity Paradox 
Abstract:
 Top executive and CEO portraits represent significant sites for the visual
 construction of corporate identity and image, but they also highlight what
 we call the authenticity paradox. At first glance such photographs may
 appear to convey an impression of the kind of authentic presence many
 consider crucial for establishing a strong corporate image. But a closer
 look at the constructed nature of both CEO identity and portrait
 photography lays bare the elusive nature of authenticity itself, as well
 as the way that CEO portraits can function also to expose the
 corporation's chronic lack of authenticity. We explore the authenticity
 paradox and its implications by means of an analysis of executive
 portraits taken by one prominent Danish photographer, Per Morten
 Abrahamsen. We also map out an agenda for the further exploration of CEO
 portraits and images as an important element in the social and symbolic
 construction of business leadership. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005.

Title: Examining the Relationships Between Monitoring and Incentives in Corporate Governance 
Abstract:
 Agency theory focuses on monitoring and incentives as two solutions to
 agency problems. Prior research suggests that monitoring and incentives
 may act either as substitutes or as complements, and that the context of
 the agency relationship plays a major role in determining the direction of
 the relationship between them. In a corporate governance setting, we
 contend that board information and boards' usage of CEO control mechanisms
 are best viewed as complements. Thus, we hypothesize that boards'
 information gathering behaviour will be positively related to boards'
 usage of CEO control mechanisms. Using primary and secondary data from 149
 US firms, we find that increases in boards' information gathering are
 associated with increases in boards' usage of managerial controls. These
 findings suggest that information and managerial control mechanisms act as
 complements in the governance context, and that boards take a variety of
 actions to protect the interests of shareholders. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2007.

Title: Firm and Group Influences on Venture Capital Firms' Involvement in New Ventures 
Abstract:
 Drawing on expectancy, equity, and collective effort theories, we argue
 that the level of involvement of individual firms in multifirm alliances
 depends on both individual firms' self-focused interests and factors
 stemming from the firms' membership in the alliance group. We apply our
 theoretical arguments to the context of venture capital syndicates and
 test the hypotheses using data about 160 venture capital firms (VCFs)
 drawn from a survey instrument and a secondary data source. The results
 show that individual firms' involvement in a multifirm alliance is
 somewhat dominated by group effects; specifically, financial stake
 relative to that of the group and the reputation of the other group
 members significantly influence the focal firm's involvement. However,
 focal firms' involvement relates negatively to their own reputation. We
 discuss the implications of these findings for future research. Our
 results imply that firms in multiparty alliances pay attention to the
 characteristics of their alliance partnership to calibrate their own
 behaviour. In our specific setting, VCF involvement in syndicates depends
 more on relative syndicate characteristics than on the focal firm's
 absolute level of investment. Further, because reputation is negatively
 associated with involvement, entrepreneurs and potential syndicate
 entrants should ensure that they fully leverage VCF reputation to achieve
 their goals. Copyright (c) Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2008.

Title: The Effects of Empowerment on Attitudes and Performance: The Role of Social Support and Empowerment Beliefs 
Abstract:
 This paper reports the results of a randomized field experiment that
 tested the effects of an empowerment intervention among unit managers of a
 large trucking company. The intervention was designed to increase
 participants' beliefs in their personal control and self-efficacy with
 regard to key aspects of their jobs. Individuals who managed
 geographically dispersed profit centres were randomly assigned to either
 an intervention group (N&thinsp;&equals;&thinsp;38) or a no-treatment
 control group (N&thinsp;&equals;&thinsp;30). The intervention
 significantly increased perceptions of maintenance control and impact at
 four months after the intervention, but only for those managers who felt
 that their supervisors were supportive. The intervention also improved
 archival measures of unit performance and affected work attitudes
 (depending upon the level of perceived supervisory support). The data
 point out the key role that perceived supervisor social support plays when
 implementing such organizational change interventions. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2007.

Title: National Cultural Influences on Knowledge Sharing: A Comparison of China and Russia 
Abstract:
 This paper presents a set of theoretical propositions regarding knowledge
 sharing in China and Russia. We argue that there are important national
 cultural similarities and differences between the two countries that
 result in certain similarities and differences in individual
 knowledge-sharing behaviour in Chinese and Russian organizations. We claim
 that vertical collectivism and particularistic social relations in China
 and Russia lead to intensive social relations among organizational
 members, which facilitate knowledge sharing between in-group members in
 organizations in both countries. We also maintain that differences in the
 essence of collectivism as well as in the extent of collectivism in the
 two cultural contexts lead to different intensities of knowledge sharing
 in Chinese and Russian organizations. Finally, we discuss theoretical and
 management implications of this research. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2006.

Title: Using Field-Configuring Events for Sense-Making: A Cognitive Network Approach 
Abstract:
 We explore the usefulness of network analytical techniques to reveal the
 structure of shared cognitions among participants at a field-configuring
 event. Using transcripts from a professional conference at a pivotal
 moment in the emergence of the Jewish lawyers group in pre-state Israel,
 we analyse the relationships of actors and topics raised at the 1944
 meeting. Our analysis demonstrates the underlying centrality of a subset
 of topics and actors that facilitated shared cognitive sense-making.
 Subsequent events are consistent with our interpretation that the revealed
 shared cognitions helped mobilize changes in the organizational field and
 its institutional logic, including growth in the Jewish legal profession
 and Jewish judges, use of Hebrew in courts, and establishment of an
 Israeli bar. Copyright (c) Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2008.

Title: Market Orientation and Performance: A Meta-Analysis and Cross-National Comparisons 
Abstract:
 Quantitative evidence drawn from a meta-analysis of 56 studies (58
 samples) conducted in 28 countries reveals that market orientation is a
 generic determinant of firm performance. However, stronger effects were
 found for studies set in large, mature markets and when market orientation
 was measured using Kohli, Jaworski and Kumar's (1993) MARKOR scale. The
 meta-analysis also revealed that the value of a market orientation weakens
 in proportion to the cultural distance separating the home market from the
 USA. This study thus extends previous research by: (1) providing evidence
 of measurement moderators that inhibit the generalization of results
 obtained from studies using different scales and performance variables;
 (2) establishing benchmark effect sizes for specific regions around the
 world; and (3) revealing that the managerial value of a market orientation
 is significantly affected by the cultural and economic characteristics of
 the host country. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2006.

Title: The Impact of Profit Sharing on the Performance of Financial Services Firms 
Abstract:
 Relying on macro theories (agency and organizational control) as well as
 micro theories (goal setting and expectancy), this study investigates the
 impact of profit-sharing plan (PSP) adoption on the value creation process
 of financial services firms. The study relies on a comprehensive
 methodological approach that is both quantitative, with a dual
 cross-sectional/longitudinal (pre-post) design that compares PSP adopters
 with a control group of PSP non-adopter firms, and qualitative through
 interviews with some adopting firms' managing directors. Results show that
 firms adopting a PSP enhance their profitability in comparison to both
 their own prior performance and to firms that are not adopting a PSP.
 Results also show that the adoption of a PSP: (a) positively influences
 only profit drivers that are under employee control; and (b) is more
 likely to have a long term, positive impact on external profit drivers
 than on internal profit drivers. Qualitative data from field interviews
 corroborate and enrich these quantitative findings. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005.

Title: An Empirical Exploration of Decision-making Under Agency Controls and Stewardship Structure 
Abstract:
 Two theories have emerged in the managerial control literature as to the
 best way for organizations to ensure that managers are acting in the
 firm's best interest: agency theory, which stresses controlling
 decision-makers through monitoring and incentives aligned with
 organizational goals, and stewardship theory, which stresses that
 decision-makers will act in the organization's best interest even in the
 absence of controls. Much of the research investigating the utility of
 these two positions is based on archival data where actual decision-making
 can only be inferred. In this study, we utilize a laboratory methodology
 in order to determine if decision-makers actually make different decisions
 when under the types of control (or lack thereof) suggested in these two
 theories. The results of this study show that individuals under agency
 controls invest more in alternatives that maximize profits of an
 organization than individuals under stewardship controls. Copyright 2003 Blackwell Publishing Ltd..

Abstract:
 The purpose of this paper is to critically explore the communities of
 practice approach to managing knowledge and its use among management
 academics and practitioners in recent years. In so doing, the aim is to
 identify the limits of the approach in the field of knowledge management.
 The paper begins with a brief description of the communities of practice
 approach. This is followed by a review of critiques of the approach
 evident in the management literature. A number of further challenges are
 then elaborated. The limits of communities of practice are subsequently
 discussed and brief conclusions drawn. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2006.

Abstract:
 We argue that Rugman and Verbeke (2002) underestimate the importance of
 Penrose's (1959) contributions to the modern resource-based view of the
 firm. In particular, we take issue with Rugman and Verbeke's (2002)
 arguments concerning Penrose's (1959) contributions to our knowledge of:
 (1) the "creation" of competitive advantage, (2) "sustaining" competitive
 advantage, (3) isolating mechanisms, and (4) competitive advantage and
 economic rents. In our response, we show that Penrose (1959) has both
 "directly" and indirectly influenced the modern resource-based view of
 strategic management. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2004.

Title: Firm Performance, Governance Structure, and Top Management Turnover in a Transitional Economy 
Abstract:
 Recent research has argued that political and regulatory environments have
 a significant impact on corporate governance systems. In particular,
 countries with poor investor protection laws and weak law enforcement have
 low levels of corporate governance that manifests itself in substandard
 financial performance, management entrenchment, and the expropriation of
 minority shareholders. One implication of this research is that China will
 have poor corporate governance and entrenched managers as its legal system
 is relatively underdeveloped and inefficient. However, using data on top
 management turnover in China's listed firms, our results refute the
 prediction of entrenched management. We find evidence of very high
 turnover of company chairmen and there are many cases that we interpret to
 be forced departures. Our results show that chairman turnover is related
 to a firm's profitability but not to its stock returns.
 Turnover-performance sensitivity is higher if legal entities are major
 shareholders but the proportion of non-executive directors perversely
 affects it. We find no evidence that profitability improves after a change
 in chairman and this suggests that a firm's governance structure is
 ineffective as it is unable to recruit suitable replacements that can turn
 around its financial performance. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2006.

Title: In Search of Theory Development in Grounded Investigations: Doctors' Experiences of Managing as an Example of Fitted and Prospective Theorizing 
Abstract:
 This article draws on a study of doctors' experiences of clinical managing
 to highlight research conventions that limit the development and use of
 middle range theories in grounded studies. Using sensemaking and the
 psychological contract as example frameworks, we illustrate how customary
 deductive evaluations of middle range theories turn grounded researchers
 away from theory building. As a correction to these conventions, we offer
 an inductive approach to building existing theory in grounded
 investigations that does not depend solely on working with frameworks
 under different empirical conditions. We suggest that forward theorizing
 is most likely to progress from a synthesis of fitted explanation and
 prospective thinking that presses at the limits of the data's usefulness.
 To illustrate this approach, trialled thinking about novel theoretical
 juxtapositions and alternative sources was used in conjunction with our
 clinical director data. The value of this approach was supported in two
 ways. First, a number of fitted and prospective conjectures are offered
 about how social identity articulates with psychological contracts and
 sensemaking in role change situations. Second, new light is shed on the
 process by which particular social conditions differentially modify
 employees' social categorizations, and how these inform employee responses
 to the evolving experience of role change. The article concludes with some
 tentative proposals for promoting more discussion of theory building in
 grounded investigations. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2004.

Title: Globalfocusing: From Domestic Conglomerates to Global Specialists 
Abstract:
 Globalization is changing the competitive terrain on which companies
 develop their corporate strategy. On the global stage, key competitive
 advantages are gained through internationally fungible resources.
 Consequently, diversified conglomerates are converting to global
 specialists in narrower niche markets and competing with a small number of
 multinational enterprises operating worldwide. Their
 "internationalization" and their reduction of product "diversification"
 are opposite sides of the same coin: "globalfocusing". I extend Penrosian
 resource-based theory to analyse this change process, notably by
 distinguishing country and industry specificity of firms' core
 competences, and by integrating divestment as part of firm growth
 processes. Globalfocusing is driven by shifts in the relative importance
 of country-specific and industry-specific resources and capabilities due
 to changes in the internal and external environment, notably the
 globalization of markets and supply chains. The argument is developed
 using case studies of restructuring of two Danish manufacturing
 enterprises. On this basis, I analyse the forces driving globalfocusing
 processes and suggest propositions for empirical testing. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2006.

Title: Knowledge Communities and Knowledge Collectivities: A Typology of Knowledge Work in Groups 
Abstract:
 The notion of a 'community-of-practice' (CmP) has become a highly
 influential way of conceptualizing how decentralized sub-units or groups
 within firms or organizations operate. CmPs refer to 'tightly knit' groups
 that have been practising together long enough to develop into a cohesive
 community with relationships of mutuality and shared understandings. The
 CmP notion, however, does not fit squarely with how temporary
 organizations or project organizations operate. Typically these kinds of
 groups consist of diversely skilled individuals, most of whom have not met
 before, who have to solve a problem or carry out a pre-specified task
 within tightly set limits as to time and costs. As a result they tend to
 become less well-developed groups, operating on a minimal basis of shared
 knowledge and understandings. Such a group, I suggest, constitutes a
 'collectivity-of-practice' (ClP). Mirroring the above distinctions, two
 ideal-type notions of epistemology are developed. The one inspired from
 the CmP literature is discussed in a 'knowledge community' terminology,
 whereas the one associated with ClPs is conceived of as a 'knowledge
 collectivity'. Finally, I outline some new options for organizational
 analysis made possible by recognizing these as two different and
 complementary notions. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005.

Title: Refashioning Organizational Boundaries: Outsourcing Customer Service Work 
Abstract:
 In recent years there has been a discernible trend towards the outsourcing
 and subcontracting of work. However, there has been very little empirical
 research on employees' attitudes to work in outsourced firms. This study
 is conducted in the area of call centre services where there has been a
 substantial growth in the provision of external market suppliers. It
 examines employees' perceptions of their work and employment arrangements
 in both an in-house producer and an external service provider and
 identifies and compares the factors that shape their organizational
 commitment and intentions to quit. The research found that the character
 of the internal labour market and the nature of the work regime were more
 important explanations of organizational commitment and intentions to quit
 in the external market supplier than in the in-house producer. The paper
 discusses the implications of these findings for the quality of customer
 service provided under subcontracting arrangements. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2006.

Title: A Modern Resource Based Approach to Unrelated Diversification 
Abstract:
 For over three decades, the questions of how and why an organization
 diversifies into related and unrelated businesses have drawn the attention
 of strategy scholars. However, explanations of unrelated diversification
 have been less than clear. A conceptual model of unrelated diversification
 is thus proposed. In drawing on Penrose's (1959) resource based approach,
 unrelated diversification is explained by an organization's 'three
 pillars', which consist of its strength of dynamic capabilities,
 absorptive capacity, and weak ties. The role of the three pillars is to
 discover new resource applications or uses in conditions of market failure
 that are characterized by 'incomplete' markets. A novel feature of this
 model is that an organization can diversify more broadly than predicted by
 Penrose (1959) and other modern resource-based approaches (Teece
 et&thinsp;al., 1997). Furthermore, unrelated diversification can be
 beneficial. This study also offers suggestions to measure the three
 pillars; its contributions and implications are discussed as well. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2007.

Title: Intellectual Capital Architectures and Ambidextrous Learning: A Framework for Human Resource Management 
Abstract:
 Both researchers and managers are increasingly interested in how firms can
 pursue ambidextrous learning; that is, simultaneously exploring new
 knowledge domains while exploiting current ones. Ambidextrous learning is
 derived from intellectual capital architectures that underlie unique
 configurations of human, social, and organizational capital. We identified
 two distinctive architectures of intellectual capital that facilitate
 ambidextrous learning. Refined interpolation is an architecture comprised
 of specialist human capital supplemented by cooperative social capital,
 and complemented by organic organizational capital. Disciplined
 extrapolation is an architecture comprised of generalist human capital,
 supplemented by entrepreneurial social capital, and complemented by
 mechanistic organizational capital. As organization contexts to support
 these architectures, we have also identified two alternative HR
 configurations that facilitate ambidextrous learning. One HR configuration
 combines job or function-based development, ILM-based employee relations,
 and error embracing performance/control systems to support refined
 interpolation. The other HR configuration combines skill-based
 development, market-based employee relations, and error avoiding
 performance/control systems to support disciplined extrapolation. Our
 framework may provide valuable theoretical implications for HRM systems
 regarding the issues of internal fits and best configurations. Copyright (c) Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2008.

Title: Ceo Locus of Control and Small Firm Performance: an Integrative Framework and Empirical Test 
Abstract:
 Previous research on the impact of chief executive officer (CEO) locus of
 control is mainly based on simple and partial mappings of bivariate
 associations between CEO locus of control and organizational outcomes. In
 addition, distinct substreams have emerged in which intricately related
 phenomena are studied separately. to overcome this fragmentation and
 polarization, we provide and empirically test an integrative framework
 based on previously tested hypotheses on the impact of CEO locus of
 control. Our approach differs from prior research in two ways. First, it
 simultaneously takes account of strategic choice and firm performance in
 order to assess the extent to which strategy mediates the relationship
 between CEO locus of control and organizational performance. Second, we
 consider the CEO to be both a formulator and implementor of organizational
 strategies. Besides the observation that CEO locus of control seems to
 matter a lot in terms of explaining organizational performance in the
 present sample, our results demonstrate that an integrative approach
 increases our insight into the impact of CEO locus of control by revealing
 why some CEOs achieve higher organizational performance than others. Copyright 1996 Basil Blackwell Ltd.

Title: Toggling with Taylor: A Different Approach to Reading a Management Text 
Abstract:
 This paper identifies influential, but previously unrecognized, subtexts
 in the writings of Frederick Winslow Taylor. Working with analytical
 methods developed from reader-response theories of literary criticism, we
 look "at" the words of the text as we share the standard meaning-making of
 the management community, as well as "through" the words of the text
 searching out the worldview that emerges from our particular reading of
 the subtext. We have described our approach to reading as 'toggling': that
 is, switching between reading text 'rhetorically' and reading it
 'philosophically'. We conclude that reader identification with textual
 voices may appear in philosophical as well as rhetorical reading outcomes
 - that Taylor's text may inveigle readers into accepting a moral worldview
 wrapped up in a seemingly rational argument - and that 'toggling' would
 empower management theory readers. Copyright 2003 Blackwell Science Asia Pty. Ltd..

Title: Entrepreneurship and Dynamic Capabilities: A Review, Model and Research Agenda 
Abstract:
 The emergent literature on dynamic capabilities and their role in value
 creation is riddled with inconsistencies, overlapping definitions, and
 outright contradictions. Yet, the theoretical and practical importance of
 developing and applying dynamic capabilities to sustain a firm's
 competitive advantage in complex and volatile external environments has
 catapulted this issue to the forefront of the research agendas of many
 scholars. In this paper, we offer a definition of dynamic capabilities,
 separating them from substantive capabilities as well as from their
 antecedents and consequences. We also present a set of propositions that
 outline (1) how substantive capabilities and dynamic capabilities are
 related to one another, (2) how this relationship is moderated by
 organizational knowledge and skills, (3) how organizational age affects
 the speed of utilization of dynamic capabilities and the learning mode
 used in organizational change, and (4) how organizational knowledge and
 market dynamism affect the likely value of dynamic capabilities. Our
 discussion and model help to delineate key differences in the dynamic
 capabilities that new ventures and established companies have, revealing a
 key source of strategic heterogeneity between these firms. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2006.

Title: CEO Experiences: Effects on the Choice of FDI Entry Mode 
Abstract:
 Drawing on the strategic management and international business
 literatures, this study examines the relationships between the experiences
 of newly selected CEOs and their choice of foreign direct investment (FDI)
 entry modes. Based on a sample<br /> of 380 foreign market entry events
 involving acquisitions, greenfield investments, and joint ventures, our
 findings indicate that CEOs with less firm experience preferred
 acquisitions and greenfield investments to joint ventures and, older CEOs
 were more likely to opt for joint ventures over greenfield investments. In
 addition, CEOs with throughput functional experience favoured acquisitions
 over joint ventures and greenfield investments. Finally, CEO international
 experience was associated with a greater propensity to choose greenfield
 investments and acquisitions over joint ventures and also greenfield
 investments over acquisitions. The implications of the findings from the
 perspective of theory and managerial practice are discussed, along with
 possible directions for future research. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2006.

Title: 'Citibankers' at Citigroup: A Study of the Loss of Institutional Trust after a Merger 
Abstract:
 In this paper, we present the results of a study of the loss of
 institutional trust following a merger. Specifically, we focus on how
 issues of organizational identity and identification processes contributed
 to the loss of institutional trust among a group of employees of Citigroup
 after its creation through the merger of Citicorp and Travelers. Our study
 makes two important contributions. First, we propose and demonstrate
 empirically that institutional trust, like interpersonal trust, can be
 identity-based. Second, adopting a narrative approach to organizational
 identity, we explore institutional trust in a post-merger context,
 highlighting how institutional trust is initially undermined after a
 merger by the ambiguity of the new organization's identity; and how later,
 once the identity of the new organization becomes less ambiguous,
 institutional trust can continue to be undermined by the absence of
 employees' identification with the new organization, especially among
 those who were highly-identified with their legacy organizations. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2008.

Title: 'The Path with the Heart': Creating the Authentic Career 
Abstract:
 This study contributes to the stream of boundaryless career research by
 detailing a theory of authenticity-driven career creation. The perspective
 developed here is grounded in an in-depth case study of the trajectory of
 a creative individual who has followed a very personal career path,
 remaining true to his creative calling. With authenticity work I denote
 the set of actions and interactions, which the creative individual
 undertakes to achieve a distinctive and true-to-self identity and image
 over time and across audiences. The study reveals that authenticity work
 is in the duality of identity expression and image manufacturing.
 Furthermore, it has some elements that are consistent over time and others
 that keep changing. I identify four stages through which authenticity
 plays a role in career creation: exploring aspects of multifaceted
 identity and image; narrowing down and focusing the identity expression
 and image manufacturing; enhancing one's control over the creative and
 business aspects of the artwork, and finally, a quest for professionalism.
 These stages are labelled exploration, focus, independence, and
 professionalism, respectively. They are embedded in a structural context
 that enables and constrains authenticity work. The resolution of the
 constraints by the creative individuals pushes their careers forward. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005.

Title: The Role of Perceived Organizational Performance in Organizational Identification, Adjustment and Job Performance 
Abstract:
 Favourable organizational status and prestige has a substantial role in
 shaping constituents' attitudes and actions. The status and prestige of an
 organization is often a reflection of its achievements or performance. In
 the present study, we investigate the role of organizational performance
 or achievement (as assessed by organizational members) in evoking
 employees' identification, adjustment, and job performance. The results of
 this study indicate that two forms of organizational performance (labelled
 as "perceived social responsibility and development" and "perceived market
 and financial performance") are associated with organizational
 identification. However, when compared to perceived market and financial
 performance, perceived social responsibility and development had a larger
 effect on organizational identification, which in turn resulted in
 enhanced employees' work outcomes - adjustment and job performance. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2007.

Title: An Exploration of How the Employee-Organization Relationship Affects the Linkage Between Perception of Developmental Human Resource Practices and Employee Outcomes 
Abstract:
 The purpose of the present study was to examine whether and how the
 quality of the employee-organization relationship (EOR) influences the
 relationship between employee perception of developmental human resource
 (HR) practices and employee outcomes. Analyses of 593 employees
 representing 64 local savings banks in Norway showed that four indicators
 of the EOR (perceived organizational support, affective organizational
 commitment, and procedural and interactional justice) moderated the
 relationship between perception of developmental HR practices and
 individual work performance. A strong and direct negative relationship was
 found between perception of developmental HR practices and turnover
 intention, but perceived procedural and interactional justice moderated
 this linkage. No support was found for a mediating role of the EOR
 indicators in the relationship between perception of developmental HR
 practices and employee outcomes. Implications and directions for future
 research are discussed. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2007.

Title: The Role, Use and Activation of Strong and Weak Network Ties: A Qualitative Analysis 
Abstract:
 A characteristic of studies seeking to explain the structure and operation
 of networks is the use of Granovetter's strong and weak tie hypothesis.
 Whilst this hypothesis has become an established paradigm, questions and
 disagreements arise over its applicability at demonstrating the real use
 and value of each tie. This study extends the work of Granovetter. Using a
 qualitative ethnographic approach to explore in-depth the networking
 activities of fourteen respondents, it aims to enhance understanding about
 the role of ties, how they are used and activated for business activity.
 Findings demonstrate that it is strong ties that are instrumental for
 business activity and used extensively to provide knowledge and
 information but also to maintain, extend and enhance business and personal
 reputations. Unless activities require their reactivation and
 manifestation, strong ties remain latent and dormant within the network.
 Strong ties also provide the mechanism to invoke 'weak' ties, represented
 by nodes operating in a wider social context. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005.

Title: Explaining Sales Pay Strategy Using Agency, Transaction Cost and Resource Dependence Theories 
Abstract:
 The purpose of this study is to investigate, using data gathered from 325
 French-Canadian organizations, the influence of key constructs related to
 agency, transaction cost and resource dependence theories on the
 proportion of salary in sales compensation. Usefulness analysis showed
 that performance information (9 per cent), uncertainty (8 per cent) and
 dependence resource (5 per cent) constructs have a significant incremental
 contribution to sales compensation. Regarding specific hypothesis tests,
 results of full model show that the capacity to observe behaviour, team
 sales and financial resources offered are associated with an increased use
 of salary pay. In contrast, adaptability of product/service-related
 resources, salesforce experience and high marginal salesforce productivity
 are associated with decreased use of the salary component. However, the
 results of full model have failed to support the direction or influence of
 relationships between programmability, span of control, market and selling
 uncertainty, the predominance of salespeople and TCA measures on
 proportion of salary. The results support the argument that integration of
 multiple theoretical perspectives better explains pay policy. Copyright 2003 Blackwell Publishing Ltd..

Title: Taking Friedman Seriously: Maximizing Profits and Social Performance 
Abstract:
 This paper examines the situation of firms that have two objectives:
 profit maximization and social performance. By looking comparatively at
 the cases of altruism, coerced egoism, and strategy, this paper uses the
 tools of microeconomics to define the optimal level of social output that
 should be produced in each case. We show that it is wiser for the firm to
 act strategically than to be coerced into making investments in corporate
 social responsibility. In addition, we argue that greater overall social
 output will be achieved by the strategic approach, than by the altruistic
 approach. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2006.

Title: 'It Was Such a Handy Term': Management Fashions and Pragmatic Ambiguity 
Abstract:
 This article builds on constructs that authors have labelled "strategic
 ambiguity", "interpretative viability", "umbrella constructs", and
 "boundary objects", and suggests that these constructs all articulate a
 central concern for collective action and the role of ambiguity therein.
 It characterizes as "pragmatic ambiguity" the condition of admitting more
 than one course of action, and elucidates and operationalizes this new
 construct. Drawing on the sociology of translation (Callon, 1986; Latour,
 1987),-super-[1] it argues that pragmatic ambiguity is both the result and
 the resource of a collective process of "intéressement" occurring during
 the rise in popularity of a new management approach. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2006.

Title: The Changing Japanese Multinational: Application, Adaptation and Learning in Car Manufacturing and Financial Services 
Abstract:
 The combination of increasingly international operations, the continuing
 domestic recession, and the gradual opening of the Japanese economy to
 foreign investment might be expected to change many features of Japanese
 multinational companies. In particular, the level and mode of central
 control of overseas units, especially their reliance on expatriate
 managers, could change as firms become more willing to use foreign
 subsidiaries as sources of innovation and learning rather than as delivery
 pipelines for domestically designed and developed products. These changes
 are more likely in sectors dominated by non-Japanese firms, such as
 international financial services. Interviews with managers of 14 Japanese
 manufacturing and financial service firms in the UK and Japan confirmed
 substantial differences in their internationalization patterns in the
 1990s, both between and within sectors. Car manufacturers in particular
 invested major resources in transferring significant features of their
 domestic operations to UK units, usually with expatriate managers, and one
 was investing in developing an international cadre of managers. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2003.

Title: Speaking Up in the Operating Room: How Team Leaders Promote Learning in Interdisciplinary Action Teams 
Abstract:
 This paper examines learning in interdisciplinary action teams. Research
 on team effectiveness has focused primarily on single-discipline teams
 engaged in routine production tasks and, less often, on interdisciplinary
 teams engaged in discussion and management rather than action. The
 resulting models do not explain differences in learning in
 interdisciplinary action teams. Members of these teams must coordinate
 action in uncertain, fast-paced situations, and the extent to which they
 are comfortable speaking up with observations, questions, and concerns may
 critically influence team outcomes. To explore what leaders of action
 teams do to promote speaking up and other proactive coordination
 behaviours - as well as how organizational context may affect these team
 processes and outcomes - I analysed qualitative and quantitative data from
 16 operating room teams learning to use a new technology for cardiac
 surgery. Team leader coaching, ease of speaking up, and boundary spanning
 were associated with successful technology implementation. The most
 effective leaders helped teams learn by communicating a motivating
 rationale for change and by minimizing concerns about power and status
 differences to promote speaking up in the service of learning. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2003.

Title: Multinational Retailers in China: Proliferating 'McJobs' or Developing Skills? 
Abstract:
 Much has been written on the nature of skills and the extent to which
 there is increased skills development or a deskilling of workers in modern
 workplaces. This paper broadens the debate and explores these issues in
 the novel context of UK- and Japanese-<br />invested retailers' operations
 in China. Data derived from over two hundred interviews at twelve retail
 stores in six Chinese cities and questionnaires completed by almost eight
 hundred employees elicited contextualized accounts of interactive service
 workers' own perceptions of their training and skills development. It was
 found that these firms made a substantial contribution to skills
 development, fostered and enhanced both directly by company training and
 also through experiential workplace-based learning. It might be, however,
 that this constitutes an essential but 'one-off' increase in skills in
 transitional economies such as that of China. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2006.

Title: Institutional Conditioning of Foreign Expansion: Some Evidence from Finnish-Based Paper Industry Firms, 1994-2000 
Abstract:
 Analyses of the foreign expansion of firms based on economics have
 recently been supplemented with institutionally-oriented studies
 demonstrating that foreign expansion is partly conditioned by the
 institutional environment in which the expanding firms are embedded. In
 this paper, we join this emerging stream of research with an empirical
 study on three Finnish-based paper industry firms from 1994 to 2000. By
 showing how changes in the patterns and forms of foreign expansion
 coincide with changes in the forms of corporate ownership and the
 cognitive constructions of organizational actors, our study confirms that
 foreign expansion cannot be adequately understood without reference to the
 institutional environment in which it originated. In particular, we show
 that foreign expansion can turn into an institutional requirement that
 directs the development of firms in part irrespective of the economic
 aspects involved. Copyright (c) Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2003..

Title: The Fallacy of Misplaced Leadership 
Abstract:
 The leadership literature typically talks about the discrete
 "individuality" of its subject and particularly the personal qualities and
 capabilities of a few key people occupying top positions in a hierarchy.
 Current leadership research now has begun to generate new knowledge about
 leadership practice in relations of interpersonal exchange. Nevertheless,
 there is an urgent need for the ramifications of this insight to be more
 sufficiently developed. The current discussion explores how a perspective
 of process studies challenges the dominance of the field by individual
 social actors and discrete schemes of relations. Its aims are twofold.
 First, it will show how both of these latter "epistemologies" are lacking
 and suggest that current leadership research and development activities
 must rise to the "ontological" challenge of "processes" rather than
 "things". Second, it looks at some methodological implications of this way
 of thinking as a productive incitement to future management studies. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005.

Title: The Impact of Gender Similarity on Employee Satisfaction at Work: A Review and Re-Evaluation 
Abstract:
 We used data from the British 1998 Workplace Employee Relations Survey
 (WERS98) to examine key unanswered questions about the impact of gender
 similarity on employee satisfaction at work. The study sample consisted of
 11,848 men and 11,278 women from over 1700 workplaces across Britain. In
 line with gender-specific compositional arguments, the effects of gender
 similarity were found to be asymmetrical for men and women, with
 similarity tending to have a greater positive impact on men than on women.
 The effects involved were primarily linear in nature. Net of the
 potentially confounding influence of other factors, they were also found
 to be quite weak, weaker than has commonly been suggested in the
 literature. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005.

Title: Reputation Management Capabilities as Decision Rules 
Abstract:
 We draw on a detailed grounded theory study of the reactions of Dutch food
 firms to the recent introduction of genetically modified foods to
 inductively identify the capabilities that firms develop in response to
 reputational threats. Central to the view on capabilities we propose are
 the decision rules organizations use to link individual actions to
 organizational outcomes. Four reputation management capabilities were
 identified, which were aimed at, respectively: (1) engaging in a
 cooperative dialogue with relevant stakeholders; (2) presenting the
 organizational point of view favourably in the eyes of external beholders;
 (3) avoiding organizational 'ownership' of critical reputational threats;
 and (4) communicating meaningfully with affected parties, even under
 conditions of high adversity and time-pressure. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2004.

Title: The Configuration of Organizational Images Among Firms in the Canadian Beer Brewing Industry 
Abstract:
 We integrate the literature on organizational image management and
 neo-institutional theory to arrive at a better understanding of how
 organizations routinely represent themselves positively in their external
 environment. Drawing on a cross-sectional exploratory study of the website
 communications of 36 firms in the Canadian brewing industry, we
 investigate how these organizations construct essential and distinctive
 organizational images in reference to a map of identity attributes and
 image categories at the organizational field level. We conclude that
 organizational self-categorizations explain the field-level configuration
 of images we discovered by establishing legitimacy claims targeted at
 relevant stakeholders. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005.

Title: Knowledge Management as the Basis of Sustained High Performance 
Abstract:
 By deconstructing some of the key elements of the resource-based view and
 the knowledge-based view of the firm, we suggest that there are three
 components to knowledge management systems that influence firm
 performance: the firm's ability to produce new knowledge, its ability to
 build on that knowledge, and its effectiveness in capturing a high
 proportion of the subsequent spin-offs. Using regression analysis to
 analyse data from 30,022 patent records from 42 firms, we find that a
 firm's growth rate is positively associated with its ability to generate
 rare and valuable knowledge, and to build on that knowledge. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2007.

Title: Management Research Based on the Paradigm of the Design Sciences: The Quest for Field-Tested and Grounded Technological Rules 
Abstract:
 Academic management research has a serious utilization problem. In this
 field mainstream research tends to be description-driven, based on the
 paradigm of the 'explanatory sciences', like physics and sociology, and
 resulting in what may be called Organization Theory. This article argues
 that the relevance problem can be mitigated if such research were to be
 complemented with prescription-driven research, based on the paradigm of
 the 'design sciences', like Medicine and Engineering, and resulting in
 what may be called Management Theory. The typical research products in
 Management Theory would be 'field-tested and grounded technological
 rules'. The nature of such rules is discussed as well as the research
 strategies producing them. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2004.

Title: Power, Innovation and Problem-Solving: The Personnel Managers' Three Steps to Heaven? 
Abstract:
 Legge's seminal book on personnel managers (Legge, 1978) identified
 ambiguities in their role, vicious circles that limited their power and
 possible strategies to improve their effectiveness. This paper explores
 how far the advent of human resource management has altered the
 circumstances in which they find themselves and how far it offers a new
 basis for power and influence. Analysis of interviews with 48 senior
 executives indicates that although there have been changes in features of
 the ambiguities and vicious circles, personnel managers have failed to
 overcome many of the problems identified by Legge 25 years earlier or to
 seize the opportunities outlined by Ulrich (1997) to become human resource
 champions. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2004.

Title: A Prescriptive Analysis of Search and Discovery 
Abstract:
 I develop a prescriptive model of entrepreneurial search and discovery,
 which operationalizes constrained, systematic search. This approach
 appears to be superior to the alertness perspective in both the number and
 the wealth-creating potential of the opportunities that it can assist
 entrepreneurs to discover. Essentially, this research shows how
 entrepreneurs can improve their search effectiveness by systematically
 restricting their searching to known domains, which I elaborate
 prescriptively. Finally, I discuss the implications of the approach for
 researchers, educators and entrepreneurs. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2007.

Title: Ownership Types and Strategic Groups in an Emerging Economy 
Abstract:
 Existing strategic group studies have rarely examined ownership type as a
 variable to classify firms in an industry. Using Chinese firms of
 different ownership types, we suggest that ownership type can be a
 parsimonious and important variable that managers use to cognitively
 classify firms into different strategic groups. While ownership itself is
 an objective variable, we contend that different ownership types lead to
 different managerial outlook and mentality due to a number of macro and
 micro foundations giving rise to various managerial cognitions. Employing
 the Miles and Snow typology, we find that state-owned enterprises (SOEs)
 and privately-owned enterprises (POEs) tend to adopt defender and
 prospector strategies, respectively, while collectively-owned enterprises
 (COEs) and foreign-invested enterprises (FIEs) exhibit an analyser
 orientation that falls between defenders and prospectors on the strategy
 continuum. Three statistical tests suggest that ownership types can be
 used to successfully predict strategic group memberships in China's
 emerging economy. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2004.

Title: Subsidiary Strategy: The Embeddedness Component 
Abstract:
 This article develops the concept of internal subsidiary embeddedness as
 the canvas within which subsidiary strategy takes place. Developing an
 inductive model, we identify three hierarchical levels of embeddedness.
 The first level is operational embeddedness, which relates to interlocking
 day-to-day relations. The second level is capability embeddedness, which
 concerns the development of competitive capabilities for the multinational
 as a whole. The third level is strategic embeddedness, which concerns a
 subsidiary's participation in a multinational corporation's strategy
 setting. We derived our concept of embeddedness from an in-depth case
 study. Embeddedness is not merely an outcome of the institutional setting
 in which a subsidiary is situated, but is a resource a subsidiary can
 manage by means of manipulating dependencies or exerting influence over
 the allocation of critical resources. A subsidiary can modify its
 embeddedness to change its strategic restraints. Therefore, the
 development of subsidiary embeddedness becomes an integral part of
 subsidiary strategy. Copyright (c) Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2008.

Title: Places and Spaces: The Role of Metonymy in Organizational Talk 
Abstract:
 Cultural meaning making as reflected in, and constituted by,
 organizational talk is an established field of interest in organizational
 analysis. However, the discursive mechanics of the process whereby this
 cultural meaning making is created and maintained are less well
 understood. The premise of this paper is that taken-for-granted
 assumptions embedded in organizational talk can be explored through the
 analysis of metonymy, a trope which is under explored in the linguistic
 turn in organization studies. This lack of focus on metonymy is, we
 believe, related to the fundamentally conventional nature of the trope in
 use, which expresses ideas, values and relationships that seem natural,
 normal and routine but which are culturally bound. We address this gap and
 carry out a metonymical analysis of organizational talk about physical
 places and spaces in one organization, to show how cultural norms and
 meanings are reflected, maintained, and potentially changed in these
 figures of speech. We show how metonymic chains based on buildings can
 reflect, reify and simplify the symbolic order of the organization, how
 these symbolic meanings can be transferred on to other inanimate objects
 and the constructions thereby spread, how people can be constructed within
 this symbolic chain, and how these metonymic chains can be invoked to
 potentially confirm, challenge or change the organizational order. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2004.

Title: Creating a High-Trust Organization: An Exploration into Organizational Policies that Stimulate Interpersonal Trust Building 
Abstract:
 We examine empirically how an organization that deliberately enhances
 interpersonal trust to become a significant organizational phenomenon, is
 different from a similar organization without explicit trust enhancement
 policies. The point of departure is relational signalling theory, which
 says that trust is a function of consistently giving off signals that
 indicate credible concern, to potential trustors. A matched pair of two
 consulting organizations, with different trust policies but otherwise
 similar characteristics, were studied intensively, using survey research,
 participant observation and half-open interviewing, focused on the
 generation of trust and the handling of trouble when trust was threatened
 or destroyed. A higher stage of trust can be reached by an inter-related
 set of policies: promoting a relationship-oriented culture, facilitation
 of unambiguous signalling, consistent induction training, creating
 opportunities for meeting informally, and the day-to-day management of
 competencies. Such policies are in principle independent of recognized
 contextual contingencies. Copyright (c) Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2008.

Title: The Relationship Between Acculturation, Individualism/Collectivism, and Job Attribute Preferences for Hispanic MBAs 
Abstract:
 This research studied the influence of acculturation on the values of
 Hispanic MBAs in the USA and the effect these values have on job attribute
 preferences. As predicted, the less acculturated Hispanic MBAs had
 significantly higher collectivist values than either highly acculturated
 Hispanic or Anglo-American MBAs. Surprisingly, acculturation was not
 related to individualism. As theorized, collectivistic, and not
 individualistic, values were significantly related to a preference for
 contextual job attributes. In contrast, individualistic, and not
 collectivistic, values were related to a preference for task-related job
 attributes. The findings point to the importance of understanding an
 individual's level of acculturation and his/her specific values, rather
 than assuming differences based on ethnicity. In addition, the findings
 indicate that managers dealing with diversity within the USA or globally
 must understand their employees' individualistic/collectivistic values
 before implementing any job design initiatives. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2003.

Title: Talk as Technique - A Critique of the Words and Deeds Distinction in the Diffusion of Customer Service Cultures in Call Centres 
Abstract:
 This paper critically explores the common distinction made between words
 and deeds (or ideas and techniques) in the diffusion of management
 knowledge literature. The concern with whether management ideas are
 "really" being implemented in an organizational context intuitively points
 to the possibility of a contrast between simply talking about a practice
 or 'hype' and practical implementation. Drawing on empirical research on
 the diffusion of customer service culture in two call centres where
 'verbal labour' predominates, it is argued that this distinction is
 important, but overdrawn. Eschewing discursive reductionism, the concepts
 of 'talk in work' and 'talk about work' are developed to illustrate how
 talk can be a technique of implementation in its own right. Copyright Blackwell Publishers Ltd 2003.

Title: Learning to Build a Supply Network: An Exploration of Dynamic Business Models 
Abstract:
 Firms are confronted with the challenge of learning how to develop and
 manage supply networks, which reduce their operating costs and maximize
 their effectiveness in the marketplace. In pursuit of such goals they are
 increasingly turning to the use of dynamic business models. Dynamic
 business models represent continuous change and therefore make firms learn
 constantly new and better ways of doing things. These changes are
 manifestations of inter-firm knowledge transfer. The aim of this research
 is to explore dynamic business models as an example of inter-firm
 knowledge transfer. Adopting a case study approach, we examine three
 components of dynamic business models - network structure, inter-firm
 routines and knowledge forms - and describe their integration through a
 problem solving approach to building an offshore supply network. Our
 empirical findings suggest that dynamic business models help organizations
 identify and link key actors with each other (at the firm and individual
 level), and aid the identification and specification of appropriate
 knowledge types and knowledge transfer mechanisms for different actors, in
 different contexts. Copyright (c) Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2008.

Title: The Theory of Knowledge Spillover Entrepreneurship 
Abstract:
 The prevailing theories of entrepreneurship have typically revolved around
 the ability of individuals to recognize opportunities and then to act on
 them by starting a new venture. This has generated a literature asking why
 entrepreneurial behaviour varies across individuals with different
 characteristics while implicitly holding constant the external context in
 which the individual finds herself. Thus, where the opportunities come
 from, or the source of entrepreneurial opportunities, is also implicitly
 taken as given. By contrast, in this paper an important source of
 entrepreneurial opportunities is identified - knowledge and ideas created
 in an incumbent organization. By commercializing knowledge that otherwise
 would remain uncommercialized through the start-up of a new venture,
 entrepreneurship serves as a conduit of knowledge spillovers. According to
 the theory of knowledge spillover entrepreneurship, a context with more
 knowledge will generate more entrepreneurial opportunities. By contrast, a
 context with less knowledge will generate fewer entrepreneurial
 opportunities. Based on a data set linking entrepreneurship to the
 knowledge context, empirical evidence is provided that is consistent with
 the proposition that entrepreneurial opportunities are not exogenous but
 rather systematically created by investments in knowledge by incumbent
 organizations. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2007.

Title: NTT DoCoMo's Launch of I-Mode in the Japanese Mobile Phone Market: A Knowledge Creation Perspective 
Abstract:
 While innovation and knowledge creation processes and context are
 interlinked in the real world, scholars frequently ignore or separate
 context from knowing due to an entrenched sense of ontological and
 analytical dualism. This paper builds on the organizational knowledge
 creation theory (Nonaka, 1994) to provide a holistic view of contextual
 innovation and knowledge creation processes. The phenomenon is
 demonstrated by a longitudinal case description of i-mode mobile Internet
 innovation at NTT DoCoMo, a Japanese mobile communications company. This
 case explains how three key managers created and organized an interlinked
 system of shared contexts, called "ba", that enabled the combination and
 open flow of diverse knowledge and led to the creation and launch of the
 i-mode mobile Internet, which unites novel technologies and services.
 Managerial implications and limitations are discussed. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2007.

Title: A Capabilities Perspective on the Evolution of Firm Boundaries: A Comparative Case Example from the Portuguese Moulds Industry 
Abstract:
 The issue of vertical firm boundaries continues to attract interest both
 for economics and management research. The transaction cost economics
 approach, emphasizing transaction-specific assets and opportunism in order
 to explain discrete 'make-or-buy' decisions, dominates the literature.
 Nevertheless, alternative perspectives, developed under the guise of the
 capabilities, competence or knowledge-based theories of the firm, have
 gained attention recently. They focus on the evolutionary dynamics of
 boundaries in the context of the division of labour among firms in an
 industry and on what is to be divided and co-ordinated - i.e. productive
 knowledge. The conceptual links between this line of research, which some
 refer to as neo-Marshallian, and the Industrial Networks approach are
 explored in this paper. The paper emphasizes both a vision of firms as
 sets of direct and indirect capabilities, developed and combined in
 different ways over time, and the connectedness between inter-firm
 relationships. The discussion is illustrated with the cases of two firms,
 which are contrasted in terms of the dynamic evolution of their
 boundaries. The analysis made supports the argument that firms' vertical
 boundaries reflect their relationships with specific counterparts and the
 way they address through time the division and integration of knowledge
 through the configuration of direct and indirect, counterpart specific,
 capabilities. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2004.

Title: Network Resources for Internationalization: The Case of Taiwan's Electronics Firms 
Abstract:
 This paper illustrates foreign direct investment (FDI) as the management
 of important network relations, using Taiwan's electronics firms as an
 example. Through FDI, seemingly small and weak firms propel the process of
 internationalization by making maximum use of external resources to which
 they have access. FDI often starts at a location close to the home base
 where support from the domestic networks can be drawn, subsequently moving
 on to more distant locations after investors have accumulated new network
 resources. The location chosen is usually an area rich in network
 resources or in close proximity to such rich networks. FDI enables the
 investors to construct a regional, or even global, sub-network under their
 control to supply a set of wide-ranging, differentiated and low-cost
 products in a flexible fashion, and sometimes within close proximity to
 the markets. With this capacity for versatility, investors become valuable
 partners for multinational firms that offer global services. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2003.

Title: Foreign Investment Strategies and Sub-national Institutions in Emerging Markets: Evidence from Vietnam 
Abstract:
 Foreign investors entering emerging markets have to take strategic
 decisions on where and how to set up operations. These decisions have to
 accommodate institutional conditions that vary not only between countries,
 but also within the host economy. We offer a theoretical framework to
 analyse how institutions in an emerging economy influence entry strategy
 decisions. On this basis, we analyse the determinants of two key aspects
 of entry strategy: location and entry mode in Vietnam. We find that
 sub-national institutional variables have a significant influence on both
 dimensions. The availability of scarce resources affects the location of
 FDI and the likelihood of Greenfield entry. Institutional pressures
 arising from incumbent state-owned firms and the domestic market
 orientation of the investor lead to a preference for joint venture entry. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005.

Title: Collective Virtuosity in Organizations: A Study of Peak Performance in an Orchestra 
Abstract:
 The purpose of this paper is to build theory on peak performance at the
 group level. Peak performance transcends ordinary performance and is
 associated with a subjective experience in which one loses a sense of time
 and space as well as feels great joy and bliss. We chose to study this
 phenomenon at the group level through a methodology of participant
 observation in an orchestra. We found that groups can be transformed by
 their own performance in a reflexive process in which virtuosity, or
 individual peak performance, becomes collective. We offer a propositional
 model of collective virtuosity in organizations, and offer directions for
 further research. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2007.

Title: Breaking Silence: Tactical Choices Women Managers Make in Speaking Up About Gender-Equity Issues 
Abstract:
 This study examines female managers' assessments of how to speak up about
 the treatment of women in their organizations. Qualitative data from 172
 women provide an in-depth look at their theories about the right way to
 sell this issue. In addition, inductive exploration of the tactics chosen
 by 985 other women to address gender-equity concerns yields four clusters
 of issue-selling tactics for this issue. We draw from these two
 complementary analyses to suggest implications for the future study and
 practice of issue selling, and for shaping organizational cultures to
 support gender equity. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2003.

Title: Research and Technology Commercialization 
Abstract:
 This paper introduces the special themed section on organizational
 interactions involving universities and firms that result in the
 commercialization of research and technology. Our objective is to shed
 light on some of the most vexing, yet under-researched predicaments
 research institutions encounter, despite their best efforts to advance
 commercialization. First, we synthesize and extend recent studies,
 including the papers in the special themed section. Next, we develop a
 taxonomy of modes of commercialization. Specifically, we consider internal
 approaches, quasi-internal approaches (e.g. incubators), university
 research parks, regional clusters, academic spin-offs and start-ups,
 licensing, contract research and consultancy, corporate venture capital,
 and open science and innovation. We also identify areas for further
 research at the individual (e.g. heterogeneity of entrepreneurial teams
 and experience; incentives), organizational and intra-university (e.g.
 corporate governance; nature of growth strategies; relationships with
 trading partners; boundary spanning activities) and technology levels
 (e.g. institutional context; reconfiguration of technology; valuation of
 technology). Copyright (c) Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2008.

Title: Transferring Organizational Learning Systems to Japanese Subsidiaries in China 
Abstract:
 Qualitative interviews and observations were conducted to study the
 cross-border transfer of organizational learning systems to the
 subsidiaries of five Japanese manufacturing companies operating in South
 China. This paper develops a holistic model of the overall process, by
 integrating knowledge-oriented, routine-oriented, and social/contextual
 perspectives, each of which plays a necessary role in explaining essential
 aspects. One feature of the transfer of organizational learning systems
 entailed arranging local access to, and opportunity to replicate, various
 types of knowledge repository that contained corporate values as well as
 technical expertise. A second feature involved the development of
 collective learning routines through dynamic interplay with evolving,
 locally based, knowledge repositories. A third feature, in two companies,
 entailed the creation of enterprise contexts that reproduced the
 socialization and corporate culture maintenance rituals, and the open plan
 factory and office designs, that were hallmarks of the respective parent
 companies, and which appeared highly conducive to the transfer of
 collective learning routines to the local sites. Findings indicate that
 successful cross-border transfer of organizational learning systems
 entails the development and implementation of an overall heuristic design
 for cultivating collective learning routines through the engineering of
 enterprise contexts and the responsive management of knowledge
 repositories. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2006.

Title: The Professionally Managed Family-ruled Enterprise: Ethnic Chinese Business in Singapore 
Abstract:
 This study identifies the change and continuity in the management
 structure of Singaporean Chinese family businesses before and after the
 Asian currency crisis based on an interpretive content analysis of oral
 history transcripts, personal interviews, documentary research and a
 historical analysis of Singapore's economy and society. It shows that
 large businesses shifted from being 'family-ruled and managed' to becoming
 'professionally managed family-ruled' businesses before the crisis. Since
 the crisis, however, Chinese businesses in sectors that are under the
 watch of the developmental state, that face increasing competition from
 Western corporations, and lack offspring who are competent and interested
 in running family enterprises have loosened family rule. Businesses in
 sectors that are free from the direct intervention of the state, that seek
 survival in negative market situations, and have trusted and competent
 offspring to harness the advantage of the family enterprise have
 maintained family rule. Based on the findings, the author offers an
 explanatory and predictive model that takes into account the roles of
 markets, institutions (including culture and the state) and key corporate
 actors. The study concludes with suggestions for future research into the
 management structures of professionally managed family businesses and the
 role of the state. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2004.

Title: Crossing the Threshold from Founder Management to Professional Management: A Governance Perspective 
Abstract:
 We argue that the challenges faced by threshold firms are deeply rooted in
 governance characteristics (i.e. the incentives, authority and legitimacy)
 which imbue them with characteristic capabilities, disabilities and path
 dependencies. Whereas Zahra and Filatotchev (2004) reason the principal
 problem facing threshold firms relates to organizational learning and
 knowledge management, we posit resource acquisition and utilization to be
 equally important. Moreover, we argue governance theory is more able than
 a knowledge-based perspective to explain the "root causes" of the learning
 and resource issues faced by threshold firms as well as the complex set of
 processes involved in their effective management. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2004.

Title: Managing Task Interdependencies in Multi-Team Projects: A Longitudinal Study 
Abstract:
 In this article we examine project-level and team-level managerial
 functions aimed at managing inter-team task interdependencies and
 investigate their effect on the performance of teams in a multi-team
 product development project. We hypothesize that team interface management
 (a team-level function) performed in the concept phase of a project,
 rather than the later development phase, is positively related to team
 performance at the project's conclusion (i.e. product quality, product
 cost, development budget, development time). Furthermore, we argue that
 project structuring and support (a project-level function) is important in
 both the concept and the development phases. We test our hypotheses
 empirically based on a 36 months longitudinal study of a product
 development project in the European automotive industry comprising 39
 teams. The results show that team interface management is particularly
 important during the concept phase of the project. Project structuring and
 support is most important in the development phase of the project, while
 hindering team performance in the concept phase. Theoretical and practical
 implications are discussed. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005.

Title: Country Resource Environments, Firm Capabilities, and Corporate Diversification Strategies 
Abstract:
 Environmental differences among countries are often assumed away in
 strategy research. In particular, the unique contexts of the emerging
 economies have not been considered adequately in extant research. I bring
 country environmental contexts to the foreground and conceptualize various
 types of economies (developed economies, emerging economies,
 institution-driven high growth emerging economies, and factor-driven high
 growth emerging economies) as dissimilar types of country resource
 environments that provide firms with country resources: factors and
 institutions. To compete successfully, firms will find it more optimal to
 emphasize appropriate firm capabilities (market capabilities and
 non-market capabilities) and corporate diversification strategy (product
 and international diversification). By integrating insights from
 institutional economics and resource-based view, this paper offers a
 conceptual framework to examine the multifaceted relationships linking
 firm capabilities and corporate diversification across dissimilar country
 resource environments. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005.

Title: Cooperative Goals, Leader People and Productivity Values: Their Contribution to Top Management Teams in China 
Abstract:
 This study proposes that when top management team members are convinced
 that their leader is committed to people and productivity, they conclude
 that their leader is effective and contribute to making their organization
 innovative. Cooperative goals among top management team members may be
 credible evidence that their leader has people and production values.
 Executives from over 100 organizations in China completed measures of
 their cooperative, competitive, and independent goals, their leader's
 people and production values, and their leader's effectiveness. CEOs from
 these firms rated their organization's innovativeness. Structural equation
 analysis suggested that cooperative goals among top management teams
 convince them that their leader values people and production and that
 these values in turn result in leader effectiveness and organizational
 innovation. Results, coupled with previous research, were interpreted as
 suggesting that cooperative goals and leader people and production values
 are foundations for leader and top management team effectiveness in China. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2006.

Title: What's New in New Forms of Organizing? On the Construction of Gender in Project-Based Work 
Abstract:
 In several industries, projects are now the normal form of work for
 individuals. The consequences of project work have not so far been subject
 to critical inquiry, however. This implies inquiry not only on how people
 handle project work at work, it also means inquiring into how they live
 their lives when working by projects. In this paper, we study this from a
 constructionist gender perspective, in which project work is seen as an
 ongoing construction of patterns of femininity and masculinity in society.
 The aim of the paper is to contribute to an understanding of how project
 work is related to the ongoing construction of femininity and masculinity
 in the work and lives of human beings. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2006.

Title: Investigating the Success of Decision Making Processes 
Abstract:
 A decision making process is made up of action-taking steps indicating
 "how" to make a decision. When linked to indicators of success, process
 provides the basis for building an action theory for decision making. The
 success of many different types of processes must be documented before
 such a theory can be constructed. In this research, processes called 'idea
 imposition' and 'discovery' are investigated by analysing 202
 organizational decisions and their outcomes. Discovery was derived from
 prescriptive literature, which stresses logical and political rationality.
 Idea imposition was inferred from the descriptive/interpretive literature,
 which stresses pragmatics and sense making. Some of the discovery efforts
 may be abandoned to exploit an opportunity, becoming an 'emergent
 opportunity' process. Idea imposition efforts end if the motivating idea
 fails, calling for steps to find a replacement with a 'redevelopment'
 process. Analysis revealed that discovery was more successful than idea
 imposition and both process adaptations. Discovery was more successful
 than the other three processes no matter what the urgency, importance,
 resource level, initial support, decision maker level, sector, or type of
 decision. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2008.

Title: Firms as Realizations of Entrepreneurial Visions 
Abstract:
 In the debate on why firms exist, the question of who chooses between
 firms and markets and on what basis is rarely addressed. This paper argues
 that the choice is a core element of the entrepreneurial pursuit of
 visions or conceptions of business opportunities. To successfully organize
 resources into the envisioned businesses - be it via firms or markets -
 resource owners must be coordinated on the entrepreneur's conception of
 the business and be motivated to perform properly. To solve the dual
 problem, the organizational form of the firm offers the entrepreneur
 unique advantages not feasible under the organizational form of markets. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2007.

Title: Whose Human Capital? The Challenge of Value Capture When Capital is Embedded 
Abstract:
 Current approaches that position human capital as central to value
 generation in knowledge-based industries obscure the importance of the
 relational nature of knowledge production. That is, separable and embodied
 forms of capital are interdependent in value creation and capture
 processes. We identify a relational form of capital, "embedded" capital,
 which we argue is "the" critical resource in knowledge-based industries
 such as professional services firms, because it allows us to include
 agency and interdependency in the value capture process. These dimensions
 have previously been overlooked by the resource-based view of the firm.
 Examples of embedded capital include brand value, processes and
 procedures. The deployment of embedded capital is also not clearly
 controlled by either the firm or individual employees. A model is
 developed to illustrate the links between each form of capital, and the
 processes of value capture. This conceptual identification of the embedded
 form of capital is therefore of importance to future value creation and
 capture debates. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2006.

Title: Organizational Task Environments: An Evaluation of Convergent and Discriminant Validity 
Abstract:
 The organizational task environment (OTE) construct is evaluated using a
 large, independent sample. A general measurement model for three latent
 variables, munificence, dynamism and complexity is constructed for
 confirmatory factor analysis. This model is then tested for both
 convergent and discriminant validity using a multitrait-multimethod matrix
 approach. The OTE model in this study demonstrates convergent validity,
 but it does not exhibit discriminant validity. The results of this study
 do not provide support for one of the key components of construct
 validity. Measurement issues are discussed, as well as the implications of
 this study for the organizational theory and strategic management
 disciplines. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2004.

Title: Long Term Incentive Plans, Executive Pay and UK Company Performance 
Abstract:
 In agency theory, the remuneration packages of executive directors in
 large companies are seen as an attempt to give them a pattern of rewards
 that aligns their interests more closely with shareholders as a whole. The
 sensitivity of total executive rewards to share price performance has
 become the conventional yardstick for judgements concerning whether reward
 packages do indeed serve shareholders' interests or executives themselves. Copyright 2003 Blackwell Publishing Ltd..

Title: Tapping Deep Pockets: The Role of Resources and Social Capital on Financial Capital Acquisition by Biotechnology Firms in Biotech-Pharma Alliances 
Abstract:
 Strategic alliances with pharmaceutical firms allow small biotechnology
 firms to acquire needed financial capital in exchange for sharing new,
 cutting-edge technologies. This study draws from aspects of resource-based
 view and social capital theory to examine the factors that influence the
 extent of financial capital biotech firms acquire when forming an alliance
 with pharmaceutical firms. Using a sample of 184 alliances from the period
 1995-2000, we found that alliances where the pharmaceutical firm has
 greater management control are associated with greater acquisition of
 financial capital by the biotech firm. We also found that the credibility
 of the pharmaceutical firm is positively associated with the extent of
 financial capital acquired by the biotechnology firm and that the number
 of patents that the biotech firm has is negatively associated to the
 financial capital the biotech firm receives. We discuss the implications
 of our findings for theory, research, and management practice. Copyright (c) Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2008.

Title: An Organizational Justice-Based View of Self-Control and Agency Costs in Family Firms 
Abstract:
 By integrating insights from two seemingly disparate literatures -
 economics and organizational justice - within the general agency
 framework, we advance propositions that suggest a fine-grained explanation
 of agency costs at family firms. In so doing, we account for the
 differential effects of the controlling owners' self-control (i.e. the
 governance mechanisms they adopt and how they administer those mechanisms)
 on the justice perceptions of the family and non-family employees. Our
 integrative view allows us to strike a realistic balance between the
 overly optimistic views about family firm governance that have been
 expressed by agency scholars and the overly pessimistic views expressed by
 management scholars in the past few years. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2007.

Title: Reverse Diffusion in US Multinationals: Barriers from the American Business System 
Abstract:
 This paper addresses the issue of 'reverse diffusion' of employment
 practices in multinational companies, which is defined as the transfer of
 practices from foreign subsidiaries to operations in the country of
 origin. It adds to the literature by examining the influence of the parent
 business system in multinationals. Specifically, it addresses how the
 dominant institutions and established organizational structures and
 practices in the home country affect the extent and impact of reverse
 diffusion of employment practices. Drawing on fresh evidence from
 American-owned multinationals in the UK we argue that there is
 considerable potential for reverse diffusion to occur among this group of
 firms. However, we highlight a number of barriers to reverse diffusion
 that the American business system presents, demonstrating that these
 constrain both the prevalence and the impact of it in practice. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005.

Title: The Utility of Social Obligations in the UK Energy Industry 
Abstract:
 The imposition of social obligations on the UK energy supply industry
 provides an important opportunity to examine how social responsibilities
 are construed by companies and how these constructions relate to
 perceptions of the role of regulation, specifically the scope for
 compromise and influence with the regulator. Our data suggest four
 templates for understanding this relationship: embracing social
 obligations, business as usual, management deliberation, and conflicts
 with commerce. First, embracing social obligations is based on competitive
 advantage and struggles for market leadership, and highlights informal
 mechanisms in attempts to influence the regulatory agenda. Second,
 business as usual reflects pre-existing standard operating procedures and
 a generalized approach to serving the broad consumer base in line with
 regulation as formal policing procedures. Third, management deliberation
 is a way of either reflecting upon or stalling progress on social issues,
 and suggests compromise and passivity in regulatory relations. Fourth,
 conflicts with commerce focuses on the inherent difficulties of
 reconciling social obligations with economic regulation and a profit
 orientation, so that meeting minimum standards or the risk of regulatory
 censure may be sensible strategies. Together these templates emphasize the
 subjective and multiple nature of social responsibility and of regulatory
 relationships, and demonstrate struggles for the strategic and operational
 meaning over the nature of public interest and competitive advantage. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2007.

Title: The Continuity-Change Duality in Narrative Texts of Organizational Identity 
Abstract:
 This paper focuses on how continuity and change are managed discursively
 in narrative texts of organizational identity and thus helps move forward
 the discussion about persistence and change in organizational identity.
 The study reports on the content, context and authorial elements of the
 evolving narrative composed by a Canadian bank's senior managers. The
 analysis indicates that the discursive strategies employed by
 organizational authors to establish confluence (or simultaneous continuity
 and change) include the selective reporting of elements from the past,
 present and future, the juxtaposition of the 'modern and attractive' with
 the 'outdated and undesirable', the persistent use of expansive labels
 that allow the addition and subtraction of meanings attached to the
 labels, and the importation of selected themes from the wider
 macro-discourses. In keeping with the view that organizations are
 plurivocal, evolving narratives of the organization in the business press
 are also presented. These narratives contribute themes that are at times
 concordant with senior managers' accounts and thus confirm the value of
 the changes in identity elaborated by management; at other times, press
 accounts are discordant with senior managers' narratives and provide
 alternative evaluations of the changes. The paper concludes with
 reflections on the indeterminacy of both organizational identity - for the
 texts that constitute it remain open to multiple readings and to
 subsequent re-writing that continually destabilize it - and the narrative
 research enterprise that falls short of providing comprehensive and
 incontrovertible accounts of the voices that constitute organizations. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005.

Title: Corporate Social Responsibility, Public Policy, and NGO Activism in Europe and the United States: An Institutional-Stakeholder Perspective 
Abstract:
 Corporate social responsibility (CSR) is an increasingly pervasive
 phenomenon on the European and North American economic and political
 landscape. In this paper, we extend neo-institutional and stakeholder
 theory to show how differences in the institutional environments of Europe
 and the United States affect expectations about corporate responsibilities
 to society. We focus on how these differences are manifested in government
 policy, corporate strategy, and non-governmental organization (NGO)
 activism towards specific issues involving the social responsibilities of
 corporations. Drawing from recent theoretical and empirical research, and
 analysis of three case studies (global warming, trade in genetically
 modified organisms, and pricing of anti-viral pharmaceuticals in
 developing countries), we find that different institutional structures and
 political legacies in the US and EU are important factors in explaining
 how governments, NGOs, and the broader polity determine and implement
 preferences regarding CSR in these two important world regions. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2006.

Title: To Conform or To Perform? Mimetic Behaviour, Legitimacy-Based Groups and Performance Consequences 
Abstract:
 The study of interorganizational imitation has been an important strand in
 the recent literature on institutional theory. This paper offers new
 insights for our understanding of mimetic isomorphism and its reliance on
 legitimacy: we suggest that legitimacy-based reference groups guide firms
 in their mimetic behaviour, that firms undertake imitation even against
 their own "ex ante" information, and that legitimacy-based imitation
 contributes negatively to firms' profitability. We examine Portuguese bank
 branching decisions between 1988 and 1996 and find that banks imitate
 their legitimacy-based groups, and not only towards "ex ante"
 (firm-specific) attractive locations, but also towards unattractive
 locations; we also find that mimetic branching produces a negative effect
 on profitability. We conclude that these results show the importance of
 legitimacy pressures on organization decisions and the tension between the
 pressure to conform and the pressure to perform. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2006.

Title: Asian Management Research: Status Today and Future Outlook 
Abstract:
 This paper reviews the existing management research on Asia. The findings
 highlight that Asian management research not only builds the understanding
 of Asia, but also makes a critical contribution to the broad domain of
 management studies. In particular, Asian-focused research allows
 researchers to extend and revise theories through the consideration of new
 contextual variables. This enables researchers to fine-tune theories by
 developing context-specific conditions and operationalization of key
 constructs, which in turn allows researchers to develop new theories and
 constructs which are generalizable to research in other contexts. This
 systematic examination will help to lay the foundation for the further
 expansion of the understanding of both Asia and of management research in
 general. Copyright (c) Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2008.

Title: Is there a 'New Managerial Work'? A Comparison with Henry Mintzberg's Classic Study 30 Years Later 
Abstract:
 This comparative study of top executives' work aimed at examining the
 stability of top managerial behaviour reveals a relatively different
 pattern of behaviour compared with the study by Henry Mintzberg. The main
 differences are a much larger workload, a contact pattern to a larger
 degree oriented towards subordinates in group-settings, a greater emphasis
 on giving information, and less preoccupation with administrative work.
 One important finding is that fragmentation of time - in previous studies
 highlighted as a central tenet of managerial work - was not as prevalent
 in the new study. The different results can be attributed (with caution)
 to the impact of the management discourse about leadership and corporate
 culture, and to factors such as organizational structure and geographical
 dispersion of companies. However, there are also significant similarities
 between the two studies which indicate that claims of the emergence of a
 radically different managerial work are much exaggerated. Instead the
 empirical data shows that new work-practices are combined with older
 practices, both in a complex and context-specific ways. Therefore, there
 is a need for better integration between theoretical development and
 empirical investigations in this field of inquiry. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2006.

Title: The Changing Roles of Personnel Managers: Old Ambiguities, New Uncertainties 
Abstract:
 There have been notable attempts to capture the changing nature of
 personnel roles in response to major transformations in the workplace and
 the associated rise of 'HRM'. A decade ago Storey (1992) explored the
 emerging impact of workplace change on personnel practice in the UK and
 proposed a new fourfold typology of personnel roles: 'advisors',
 'handmaidens', 'regulators' and 'changemakers'. Have these four roles
 changed now that HRM has increasingly become part of the rhetoric and
 reality of organizational performance? If Storey's work provides an
 empirical and analytical benchmark for examining issues of 'role change',
 then Ulrich's (1997) work in the USA offers a sweeping prescriptive
 end-point for the transformation of personnel roles that has already been
 widely endorsed by UK practitioners. He argues that HR professionals must
 overcome the traditional marginality of the personnel function by
 embracing a new set of roles as champions of competitiveness in delivering
 value. Is this a realistic ambition? The new survey findings and interview
 evidence from HR managers in major UK companies presented here suggests
 that the role of the personnel professional has altered in a number of
 significant respects, and has become more multifaceted and complex, but
 the negative counter-images of the past still remain. To partly capture
 the process of role change, Storey's original fourfold typology of
 personnel roles is re-examined and contrasted with Ulrich's prescriptive
 vision for the reinvention on the HR function. It is concluded that
 Storey's typology has lost much of its empirical and analytical veracity,
 while Ulrich's model ends in prescriptive overreach by submerging issues
 of role conflict within a new rhetoric of professional identity. Neither
 model can adequately accommodate the emergent tensions between competing
 role demands, ever-increasing managerial expectations of performance and
 new challenges to professional expertise, all of which are likely to
 intensify in the future. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2003.

Title: Symmetrical Absence/Symmetrical Absurdity: Critical Notes on the Production of Actor-Network Accounts 
Abstract:
 An enduring concern within management and organization studies (MOS) is
 how to conduct research from perspectives deemed 'alternatives' to those
 of functionalism and positivism. Our aim is to address this concern with
 regard to an approach employed by Karen Legge in research on knowledge
 workers, namely that of actor-network theory (ANT) (or the 'sociology of
 translation'). Following an introduction to ANT, the views of some its key
 proponents, and Legge's own use of the approach, the paper presents
 critical notes on five issues related to the production of ANT accounts -
 the inclusion and exclusion of actors; the treatment of humans and
 non-humans; the nature of privileging and status; the handling of agency
 and structure; and the nature of politics and power in 'heterogeneous
 engineering'. We discuss the relationships between these issues and the
 key ANT goal of achieving a sense of 'general symmetry' in the accounting
 process. In so doing we note how ANT authors are frequently chastised for
 either failing to take sufficient account of, or promoting too strong a
 sense of, analytical symmetry in their writing. It is argued that the
 primary challenge facing ANT researchers is to produce accounts that are
 robust enough to negate the twin charges of symmetrical absence and
 symmetrical absurdity. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2004.

Title: An Exploratory Study of Employee Silence: Issues that Employees Don't Communicate Upward and Why 
Abstract:
 There is evidence from a variety of sources that employees often do not
 feel comfortable speaking to their bosses about organizational problems or
 issues that concern them. The purpose of this study was to shed light on
 the types of issues that employees are reluctant to raise, and identify
 why employees sometimes decide to remain silent rather than voice their
 concerns. We interviewed 40 employees and found that most had been in
 situations where they were concerned about an issue but did not raise it
 to a supervisor. Silence spanned a range of organizational issues, with
 several of our respondents indicating that they did not feel comfortable
 speaking to those above them about "any" issues or concerns. The most
 frequently mentioned reason for remaining silent was the fear of being
 viewed or labeled negatively, and as a consequence, damaging valued
 relationships. From our data, we develop a model of how the perceived
 consequences of voice contribute to silence, and a model of how the social
 and relational implications of speaking up can take away employees'
 ability to have influence within an organizational setting. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2003.

Title: Governing through Teamwork: Reconstituting Subjectivity in a Call Centre 
Abstract:
 This article focuses on teamworking as a form of governmentality whereby
 management seeks to govern by distance. This involves mobilizing the
 support and commitment of employees to teamworking and organizational
 goals by appealing to their autonomy, unity, sociability and desire for a
 more enriched work experience. It is the struggle over subjectivity that
 is of concern here, for teamworking can be seen as a technology that aims
 to transform individuals into subjects that secure their sense of meaning
 and significance through working as a team. We will explore through a case
 study of a call centre in a large building society how a discourse of
 teamworking has begun to impinge upon individuals so as to shape not only
 how they behave but also how they think, derive meaning and understand the
 world. In turn, we consider some of the tensions and inconsistencies of
 teamworking in relation to the secrecy of pay differentials, and the
 return to productivity pressures after a period of relaxation and trust.
 Ultimately the article examines how individuals respond to, agonize over,
 resist and baulk against the imposition of 'team lives' when this rubs up
 against what they understand to be their 'private lives'. This will
 involve considering gender tensions that have so far been largely
 neglected in relation to call centres and teamworking. Teamworking, we
 will argue, reflects a will to govern rather than a mechanism of
 government. Copyright 2003 Blackwell Publishing Ltd..

Title: ORGANIZATIONAL AND OCCUPATIONAL COMMITMENT: KNOWLEDGE WORKERS IN LARGE CORPORATIONS 
Abstract:
 Previous discussion of knowledge work and workers tends to overlook the
 importance of contextual knowledge in shaping the organizational form of
 knowledge workers who are employees in large corporations. This paper
 proposes a model to understand the way knowledge base and organizational
 form are related to the work commitment, effort and job satisfaction of
 knowledge workers. The model is derived from (1) a critical examination of
 the market model of knowledge work organization, and (2) the results of
 empirical research conducted in two large corporations. We argue that
 contextual knowledge is important in the relationships between the
 corporation and knowledge workers. A dualistic model and an enclave
 organizational form are suggested to examine the relationships between the
 commitment, work effort and job satisfaction of knowledge workers. We
 noted from our empirical cases that enclave-like work teams enhanced the
 expertise and job autonomy of knowledge workers vis-à-vis management.
 These work teams together with the performance-based pay system, however,
 led to unmet job expectations including limited employee influence over
 decision-making and careers, and communication gaps with senior
 management. Under these circumstances, and in contrast to the impact of
 occupational commitment, organizational commitment did not contribute to
 work effort. The study highlights the importance of management's strategy
 in shaping the organizational form of knowledge work. The paper concludes
 by noting general implications of our study for the management of
 expertise and for further research. Copyright 2002 Blackwell Publishers Ltd..

Title: Voice Lessons: Tempered Radicalism and the Use of Voice and Silence 
Abstract:
 This article explores the ontology of voice and silence in the context of
 tempered radicalism. The career experiences of gay and lesbian Protestant
 ministers illuminate key issues for understanding voice and silence in
 organizations. First, social actors' discursive context provides genres
 and plots for the construction of self-hood that shape their use of voice
 and silence. Second, voice and silence are ambiguous, intertwined
 phenomena. When you are saying one thing, you are not saying another.
 Third, self-authorization - a form of institutional change agency -
 legitimates action that falls outside institutional norms for authorized
 resistance, while framing these actions as enactments of institutional
 values and beliefs. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2003.

Title: Cooperation Costs, Governance Choice and Alliance Evolution 
Abstract:
 While researchers in alliance management have identified the duality of
 cooperation and control within alliances, comparative governance scholars
 have not yet developed a coherent framework for relating the costs of
 cooperation to governance choices. This paper proposes a theory of
 cooperation costs highlighting the importance of joint task complexity,
 interpartner diversity, equity and strategic implications on the
 perception of alliance value and the formation and evolution of hybrid
 governance structures. A tolerance frontier is used to predict conditions
 for alliance failure both ex ante and after formation, as well as
 conditions under which an alliance will evolve once formed. The framework
 is illustrated through an analysis of the initial structuring and
 subsequent changes in the NedCar alliance between Mitsubishi Motors and
 Volvo, and implications for further research are discussed. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005.

Title: The Dynamic Between Firms' Environmental Strategies and Institutional Constraints in Emerging Economies: Evidence from China and Taiwan 
Abstract:
 This paper combines institutional and political perspectives to develop a
 framework for analysing firms' strategies in relation to demands for
 environmental protection in emerging economies. The main subjects for an
 examination of the framework and the issues it raises are three
 large-scale diversified multinational corporations (MNCs) in the chemicals
 sector, each with manufacturing in both China (PRC) and Taiwan. They are
 contrasted with four local firms in the same sector. An accommodation
 between MNCs' strategies and institutional constraints is achieved through
 a system of dynamic relationships in which both firms and institutional
 agents have a stake. Institutions are found to be more pervious to
 corporate strategic action than has been assumed by recent institutional
 theory, and with consequences that are not necessarily inimical to local
 community interests. The study offers new insights into (1) the processes
 that lead to conformity in corporate environmental practices
 (isomorphism), (2) the need to extend the normal purview of institutional
 theory, and (3) the contribution of a political perspective that allows
 for MNC proactivity. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005.

Title: An Examination of Collaboration and Knowledge Transfer: China-Singapore Suzhou Industrial Park 
Abstract:
 This paper examines alliance knowledge transfer using a case study of the
 China-Singapore Suzhou Industrial Park (SIP), an alliance involving the
 Chinese and Singaporean governments, their agencies, and various private
 sector organizations. The objective is to extend existing knowledge in the
 alliance learning area and provide deeper understanding of some
 process-oriented aspects of alliance learning performance. We found that
 tacit knowledge was particularly difficult to transfer and that issues
 involving collaborative interactions between the partners both facilitated
 and impeded knowledge transfer. We also found that competitive learning
 occurred, which impacted the partner relationship and knowledge transfer. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2006.

Title: Aligning Manufacturing Strategy and Business-Level Competitive Strategy in New Competitive Environments: The Case for Strategic Resonance 
Abstract:
 In this paper we make the case for "strategic resonance" in the strategy
 making process within dynamic and highly volatile market conditions. We
 discuss how managers are faced with competing paradigms of resource-driven
 versus market-led approaches to strategy but we suggest that both
 paradigms have flaws and may cause "strategic dissonance" to occur.
 Moreover, we offer additional insights into why strategic dissonance can
 occur within the strategy process of the firm. We suggest that a key
 omission often lies in the neglect of operations managers' potentially
 important contributions to the strategy mainstream process. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005.

Abstract:
 This study examines one specific aspect of the resource-based view,
 intellectual capital, and its three knowledge components - human,
 organizational, and social capital. We hypothesize that the impact of each
 component on financial performance is contingent upon the values of the
 other components, and that these leveraging effects are themselves
 contingent upon the industry conditions in which a business operates. Our
 hypotheses are supported using line-of-business survey and FDIC data
 (within-industry/within-geographic region) from two non-competing resource
 niches of the banking industry (personal and commercial banking). Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2006.

Title: The Business School 'Business': Some Lessons from the US Experience 
Abstract:
 US business schools dominate the business school landscape, particularly
 for the MBA degree. This fact has caused schools in other countries to
 imitate the US schools as a model for business education. But US business
 schools face a number of problems, many of them a result of offering a
 value proposition that primarily emphasizes the career-enhancing,
 salary-increasing aspects of business education as contrasted with the
 idea of organizational management as a profession to be pursued out of a
 sense of intrinsic interest or even service. We document some of the
 problems confronting US business schools and show how many of these arise
 from a combination of a market-like orientation to education coupled with
 an absence of a professional ethos. In this tale, there are some lessons
 for educational organizations both in the US and elsewhere that are
 interested in learning from the US experience. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2004.

Title: An Examination of Differences Between Organizational Legitimacy and Organizational Reputation 
Abstract:
 Organizational legitimacy and organizational reputation have similar
 antecedents, social construction processes and consequences. Nonetheless,
 an improved understanding of relationships between legitimacy and
 reputation requires that differences between the two be specified and
 clarified. Our examination of past research indicates that legitimacy
 emphasizes the social acceptance resulting from adherence to social norms
 and expectations whereas reputation emphasizes comparisons among
 organizations. We empirically examine two antecedents of the financial,
 regulatory, and public dimensions of legitimacy and reputation in a
 population of US commercial banks. We find that isomorphism improves
 legitimacy, but its effects on reputation depend on the bank's reputation.
 Moreover, higher financial performance increases reputation, but does not
 increase the legitimacy of high performing banks. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005.

 bridge this gap by developing a dynamic framework for the role of social
 networks from idea generation to selection. We apply findings from
 creativity and behavioural decision-making literature and present an
 in-depth understanding of the sociological processes in the front-end of
 the new product development process. Our framework builds on the
 importance of mutual understanding, sensemaking and consensus formation.
 The propositions focus on both network structure and content and highlight
 the need to have strong ties and prior related knowledge, to incorporate
 decision makers, and to move over time from a large, non-redundant and
 heterogeneous to a smaller and more cohesive network structure. We
 conclude with a discussion on empirical validation of the framework and
 possible extensions. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2007.

Title: Burned by Bullying in the American Workplace: Prevalence, Perception, Degree and Impact 
Abstract:
 This study assesses the prevalence of workplace bullying in a sample of US
 workers, using a standardized measure of workplace bullying (Negative Acts
 Questionnaire, NAQ), and compares the current study's prevalence rates
 with those from other bullying and aggression studies. The article opens
 by defining bullying as a persistent, enduring form of abuse at work and
 contrasting it with other negative workplace actions and interactions.
 Through a review of the current literature, we propose and test hypotheses
 regarding bullying prevalence and dynamics relative to a sample of US
 workers. After discussing research methods, we report on the rates of
 bullying in a US sample, compare these to similar studies, and analyse the
 negative acts that might lead to perceptions of being bullied. Based upon
 past conceptualizations, as well as research that suggests bullying is a
 phenomenon that occurs in gradations, we introduce and provide statistical
 evidence for the construct and impact of bullying degree. Finally, the
 study explores the impact of bullying on persons who witnessed but did not
 directly experience bullying in their jobs. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2007.

Title: Identifying, Enabling and Managing Dynamic Capabilities in the Public Sector 
Abstract:
 In this paper, we examine how a public sector organization developed a new
 strategic approach based on the identification and use of an internal
 dynamic capability (learning through experimenting). In response to the
 need for continual performance improvement in spite of reduced financial
 resources, this organization engaged in three overlapping phases as they
 shifted to this strategic approach. First, managers identified appropriate
 latent dynamic capabilities. Next, they used their leadership skills and
 built on established levels of trust to enable the use of these dynamic
 capabilities. Finally, they managed the tension between unrestricted
 development of local initiatives and organizational needs for guidance and
 control. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2007.

Title: Organizational Transformation in Transition Economies: Resource-based and Organizational Learning Perspectives 
Abstract:
 The capitalist and socialist societies of the twentieth century assigned
 firms different roles within their economic systems. Enterprises
 transforming from socialist to market economies thus face fundamental
 organizational restructuring. Many former state-owned firms in the
 transition economies of Central and Eastern Europe have failed at this
 task. These firms have pursued primarily defensive downsizing, rather than
 strategic restructuring, as a result of both internal and external
 constraints on restructuring strategies. Copyright 2003 Blackwell Publishing Ltd..

Title: Economics, Politics and Nations: Resistance to the Multidivisional Form in France, Germany and the United Kingdom, 1983-1993 
Abstract:
 This paper assesses economic, political and national institutional
 explanations for continued resistance to the multidivisional form in
 France, Germany and the United Kingdom during the 1980s and 1990s. It
 finds that the economics of different diversification strategies play a
 significant but changing role in the structural choices of large
 corporations. The political interests of personal, banking and government
 owners are exercised variably. There remain strong national influences on
 structural choices, with resistance to the multidivisional form
 particularly pronounced in Germany. Overall, our results call for an
 increased contextual sensitivity in management research while
 acknowledging the possibility of convergent processes in business
 organization, represented here by the slow progress of the multidivisional
 firm. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2004.

Title: Coevolution of Institutions and Corporations in Emerging Economies: How the Salim Group Morphed into an Institution of Suharto's Crony Regime 
Abstract:
 We investigate whether large family groups in emerging economies can
 proactively change their environment. We use a coevolutionary approach,
 which accounts for the influence of context on the entrepreneur and for
 the freedom of the latter to modify it. We find that entrepreneurs can
 shape institutions to their advantage, illustrated by the Salim Group,
 which achieved growth by aligning with and influencing politicians,
 eventually 'morphing into an institution'. We unravel unique
 coevolutionary patterns, which we use to extend existing theories. Our
 first contribution is to initiate a new line of inquiry in coevolution
 theory, focusing on individual companies coevolving with institutions.
 Secondly, we document factors that increase and decrease strategic choice
 for family groups in emerging economies. Thirdly, we find that the Salim
 Group became part of the crony Suharto regime. The group became both an
 institutional entrepreneur and an entrepreneurial institution,
 demonstrating that companies and institutions are not necessarily mutually
 exclusive. Copyright (c) Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2008.

Title: Examining the Conditional Limits of Relational Governance: Specialized Assets, Performance Ambiguity, and Long-Standing Ties 
Abstract:
 Despite recognition of the benefits of relational governance in
 inter-organizational exchanges, factors that may erode its value have
 received little examination. We extend the literature by asking whether
 self-interested opportunities and long-standing ties erode the positive
 association between relational governance and performance. Consistent with
 transaction cost and moral hazard logics, exchange hazards, particularly
 asset specificity and difficult performance measurement, dampen the
 positive association of relational governance and performance. We further
 find, consistent with recent inquiries into the dark side of embedded ties
 that the performance benefits associated with relational governance
 decline when parties rely on repeated partnerships. Copyright (c) Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2008.

Title: Supplier-Focused Knowledge Management in the Automobile Industry and Its Implications for Product Performance 
Abstract:
 This study focuses on the impact of knowledge management in supplier
 relations (termed as supplier-focused knowledge management, SFKM) within
 the automobile industry of an emerging economy (Brazil), on financial and
 product performance. A model of the relationship between supplier-focused
 knowledge management, including its associated processes, and performance
 is described and the associated hypotheses are developed and then tested.
 Knowledge sharing through face-to-face communication is positively related
 to both product and financial performance, while technological knowledge
 sharing has a positive impact on product performance under conditions of
 high technological dynamism. Supplier involvement in the production
 process is related to product performance and use of knowledge management
 tools is related to financial performance. The results support the major
 hypotheses of our SFKM model. These results are discussed in the context
 of the knowledge management and supplier-relations literatures in terms of
 the contributions, implications for research and practice, and directions
 for future research. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2007.

Title: Business Groups: An Integrated Model to Focus Future Research 
Abstract:
 Business groups are the primary form of managing large business
 organizations outside North America. This paper provides a systematic and
 integrative framework for understanding business groups. We argue that
 existing theoretical perspectives of business groups pay attention to four
 critical external contexts, each of which draws from a specific
 theoretical perspective: market conditions (transaction cost theory),
 social relationships (relational perspective), political factors
 (political economy perspective), and external monitoring mechanisms
 (agency theory). Business groups adapt to these external forces by
 deploying various internal mechanisms along two key dimensions: one
 focuses on the distinctive roles of the group affiliates (horizontal
 connectedness) and the other focuses on coupling and order between the
 parent firm and its affiliates (vertical linkages). Based on these two
 dimensions, a typology of business group forms is developed: network
 (N-form), club (C-form), holding (H-form), and multidivisional (M-form).
 Utilizing this model we provide research questions which facilitate an
 improved future research agenda. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2007.

Title: Reputation and Strength of Ties in Predicting Commercial Success and Artistic Merit of Independents in the Italian Feature Film Industry 
Abstract:
 We investigate what factors are required in order to succeed in
 project-based cultural industries. In particular, we focus on the effects
 of relational stability and reputation on two key dimensions of movies'
 success: commercial success and artistic merit. We combine the two
 dimensions of films' performance for a more accurate understanding of how
 authenticity and artistic merit are manufactured in the movie industry. We
 examine this question by analysing a sample of Italian films and focusing
 on the role of the film director. We argue that commercial success is
 favoured by a director's strong vertical ties (with producers and
 distributors) and economic reputation, while artistic merit is positively
 affected by a director's weak horizontal ties (with other creative
 partners) and artistic reputation. We propose an explanation in terms of
 varying degrees of task routineness and we use it to account for the
 divergence between our results and others in the cultural and
 organizational literature. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005.

Title: Strategic Motives For International Alliance Formation 
Abstract:
 This paper considers the strategic motivation for international alliance
 formation for a sample of UK firms with partners in western Europe, the
 United States and Japan. the relative importance of a set of strategic
 motives is identified and related to extant theory. A parsimonious set of
 strategic motives for the sample studied is provided by means of factor
 analysis. the paper identifies the main strategic motives for alliance
 formation by UK firms as intrinsically linked to the market and
 geographical expansion of the firm and that the main strategic motives are
 underpinned by the theories of strategic positioning and organizational
 learning. This study also finds that some of the often suggested motives
 for alliance formation found in the literature, in particular aspects of
 risk reduction associated with new projects, appear not to be particularly
 important motivating factors. Hypotheses are tested on the relationship
 between the relative importance of individual strategic motives and a
 number of characteristics of the sample - contractual form of the
 alliance, relative partner size, primary geographical location of the
 venture, industry of the alliance and partner nationality. Implications of
 the findings for future theorizing on alliances and their motives is
 identified. Copyright 1996 Basil Blackwell Ltd.

Abstract:
 This study tests the effects of cultural differences on the behaviour and
 performance of joint-ventures. We first study the relationship and
 predictions of two relevant theories, i.e., the theory about cultural
 diversity and that about cultural distance. After that, we apply the
 theories to study the behaviour and performance of Sino-Japanese and
 Sino-West joint ventures (JVs). Processing data from 2718 such JVs in
 different parts of China, we show evidence supporting our arguments. Our
 paper concludes with a discussion on the implications of the findings. Copyright 2002 Blackwell Publishers Ltd..

Title: Resource Configuration in Family Firms: Linking Resources, Strategic Planning and Technological Opportunities to Performance 
Abstract:
 We apply the resource-based view of the firm to the study of family firms
 by investigating how a family specific resource (reciprocal altruism) and
 a firm specific resource (innovative capacity) contribute to family firm
 performance. We then examine how the impact of these resources is
 moderated by strategic planning and technological opportunities. Our
 findings suggest that family firms can benefit from emphasizing the
 positive aspects of kinship and from developing innovative capacities. As
 such, we demonstrate that not only do firm specific resources contribute
 to family firm performance, but also that family relationships can be a
 source of competitive advantage for a family firm. In addition, we found a
 heightened importance of reciprocal altruism in environments rich in
 technological opportunities, and that strategic planning is more important
 for those family firms that lack innovative capacities. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2007.

Title: A Cognitive Perspective on Entrepreneurship and the Firm 
Abstract:
 I propose to examine the theme of this Special Issue from the perspective
 of its treatment - and, of especial significance, its lack of treatment -
 within economics. In the course of this examination we shall observe that
 the concepts of entrepreneurship and the firm are generally kept separate,
 and attempt to explain why. I shall avoid any discussion of recent work,
 which is more productively left to my fellow contributors, choosing
 instead to devote the first half of my contribution to providing an
 analytical basis for the second half by exploring the problem of knowledge
 in economic systems, and relating this problem to the evolved nature of
 human beings and their relationship with their environment. In this
 exploration I shall rely almost entirely on the work of economists, though
 much of it was not directed to conventional economic issues. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2007.

Title: Management, Theology and Moral Points of View: Towards an Alternative to the Conventional Materialist-Individualist Ideal-Type of Management 
Abstract:
 Weber's (1958) argument suggests that there are four ideal-types of
 management, and that conventional management is underpinned by a
 moral-point-of-view associated with a secularized Protestant Ethic, which
 can be characterized by its relatively high emphasis on materialism (e.g.
 productivity, efficiency and profitability) and individualism (e.g.
 competitiveness). Weber calls on management scholars and practitioners to
 become aware of their own moral-points-of-view, and to develop management
 theory and practice that de-emphasizes materialism and individualism. Our
 paper responds to this challenge, as we draw from an Anabaptist-Mennonite
 moral-point-of-view to develop a radical ideal-type of management that is
 characterized by its emphasis on servant leadership, stakeholding, job
 crafting and sustaincentrism. Implications for management theory and
 practice are discussed. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005.

Title: Alliance Research: Less is More 
Abstract:
 Bell et al. (2006) express dissatisfaction with academic research on
 alliances and suggest ways in which it could be improved. While much of
 the literature has delved on alliance structure, they think it should
 analyse processes by which alliances evolve, what they call the dynamics
 of cooperation. Unfortunately, they find that this literature lacks
 coherence and is useless to managers. I agree with them that the present
 dynamics of cooperation literature leaves much to be desired, but I am
 pessimistic as to its chances of ever providing parsimonious and
 managerially useful theories. Re-visiting four cases of alliance evolution
 that have been featured in the dynamics of cooperation literature, I show
 that focusing instead on alliance structure, in the broad sense of the
 term, is likely to yield strong testable propositions and useful
 managerial prescriptions. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2006.

Title: When is Contracting Preferable to Employment? An Exploration of Management "and" Worker Perspectives 
Abstract:
 Managers make choices regarding the types of employment structures that
 meet the needs of the firm, and workers make choices regarding the types
 of arrangement that meet their needs. Various streams of literature offer
 perspectives on why employment or contracting might be preferred but it is
 often the perspective of the firm that dominates the analysis. This kind
 of one-sidedness weakens our understanding of employment as a
 "relationship". It lacks recognition of the importance of mutuality: of
 matching the needs of the worker with the needs of the business. This
 paper reports research investigating management decisions to use
 self-employed contractors or employees for particular jobs, and workers'
 decisions to seek or accept organizational employment or self-employment.
 Some 80 in-depth interviews were conducted with managers and workers
 across two industries (energy supply and engineering consultancy) with the
 intent of studying two groups of workers differing dramatically in skill
 levels. While largely confirming existing theory on the management
 conditions relevant to the contracting-out of work, the study identifies
 factors that make a contracting relationship more "mutually" beneficial,
 thus suggesting propositions for further research on worker preferences. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005.

Title: Constructing Organizational Identities on the Web: A Case Study of Royal Dutch/Shell 
Abstract:
 In this paper we analyse two of the e-mail exchanges that had been posted
 on Royal Dutch/Shell's Web site in order to investigate how organizational
 identities are constructed through processes of description, questioning,
 contestation and defence. Organizational identities may be regarded as
 ongoing arguments between insiders and between ostensible insiders and
 outsiders, who deploy various persuasive techniques in their efforts to
 render hegemonic their versions of an organization's identity. Making
 plausible through persuasive rhetoric is a complex task, and requires a
 discourse analytic methodology and an analytical focus on whole
 utterances, in order to explicate how identity-as-argument is enacted. The
 research implications of our paper are twofold. First, by focusing on
 language as an opaque phenomenon, taken-for-granted ways of being
 persuasive are made strange and hence more visible. Second, our
 understanding of organizations as situated in ongoing, multi-focused
 arguments, illustrates a new way of conceptualizing the polyphonic,
 genre-relevant nature of institutional identities. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2004.

Title: Showdown at Kykuit: Field-Configuring Events as Loci for Conventionalizing Accounts 
Abstract:
 Despite the centrality of fields as a concept in organizational research,
 the processes by which fields form and change have not been studied in
 great depth. By situating action in time and space, field-configuring
 events (FCEs) offer valuable settings for researchers seeking insight into
 such processes. This paper develops a theory of accounts as a way to
 understand a mechanism by which institutional entrepreneurs seek to shape
 fields and influence the institutions that govern them. Actors produce and
 distribute justified accounts - narratives that describe the way work in
 the field ought to be done - and attempt to persuade powerful actors in
 the field to adopt them as conventions. FCEs can thus be understood as
 loci for conventionalizing accounts. The theory of accounts and
 field-level change is illustrated with a case study of a turning point FCE
 during which competing institutional entrepreneurs in the field of
 'non-profit technology assistance providers' present alternative accounts.
 Successful institutional entrepreneurship comes from recognizing political
 opportunities to align one's account with the dominant orders of worth in
 the field, thereby convincing powerful actors to accept one's account as
 convention. Copyright (c) Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2008.

Title: International and Cultural Variations in Employee Assistance Programmes: Implications for Managerial Health and Effectiveness 
Abstract:
 While employee assistance programmes (EAPs) are becoming commonplace in
 large Western organizations, little is known regarding their prevalence in
 non-Western cultures. In this paper, we provide a framework for
 understanding the prevalence of EAPs in four distinct cells of societal
 culture-based variations. A cultural matrix for analysing the relative
 emphases of styles of coping, social support systems, rites and rituals,
 and the prevalence of EAPs is developed. The implications for managerial
 health and effectiveness in the global context are discussed. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2007.

Title: The Influence of a Structurationist View on Strategic Management Research 
Abstract:
 In this article, strategic management research using structuration theory
 from 1995 to 2000 is reviewed. I describe and analyse the theoretical
 articulations adopted to make sense of strategy using a structurationist
 view. I found that, instead of being applied as the sole theoretical
 foundation, Giddens' propositions have been incorporated into other
 perspectives, the effects of which should be known by researchers looking
 for theoretical frameworks that avoid dichotomist thinking. The paper
 draws on the effects that structurationist arguments may produce regarding
 classical oppositions such as micro/macro and voluntarist/determinist. Its
 main contribution is to show how theoretical complementarities using
 structuration theory are promising avenues of research in the strategic
 management field. It also suggests that, although other alternatives of
 avoiding dichotomist logic exist, making a choice among them is more a
 question of ontological affinity than of making the 'better choice' among
 competing accounts. There are several routes to advance the understanding
 of the possibilities of human choice. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2004.

Title: Network Updating and Exploratory Learning Environment 
Abstract:
 This paper examines how the current relevance of social capital derived
 from a task-advice network affects an actor's exploratory learning
 environment. Building on Burt's (1992) structural holes hypothesis that a
 large, sparse task advice network enhances an actor's exploratory learning
 environment, I propose that such effects hold only when the direct and
 indirect network ties are composed of current network contacts (ones that
 have been updated since the last change in positions of an actor).
 Analyses of data from a sample of 230 salaried employees of a
 high-technology manufacturing corporation support my arguments. In
 addition to the focus of social capital research on network structure,
 therefore, this study emphasizes the time-contingent value of social
 capital. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2004.

Title: 'Kindergarten Cop': Paternalism and Resistance in a High-Commitment Workplace 
Abstract:
 This article investigates how organizational paternalism, often considered
 a traditional and rather archaic management style, is evoked by a culture
 management programme in order to increase control. Most research assumes
 that paternalism does successfully capture the subjective commitments of
 employees because they appreciate the 'caring' and 'nurturing' environment
 it engenders. Lacking in this literature is a consideration of "how" and
 "why" employees might resist organizational paternalism. An empirical
 study is presented that suggests some workers resist paternalism because
 it casts them as irrational children and undermines their dignity. The
 structure of this resistance is explored in detail and the relationships
 between paternalism, culture management and HRM examined. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005.

Title: The Organization of Marketing: A Study of Decentralized, Devolved and Dispersed Marketing Activity 
Abstract:
 Despite a priority research grading by the Marketing Science Institute,
 the issue of marketing organization is bewilderingly under explored.
 Whilst advances have been made in conceptualizing marketing organization
 in networks of large trans-national corporations, recent research has
 highlighted the paucity of empirical work into the intra-firm dispersion
 of marketing activities. This study is designed to examine just this
 issue. The aim is to develop data-grounded insights into the organization
 and dispersion of marketing activities. A case study finds an unusual form
 of marketing organization. This form of marketing organization is
 characterized by the decentralization, devolution and dispersion of
 community-oriented marketing management activities driven by empowered
 operational-level part-time-marketers who either adopt a traditional
 mix-management approach or more rarely a relational approach. These
 findings lead to a range of interesting implications for theorists and
 practitioners. Copyright 2003 Blackwell Science Asia Pty. Ltd..

Title: An Integrative Framework for Measuring the Extent to which Organizational Variables Influence the Success of Process Improvement Programmes 
Abstract:
 Studies on the three types of process improvement programmes (Continuous
 Improvement, Reengineering and Benchmarking) have appeared many times in
 the literature. These studies suggest that certain organizational
 variables act as enablers and their presence or absence can significantly
 influence success rates. Such studies have tended to examine companies
 where a single programme has been implemented. In contrast, this paper
 examines a sample of companies who have experienced all three programmes.
 Our aim is to compare and contrast each programme's impact on firm
 performance and identify which organizational variables are common and
 which are programme-specific enablers of success. We build and test an
 integrative framework to support our analysis. Our study found that: (1)
 Reengineering delivered the greatest impact on performance; (2) executive
 commitment was needed to make this happen; (3) strategic alignment was the
 major influence on the success rate of Reengineering and Continuous
 Improvement programmes; and (4) employee empowerment was necessary for
 each programme to work effectively. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005.

Title: For the Sake of Argument: Towards an Understanding of Rhetoric as Process 
Abstract:
 This paper seeks to respond to two particular aspects of Legge's work, her
 development of the concept of rhetoric and her commitment to the educative
 process. Legge has been drawing attention to the concept of rhetoric for a
 long time (e.g. Gowler and Legge, 1981, 1996 [originally 1983]; Legge,
 1989, 1995a). However, despite its popularity as an epithet, the "process"
 of rhetoric remains largely unexplored. Locating rhetoric within a
 poststructuralist view of language, this paper utilizes and explores the
 contribution of 'The New Rhetoric' to such an understanding, focusing on
 issues of style and context. This is used to illustrate a characterization
 of rhetoric which emphasizes its quality as a closed system with an
 important role in maintaining the status quo of 'managerialism'.
 Highlighting the key concept within 'The New Rhetoric' of "audience", we
 suggest that to achieve change it is necessary to intervene in the closed
 cycle of the relationship between producers and consumers of management
 knowledge. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2004.

Title: Executives' Orientations as Indicators of Crisis Management Policies and Practices 
Abstract:
 The paper examines effects of executives' orientations on crisis
 management awareness and practices, drawing on the simplicity and paradox
 management theories. It is suggested that a focus on single-sided
 management constitutes an antecedent of crisis proneness. Employing a set
 of key corporate domains and based on a holistic organizational approach,
 the study aims at assessing the extent to which companies are crisis prone
 or prepared. In a sample of 82 Istaeli business and not-for-profit
 organizations it was found that human resource management, strategy,
 structure, and unlearning factors significantly predicted crisis
 preparedness. These results suggest that unlearning, despite a mere
 allusion to this correlate in the simplicity and paradox management
 theories, correlates better with crisis preparedness. By contrast,
 traditional strategy-related and structural effects were marginally
 related to crisis management policies. Implications and suggestions for
 further research are proposed. Copyright 2003 Blackwell Publishing Ltd..

Title: The Entrepreneurial Organization of Heterogeneous Capital 
Abstract:
 Transaction cost, property rights, and resource-based approaches to the
 firm assume that assets, both tangible and intangible, are heterogeneous.
 Arranging these assets to minimize contractual hazards, to provide
 efficient investment incentives, or to exploit competitive advantage is
 conceived as the prime task of economic organization. None of these
 approaches, however, is based on a systematic theory of capital
 heterogeneity. In this paper we outline the approach to capital developed
 by the Austrian school of economics and show how Austrian capital theory
 provides a natural bridge between theory of entrepreneurship and the
 theory of the firm. We refine Austrian capital theory by defining capital
 heterogeneity in terms of subjectively perceived attributes, the
 functions, characteristics, and uses of capital assets. Such attributes
 are not given, but have to be created or discovered by means of
 entrepreneurial action. Conceiving entrepreneurship as the organization of
 heterogeneous capital provides new insights into the emergence,
 boundaries, and internal organization of the firm, and suggests testable
 implications about how entrepreneurship is manifested. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2007.

Title: Making Space: Valuing Our Talk in Organizations 
Abstract:
 This paper argues for a re-consideration of the value of process, here
 represented by the talk of organizational actors. It argues that the talk
 between organizational actors is an under-valued organization resource
 that presently in most organizations is allowed to slip way into obscurity
 because of its evanescent qualities. It argues this represents an
 unacceptable loss of a vital layer of organizational knowing, and
 illustrates this through the utilization of two contrasting case
 incidents. Accordingly, the paper discusses the potential of re-presenting
 talk as a means to prise open the space-between-words, and despite the
 limitations of contextual relevance, suggests these reflexive
 opportunities will develop deeper, richer and more novel interpretations
 of knowing. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2003.

Title: Manifested Attitudes: Intricacies of Inter-Partner Learning in Collaboration 
Abstract:
 This article is concerned with attitudes to learning in
 inter-organizational collaboration. Basic attitudes to learning evident in
 extant research -"selfish", "sharing" and "sidelined"- are compared with
 those observed through research-oriented action research. A
 conceptualization based on a characterization of the attitudes observed in
 the research situations is produced. It models attitudes to learning in
 collaboration as bundles of varied stances relating to taking and giving
 knowledge from or to a partner, or excluding learning from the agenda
 altogether. The observations suggest that actual attitudes - which are
 evident at individual, community or organizational level - are much more
 varied than the basic attitudes and that they often include elements of
 all three -"sidelined", "selfish "and "sharing"- motivations. The model
 acknowledges differences in perceptions of attitudes, differences of
 attitudes within partner organizations as well as between them, and
 differences in partners' attitudes to each other over time. Copyright (c) Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2007.

Title: Don't Take It Personally: Exploring Cognitive Conflict as a Mediator of Affective Conflict 
Abstract:
 Research has sought to explain the multi-dimensionality of conflict and
 its paradoxical effects on decision making (Amason, 1996; DeDreu and
 Weingart, 2003; Jehn, 1995). The primary prescription to emerge from this
 work has been for teams to seek the benefits of cognitive (task) conflict
 while simultaneously avoiding the costs of affective (emotional) conflict.
 The problem is that these two types of conflict often occur together and
 researchers have offered few explanations as to why this happens or
 guidance as to how it can be avoided. In this paper, we provide empirical
 evidence that cognitive conflict can contribute to affective conflict. As
 a result, by encouraging cognitive conflict, teams may inadvertently
 provoke affective conflict. We provide evidence that behavioural
 integration can mitigate this tendency. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2007.

Title: Management Control as an Employee Resource: The Case of Front-line Service Workers 
Abstract:
 This paper argues that the conception of management control as an employee
 resource can enhance critical understandings of front-line service work.
 The argument is developed first through a critique of the contemporary
 control literature and its prominent worker images of smiling docility and
 haggard exhaustion. Seeking to encourage accounts more sensitive to the
 subjectivity and agency of service workers, the paper calls for more
 research attention to the question of how these employees experience and
 evaluate management control in relation to their self-defined interests.
 Analysis of the nature of contemporary service work suggests that one such
 perceived interest is likely to be interactive control, or the capacity of
 workers to control and influence those parties with whom they directly
 interact. Based on a close reading of the emerging empirical literature on
 services, the article explores various ways in which the bureaucratic,
 technical and normative regulation designed by management to control
 service workers is used in turn by workers to further their own control
 and influence over managers and customers. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2004.

Title: Role Expectations and Middle Manager Strategic Agency 
Abstract:
 Based on an analysis of 262 interviews, I argue that role expectations
 have the potential to both enable and constrain middle manager strategic
 agency. To explain why the same role expectations have contradictory
 effects on agency, I analyse enabling conditions corresponding to four
 strategic role expectations, based on Floyd and Wooldridge's work on
 middle manager roles. After presenting eight enabling conditions for
 strategic agency, specific to the four role expectations, I argue that the
 dominant functionalist view of strategic roles should be augmented from a
 middle manager viewpoint. I suggest a reciprocal view of strategic role
 expectations, which elucidates the tensions between dialogue, legitimacy
 and rationality within a set of strategic roles. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2007.

Title: Organizational De-development 
Abstract:
 Organizational decline prompts leaders to downsize, reducing the size of
 the workforce in an attempt to cut costs. This paper discusses some of the
 dangers of downsizing in which organizations experience an unanticipated
 and unwanted loss of core competencies. An alternative to downsizing is
 offered, showing how organizations can 'de-develop' by slowly and
 deliberately moving to a lower order of organized complexity, retaining
 essential core competencies and supporting functions. To produce a
 'soft-landing' that preserves core competencies, a new identity is forged
 and connections to the new identity are uncovered. The connections point
 out what must be preserved, such as a crucial channel for key products,
 for the new identity to survive and flourish. The de-developed
 organization preserves customers, products, markets, channels, revenue
 sources, alliances, skilled people, ways to organize, and/or image crucial
 to the new strategic identity before letting go of the remaining
 customers, products, etc. The paper identifies conditions under which
 de-development can be desirable and suggests a 'devolutionary' process
 that points out some of the key moves needed to reduce organized
 complexity and realize a soft landing. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2004.

Title: Understanding Labour Turnover in a Labour Intensive Industry: Evidence from the British Clothing Industry 
Abstract:
 The clothing industry is both a quintessential global industry and one
 that is inescapably labour intensive. Despite more and more production
 shifting to low wage economies in the past decades, there remains a
 significant amount of clothing manufacturing in high wage economies. This
 study examines the drivers of change that are forcing restructuring in one
 such country and the outcomes of such changes for the organization of
 production. Because the changes have involved treating workers as a
 resource to be developed rather than a cost, preventing labour turnover
 has become a crucial component of this strategic repositioning. In
 presenting the results of a national survey of UK clothing manufacturers
 we find that high labour turnover rates persist. We discuss the historical
 background to this phenomenon and current trends, and then explore the
 principal variables that might explain these trends. We conclude with a
 discussion of the outcomes facing firms in this industry and comment on
 why managers resist comprehensive changes in organizational routines and
 the effort bargain. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2003.

Title: The Fragmentation of a Railway: A Study of Organizational Change 
Abstract:
 This paper considers pathways of organizational change within British Rail
 (BR) during its long period of commercialization culminating in
 privatization. The Laughlin (1991) and Parker (1995a) frameworks are used
 to demonstrate how a new interpretative scheme supplanted the previous
 interpretative scheme within BR between the 1970s and privatization in the
 mid-1990s, leading to a fragmented organization. BR did not survive and
 privatization of Britain's railways remains controversial. The study
 demonstrates that without the earlier changes in interpretive scheme from
 'social railway' to 'business railway' to 'profitable business', and the
 associated changes in design archetypes and sub-systems, privatization
 would have been both less tempting and less feasible. It is intended that
 the approach developed here to analyse organizational change in BR should
 be applicable to the study of other privatizations and to other forms of
 organizational change in both the public and private sectors. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005.

Title: Disentangling Alliance Management Processes: Decision Making, Politicality, and Alliance Performance 
Abstract:
 Using a sample of 106 organizations engaged in strategic alliances, we
 develop and test a framework of alliance-related organizational
 decision-making processes and their impact on alliance performance. With
 regard to direct effects, our results show a negative impact of
 decision-making recursiveness and no significant relationship for openness
 and procedural rationality. Acknowledging the importance of the
 organization's micropolitical context in which these decision processes
 are embedded, we also test the moderating influence of politicality. Our
 findings provide support for our hypotheses that in a context of low
 politicality, the decision-making characteristics of openness and
 procedural rationality have a positive influence, whereas recursiveness
 negatively affects alliance performance. In a context of high
 politicality, however, openness and procedural rationality exert a
 negative influence, and the negative impact of recursiveness is
 aggravated. We suggest that alliance-related decision making cannot be
 adequately understood without explicitly considering the micropolitical
 context in organizations. Copyright (c) Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2007.

Title: Investigating Managers' Exploration and Exploitation Activities: The Influence of Top-Down, Bottom-Up, and Horizontal Knowledge Inflows 
Abstract:
  This paper develops and tests hypotheses on the influence of managers'
 knowledge inflows on managers' exploration and exploitation activities.
 Based on a survey among managers of a leading electronics firm, the
 findings indicate, as expected, that top-down knowledge inflows of
 managers positively relate to the extent to which these managers conduct
 exploitation activities, while they do not relate to managers' exploration
 activities. Furthermore, as expected, bottom-up and horizontal knowledge
 inflows of managers positively relate to these managers' exploration
 activities, while they do not relate to managers' exploitation activities.
 We contribute to current literature on exploration and exploitation by
 focusing on the manager level of analysis, and by adding the importance of
 knowledge flow configurations to studies which investigate the impact of
 organizational factors on exploration and exploitation. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2007.

Title: Opportunity Discovery, Problem Solving and a Theory of the Entrepreneurial Firm 
Abstract:
 When should an entrepreneur employ a market to help discover and exploit
 opportunities, and when should the entrepreneur create a firm to do so? If
 a firm is created, how should it be organized? In this paper we argue that
 opportunities equate to valuable problem-solution pairings, and that
 opportunity discovery relates to deliberate search or recognition over
 this solution space. As problem complexity increases, experiential (or
 'directional') search via trial-and-error provides fewer benefits, and
 cognitive (or 'heuristic') search via theorizing becomes more useful.
 Cognitive search, however, requires knowledge sharing, when knowledge is
 distributed among specialists, that is plagued by a knowledge
 appropriation hazard and a strategic knowledge accumulation hazard.
 Markets, authority-based hierarchy, and consensus-based hierarchy then
 have differential effects on the efficiency of opportunity discovery given
 the complexity of the associated problem. Those entrepreneurs with
 exceptional capabilities of opportunity recognition can efficiently adopt
 authority-based governance over a wider range of complexity. We thus
 combine the two major modes of opportunity discovery - search and
 recognition - onto one framework that can explain different
 entrepreneurial organizational forms, resulting in an entrepreneurial
 theory of the firm. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2007.

Title: Measures for Dealing with Competence and Integrity Violations of Interorganizational Trust at the Corporate and Operating Levels of Organizational Hierarchy 
Abstract:
 We examine how partners in an interorganizational relationship can repair
 violated trust, and if that is impossible, how they can preserve the
 collaborative relationship. We also consider under what circumstances exit
 from the relationship is the only viable option. We propose that the
 effectiveness of legalistic and non-legalistic measures in response to a
 trust violation is a function of the hierarchical level at which the
 violation occurred (corporate vs. operating), the character of the
 violation (competence vs. integrity), the frequency and severity with
 which it occurred, the organizational context in which boundary spanners
 are embedded, and the degree of dependence between the partners. Based on
 these factors, we explore how the way in which violation of trust is dealt
 with at one hierarchical level might affect trust at the other level. Our
 theoretical model reveals that prior findings on trust repair in
 inter-personal context may not hold in the interorganizational context. Copyright (c) Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2008.

Title: Re-Engineering the Sense of Self: the Manager and the Management Guru 
Abstract:
 Conventional explanations of the enormous popularity of management gurus
 have centred on the need for managers to find relatively quick and simple
 solutions to their organizations' complex problems and the gurus'
 adeptness with marketing technology to promote these solutions. A few
 writers have also recognized the role that management gurus play in
 responding to managers' needs to make sense of themselves. Management
 gurus appeal to the manager's social or externally directed esteem needs
 by legitimating and celebrating the manager's role in society. the
 spiritual and charismatic quality of the gurus' work resonates with the
 manager's personal or internally driven needs by providing a sense of hope
 and purpose. Copyright 1996 Basil Blackwell Ltd.

Title: Appreciating Stockbroking: Constructing Conceptions to Make Sense of Performance 
Abstract:
 The performance of individual stockbrokers differs. This paper aims to
 make sense of these differences. In a study of 14 stockbrokers, the high
 performing brokers described their working life in a systematically
 different way, compared to the low performing brokers. The brokers gave
 different and conflicting accounts of what, from an outsider's viewpoint,
 seemed to be very similar work and working conditions. The brokers'
 different accounts are interpreted and reconstructed into two opposing
 conceptions of stockbrokers' world of working. In an ideal typical sense
 these two conceptions make sense of, and maybe even explain the
 stockbrokers' different levels of performance. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2004.

Title: Planned or Prioritized? Two Options in Managing the Implementation of Strategic Decisions 
Abstract:
 This paper presents findings from a study of 55 cases of decision
 implementation. The research identifies a number of features that
 characterize the way implementation is managed which appear to enhance the
 chance of success. Analysis reveals patterns in the data indicating that
 these features fall into two groupings, giving rise to two distinct
 approaches to implementation management. These are termed the
 Experience-based approach and the Readiness-based approach from the
 initial conditions which give rise to each. Although following either
 approach may enhance decision performance, the greatest success is
 associated with a dual approach. Implementations that follow neither are
 generally less successful. A theory of implementation management is
 postulated, comprising a Planned Option and a Prioritized Option. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2003.

Title: Empowerment and Accountability: Evidence from the UK Privatized Water Industry 
Abstract:
 Empowerment initiatives have become popular in recent years in programmes
 of organizational change, but their impact as a practical managerial
 policy remains shrouded in ambiguities. We attempt to provide a fuller
 understanding of their impact, firstly by exploring managers'
 understanding of what constitutes empowerment, and secondly by locating
 the analysis of changes in managers' experiences of empowerment in the
 context of their experiences of changes in accountability practices.
 Drawing on data from interviews with managers and a mail questionnaire, we
 argue that the experience of empowerment is multi-faceted, and shaped by
 managers' attitudes towards it. Moreover we find that accountability plays
 a more significant and independent role in encouraging managers to engage
 in empowerment than has hitherto been acknowledged. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2006.

Title: The Effect of 'Simplicity' on the Strategy-Performance Relationship: A Note 
Abstract:
 The concept of 'simplicity' (Miller, 1993) in strategy making suggests a
 preoccupation with a single goal, strategic activity, or function. Prior
 research indicates that simplicity may, under certain conditions, benefit
 firm performance, but it may also limit an organization's perspective and
 blind it to the breadth and variety it needs to sustain its success. This
 field study investigates the role of simplicity as a moderator of
 strategy-performance relationships. Using moderated hierarchical
 regression analysis, simplicity was found to enhance performance among
 firms using cost leadership and focus strategies among a sample of 32
 firms. The findings suggest that the strategy making styles and practices
 of strategic managers influence the character of the whole organization
 and often have an important impact on organizational outcomes. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2006.

Title: Guest Editors' Introduction 
Abstract:
 &emsp;This introductory paper provides a background to the origins, themes
 and papers of this Special Issue on Micro Strategy and Strategizing. Our
 overarching argument is that, while the field of strategy has
 traditionally concentrated on the macro-level of organizations, it needs
 now to attend to much more micro-level phenomena. We propose an
 activity-based view of strategy that focuses on the detailed processes and
 practices which constitute the day-to-day activities of organizational
 life and which relate to strategic outcomes. The paper develops this view
 by considering two bodies of theory, those of the resource based view and
 institutionalism; two bodies of empirical work, those on corporate
 diversification and structure; and finally the process tradition of
 strategy research. The paper identifies the benefits of the activity-based
 view and introduces some challenges for further research. It concludes by
 introducing the papers in this Special Issue. Copyright 2003 Blackwell Publishers Ltd..

Title: The Social Construction of Contextual Rationalities in MNCs: An Anglo-German Comparison of Subsidiary Choice 
Abstract:
 This paper seeks to examine empirically the extent to which actors in
 subsidiaries of multinational companies (MNCs) are able to exercise some
 choice in the face of global pressures from the MNC headquarters (HQ). We
 argue that managerial practices in MNCs are not the result of a simple
 imposition of a global or a MNC organizational rationality but are subject
 to an interactive process, where differing contextual rationalities come
 into play. Using data from MNC subsidiaries in Britain and Germany, the
 paper compares the power resources and strategic choices of subsidiary
 level actors and shows the ways in which they seek to influence global
 strategy implementation as it affects local work systems. We investigate
 the different abilities of German and British managers to shape global
 restructuring processes in their local organizational contexts and
 conclude that national contexts impact on both the formulation of parent
 company strategies via a home country rationality and on the
 implementation of global strategies via a host country rationality. There
 are greater national barriers to a MNC policy of convergence based on
 standardized products and processes in Germany than in the UK. Copyright Blackwell Publishers Ltd 2003.

Title: From Dramaturgy to Theatre as Technology: The Case of Corporate Theatre 
Abstract:
 This article examines a piece of corporate theatre. Although theatre has
 entered organization studies through the dramatistic writing of Kenneth
 Burke and the dramaturgical writings of Erving Goffman, this article is
 concerned with an approach variously described as "organizational,
 radical", "situation" or "corporate" theatre that treats theatre not
 primarily as a resource, an ontology or a metaphor but as a technology.
 This approach involves the deployment by an organization of dramatists,
 actors, directors, set designers, lighting specialists, and musicians to
 put on performances in front of audiences. Using frameworks derived from
 studies of theatre a particular piece of corporate theatre is described
 and analysed. It is argued that this form of theatre appears to be used to
 contain reflection and to promote the views of a particular group within
 an organization. It does not confront an audience but subtly suggests
 alternative ways of evaluating, construing and understanding issues. This
 may be achieved by anaesthetizing audience reaction by encouraging
 imaginative participation in the performance so that cherished beliefs and
 values do not appear to be directly challenged. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2004.

Title: Multinational Management Strategy and Human Resource Decision Making In the Single European Market 
Abstract:
 There has been considerable academic interest in the consequences of
 European integration for multinational companies and their subsidiaries,
 and the co-ordination and control of human resource decision making.
 Against the backdrop of this debate, this paper examines the impact of
 European integration on management organization and human resource
 decision making in 13 British multinational companies. Although there were
 partial moves towards the development of European managers, a
 European-wide approach to human resource matters was not yet a conspicuous
 feature of this sample of multinationals. the global preoccupations of the
 companies, as well as the persistence of national variations in consumer
 markets and modes of product regulation, were clearly major constraints on
 the emergence of European forms of corporate organization and underpinned
 the lack of enthusiasm for distinctively European approaches to employee
 management. Copyright 1996 Basil Blackwell Ltd.

Title: The Performance Differential between Private and State Owned Enterprises: The Roles of Ownership, Management and Market Structure 
Abstract:
 This article examines differences in performance between private companies
 (POEs) and state owned enterprises (SOEs), with an emphasis on the effects
 of market structure. The study uses a comprehensive panel covering in
 principle all registered companies during the 1990s in Norway, a country
 where SOEs play an important role in regular markets. Return on assets as
 well as costs relative to sales revenue are used as measures of
 performance in markets where SOEs and POEs compete with each other.
 Overall, POEs perform significantly better than SOEs. The study tests the
 hypothesis that SOE managers may learn from POE managers in environments
 with stronger competition, but finds only weak empirical support for such
 a learning mechanism. Copyright (c) Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2008.

Title: Contrasting Institutional and Performance Accounts of Environmental Management Systems: Three Case Studies in the UK Water & Sewerage Industry 
Abstract:
 This paper presents results from a longitudinal, qualitative study into
 the adoption of environmental management systems (EMS) in three companies
 in the UK water & sewerage industry. Based on institutional theory and the
 literature on EMS, four factors related to the adoption of EMS are
 identified: external and internal institutional forces, environmental
 performance issues, and economic performance issues. While previous
 literature has often assumed a balance of performance and institutional
 factors or a preponderance of performance factors, the results of this
 study indicate that institutional forces are the predominant drivers. The
 results further indicate that environmental performance issues become less
 important over time, whereas institutional drivers and economic
 performance rationales increase in importance over time. While conforming
 to institutional pressures can result in improved economic performance of
 a company, adoption of environmental management systems mostly on the
 basis of institutional and economic factors has wider repercussions for
 the state of corporate environmental management and progress towards
 greater ecological sustainability of business. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2007.

Title: Knowledge Networks and Careers: Academic Scientists in Industry-University Links 
Abstract:
 Careers are central to our understanding of the knowledge creation
 dynamics of network organizations. Based on the example of R&D project
 collaboration between firms and universities, this paper examines the
 emerging forms of career models that support knowledge flows between
 organizations. It explores how some large firms in the high-technology
 sectors have sought to break away from the limitations of internal R&D and
 firm-based careers for scientists by engaging in external collaborative
 projects to gain access to the open knowledge networks of university
 researchers. It examines how the firms seek to forge close institutional
 ties with their university partners and develop network career structures
 in order to engage academic scientists in joint knowledge production. It
 argues that firms have sought to extend their human resource and knowledge
 boundaries into the established internal labour markets of the
 universities with which they collaborate, leading to the formation of a
 pool of joint human resources with work experiences and career patterns
 straddling the two sectors. The paper develops the concept of an
 'overlapping internal labour market' to provide a conceptual bridge
 between internal labour markets and network organizations. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2007.

Title: Choosing Constraints as a Third Solution to Agency 
Abstract:
 The standard solutions to agency, incentive contracting and monitoring,
 are degraded by the frequency and the duration of the decisions affected.
 Decisions of low frequency and long duration are not effectively
 controlled by either monitoring or incentive contracting. For decisions of
 low frequency and long duration, constraining the firm's choices
 significantly reduces agency. Applying the theory, guidelines for choosing
 constraints are suggested, and propositions advanced. As one application,
 the mission statement is considered as a vehicle for embedding
 constraints. The theory is also investigated by examining existing
 recommendations for both the content and process of mission statements. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2004.

Title: The Narrative of 'Evidence Based' Management: A Polemic 
Abstract:
 'Evidence based' management is a popular contemporary account of the
 relationship between research and practice in management studies. This
 paper critically examines the implications of this account from the
 perspective of Formalism: a narratological approach to critique that
 focuses on how narratives are made compelling, and hence powerful.
 Compelling narratives deploy devices that establish (i) credibility and
 (ii) defamiliarization. Using this approach the paper identifies and
 examines different ideological strands in the nascent literature on
 evidence based management: "pragmatism", "progress", "systematization",
 "technique", "accumulation". These are the means by which advocates of
 evidence based approaches construct a compelling story about the value of
 this approach. Prior criticism of the evidence based approach has centred
 on epistemological and technical issues. The aim here is to use an
 aesthetic mode of criticism to highlight political and moral implications.
 These are important given the relationship between claims to knowledge and
 the use of power; and the interaction between management research, and
 management as practice. Copyright (c) Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2008.

Title: Why Service and Manufacturing Entry Mode Choices Differ: The Influence of Transaction Cost Factors, Risk and Trust 
Abstract:
 In this study, we suggest that disparities between service and
 manufacturing firms' international entry mode choices can be explained by
 differences in their reaction to transaction cost based variables and by
 the influence of risk and trust propensity. We find that: (1) due to the
 investment intensive nature of manufacturing, environmental uncertainties
 and risk propensity influence manufacturers' mode choices; while (2)
 behavioural uncertainties, trust propensity and asset specificity
 influence service providers' entry mode choices because of the
 people-intensive nature of services. Implications for future research are
 discussed. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2003.

Title: Managerial Technologies, Ethics and Managing 
Abstract:
 This paper engages with a key element of Legge's work: the relationship
 between the technical and the moral in the application of managerial
 technologies, and how managers manage these different layers of meaning.
 Taking business planning and performance measurement as an example of
 managerial technologies, these are analysed for the extent to which they
 allow for an engagement with an ethical position, using Legge's (1978)
 characterization of the role of managerial technologies originally
 identified in "Power, Innovation and Problem Solving in Personnel
 Management". The inter-related elements of the technical, the ethical and
 the practical are then used to explore how managers construct the meaning
 of management and their implications for Legge's more recent deontological
 and teleological ethical framework. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2004.

Title: When Does University Research Get Commercialized? Creating Ambidexterity in Research Institutions 
Abstract:
 We examine the tensions that make it difficult for a research-oriented
 university to achieve commercial outcomes. Building on the organizational
 ambidexterity literature, we specify the nature of the tensions (between
 academic and commercially-oriented activities) at both organizational and
 individual levels of analysis, and how these can be resolved. We develop
 hypotheses linking specific aspects of the organization and the individual
 researcher to the likelihood of their research projects generating
 commercial outcomes, and we test them using a novel dataset of 207
 Research Council-funded projects, combining objective data on project
 outcomes with the perceptions of principal investigators. We show that the
 tension between academic and commercial demands is more salient at the
 level of the individual researcher than at the level of the organization.
 Universities show evidence that they are able to manage the tensions
 between academic and commercial demands, through for example their
 creation of 'dual structures'. At the individual level, on the other hand,
 the tensions are more acute, so that the people who deliver commercial
 outcomes tend to be rather different to those who are accustomed to
 producing academic outcomes. Copyright (c) Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2008.

Title: Strategic Practices: An Activity Theory Perspective on Continuity and Change 
Abstract:
 &emsp;This paper draws upon activity theory to analyse an empirical
 investigation of the micro practices of strategy in three UK universities.
 Activity theory provides a framework of four interactive components from
 which strategy emerges; the collective structures of the organization, the
 primary actors, in this research conceptualized as the top management team
 (TMT), the practical activities in which they interact and the strategic
 practices through which interaction is conducted. Using this framework,
 the paper focuses specifically on the formal strategic practices involved
 in direction setting, resource allocation, and monitoring and control.
 These strategic practices are associated with continuity of strategic
 activity in one case study but are involved in the reinterpretation and
 change of strategic activity in the other two cases. We model this finding
 into activity theory-based typologies of the cases that illustrate the way
 that practices either distribute shared interpretations or mediate between
 contested interpretations of strategic activity. The typologies explain
 the relationships between strategic practices and continuity and change of
 strategy as practice. The paper concludes by linking activity theory to
 wider change literatures to illustrate its potential as an integrative
 methodological framework for examining the subjective and emergent
 processes through which strategic activity is constructed. Copyright 2003 Blackwell Publishers Ltd..

Title: The Cognitive Style Index: A Measure of Intuition-Analysis For Organizational Research 
Abstract:
 Almost 1000 adults participated in the development of the Cognitive Style
 Index (CSI), a new measure designed specifically for use with managerial
 and professional groups. the objectives of the study were, first, to
 produce a psychome-trically sound instrument suitable for application in
 large-scale organizational studies, and second, through its development,
 to confirm empirically the generic intuition-analysis dimension of
 cognitive style. Findings suggest that each objective was largely
 fulfilled. At a time when there is a burgeoning interest in intuition as a
 basis for decision making and problem solving in organizations, the CSI
 would appear to be a notable addition to the small collection of measures
 appropriate for survey research. Copyright 1996 Basil Blackwell Ltd.

Title: Breaking the Silence: The Moderating Effects of Self-Monitoring in Predicting Speaking Up in the Workplace 
Abstract:
 Whereas both management scholars and practitioners emphasize the
 importance of employee input for improving workplace practices, research
 suggests that many employees are hesitant to express their opinions or
 voice their views because doing so might lead to retaliation.
 Consequently, they remain silent rather than speak up about workplace
 happenings, actions or ideas of others, needed changes, and other
 job-related issues. Drawing on various literatures, we developed and
 tested a conceptual scheme for examining the influence of self-monitoring
 on the relationships between two individual (locus of control and
 self-esteem) and two contextual (top-management openness and trust in
 supervisor) factors and speaking up. Data from 118 telecommunications
 employees and their coworkers provided supporting evidence. As predicted,
 low self-monitors, in comparison to high self-monitors, spoke up more
 often as internal locus of control, self-esteem, top-management openness,
 and trust in supervisor increased. The theoretical and practical
 implications of our results are discussed. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2003.

Title: An Empirical Test of Cognitive Style and Strategic Decision Outcomes 
Abstract:
 We examine how cognitive style, as measured by the MBTI, affects strategic
 decision outcomes. Executives participated in a simulated strategic
 decision making environment that allowed controlled collection of decision
 outcomes, including manager decisiveness, decision quality, and perceived
 effectiveness. We found that iNtuiting/Thinking managers used their
 intuition to make cognitive leaps based on objective information to craft
 more decisions of higher quality than other managers. In contrast,
 Sensing/Feeling types used time to seek socially acceptable decisions,
 which led to the lowest number of decisions and the lowest perceived
 effectiveness of all. We found no effect on decisiveness or perceived
 effectiveness based on a manager's preference for Perceiving or Judging.
 However, we found that others perceived Extraverted managers as being more
 effective than Introverted managers when, in fact, the Extraverts were no
 more decisive than Introverts. Thus, cognitive style influences actual
 decision outcomes as well as how others perceive one's decision
 performance. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005.

Title: Technological Expansion: the Interaction Between Diversification Strategy and Organizational Capability 
Abstract:
 This study analyses technological expansion by examining the interaction
 between firms' diversification strategy and internal capabilities. We
 argue that when new technologies emerge, firms that were actively pursuing
 diversification do not have equal intention to adopt the technologies. For
 firms that possess internal capabilities similar or relevant to the new
 technologies, their diversification strategy facilitates technological
 expansion, otherwise diversification strategy negatively affects
 technological adoption. This study improves our understanding on
 technological expansion. Existing studies try to identify organizational
 characteristics that facilitate or impede firm entry into new
 technological fields. This research reveals that the same organizational
 characteristic (e.g. diversification strategy) can exhibit different
 effects on technological adoption. It facilitates technological expansion
 if firms' existing capabilities can be applied to new technologies,
 otherwise it impedes new technological adoption. Copyright 1996 Basil Blackwell Ltd.

Title: Environmental Uncertainty and Product-Process Life Cycles: A Multi-level Interpretation of Change Over Time 
Abstract:
 Product-process life cycle models are often used to describe long-term
 change in organizations. Such models generally assume a deterministic
 trajectory of long-run industry evolution and production core
 transformation that lead to standardization over time. Typical
 interpretations of these models do not explain the short and intermediate
 term choices and competitive dynamics that lead to the longer-term
 changes, or explain viable 'off-trajectory' positions and
 post-stabilization complications that can arise. In this paper, we use
 multiple theory streams to augment discussions of product-process life
 cycle models in ways that allow interpretation of the role of uncertainty
 and management decision-making for the typical trajectory of
 standardization as well as off-trajectory and post-standardization phases. Copyright 2003 Blackwell Publishing Ltd..

Title: Narrating the Power of Non-Standard Employment: The Case of the Israeli Public Sector 
Abstract:
 Applying a critical discourse analysis approach, this study shows how the
 argument equating non-standard employment (NSE) with organizational
 efficiency gains dominance over the contesting argument that views NSE as
 reducing organizational efficiency. We interviewed 24 senior-level HR
 managers in the Israeli public sector, where NSE is used extensively, in
 order to shed light on the discursive order and the power struggle between
 these contesting arguments. Findings point to two story-lines that helped
 discredit the argument in which NSE reduces organizational efficiency: (1)
 a statement of loyalty to organizational efficiency, accompanied by a
 gesture of concern for employees in non-standard arrangements; and (2)
 subordinating an implied preference for eliminating NSE to organizational
 constraints. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005.

Title: Reflexivity in Management Research 
Abstract:
 Recently the term reflexivity has entered management discourses about
 research, education and practice. This paper highlights the ambiguity
 which prevails concerning the concept of reflexivity showing how the ways
 in which reflexivity itself is constituted inevitably articulates
 epistemological circularity in that commentators' definitions and
 prescriptions vary according to their tacit metatheoretical commitments.
 Hence the aim of this paper is to explore this paradox by excavating such
 commitments and demonstrating how they constitute particular forms of
 reflexivity - each with distinctive implications for the role of the
 management researcher in terms of aims, processes, and outcomes. Three
 generic forms of reflexivity are proposed: the methodological, the hyper
 or deconstructive, and the epistemic. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2003.

Title: DISCIPLINING THE PROFESSIONAL: THE CASE OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT 
Abstract:
 Despite its rapid growth in recent years, Project Management has received
 very little critical attention, particularly when compared to the more
 'hyped' managerial fashions such as TQM (cf. Wilkinson and Willmott, 1995)
 and BPR (cf. Grey and Mitev, 1995; Grint, 1994). My intention in this
 paper is to critically examine the ongoing construction of Project
 Management as a professional discipline in modern organizations. Drawing
 on an understanding of 'discipline' based in Foucauldian work, I will
 briefly trace the historical construction of Project Management as a form
 of managerial knowledge, outlining the key models and techniques which
 make up contemporary Project Management. Through an empirical study of the
 articulation and reproduction of Project Management within two Financial
 Services institutions, the everyday construction of Project Management as
 an 'objective' and 'abstract' body of knowledge will be described. I then
 contrast this with the embodied and power-laden operation of Project
 Management, with disciplinary effects not only on those employees whose
 work is restructured in line with Project Management principles but
 equally upon self-professed Project Management professionals themselves. Copyright 2002 Blackwell Publishers Ltd..

Title: Unravelling the HRM-Performance Link: Value-Creating and Cost-Increasing Effects of Small Business HRM 
Abstract:
 The majority of empirical studies on the HRM-performance link report a
 positive story. The costs associated with the productivity rise due to
 high performance work practices (HPWP) have been largely neglected. The
 purpose of this study is to develop a conceptual framework that maps both
 the value-enhancing and cost-raising impact of HPWP. In addition, we want
 to pronounce upon their overall effect on financial performance. To test
 our model, we rely on a sample of small businesses. Understanding both
 performance and cost-related effects of the implementation of HPWP is
 particularly valuable for small businesses since they often lack financial
 resources to implement HPWP and benefit less from economies of scale
 compared to their larger counterparts. Study results indicate that
 although greater use of HPWP is associated with increased productivity,
 this effect is offset by increased labour costs. However, we find an
 overall positive effect of HPWP on firm profitability. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2006.

Title: Top Executive Remuneration: A View from Europe 
Abstract:
 We argue that the dominance of principal-agent theory as an approach to
 investigating executive pay has led to an overly narrow focus which may be
 unhelpful when considering cross-country differences and probably also
 hinders within-country analysis. The paper discusses the interlinked
 nature of three available theoretical lenses, namely principal-agent,
 executive power, and stewardship/stakeholder theories. It argues that
 institutional theory can provide a useful overarching framework within
 which appropriate variants of these approaches can be deployed to better
 comprehend developments in executive pay. We illustrate our approach with
 a discussion of executive pay in the UK and in Germany. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005.

Title: Too Busy To Serve? An Examination of the Influence of Overboarded Directors 
Abstract:
 Overboarded directors (i.e., those serving on too many boards) have come
 under recent attack. The accusation is that such directors are 'stretched'
 by several directorships and therefore cannot fulfil their governance
 responsibility. This study investigates the impact of overboarded
 directors upon key strategic decisions such as corporate acquisitions.
 Based on our examination of acquisition outcomes, we found that such
 directors are important sources of knowledge and enhance acquisition
 performance. Moreover, they represent an important complement to inside
 and non-overboarded outside directors. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2004.

Title: Knowledge Content and Worker Participation in Environmental Management at NUMMI 
Abstract:
 This paper looks at, within the context of lean production, "how" and "in
 what ways" employees participate in environmental improvements. The paper
 uses data from an automobile plant well known for its participative work
 structures, New United Motor Manufacturing (NUMMI), to look more closely
 at the dynamics of worker participation in environmental management (i.e.
 management of pollution and waste). Findings show that while workers
 possess important contextual knowledge, the importance of process,
 intra-organizational and external knowledge make the role of specialist
 staff (both internal and external to the environmental function)
 critically important for environmental improvements. Additionally,
 environmental improvements often required a combination of more than one
 knowledge type. The paper discusses how the culture and management
 structure at NUMMI and other lean plants encourage this combination.
 Implications for environmental management, lean production, and future
 research on worker participation are discussed. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2003.

Title: Exploring Organizationally Directed Citizenship Behaviour: Reciprocity or 'It's my Job'? 
Abstract:
 This study sets out to examine two explanations for why employees engage
 in organizational citizenship behaviour (OCB). The first explanation views
 OCB as a form of reciprocation where employees engage in OCB to
 reciprocate fair or good treatment from the organization. The second view
 is that employees engage in OCB because they define those behaviours as
 part of their job. The research methodology consisted of survey data from
 387 hospital employees on their perceptions of procedural and
 interactional justice, mutual commitment, job breadth and OCB. The results
 suggest that procedural and interactional justice are positively
 associated with mutual commitment that in turn, is related directly to OCB
 and indirectly through expanding the boundaries of an individual's job.
 These findings suggest that together the reciprocation thesis and 'it's my
 job' argument complement each other and provide a more complete foundation
 for our understanding of OCB. The difference between the two perspectives
 lies in the process by which individuals respond; that is, role
 enlargement and role maintenance. Implications and directions for future
 research are discussed. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2004.

Title: Team Learning from Mistakes: The Contribution of Cooperative Goals and Problem-Solving 
Abstract:
 Although mistakes may have considerable potential for learning, previous
 research has emphasized that organizational members are often defensive
 when their mistakes are pointed out and will even continue with their
 present course of action despite growing costs. Recent research has shown
 that team-level variables, such as psychological safety and shared mental
 model, can help overcome barriers to learning from mistakes. Structural
 equation analyses on teams working in a sample of organizations in
 Shanghai, China, suggested that teams were able to learn from their
 mistakes to the extent that they took a problem solving orientation. This
 orientation in turn was based on developing cooperative but not
 competitive goals within the team. Although competitive and independent
 goals induce blaming, blaming itself was not significantly related to
 learning. Blaming, especially when conducted openly, may hold individual
 team members accountable as well as provoke defensiveness. Findings
 empirically link the theory of cooperation and competition with the
 organizational learning literature. Results suggest that cooperative goals
 and problem solving promote learning from mistakes. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2004.
