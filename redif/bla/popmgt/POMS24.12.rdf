Title: Managing Logistics in Regional Banknote Supply Chain Under Security Concerns

Abstract:
  type="main" xml:id="poms12378-abs-0001"> <p>We study the logistics
 problem faced by Regional Branches (RBs) of a central bank in managing the
 currency supply under security concerns. While making banknote supply
 decisions to Sub-Branches (SBs), the management of RB must achieve two
 goals simultaneously: (i) guarantee that each SB has sufficient
 inventories of all denominations of banknotes to satisfy the demands from
 all commercial banks within its service area, and (ii) control the annual
 spending on this banknote supply operation. Due to security concerns, the
 following methods are implemented in the process of transporting
 banknotes: (i) the capacity of a cash truck is limited by the total face
 value (instead of the physical space) of banknotes, and (ii) empty decoy
 trucks are deployed along with the trucks filled with banknotes. After
 deriving a polynomial-time strategy to guarantee an optimal solution for
 the special Bin-Packing Problem faced in this study, we provide an exact
 formulation for the RB's supply planning problem. We also propose several
 polynomial-time algorithms for deriving either optimal or near-optimal
 solutions for the problem under different settings. Using the weekly
 demand data obtained from the central bank, we verify the performance of
 our algorithms, and analyze the impacts of changes in these features and
 in the fleet capacity on the total cost incurred by an RB under various
 scenarios.

Title: Optimal Descending Mechanisms for Constrained Procurement

Abstract:
  type="main" xml:id="poms12385-abs-0001"> <p>Descending mechanisms for
 procurement (or, ascending mechanisms for selling) have been
 well-recognized for their simplicity from the viewpoint of bidders—they
 require less bidder sophistication as compared to sealed-bid mechanisms.
 In this study, we consider procurement under each of two types of
 constraints: (1) Individual/Group Capacities: limitations on the amounts
 that can be sourced from individual and/or subsets of suppliers, and (2)
 Business Rules: lower and upper bounds on the number of suppliers to
 source from, and on the amount that can be sourced from any single
 supplier. We analyze two procurement problems, one that incorporates
 individual/group capacities and another that incorporates business rules.
 In each problem, we consider a buyer who wants to procure a fixed quantity
 of a product from a set of suppliers, where each supplier is endowed with
 a privately known constant marginal cost. The buyer's objective is to
 minimize her total expected procurement cost. For both problems, we
 present descending auction mechanisms that are optimal mechanisms. We then
 show that these two problems belong to a larger class of mechanism design
 problems with constraints specified by polymatroids, for which we prove
 that optimal mechanisms can be implemented as descending mechanisms.

Title: Inspecting a Vital Component Needed upon Emergency

Abstract:
  type="main" xml:id="poms12386-abs-0001"> <p>We consider a stochastically
 failing component that will be needed at a random future time when an
 emergency occurs. If the component is not operational at that time, the
 system incurs a large penalty, which we want to avoid through inspections
 and replacements. We propose a model and solution algorithm for finding an
 inspection policy that minimizes the infinite horizon discounted expected
 penalty, replacement, and inspection costs. We also discuss structural
 properties of the solution, as well as insights based on numerical
 results.

Title: Incentive Contracts for Managing a Project with Uncertain Completion Time 
Author-Name: Christopher S. Tang  
Author-Name: Kairen Zhang  
Author-Name: Sean X. Zhou  
Abstract:
  type="main" xml:id="poms12387-abs-0001"> <p>We examine two time-related
 incentive project management contracts (C1 and C2 contracts) when the
 manager conducts a reverse auction. Under the C1 contract, the contractor
 with the lowest bid price wins; however, the manager imposes a linear and
 symmetric incentive/disincentive for early/late completion according to a
 pre-specified due date. Under the C2 contract, the winning contractor has
 the lowest composite score that is based on the quoted price and the
 quoted due date; however, in addition to the linear and symmetric
 penalty/incentive, the contractor is subject to an additional penalty for
 late completion. While the C2 contract is more sophisticated than the C1
 contract (in terms of the number of decisions that each party has to
 make), our analysis reveals that, unless the project is truly urgent, the
 more complicated C2 contract adds no value to the manager— the simple C1
 contract will suffice.

Title: The Impact of Limited Supply on a Firm's Bundling Strategy 
Author-Name: Qingning Cao  
Author-Name: Kathryn E. Stecke  
Author-Name: Jun Zhang  
Abstract:
  type="main" xml:id="poms12388-abs-0001"> <p>A firm's two-product bundling
 decision is examined when the supply of one product is limited and
 consumer valuations are normally distSteckeributed. The firm can choose to
 sell products separately and/or through a bundle. We find that the impact
 of limited supply on a firm's bundling decision depends on the correlation
 between the consumer valuations of the two products as well as the
 symmetry level of the two products in terms of their attractiveness (how
 much they are valued by consumers). When the valuation correlation is high
 and the symmetry level of the two products is low, limited supply can
 drive bundling. When the valuation correlation is low or the symmetry
 level is high, limited supply can drive no bundling. When the
 attractiveness of both products are low or the valuation correlation is
 very high, limited supply has no impact on a firm's bundling decision: The
 firm should not bundle for all supply levels.<p>This study offers a new
 driver for product bundling: the limited supply of a product. The existing
 bundling literature suggests that a firm should bundle symmetric products
 that have a low consumer valuation correlation, when bundling is driven by
 consumer valuation heterogeneity reduction. In contrast, when bundling is
 driven by limited supply, a firm should bundle asymmetric products with a
 high consumer valuation correlation. The benefit of supply-driven bundling
 depends on the severity of supply limitation. When supply limitation is
 moderate, bundling creates value by expanding the market of the less
 attractive product. When supply limitation is severe, bundling enables a
 firm to extract a higher margin from the less attractive product.</p>

Title: Elective Patient Admission and Scheduling under Multiple Resource Constraints 
Author-Name: Christiane Barz  
Author-Name: Kumar Rajaram  
Abstract:
  type="main" xml:id="poms12395-abs-0001"> <p>We consider a patient
 admission problem to a hospital with multiple resource constraints (e.g.,
 OR and beds) and a stochastic evolution of patient care requirements
 across multiple resources. There is a small but significant proportion of
 emergency patients who arrive randomly and have to be accepted at the
 hospital. However, the hospital needs to decide whether to accept,
 postpone, or even reject the admission from a random stream of
 non-emergency elective patients. We formulate the control process as a
 Markov decision process to maximize expected contribution net of
 overbooking costs, develop bounds using approximate dynamic programming,
 and use them to construct heuristics. We test our methods on data from the
 Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center and find that our intuitive
 newsvendor-based heuristic performs well across all scenarios.

Title: Impulse Balance and Multiple-Period Feedback in the Newsvendor Game 
Author-Name: Axel Ockenfels  
Author-Name: Reinhard Selten  
Abstract:
  type="main" xml:id="poms12399-abs-0001"> <p>Human subjects in the
 newsvendor game place suboptimal orders: orders are typically between the
 expected profit-maximizing quantity and mean demand (“pull-to-center
 bias”). In previous work, we have shown that impulse balance equilibrium
 (IBE), which is based on a simple ex post rationality principle along with
 an equilibrium condition, can predict ordering decisions in the
 laboratory. In this study, we extend IBE to standing orders and
 multiple-period feedback and show that it predicts—in line with previous
 findings—that constraining newsvendors to make a standing order for a
 sequence of periods moves the average of submitted orders toward the
 optimum.

Title: How Costs and Heterogeneous Consumer Price Sensitivity Interact with Add-On Pricing 
Author-Name: Xianjun Geng  
Author-Name: Jeffrey D. Shulman  
Abstract:
  type="main" xml:id="poms12400-abs-0001"> <p>Firms often cite cost savings
 as a reason why they charge separately for add-ons. Firms also often face
 situations where consumers' price sensitivity is correlated with their
 valuation of add-ons. While cost savings may directly translate into
 profit gains in some scenarios, this study examines the strategic
 implications of add-on pricing and is the first to suggest that cost
 savings from add-on pricing may in fact result in profit loss for firms
 when consumers are heterogeneous in price sensitivity. This is because
 add-on pricing can trigger a revenue loss that exceeds any cost savings,
 thus leading to a negative net profit change for competing firms. Even if
 firms have the capability to pre-commit to not adopting add-on pricing, we
 show that competing firms can be locked in a prisoner's dilemma where all
 choose to adopt add-on pricing and lose profits (as compared to none
 adopting add-on pricing). We further show the possibility that the greater
 the cost of providing the add-on (and the greater the cost savings
 generated from add-on pricing), the worse this profit loss gets.

Title: Strategic Consumer Cooperation in a Name-Your-Own-Price Channel 
Author-Name: Tatsiana Levina  
Author-Name: Yuri Levin  
Author-Name: Jeff McGill  
Author-Name: Mikhail Nediak  
Abstract:
  type="main" xml:id="poms12412-abs-0001"> <p>Supplier reluctance to openly
 advertise highly discounted products on the Internet has stimulated
 development of “opaque” name-Your-Own-Price sales channels. Unfortunately
 (for suppliers), there is significant potential for online consumers to
 exploit these channels through collaboration in social networks. In this
 paper, we study three possible forms of consumer collaboration: exchange
 of bid result information, coordinated bidding, and coordinated bidding
 with risk pooling. We propose an egalitarian total utility maximizing
 mechanism for coordination and risk pooling in a bidding club and describe
 characteristics of consumers for whom participation in the club makes
 sense. We show that, in the absence of risk pooling, a plausible bidding
 club strategy using just information exchange gives almost the same
 benefits to consumers as coordinated bidding. In contrast, coordinated
 bidding with risk pooling can lead to significantly increased benefits for
 consumers. The benefits of risk pooling are highest for consumers with a
 low tolerance to risk. We also demonstrate that suppliers that actively
 adjust for such strategic consumer behavior can reduce the impact on their
 businesses and, under some circumstances, even increase revenues.

Title: Strategic Capacity Management When Customers Have Boundedly Rational Expectations 
Author-Name: Tingliang Huang  
Author-Name: Qian Liu  
Abstract:
  type="main" xml:id="poms12420-abs-0001"> <p>In retailing industries, such
 as apparel, sporting goods, customer electronics, and appliances, many
 firms deploy sophisticated modeling and optimization software to conduct
 dynamic pricing in response to uncertain and fluctuating market
 conditions. However, the possibility of markdown pricing creates an
 incentive for customers to strategize over the timing of their purchases.
 How should a retailing firm optimally account for customer behavior when
 making its pricing and stocking/capacity decisions? For example, is it
 optimal for a firm to create rationing risk by deliberately under stocking
 products? In this study, we develop a stylized modeling framework to
 answer these questions. In our model, customers strategize over the timing
 of their purchases. However, customers have boundedly rational
 expectations in the sense of anecdotal reasoning about the firm's fill
 rate, i.e., they have to rely on anecdotes, past experiences, or
 word-of-mouth to infer the firm's fill rate. In our modeling framework, we
 distinguish two settings: (i) capacity commitment, where the firm commits
 to its capacity level in the long run, or (ii) the firm dynamically
 changes it in each season. For both settings, within the simplest form of
 anecdotal reasoning, we prove that strategic capacity rationing is not
 optimal independent of customer risk preferences. Then, using a general
 form of anecdotal reasoning, we provide sufficient conditions for capacity
 rationing to be optimal for both settings, respectively. We show that the
 result of strategic capacity rationing being suboptimal is fairly robust
 to different valuation distributions and utility functions, heterogeneous
 sample size, and price optimization.
