Title: Product Launches and Buying Frenzies: A Dynamic Perspective 
Author-Name: Pascal Courty  
Author-Name: Javad Nasiry  
Abstract:
  type="main" xml:id="poms12394-abs-0001"> <p>Buying frenzies caused by a
 firm's intentional undersupplying of a new product are frequently evident
 in several industries including electronics (cell phones, video games),
 luxury automobiles, and fashion goods. We develop a dynamic model of
 buying frenzies that incorporates the firm's manufacturing and sale of a
 product over time and characterizes the conditions under which inducing
 such frenzies is an optimal strategy. We find that buying frenzies occur
 when customers are sufficiently uncertain about their valuations of the
 product and when they discount the future sufficiently but not
 excessively. We propose measures of “customer desperation” and of the
 extent of scarcity to measure the depth and breadth of buying frenzies,
 respectively. We also demonstrate that such frenzies can have a
 significantly positive effect on firm profits and partially recover the
 loss due to non-commitment to future prices. This study provides
 managerial insights on how firms can influence market response to a new
 product through production, pricing, and inventory decisions to induce
 profitable frenzies.

Title: Optimal Choice for Appointment Scheduling Window under Patient No-Show Behavior 
Author-Name: Nan Liu  
Abstract:
  type="main" xml:id="poms12401-abs-0001"> <p>Observing that patients with
 longer appointment delays tend to have higher no-show rates, many
 providers place a limit on how far into the future that an appointment can
 be scheduled. This article studies how the choice of appointment
 scheduling window affects a provider's operational efficiency. We use a
 single server queue to model the registered appointments in a provider's
 work schedule, and the capacity of the queue serves as a proxy of the size
 of the appointment window. The provider chooses a common appointment
 window for all patients to maximize her long-run average net reward, which
 depends on the rewards collected from patients served and the “penalty”
 paid for those who cannot be scheduled. Using a stylized M/M/1/K queueing
 model, we provide an analytical characterization for the optimal
 appointment queue capacity K, and study how it should be adjusted in
 response to changes in other model parameters. In particular, we find that
 simply increasing appointment window could be counterproductive when
 patients become more likely to show up. Patient sensitivity to incremental
 delays, rather than the magnitudes of no-show probabilities, plays a more
 important role in determining the optimal appointment window. Via
 extensive numerical experiments, we confirm that our analytical results
 obtained under the M/M/1/K model continue to hold in more realistic
 settings. Our numerical study also reveals substantial efficiency gains
 resulted from adopting an optimal appointment scheduling window when the
 provider has no other operational levers available to deal with patient
 no-shows. However, when the provider can adjust panel size and overbooking
 level, limiting the appointment window serves more as a substitute
 strategy, rather than a complement.

Title: Product Assortment and Price Competition under Multinomial Logit Demand 
Author-Name: Omar Besbes  
Author-Name: Denis Sauré  
Abstract:
  type="main" xml:id="poms12402-abs-0001"> <p>The role of assortment
 planning and pricing in shaping sales and profits of retailers is well
 documented and studied in monopolistic settings. However, such a role
 remains relatively unexplored in competitive environments. In this study,
 we study equilibrium behavior of competing retailers in two settings: (i)
 when prices are exogenously fixed, and retailers compete in assortments
 only; and (ii) when retailers compete jointly in assortment and prices.
 For this, we model consumer choice using a multinomial Logit, and assume
 that each retailer selects products from a predefined set, and faces a
 display constraint. We show that when the sets of products available to
 retailers do not overlap, there always exists one equilibrium that
 Pareto-dominates all others, and that such an outcome can be reached
 through an iterative process of best responses. A direct corollary of our
 results is that competition leads a firm to offer a broader set of
 products compared to when it is operating as a monopolist, and to broader
 offerings in the market compared to a centralized planner. When some
 products are available to all retailers, that is, assortments might
 overlap, we show that display constraints drive equilibrium existence
 properties.

Title: Traffic-Based Labor Planning in Retail Stores 
Author-Name: Howard Hao-Chun Chuang

Author-Name: Olga Perdikaki  
Abstract:
  type="main" xml:id="poms12403-abs-0001"> <p>Staffing decisions are
 crucial for retailers since staffing levels affect store performance and
 labor-related expenses constitute one of the largest components of
 retailers’ operating costs. With the goal of improving staffing decisions
 and store performance, we develop a labor-planning framework using
 proprietary data from an apparel retail chain. First, we propose a sales
 response function based on labor adequacy (the labor to traffic ratio)
 that exhibits variable elasticity of substitution between traffic and
 labor. When compared to a frequently used function with constant
 elasticity of substitution, our proposed function exploits information
 content from data more effectively and better predicts sales under extreme
 labor/traffic conditions. We use the validated sales response function to
 develop a data-driven staffing heuristic that incorporates the prediction
 loss function and uses past traffic to predict optimal labor. In
 counterfactual experimentation, we show that profits achieved by our
 heuristic are within 0.5% of the optimal (attainable if perfect traffic
 information was available) under stable traffic conditions, and within
 2.5% of the optimal under extreme traffic variability. We conclude by
 discussing implications of our findings for researchers and practitioners.

Title: Technical Note – Pricing Below Cost Under Exchange-Rate Risk 
Author-Name: John Park  
Author-Name: Burak Kazaz  
Author-Name: Scott Webster  
Abstract:
  type="main" xml:id="poms12405-abs-0001"> <p>Pricing below cost is often
 classified as “dumping” in international trade and as “predatory pricing”
 in local markets. It is legally prohibited from practice because of
 earlier findings that it leads to predatory behavior by either eliminating
 competition or stealing market share. This study shows that a stochastic
 exchange rate can create incentives for a profit-minded monopoly firm to
 set price below marginal cost. Our result departs from earlier findings
 because the optimal pricing decision is based on a rational behavior that
 does not exhibit any malicious intent against the competition to be
 considered as violating anti-trust laws. The finding is a robust result,
 because our analysis demonstrates that this behavior occurs under various
 settings such as when the firm (i) is risk-averse, (ii) can postpone
 prices until after exchange rates are realized, (iii) is capable of
 manufacturing in multiple countries, and (iv) operates under demand
 uncertainty in addition to the random exchange rate.

Title: Safety Stock, Excess Capacity or Diversification: Trade-Offs under Supply and Demand Uncertainty 
Author-Name: Aadhaar Chaturvedi  
Author-Name: Victor Martínez-de-Albéniz  
Abstract:
  type="main" xml:id="poms12406-abs-0001"> <p>Firms mitigate uncertainty in
 demand and supply by carrying safety stock, planning for excess capacity
 and diversifying supply sources. In this study, we provide a framework to
 jointly optimize these three levers in a periodic review infinite horizon
 setting, and in particular we examine how one can reduce inventory and
 capacity investments through proper diversification strategies. Observing
 that a modified base-stock inventory policy is optimal, we find that the
 capacity-diversification problem is well behaved and characterize the
 optimal mix of safety stock, excess capacity and extra number of supply
 sources. We find that higher supply uncertainty results in higher safety
 stock, more excess capacity, and higher diversification. But safety stock
 and diversification are non-monotonic in demand uncertainty. Our results
 can be extended to situations in which suppliers are heterogeneous, and
 can be used to develop effective heuristics.

Title: Optimal Coordination in Distributed Software Development 
Author-Name: Hao Xia  
Author-Name: Milind Dawande  
Author-Name: Vijay Mookerjee  
Abstract:
  type="main" xml:id="poms12408-abs-0001"> <p>The construction of a
 software system requires not only individual coding effort from team
 members to realize the various functionalities, but also adequate team
 coordination to integrate the developed code into a consistent, efficient,
 and bug-free system. On the one hand, continuous coding without adequate
 coordination can cause serious system inconsistencies and faults that may
 subsequently require significant corrective effort. On the other hand,
 frequent integrations can be disruptive to the team and delay development
 progress. This tradeoff motivates the need for a good coordination policy.
 Both the complexity and the importance of coordination is accentuated in
 distributed software development (DSD), where a software project is
 developed by multiple, geographically-distributed sub-teams. The need for
 coordination in DSD exists both within one sub-team and across different
 sub-teams. The latter type of coordination involves communication across
 spatial boundaries (different locations) and possibly temporal boundaries
 (different time zones), and is a major challenge that DSD faces. In this
 study, we model both inter- and intra-sub-team coordination in DSD based
 on the characteristics of the systems being developed by the sub-teams,
 the deadline for completion, and the nature of division adopted by the
 sub-teams with respect to development and integration activities. Our
 analysis of optimal coordination policies in DSD shows that integration
 activities by one sub-team not only benefit that sub-team (as is the case
 in co-located development) but can also help the other sub-teams by
 providing greater visibility, thereby resulting in a higher integration
 frequency relative to co-located development. Analytical results are
 presented to demonstrate how the characteristics of the projects and the
 sub-teams, and the efficiency of communication across the sub-teams,
 affect coordination and productivity. We also investigate the pros and
 cons of using specialized integration sub-teams and find that their
 advantage decreases as the project schedule becomes tighter. Decentralized
 decisions and asymmetric subsystems are also discussed.

Title: Bundling and Scheduling Service Packages with Customer Behavior: Model and Heuristic 
Author-Name: Michael J. Dixon  
Author-Name: Gary M. Thompson  
Abstract:
  type="main" xml:id="poms12409-abs-0001"> <p>Past researchers have found
 evidence that customers consider the sequence of event utility when
 evaluating past and future service experiences. Specifically, the evidence
 confirms that the placement of a peak event, the utility of the last
 event, and the slope of event utility over time all affect customer
 behavior and perception. We formulate an optimization problem with a focus
 on optimizing schedule sequence characteristics in order to maximize
 customer experiences. We discuss possible contexts in which this type of
 scheduling might be considered and, as an example, present a particularly
 complex model of a world-renowned performing arts venue. We solve the
 problem with a simulated annealing algorithm and further discuss the
 complexity and opportunities associated with this type of scheduling
 effort.

Title: Problem Formulation and Solution Mechanisms: A Behavioral Study of Humanitarian Transportation Planning 
Author-Name: Erica Gralla  
Author-Name: Jarrod Goentzel  
Author-Name: Charles Fine  
Abstract:
  type="main" xml:id="poms12496-abs-0001"> <p>When dealing with urgent,
 ill-defined problems, such as rapidly evolving emergency situations,
 operations managers have little time for problem formulation or solution.
 While the mechanisms by which humans formulate and solve problems have
 been described, mechanisms for rapid, concurrent formulating and solving
 are not well understood. This study investigates these mechanisms through
 a field study of transportation planning in a humanitarian response
 setting. The findings show that the problem is solved through greedy
 search and formulated through sensemaking, in which search enables updates
 to an evolving problem formulation, and the formulation directs and limits
 the search process. This study explores the implications of these findings
 for the development of better problem formulation processes and
 problem-solving strategies for urgent and ill-defined operations
 management problems.

Title: Managing Inventory with Cash Register Information: Sales Recorded but Not Demands 
Author-Name: Alain Bensoussan  
Author-Name: Metin Çakanyildirim  
Author-Name: Meng Li  
Author-Name: Suresh P. Sethi  
Abstract:
  type="main" xml:id="poms12511-abs-0001"> <p>Inventory inaccuracy is
 common in many businesses. While retailers employ cash registers to enter
 incoming orders and outgoing sales, inaccuracy arises because they do not
 record invisible demand such as spoilage, damage, pilferage, or returns.
 This setting results in incomplete inventory and demand information. An
 important inventory control problem therefore is to maximize the total
 expected discounted profit under this setting. Allowing for dependence
 between demand and invisible demand, we obtain the associated dynamic
 programming equation with an infinite-dimensional state space, and reduce
 it to a simpler form by employing the concept of unnormalized probability.
 We develop an analytical upper bound on the optimal profit as well as an
 iterative algorithm for an approximate solution of the problem. We compare
 profits of the iterative solution and the myopic solution, and then to the
 upper bound. We see that the iterative solution performs better than the
 myopic solution, and significantly so in many cases. Furthermore, it gives
 a profit not far from the upper bound, and is therefore close to optimal.
 Using our results, we also discuss meeting inventory service levels.
