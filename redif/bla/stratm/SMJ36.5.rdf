Title: How anticipated employee mobility affects acquisition likelihood: Evidence from a natural experiment

Abstract:
  type="main" xml:id="smj2237-abs-0001"> <p
 xml:id="smj2237-para-0001"><fi>This study draws on strategic factor market
 theory and argues that acquirers' decisions regarding whether to bid for a
 firm reflect their expectations about employee departure from the firm
 post-acquisition, suggesting a negative relationship between the
 anticipated employee departure from a firm and the likelihood of the firm
 becoming an acquisition target. Using a natural experiment and a
 difference-in-differences approach, we find causal evidence that
 constraints on employee mobility raise the likelihood of a firm becoming
 an acquisition target. The causal effect is stronger when a firm employs
 more knowledge workers in its workforce and when it faces greater in-state
 competition; by contrast, the effect is weaker when a firm is protected by
 a stronger intellectual property regime that mitigates the consequences of
 employee mobility</fi>. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Title: More stars stay, but the brightest ones still leave: Job hopping in the shadow of patent enforcement 
Author-Name: Martin Ganco

Abstract:
  type="main" xml:id="smj2239-abs-0001"> <p
 xml:id="smj2239-para-0001"><fi>Competitive advantage often rests on the
 skills and expertise of individuals who may leave for rival organizations.
 Although institutional factors like non-compete regimes shape
 intra-industry mobility patterns, far less is known about firm-specific
 reputations built through patent enforcement. This study formally models
 and empirically tests how a firm's prior litigiousness over patents (i.e.,
 its reputation for IP toughness) influences employee mobility. Based on
 inventor data from the U.S. semiconductor industry, we find that
 litigiousness not only diminishes the proclivity of inventive workers to
 “job hop” to others in the industry, it also shifts the distribution of
 talent released to the market. The study contributes new insights linking
 firm-level reputations as tough legal enforcers to the “stay versus exit”
 calculus of knowledge workers</fi>. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley & Sons,

Title: Lighting the way or stealing the shine? An examination of the duality in star scientists' effects on firm innovative performance

Abstract:
  type="main" xml:id="smj2240-abs-0001"> <p
 xml:id="smj2240-para-0001"><fi>Do star employees enhance or constrain the
 innovative performance of an organization? Using data from 456
 biotechnology firms between 1973 and 2003, we highlight the duality of the
 effects that stars have on firm performance. We show that while stars
 positively affect firms' productivity, their presence constrains the
 emergence of other innovative leaders in an organization. We find that
 firm productivity and innovative leadership among non-stars in a firm are
 greatest when a star has broad expertise and collaborates frequently. We
 offer cross-disciplinary insights into the role of human capital as a
 source of competitive advantage, suggesting that the value of human
 capital in a firm is contingent on the mutual dependence inherent in
 high-status employees' relationships with other individuals in a
 firm</fi>. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Title: Real options in divestment alternatives 
Author-Name: Naga Lakshmi Damaraju  
Author-Name: Jay B. Barney  
Author-Name: Anil K. Makhija  
Abstract:
  type="main" xml:id="smj2243-abs-0001"> <p
 xml:id="smj2243-para-0001"><fi>This paper examines the implications of
 real options theory for both the decision to divest a business unit and
 the mode of divestment. It is shown that the decision to divest a business
 unit and the decision to engage in staged modes of divestment are both
 sensitive to uncertainty, consistent with a real options logic. However,
 in the face of uncertainty, the results suggest that staged forms of
 governance create real options that are of lesser value as compared to
 simply not divesting a business unit and also as compared to completely
 divesting a business unit. Thus, this study shows that firms have real
 options of varied value to choose from in the context of divestments</fi>.

 xml:id="smj2244-para-0001"><fi>Mergers and acquisitions (M&A) and organic
 growth are two common strategies to achieve horizontal growth. In this
 study, we disentangle two distinct sources of firm performance
 corresponding to different theoretical perspectives on firm size: firms'
 bargaining power with respect to suppliers and customers, and operating
 efficiency arising from scale economies. We conceptually argue and
 empirically show that relatively, M&A enhance bargaining power in the
 short term while organic growth enhances operating efficiency over the
 long term. In order to disaggregate these effects, we use accounting
 rather than financial or managerial data and test our predictions in the
 global retail industry over a 20-year period. We examine implications of
 these results for sustainability of size-based competitive
 advantages</fi>. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Title: Reconceptualizing competitive dynamics: A multidimensional framework

Abstract:
  type="main" xml:id="smj2245-abs-0001"> <p
 xml:id="smj2245-para-0001"><fi>Competitive dynamics research, despite
 progress, lacks a conceptual framework that can extend the field's reach
 to address today's environment. Increasing stakeholder power and
 globalization are but two of the organizational and economic forces
 compelling a broader conceptualization of competition. Our framework
 expands competitive dynamics along five dimensions—aims of competition,
 mode of competing, roster of actors, action toolkit, and time horizon of
 interaction—that prove useful for contrasting the rivalrous and
 competitive-cooperative modes and a new approach we call relational
 competition. We draw conjectures about the moderators, such as industry
 and culture, that determine the appropriateness of these forms of
 interaction, and conclude by relating our method to three discrete
 perspectives: the configurational, transaction cost, and stakeholder
 views</fi>. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Title: Looking good by doing good: The antecedents and consequences of stakeholder attention to corporate disaster relief

Abstract:
  type="main" xml:id="smj2246-abs-0001"> <p
 xml:id="smj2246-para-0001"><fi>Stakeholder theory suggests a relationship
 between corporate social responsibility (CSR) and corporate financial
 performance (CFP) because certain stakeholders reward certain types of
 CSR. This argument assumes that stakeholders attend to firms' CSR
 activities—an assumption that has yet to be examined. We fill this gap by
 extending stakeholder theory to the context of stakeholder attention to
 firm CSR and exploring the antecedents and consequences of stakeholder
 attention to corporate disaster relief CSR. We test the resulting
 hypotheses on a sample of public companies that engaged in natural
 disaster relief efforts, finding that stakeholder attention partially
 mediated the relationship between disaster relief and CFP and that
 stakeholder attention to corporate disaster relief was driven by the
 legitimacy, urgency, and enactment of disaster relief CSR
 initiatives.</fi> Copyright © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Title: Productivity enhancement at home via cross-border acquisitions: The roles of learning and contemporaneous domestic investments 
Author-Name: Olivier Bertrand  
Author-Name: Laurence Capron  
Abstract:
  type="main" xml:id="smj2256-abs-0001"> <p
 xml:id="smj2256-para-0001"><fi>We examine whether ex post domestic
 productivity gains accrue to firms making cross-border acquisitions. We
 argue that cross-border acquisitions can enhance the acquirers'
 productivity at home, and we posit that these domestic productivity gains
 will be greater when there are learning opportunities in the target's host
 country and when contemporaneous domestic productivity-enhancing
 investments are made by the acquirer in conjunction with the acquisition.
 These predictions are supported by data drawn from a sample of French
 acquiring and nonacquiring firms. Our results indicate that cross-border
 acquisitions and investing in productivity at home are complementary: each
 makes the other more beneficial to firm productivity</fi>. Copyright ©
