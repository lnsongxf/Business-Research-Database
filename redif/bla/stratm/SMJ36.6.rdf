Title: From home country to home base: A dynamic approach to the liability of foreignness 
Author-Name: Nan Zhou  
Author-Name: Mauro F. Guillén  
Abstract:
  type="main" xml:id="smj2242-abs-0001"> <p xml:id="smj2242-para-0001">We
 argue that the influence of the home country wanes as the firm increases
 its geographic reach. We introduce the concept of the “home base” to
 capture the effect of the set of countries in which the firm operates. We
 expect the dynamic liability of foreignness defined relative to the home
 base to be a better predictor than the static liability of foreignness
 defined relative to the home country. We also expect the diversity of
 foreign experience to increase foreign market entry. We find support for
 these hypotheses with data on Chinese listed firms investing abroad
 between 1991 and 2007. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Title: Managerial cognitive capabilities and the microfoundations of dynamic capabilities 
Author-Name: Constance E. Helfat  
Author-Name: Margaret A. Peteraf  
Abstract:
  type="main" xml:id="smj2247-abs-0001"> <p xml:id="smj2247-para-0001">The
 microfoundations of dynamic capabilities have assumed greater importance
 in the search for factors that facilitate strategic change. Here, we focus
 on microfoundations at the level of the individual manager. We introduce
 the concept of “managerial cognitive capability,” which highlights the
 fact that capabilities involve the capacity to perform not only physical
 but also mental activities. We identify specific types of cognitive
 capabilities that are likely to underpin dynamic managerial capabilities
 for sensing, seizing, and reconfiguring, and explain their potential
 impact on strategic change of organizations. In addition, we discuss how
 heterogeneity of these cognitive capabilities may produce heterogeneity of
 dynamic managerial capabilities among top executives, which may contribute
 to differential performance of organizations under conditions of change.
 Finally, we propose possible directions for future research. Copyright ©

Title: The effects of corporate reputation perceptions of the general public on shareholder value 
Author-Name: Sascha Raithel  
Author-Name: Manfred Schwaiger  
Abstract:
  type="main" xml:id="smj2248-abs-0001"> <p
 xml:id="smj2248-para-0001">Superior corporate reputations can have
 strategic value for firms. Of the “multiple reputations” associated with
 each firm, we focus on the perceptions of the general public. The public
 represents the most widely defined stakeholder group but has attracted the
 least amount of research interest to date. Drawing on data for German
 firms, this study demonstrates that superior reputation perceptions issued
 by the general public increase shareholder value, as measured by future
 stock returns. This study provides a more nuanced understanding for this
 novel finding. Applying a conceptualization of reputation that balances
 both its affective and cognitive components, we find that reputation
 perceptions that are driven by nonfinancial aspects are more value
 relevant in the future than reputation perceptions that are driven by
 previous financial performance. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Title: Confidence in learning: Inter- and intraorganizational learning in foreign market entry decisions 
Author-Name: Jiatao Li  
Author-Name: Cuili Qian  
Author-Name: Fiona K. Yao  
Abstract:
  type="main" xml:id="smj2250-abs-0001"> <p xml:id="smj2250-para-0001">From
 an organizational learning perspective, we argue that the information
 signaled by the distribution attributes of foreign investors already
 operating in a location will influence the entry decisions of later
 arrivals by affecting their level of confidence in imitating. In the
 context of foreign investment decisions, the proportion of experienced
 firms in a location was shown to first increase a follower firm's
 confidence about imitating them, but then to decrease it, due to
 anticipated competition. The impact of learning from target organizations
 also varies with the experience of the learning organization. Data on the
 location choices of 7,478 manufacturing ventures in China by U.S. firms
 supported the hypotheses. The results provide a more integrated and
 nuanced understanding of learning in foreign direct investment. Copyright

Title: When is human capital a valuable resource? The performance effects of Ivy league selection among celebrated CEOs

Author-Name: Vikas Mehrotra  
Abstract:
  type="main" xml:id="smj2251-abs-0001"> <p xml:id="smj2251-para-0001">We
 investigate whether and when highly trained human capital constitutes a
 rent-sustaining resource. Our study of 444 CEOs celebrated on the covers
 of major U.S. business magazines found an advantage accruing to graduates
 of selective universities. Such CEOs led firms with higher and more
 sustained market valuations. The advantage was strongest for undergraduate
 programs as these related to the kinds of talent demanded of a CEO. The
 advantage also was greatest in smaller firms where CEO discretion might be
 highest and for younger CEOs who may benefit most from college and are
 less able to appropriate rents. Finally, the advantage accrued to
 graduates of more recent years, when selective schools had become less
 socially elitist and increasingly meritocratic, thus favoring human versus
 social capital. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Title: The role of reference point in CEO restricted stock and its impact on R&D intensity in high-technology firms 
Author-Name: Elizabeth N. K. Lim  
Abstract:
  type="main" xml:id="smj2252-abs-0001"> <p
 xml:id="smj2252-para-0001">Prior work based on agency theory and
 behavioral agency model has focused on how absolute pay values affect firm
 outcomes. Departing from this traditional approach, we draw from
 behavioral decision theory to explain how relative pay levels influence
 firm risk taking. We investigate how CEO restricted stock value relative
 to reference point influences R&D intensity in high-technology firms. We
 propose that negative deviation increases are related to R&D increases and
 positive deviation increases lead to R&D decreases, while negative
 deviation has greater effect than positive deviation. We establish
 theoretical boundary conditions by considering CEO duality and board
 vigilance as moderators. Drawing from agency theory, we predict the main
 effects will be enhanced under duality and weakened under high board
 vigilance. Our hypotheses are largely supported. Copyright © 2014 John

Abstract:
  type="main" xml:id="smj2253-abs-0001"> <p
 xml:id="smj2253-para-0001">Drawing on social comparison theory, this study
 examines the relationship between politically connected boards and top
 executive pay. Moreover, given the socialist orientation of China, tests
 are also carried out to establish the relationship between politically
 connected directors and pay dispersion across the firm. We find a negative
 association between politically connected boards and top executive pay. We
 also find that politically connected boards are negatively associated with
 pay dispersion, i.e., the higher the number of political directors on the
 board the smaller the gap between top executive pay and average employee
 pay. Finally, our study shows that politically connected directors weaken
 the pay-performance link. These findings have important theoretical,
 policy, and managerial implications. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley & Sons,

Title: Redesigning routines for replication 
Author-Name: Anuja Gupta  
Author-Name: David G. Hoopes  
Author-Name: Anne Marie Knott  
Abstract:
  type="main" xml:id="smj2254-abs-0001"> <p xml:id="smj2254-para-0001">One
 factor affecting the replicability of routines is the template of what
 gets replicated. There isn't much work on where this comes from. One view
 is that the routine is discovered over time. Another view is that in some
 cases firms prefer to copy the last incarnation exactly. A third view is
 that in completely new contexts, neither evolution nor copy-exactly is
 completely appropriate. In those instances firms need to redesign the
 routine prior to introducing it to the new context. We conduct an
 exploratory study of a redesign process that ends in failure. Analysis of
 the failure provides preliminary hypotheses about how to create theory for
 redesigning routines. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Title: Has the “CEO effect” increased in recent decades? A new explanation for the great rise in America's attention to corporate leaders 
Author-Name: Timothy J. Quigley  
Author-Name: Donald C. Hambrick  
Abstract:
  type="main" xml:id="smj2258-abs-0001"> <p xml:id="smj2258-para-0001">We
 introduce a new explanation for one of the most pronounced phenomena on
 the American business landscape in recent decades: a dramatic increase in
 attributions of CEO significance. Specifically, we test the possibility
 that America's CEOs became seen as increasingly significant because they
 were, in fact, increasingly significant. Employing variance partitioning
 methodologies on data spanning 60 years and more than 18,000 firm-years,
 we find that the proportion of variance in performance explained by
 individual CEOs, or “the CEO effect,” increased substantially over the
 decades of study. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of
 this finding. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Title: Motivation and sorting of human capital in open innovation 
Author-Name: Sharon Belenzon  
Author-Name: Mark Schankerman  
Abstract:
  type="main" xml:id="smj2284-abs-0001"> <p xml:id="smj2284-para-0001">This
 paper studies how business models can be designed to tap effectively into
 open innovation labor markets with heterogeneously motivated workers.
 Using data on open source software, we show that motivations are diverse,
 and demonstrate how managers can strategically influence the flow of code
 contributions and their impact on project performance. Unlike previous
 literature using survey data, we exploit the observed pattern of project
 membership and code contributions—the “revealed preference” of
 developers—to infer the motivations driving their decision to contribute.
 Developers strongly sort along key dimensions of the business model chosen
 by project managers, especially the degree of openness of the project
 license. The results indicate an important role for intrinsic motivation,
 reputation, and labor market signaling, and a more limited role for
 reciprocity. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
