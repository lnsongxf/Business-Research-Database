Abstract:

 xml:id="smj2260-para-0001"><fi>Organizations learn and adapt their
 aspiration levels based on reference points (prior aspiration, prior
 performance, and prior performance of reference groups). The relative
 attention that organizations allocate to these reference points impacts
 organizational search and strategic decisions. However, very little
 research has explored this. Therefore, we build a recursive feedback model
 of learning from organizational experience that explains heterogeneity of
 attention allocation to the reference points in adaptive aspirations. In a
 sample of the German magazine industry (1972–2010), we find when early in
 their life cycle and as they or their parent company age, organizations
 tend to focus more on their own aspirations; however, when at the verge of
 bankruptcy, they increase their attention to competitors'
 performance</fi>. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Title: Deals not done: Sources of failure in the market for ideas

 xml:id="smj2261-para-0001"><fi>Using novel survey data on technology
 licensing, we report the first empirical evidence linking the three main
 sources of failure emphasized in the market design literature (lack of
 market thickness, congestion, lack of market safety) to deal outcomes. We
 disaggregate the licensing process into three stages and find that,
 although lack of market thickness and deal failure are correlated in the
 first stage, they are not in the latter stages, underscoring the bilateral
 monopoly conditions under which negotiations over intellectual property
 often occur. In contrast, market safety is only salient in the final
 stage. Several commonly referenced bargaining frictions (congestion) are
 salient, particularly in the second stage. Also, universities and firms
 differ in the stage during which they are most likely to experience deal
 failure</fi>. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Title: Time to exit: Rational, behavioral, and organizational delays 
Author-Name: Daniel W. Elfenbein

Abstract:
  type="main" xml:id="smj2262-abs-0001"> <p
 xml:id="smj2262-para-0001"><fi>Existing studies of exit delay typically
 focus on rational, behavioral, or organizational explanations in
 isolation. We integrate these different theoretical explanations, develop
 testable hypotheses for each, and examine them using the population of US
 banks between 1984 and 1997. Banks' exit behavior is not consistent with
 theories emphasizing the option value of avoiding reentry costs. Patterns
 of exit do, however, support models of rational delay under ability
 uncertainty. Controlling for this source of rational delay, we find
 evidence of delay due to behavioral bias—firms discount negative signals
 of profitability relative to positive signals—and organizational
 considerations—delay increases with the separation of ownership and
 control. These results demonstrate that all three sets of theories are
 necessary to describe exit behavior</fi>. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley &

Title: The effects of geographic and network ties on exploitative and exploratory product innovation

 literature, we first distinguish the type of innovation and study the
 relationship of industrial clusters with exploitative and exploratory
 product innovation. Furthermore, we study how focal cluster firms' network
 ties with their suppliers and buyers in their clusters might moderate
 these relationships. Our empirical study showed that, while cluster
 membership enhanced firms' exploitative product innovation, it hindered
 their exploratory product innovation. Moreover, the results showed that
 focal cluster firms' network ties with their suppliers and buyers in their
 clusters strengthened the effects of cluster membership on exploitative
 product innovation. They also showed that focal cluster firms' network
 ties with their buyers but not suppliers in their clusters reduced the
 negative effects of cluster membership on exploratory product
 innovation</fi>. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

 office in firm performance has focused on establishing how much
 performance variance can be attributed to a “corporate effect,” with
 little attention devoted to understanding how this influence occurs. In
 this study, we model capital allocation competency as a dynamic managerial
 capability and find that lower levels of allocation competency in the form
 of excess investment to business units with relatively poorer future
 prospects reduce business unit performance. We also find that market
 conditions affect performance implications of capital
 allocation—allocation competency is more salient in more competitive
 markets. These results enhance our understanding of how the corporate
 office influences business unit performance through its role in allocating
 capital across business units</fi>. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley & Sons,

Title: Attention allocation to multiple goals: The case of for-profit social enterprises

Abstract:
  type="main" xml:id="smj2265-abs-0001"> <p
 xml:id="smj2265-para-0001"><fi>The complexity of issues firms have to
 attend to make it impossible for CEOs to give their full attention to all
 issues concurrently. Drawing on the “attention-based view” of the firm,
 this paper opens the black box of attention allocation in for-profit
 social enterprises by showing how attention structures and the context in
 which the firm operates interplay. Utilizing empirical data on 148
 for-profit social enterprises, findings show that the attention
 structures—other-regarding values, utilitarian identity, and resource
 availability—have a significant impact on the relative attention to social
 goals, while past firm performance as a context variable moderates these
 relations. Applying the principles of structural and situated attention,
 this paper makes an important contribution to management theory and
 attention allocation in for-profit social enterprises</fi>. Copyright ©

Title: The impact of corporate social responsibility on investment recommendations: Analysts' perceptions and shifting institutional logics

Abstract:

 xml:id="smj2268-para-0001"><fi>We explore the impact of corporate social
 responsibility (CSR) ratings on sell-side analysts' assessments of firms'
 future financial performance. We suggest that when analysts perceive CSR
 as an agency cost they produce pessimistic recommendations for firms with
 high CSR ratings. Moreover, we theorize that, over time, the emergence of
 a stakeholder focus shifts the analysts' perceptions of CSR. Using a large
 sample of publicly traded U.S. firms over 15 years, we confirm that, in
 the early 1990s, analysts issue more pessimistic recommendations for firms
 with high CSR ratings. However, analysts progressively assess these firms
 more optimistically over time. Furthermore, we find that analysts of
 highest status are the first to shift the relation between CSR ratings and
 investment recommendation optimism</fi>. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley &

Title: The effects of opportunities and founder experience on new firm performance

Abstract:
  type="main" xml:id="smj2269-abs-0001"> <p
 xml:id="smj2269-para-0001"><fi>Much prior research in entrepreneurship has
 focused on the role of the founder's knowledge in affecting new firm
 performance. Yet, little is known about how and why the entrepreneurial
 opportunity itself shapes outcomes in this arena. We begin filling in this
 critical gap in the literature by examining how the riskiness of the
 opportunity not only affects start-up performance, but also conditions the
 relevance of the founder's distinct knowledge endowments. Analyses of a
 sample of 451 new firms show that the riskier the opportunity, the greater
 the performance of the start-up, above and beyond founder characteristics.
 Moreover, the value of founder knowledge is relative to the type of
 opportunity exploited: high-risk opportunities favor founders with
 managerial experience, whereas low-risk opportunities favor founders with
 industry experience</fi>. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Title: Firm responses to social movement pressures: A competitive dynamics perspective

Abstract:
  type="main" xml:id="smj2273-abs-0001"> <p
 xml:id="smj2273-para-0001"><fi>Why do firms respond to social movement
 pressures differently? This study investigates how the strategic
 motivation of firms, as captured by competitor activity and market
 dependence, influences the likelihood of their response to social movement
 demands. We examine this through a longitudinal analysis of wind power
 adoption by electric utilities in U.S. deregulated markets. We find that
 when either competitor actions aligned with movement demands or firm
 dependence on targeted markets increase, the positive effect of movement
 activism on firm response diminishes. In contrast, as strategic motivation
 declines, increases in movement activism become more influential at
 eliciting firm responses</fi>. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

 interests of CEOs and shareholders, but scholars have shown that options
 sometimes lead to outcomes that run counter to what they are meant to
 achieve. Building on this research, we argue that options promote a lack
 of caution in CEOs that manifests in a higher incidence of product safety
 problems. We also posit that this relationship varies across CEOs, and
 that the effect of options will depend upon CEO characteristics such as
 tenure and founder status. Analyzing product recall data for a large
 sample of FDA-regulated companies, we find support for our theory</fi>.
