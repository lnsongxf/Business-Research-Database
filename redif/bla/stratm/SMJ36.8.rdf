Title: Value creation and value capture under moral hazard: Exploring the micro-foundations of buyer– supplier relationships 
Author-Name: Tomasz Obloj  
Author-Name: Peter Zemsky  
Abstract:
  type="main" xml:id="smj2271-abs-0001"> <p xml:id="smj2271-para-0001">We
 combine the formalism of a principal–agent framework with a value-based
 analysis in order to investigate the micro-foundations of business partner
 selection and the division of value in contracting relationships. In
 particular, we study how the key contracting parameters such as
 efficiency, transactional integrity, incentive alignment, and gaming
 affect outcomes when buyers face competing suppliers. We show that
 integrity and efficiency increase value creation and capture for all
 parties and are complements. While incentive gaming is unambiguously bad
 for value creation, and reduces buyers' value capture, it can benefit some
 suppliers. For alignment, we find that neither party has an incentive to
 use fully aligned performance measures that maximize total value creation.
 We conclude by analyzing buyers' and suppliers' incentives to invest in
 integrity. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Title: I used to work at Goldman Sachs! How firms benefit from organizational status in the market for human capital

Abstract:
  type="main" xml:id="smj2272-abs-0001"> <p xml:id="smj2272-para-0001">How
 does employer status benefit firms in the market for general human
 capital? On the one hand, high status employers are better able to attract
 workers, who value the signal of ability that employment at those firms
 provides. On the other hand, that same signal can help workers bid up
 wages and capture the value of employers' status. Exploring this tension,
 we argue that high status firms are able to hire higher ability workers
 than other firms, and do not need to pay them the full value of their
 ability early in the career, but must raise wages more rapidly than other
 firms as those workers accrue experience. We test our arguments using
 unique survey data on careers in investment banking. Copyright © 2014 John

Title: Do female and ethnically diverse executives endure inequity in the CEO position or do they benefit from their minority status? An empirical examination 
Author-Name: Aaron D. Hill

Author-Name: Rafik I. Beekun  
Abstract:
  type="main" xml:id="smj2274-abs-0001"> <p xml:id="smj2274-para-0001">We
 present competing hypotheses regarding whether gender and ethnic minority
 CEOs endure inequities resulting in lower compensation and higher
 likelihood of job exit or benefit from their valuable, rare, and
 inimitable minority status, resulting in higher compensation and lower
 likelihood of job exit. Using a longitudinal sample, we find support for
 the resource-based hypothesis regarding compensation that suggests CEOs
 benefit from their minority status to receive higher compensation than
 white male CEOs receive. However, we also find mixed support for our
 hypotheses relating CEO minority status to the likelihood of exit. We find
 that the effects of minority status on likelihood of exit are
 significantly different for female and ethnic minority CEOs such that the
 former relationship is negative while the latter is positive. Copyright ©

 xml:id="smj2275-para-0001">Prior studies of IPO underpricing, mostly using
 agency theory and single-country samples, have generally fallen short. In
 this study, we employ the knowledge-based view (KBV) to explore
 underpricing across 17 countries. We find that agency indicators are
 insignificant predictors, board of director knowledge limits underpricing,
 and external knowledge both substitutes for and complements internal board
 knowledge. This third finding suggests that future KBV studies should
 consider how internal and external knowledge states interact with each
 other. Our study offers new insights into the antecedents of underpricing
 and extends our understanding of comparative governance and the KBV of the
 firm. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Title: The quest for expansive intellectual property rights and the failure to disclose known relevant prior art

Abstract:
  type="main" xml:id="smj2279-abs-0001"> <p
 xml:id="smj2279-para-0001">Expansive patent portfolios may be used by
 firms to fence off technological space for commercialization, impede the
 commercialization efforts of competitors, and enhance bargaining power in
 cross-licensing negotiations. Low quality patents with claims that overlap
 those of other patents contribute to these portfolios and patent
 strategies. By failing to disclose known relevant prior art during the
 patenting process, inventors and their firms may be granted low quality
 patents with intellectual property claims which would not otherwise have
 been granted. We find that the failure of inventors to disclose known
 relevant prior art increases as they gain experience with the patenting
 process. Such failure is also greater among inventors employed by
 relatively small, poorly performing firms that rely on outsourced legal
 counsel during the application process. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley &

Title: Asset divestment as a response to media attacks in stigmatized industries 
Author-Name: Rodolphe Durand  
Author-Name: Jean-Philippe Vergne  
Abstract:
  type="main" xml:id="smj2280-abs-0001"> <p xml:id="smj2280-para-0001">In
 stigmatized industries characterized by social contestation, hostile
 audiences, and distancing between industry insiders and outsiders, firms
 facing media attacks follow different strategies from firms in uncontested
 industries. Because firms avoid publicizing their tainted-sector
 membership, when threatened, they can respond by divesting assets from
 that industry. Our analyses of the arms industry demonstrate that media
 attacks on the focal firm and its peers both increase the likelihood of
 divestment for the focal firm. Specifically, attacks on the focal firm are
 the most consequential, followed by attacks on peers in the same industry
 subcategory, and by attacks on peers in different subcategories. These
 findings shed new light on divestment as a response to media attacks in
 stigmatized industries and lead us to rethink impression management
 theory. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Title: Exploring longitudinal risk-return relationships

Author-Name: Richard A. Bettis  
Abstract:
  type="main" xml:id="smj2281-abs-0001"> <p xml:id="smj2281-para-0001">We
 study a longitudinal fit model of adaptation and its association with the
 longitudinal risk-return relationship. The model allows the firm to adjust
 its position in response to partial learning about a changing environment
 characterized by two path-dependent processes—a random walk and a
 stochastic trend. Computational simulations at low levels of learning in
 both environmental contexts are consistent with empirical data. However,
 the results are also consistent when firm behavior appears to be mindless
 in the form of a random walk. Hence, both imperfect learning and a
 mindless random walk can lead to the inverse longitudinal risk-return
 relationships observed empirically. We discuss this apparent paradox and
 the possible resolution between mindless and conscious behavior as
 plausible causes of the longitudinal Bowman Paradox. Copyright © 2014 John

Title: Predicting organizational identification at the CEO level

Abstract:
  type="main" xml:id="smj2283-abs-0001"> <p xml:id="smj2283-para-0001">To
 develop further insight into antecedents of the CEO's psychological
 orientation toward the firm, we investigate what might lead CEOs to
 identify with their firms. Although research suggests that CEO
 organizational identification can be quite consequential for the firm,
 little research attention has been paid to its determinants. To predict
 how the special context of the CEO position might lead to identification,
 we consider a set of motives that members have for identifying with their
 organizations and consider how unique features of the CEO position might
 be relevant to those motives. Our theory and supportive findings help
 explain how the context of the CEO position, including variables often
 conceptualized as control mechanisms in agency theory research, can have
 important effects on subsequent CEO organizational identification.

Title: New venture strategic adaptation: The interplay of belief structures and industry context 
Author-Name: Andreea N. Kiss  
Author-Name: Pamela S. Barr  
Abstract:
  type="main" xml:id="smj2285-abs-0001"> <p xml:id="smj2285-para-0001">We
 adopt an information processing perspective to investigate how the
 interplay of belief structures and industry context shapes new venture
 strategic adaptation in a sample of 104 publicly traded new ventures
 founded between 1996 and 2006 in several technology-intensive industries.
 Results highlight that distinct espoused belief structures attributes
 (complexity, centrality, proactive causal logics) and industry growth
 combinations predict diversity, frequency, and speed of new venture
 strategic actions. We contribute to prior literature on early firm
 strategic adaptation by providing an elaborated understanding of the role
 of espoused belief structures in interpreting and translating industry
 signals into new venture strategic action. Further, we highlight the role
 of belief structures in facilitating the fast, diverse, and frequent
 organizational actions typically associated with continuous adaptation.

Title: Do banks matter for the risk of a firm's investment portfolio? Evidence from foreign direct investment programs 
Author-Name: Marie-Ann Betschinger  
Abstract:
  type="main" xml:id="smj2302-abs-0001"> <p xml:id="smj2302-para-0001">The
 study explores the role of banks as debt and equity holders for the
 riskiness of a firm's investment strategy using a panel of Japanese firms
 in the electronics industry in the period 1992–2004 for the empirical
 analysis. Based on a conceptual framework grounded in agency and financial
 intermediation theories, we find that a larger involvement of banks as
 debt holders in a firm is associated with lower foreign direct investment
 portfolio risk, while the shareholdings of universal banks increase it,
 supporting the theoretical predictions. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley &
