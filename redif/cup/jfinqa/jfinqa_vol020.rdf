Title: A Comparison of the Information Content of Insider Trading and Management Earnings Forecasts
Journal: Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis
Pages: 1-17
Issue: 01
Volume: 20
Year: 1985
Month: March    
Abstract: In this paper, insider trading is viewed as a signal of managements' assessments of firms' future prospects and its information content is compared to that in managements' earnings forecasts. These forecasts are explicit statements of managements' assessments of future prospects. A number of measures of insider trading designed to capture the information aspect of trading are investigated. The results indicate that the insider trading measures do not capture the information conveyed in earnings forecasts, although there is evidence that insider trading measures that take into account the timing of trades relative to the date of the release of the forecast are informative.

Title: The Effect of Forward Markets on the Debt-Equity Mix of Investor Portfolios and the Optimal Capital Structure of Firms
Journal: Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis
Pages: 19-27
Issue: 01
Volume: 20
Year: 1985
Month: March    
Abstract: This paper demonstrates that the various market imperfections that have been suggested to explain observed portfolio choices and capital structures can be circumvented if securities (e.g., options) can be traded that simulate forward contracts on stock. It is shown that if the risk-adjusted returns to bondholders exceed the returns to stockholders (to reflect personal tax differences) tax-exempt investors will prefer a combination of these synthetic forward purchases and corporate bonds to purchasing stock directly. They will not, as has been suggested, include stock in their portfolios for diversification purposes when they can alternatively purchase securities that simulate forward contracts. It is also shown that firms that can sell synthetic forward positions on their own stock can essentially guarantee that sufficient funds will be available to meet their bond obligations. This gives firms the opportunity to increase their debt levels without increasing the possibility of bankruptcy and the corresponding administrative and agency costs.

Title: Inflation, the Interest Rate, and the Required Return on Equity
Journal: Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis
Pages: 29-44
Issue: 01
Volume: 20
Year: 1985
Month: March    
Abstract: Miller has analyzed capital structure in the presence of both corporate and personal taxes. The present work investigates the effect of inflation on both interest rates and equity returns when the Miller equilibrium condition is employed in a loanable funds model. Both an interest rate effect and a redistribution effect are derived. The interest rate effect forces the responsiveness of the interest rate to the inflation rate to be below that hypothesized by Darby. However, the redistribution effect may change this responsiveness in either direction.

Title: Valuation by Approximation: A Comparison of Alternative Option Valuation Techniques
Journal: Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis
Pages: 45-71
Issue: 01
Volume: 20
Year: 1985
Month: March    
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to compare a variety of approximation techniques for valuing contingent contracts when analytic solutions do not exist. The comparison is made with respect to the differences in both the approximation theory and the efficiency of the computation algorithms. The focus of the computational comparison is upon binomial and finite difference methods applied to option valuation models with one stochastic variable. However, many of the results would generalize to pricing corporate securities, and also to certain aspects of problems involving multiple stochastic variables.

Title: Explanations for the Instability of Equity Beta: Risk-Free Rate Changes and Leverage Effects
Journal: Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis
Pages: 73-94
Issue: 01
Volume: 20
Year: 1985
Month: March    
Abstract: This paper is an initial attempt to bridge the gap that presently exists between the theoretical and empirical literature on the instability of equity beta. We focus on two factors from the joint Option Pricing Model/Capital Asset Pricing Model framework—leverage and unexpected changes in the risk-free rate—which are hypothesized to influence the instability of equity beta across firms and over time. Using alternative variable parameter regression models, we find that highly leveraged firms exhibit greater equity beta instability than firms with lower leverage. Over time, equity betas exhibit greater instability during periods of large unexpected changes in the risk-free rate when compared to periods with small unexpected changes in the risk-free rate.

Journal: Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis

Issue: 01
Volume: 20
Year: 1985
Month: March    
Abstract: This paper examines the differential tax treatment of the borrower and lender at the time debt is called as a potential explanation for the widespread existence of call provisions in corporate debt. This tax effect alone cannot explain the standard call feature because greater tax benefits may be derived for bonds callable at market prices. The equilibrium implications of the model allowing for tax arbitrage opportunities both at the corporate level and the individual level also are considered.

Title: Lifting the Lid on Closed-End Investment Companies: A Case of Abnormal Returns
Journal: Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis
Pages: 107-117
Issue: 01
Volume: 20
Year: 1985
Month: March    
Abstract: This study documents substantial gains accuring to shareholders of discounted closed-end investment companies when these funds are reorganized to allow shareholders to obtain the market value of the fund's assets. The findings indicate that the discounts on closedend funds are real, i.e., they are not the sole result of inaccurate reporting of the fund's net asset value. The study also documents significant abnormal returns <italic>after</italic> the announcement of management-sponsored proposals to reorganize. This finding is inconsistent with the joint hypothesis of market efficiency and that the market model (as estimated) is the correct return bench mark for funds undertaking reorganization.

Abstract: Several studies used a multi-factor model to examine the interest rate sensitivity of a financial intermediary's common stock. The model was re-specified in an attempt to estimate each factor's influence. This note shows that the re-specification results in biased estimators. Hypothesis tests are flawed by failure to acknowledge the bias; this casts doubt upon the reported findings

Journal: Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis

Issue: 03
Volume: 20
Year: 1985
Month: September
Abstract: This paper presents a model of equilibrium in a capital market for linear shares of risky firms andin a market for managerial labor in which market participants function as both investors and managers. The model yields interesting and relevant equilibrium conditions that integrate earlier separate treatments of the capital market with human capital and the incentive contracting problem regarding shirking.The theory developed here provides a microeconomic explanation of how the price of risk established in the capital market is relevant to the labor contracting problem. The analysis also provides a logical rationale for the division of responsibilities between a board of directors and the management of the firm.

Month: September
Abstract: The quadratic form of the covariance-co-skewness model by Kraus and Litzenberger and arbitrage pricing theory are used for an empirical investigation of market equilibrium with skewed seecurity returns. Empirical tests similar to the ones in Black-Jensen-Scholes and Gibbons are discussed. The empirical estimates give some support to the Kraus-Litzenberger hypothesis on skewness preference. However, there is some evidence that the tested arbitrage equilibrium is not a complete description of security pricing.

Journal: Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis
Pages: 315-334
Issue: 03
Volume: 20
Year: 1985
Month: September
Abstract: This paper considers two aspects of the tendency for systematic risk to change during the period surrounding a firm-specific event. First, a statistic allowing for heteroskedasticity is presented as a means of more precisely testing for the incidence of structural change in the market model. Secondly, the bias resulting from the imposition of a single, arbitrary event period on every firm in a market efficiency study is formally demonstrated. Using a sample based upon stock splits, the switching regression technique of Quandt is then adapted to show that event intervals are more appropriately considered on a case-by-case basis. A comparison of alternative residual measures illustrates these procedures.

Abstract: Daily cash forecasting generally requires some method to reflect day-of-month and day-of-week effects.

This paper first presents <italic>multiplticative</italic> and <italic>mixed-effects</italic> specifications of day-of-month and day-of-week effects as alternatives to the <italic>additive</italic> specifications. Then, several important estimation issues pertinent to each specification are investigated, namely collinearity, holiday effects, length-of-month distortion, varying weekly-monthly pattern mix, and daily-monthly consistency.

Title: Simple Optimal Policy for Cash Management: The Average Balance Requirement Case
Journal: Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis
Pages: 353-369
Issue: 03
Volume: 20
Year: 1985
Month: September
Abstract: This paper treats a problem of stochastic cash management under an average compensating-balance requirement. It develops a dynamic programming formulation of the problem in which the relevant state is a unidimensional quantity equivalent to the forecasted average balance at the end of the averaging period. Under usably broad conditions, it establishes the optimality of a transient policy of simple type, similar to the two-sided inventory type policy familiar from certain earlier studies of stationary cash balance problems having absolute balance requirements. The results apply to cases in which the transactions costs contain both fixed and proportional components. The paper discusses also a numerical example drawn from the literature of the cash balance problem and shows by simulation of the optimal (and simply modified forms of the optimal) policy, that good protection is afforded against negative balances, even though the model does not explicitly constrain the negative-balance probabilities.

Volume: 20
Year: 1985
Month: September
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the effect of futures trading in Treasury bills on the volatility of yields in the cash market. It is found that futures trading led to a decrease in volatility initially, but the effect disappeared when futures volume became large and possibly resulted in increased volatility in the secondary cash market. The results also indicated that the deliverable bill appears to sell at a small premium relative to the adjacent maturities prior to the delivery date.

Abstract: A necessary and sufficient condition for linear sharing rules to be Pareto optimal, as generally accepted by the finance community, is that utility functions be of the equicautious HARA class. We demonstrate that this condition is not necessary for a fixed distribution of initial endowments and derive the necessary and sufficient condition. We show examples of utility functions satisfying our conditions.

Abstract: In this note, a loss shared by the security holders of merging firms is pointed out: separate corporate entities provide double protection against future negative cash flows that are partof any production process (e.g., when customer or employee liabilities exceed future income), independent of whether or not debt is used in the corporate capital structure. A merger involvesa relinquishment of this double protection in return for a less valuable single protection: limited liability in the merged corporation against <italic>combined</italic> negative cash flows.

Month: December 
Abstract: We develop a positive theory of the hedging behavior of value-maximizing corporations. We treat hedging by corporations simply as one part of the firm's financing decisions. We examine (1) taxes, (2) contracting costs, and (3) the impact of hedging policy on the firm's investment decisions as explanations of the observed wide diversity of hedging practices among large, widely-held corporations. Our theory provides answers to the questions: (1) why some firms hedge and others do not; (2) why firms hedge some risks but not others; and (3) why some firms hedge their accounting risk exposure while others hedge their economic value.

Volume: 20
Year: 1985
Month: December 
Abstract: We propose a simple model of equilibrium asset pricing in which there are differences in the amounts of information available for developing inferences about the returns parameters of alternative securities. In contrast with earlier work, we show that parameter uncertainty, or estimation risk, can have an effect upon market equilibrium. Under reasonable conditions, securities for which there is relatively little information are shown to have relatively higher systematic risk when that risk is properly measured, <italic>ceteris paribus</italic>. The initially very limited model is shown to be robust with respect to relaxation of a number of its principal assumptions. We provide theoretical support for the empirical examination of at least three proxies for relative information: period of listing, number of security returns observations available, and divergence of analyst opinion.

Abstract: The parameters of the return process of a firm are determined by two elements—the <italic>natural event structure</italic>, i.e., the process by which nature affects the value of the firm, and the <italic>information structure</italic>, i.e., the process by which information about these events is collected and disseminated to investors. Simple measures of three dimensions of the information structure—the frequency and accuracy of, and the bias in information releases, are derived from the moments of the return distribution.

Title: Efficiency Analysis and Option Portfolio Selection
Journal: Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis
Pages: 435-450
Issue: 04
Volume: 20
Year: 1985
Month: December 
Abstract: The unique characteristics of options enable investors to create nonnormal portfolio return distributions that cannot be replicated with other assets. This analysis explores the power of various investment selection criteria to identify efficient portfolios from investment strategies involving call options and treasury bills, stocks, and covered option writing. The preference structure for strategies incorporating options is compared to traditional stock-fixed income investments, and the importance of options to investor utility maximization is illustrated. This study reveals that rules of stochastic dominance that place few restrictions on investor preference functions and asset return distribution are appropriate criteria by which to rank portfolios containing options and other assets.

Title: Market Timing and Risk Reduction
Journal: Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis
Pages: 451-459
Issue: 04
Volume: 20
Year: 1985
Month: December 
Abstract: This paper addresses both how best to incorporate forecasts of future excess market returns into a market-timing strategy and what additional return to expect as a consequence. In contrast to the work of Jensen [8] and Grant ([4], [5], and [6]), the results specifically consider and measure the attractiveness to a risk-averse investor of the positively skewed distribution of portfolio returns expected from a market-timed portfolio. The usual mean and variance characterization of a risky portfolio is not sufficient in the case of a markettimed portfolio, and a simple utility model is employed to measure the incremental value of a market-timing strategy. The results are given as a function of the relative volatility of the market, the quality of available forecasts, and the risk attitude of the investor.

Title: Predicting Tender Offer Success: A Logistic Analysis
Journal: Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis
Pages: 461-478
Issue: 04
Volume: 20
Year: 1985
Month: December 
Abstract: This research develops and tests a model for the prediction of tender offer outcomes. Variables that increase the supply of “obtainable shares” (such as increased bid premiums or the payment of solicitation fees) are shown to increase the probability of success. Increased ownership of target firm shares by the bidder also increases the probability of success. Variables that impede the tendering of shares (such as target management opposition or a competing bid) decrease the probability of success. Tests of the model utilizing both linear and logistic analysis support the theoretical constructs and help resolve the paradoxical findings of previous research.

Title: Debt Policy and the Rate of Return Premium to Leverage
Journal: Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis
Pages: 479-499
Issue: 04
Volume: 20
Year: 1985
Month: December 
Abstract: Equilibrium in the market for real assets requires that the price of those assets be bid up to reflect the tax shields they can offer to levered firms. Thus, there must be an equality between the market values of real assets and the values of optimally levered firms. The standard measure of the advantage to leverage compares the values of levered and unlevered assets, and can be misleading and difficult to interpret. We show that a meaningful measure of the advantage to debt is the extra rate of return, net of a market premium for bankruptcy risk, earned by a levered firm relative to an otherwise-identical unlevered firm. We construct an option valuation model to calculate such a measure and present extensive simulation results. We use this model to compute optimal debt maturities, show how this approach can be used for capital budgeting, and discuss its implications for the comparison of bankruptcy costs versus tax shields.

Title: The Application of Errors-in-Variables Methodology to Capital Market Research: Evidence on the Small-Firm Effect
Journal: Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis
Pages: 501-515
Issue: 04
Volume: 20
Year: 1985
Month: December 
Abstract: Errors in variables due to nonsynchronous trading and benchmark error are significant problems for capital market research. This paper develops the use of direct and reverse regression to bound true coefficient estimates when the data exhibit error structures arising from these two sources both separately and jointly. The approach appears to have broad applicability for capital markets research. As an example, the paper reexamines the small-firm effect to show that it cannot be attributed to nonsynchronous trading or benchmark error in the estimated variance of the market portfolio. This result is shown to hold even when the tax-selling effect is controlled for by excluding January returns.

Title: Portfolio Serial Correlation and Nonsynchronous Trading
Journal: Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis
Pages: 517-523
Issue: 04
Volume: 20
Year: 1985
Month: December 
Abstract: Common stock portfolios of large, heavily traded firms exhibit daily first-order serial correlation in excess of what would be expected, given the individual security coefficients. Further, this correlation rises as the number of securities in the portfolio increases. The direct implication of this finding is that nonsynchronous trading is not the only cause of correlation in daily market indices. Related implications are also discussed.
