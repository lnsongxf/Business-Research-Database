Title: The Relationship between the Level of Capital Expenditures and Firm Value
Journal: Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis
Pages: 115-129
Issue: 02
Volume: 21
Year: 1986
Month: June     
Abstract: When a firm's management needs to raise external capital in order to finance an investment project, it is likely to have better information about the project's future return than do potential investors. In such a case, as has been shown in the literature, management may be able to signal its information through the use of certain financial variables. However, the possibility that management may be able to use the level of investment in the project itself to signal their information has not been considered. The purpose of this paper is to examine this possibility. It is shown here that the level of capital investment may be able to perfectly reveal management's information, with a higher input level signalling more favorable information. It is further demonstrated that even in this equilibrium, financial variables still play an important role. Among other results, it is shown, in contrast to a conclusion of a study by Leland and Pyle, that in this setting the number of shares held by management may be negatively correlated with the favorableness of their information.

Title: Evidence on the Impact of the Agency Costs of Debt on Corporate Debt Policy
Journal: Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis
Pages: 131-144
Issue: 02
Volume: 21
Year: 1986
Month: June     
Abstract: In the last several years, there has been increased theoretical emphasis on the agent-principal problem as it applies to corporate finance. This paper is an attempt to empirically test for the presence of the agency costs and their relation to the debt policy of corporations. We find that firms with higher insider ownership have greater debt ratios than firms with lower insider ownership, which may be explained by the agency costs of debt and/or the agency costs of equity. Other regression results tend to confirm the theoretically optimal relationships put forth by Myers. We find that high-growth firms use less debt rather than more debt, high-operating-risk firms use more debt rather than less debt, and firm size appears to be uncorrelated to the level of debt.

Month: June     
Abstract: This paper investigates the efficiency of the market for foreign currency options with the help of a modified version of the Black-Scholes model. The evidence in the <italic>ex post</italic> tests is inconsistent with this hypothesis since we find a large number of opportunities for abnormal profits. A second set of tests is conducted on an <italic>ex ante</italic> basis to determine whether these profit opportunities exist even if the execution of the strategy is delayed by one day. The evidence from these tests provides more support for the hypothesis of market efficiency.

Title: Market Line Deviations and Market Anomalies with Reference to Small and Large Firms
Journal: Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis
Pages: 161-180
Issue: 02
Volume: 21
Year: 1986
Month: June     
Abstract: Previous anomaly research may have misinterpreted corrected, for the market index, mean returns on small firms. Assuming mean-variance preferences, it is shown theoretically that corrected mean returns (i.e., market line deviations) are not indicative of the relative desirability of increasing the proportional investment in small firms. The correct improvement criterion is derived and estimated. Tests indicate that the value-weighted market index is not significantly improved with greater weight on small firms, in the average month. When seasonality is considered, the observed performance improvements due to small or large firms are significant in some months, but the required portfolio position is unclear. If a case exists for a small firm anomaly in January, it probably exists in other months and it also exists for large firms. It is doubtful whether such an anomalous stock market exists.

Title: The Effect of Management's Choice between Negotiated and Competitive Equity Offerings on Shareholder Wealth
Journal: Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis
Pages: 181-196
Issue: 02
Volume: 21
Year: 1986
Month: June     
Abstract: This paper investigates the effect on shareholder wealth of two events that change management's choice between negotiated and competitive underwritten equity offerings. These two events are the suspension and termination of suspension of Rule 50. (This rule is based on the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 and requires certain utilities to use the competitive method.) The results indicate that the shareholders of the affected utilities experience an abnormal negative return on the announcement of the suspension of Rule 50, and an abnormal positive return on the announcement of the termination of suspension. This evidence is consistent with the joint hypothesis: (i) competitive offerings are less costly than negotiated offerings, and (ii) manager-shareholder agency costs are a determinant of the corporate choice between these two methods of raising equity.

Title: Corporate Bond Price Data Sources and Return/Risk Measurement
Journal: Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis
Pages: 197-208
Issue: 02
Volume: 21
Year: 1986
Month: June     
Abstract: To date, a number of studies involving the use of bond prices and/or returns have utilized the published prices of trades on the New York and other exchanges. These exchange quotes reflect the odd-lot activities of individual investors and account for only a negligible portion of the trading in listed issues. In contrast, the vast majority of listed corporate trading occurs over-the-counter and involves round-lot trades between institutions. Given differences in market characteristics, odd-lot exchange prices may differ substantially from those in the round-lot institutional market. This study compares exchange quotations from Moody's <italic>Bond Record</italic> with prices assigned by Merrill Lynch's institutional pricing service and uses each set of prices to calculate return and risk measures. Institutional (Merrill Lynch) bond prices are shown to be systematically greater than exchange (Moody's) prices. In addition, bond returns based on Merrill Lynch prices are shown to yield significantly higher beta and R<sup>2</sup> estimates, as well as significantly lower standard deviation and residual risk estimates.

Title: Testing for Nonstationarity of Market Risk: An Exact Test and Power Considerations
Journal: Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis
Pages: 209-220
Issue: 02
Volume: 21
Year: 1986
Month: June     
Abstract: This paper reexamines the issue of common stock market risk stationarity by applying a newly available exact test for random-walk regression coefficients. For each eight-year subperiod tested in the 1951–1974 interval, betas for individual New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks appeared to be nonstationary. The statistical powers of the exact test and of locally most powerful tests are compared to the power of the test employed previously by Sunder. These power considerations are cited to explain the differences between test results obtained here and those reported by Sunder.

Title: A Nonparametric, Distribution-Free Test for Serial Independence in Stock Returns
Journal: Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis
Pages: 221-227
Issue: 02
Volume: 21
Year: 1986
Month: June     
Abstract: A fundamental statistical test of serial independence is developed and applied to daily stock returns. Let <italic>x</italic> be the deviation of the daily return on a stock from its sample mean after any autocorrelation present has been removed. If <italic>x</italic> is serially independent, then the cumulative sum of <italic>x</italic> over time is the position of a one-dimensional random walk on a line. The empirical distribution of step lengths over a large sample allows the distribution of the largest absolute excursion in a <italic>T</italic>-step walk to be calculated by repeated simulation. The observed maximal excursions are found to be significantly smaller than one would expect, based on serial independence and the observed distribution of step lengths. It is concluded that these daily stock returns are not serially independent and that the market value of the corporations studied has a tendency to return to an interval around the trend value.

Title: An Analytic Approximation for the American Put Price for Options on Stocks with Dividends
Journal: Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis
Pages: 229-233
Issue: 02
Volume: 21
Year: 1986
Month: June     
Abstract: In a recent paper, Johnson [7] has given an analytic approximation to the American put price that delivers values that are very close to numerical solutions. The limitation to the Johnson approximation is that it is only applicable to put options on stocks without cash dividends. This study modifies the Johnson approximation to value options on stocks that have one exdividend date prior to the option expiration date, and these approximation values are compared to the analytic solutions provided by the Geske and Johnson [6] American put option pricing model. The approximation values are generally very close to the analytic solutions.

Year: 1986
Month: December 
Abstract: This paper examines the influence of risk aversion on the pricing policies of a market maker for securities. It is shown that a market maker's bid-ask spread can be decomposed into a portion for the known limit orders, a risk-neutral adjustment for expected market orders, and a risk adjustment for market order and inventory value uncertainty. It is demonstrated that a risk-averse market maker may set a smaller spread than a risk-neutral specialist. Finally, this paper demonstrates the pervasive role of inventory in affecting both the placement and size of the spread.

Title: An Empirical Test of a Valuation Model for American Options on Futures Contracts
Journal: Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis
Pages: 377-392
Issue: 04
Volume: 21
Year: 1986
Month: December 
Abstract: Pricing models for American call and put options on futures contracts are derived herein. These models are used to investigate the efficiency of the market for options on Standard & Poor 500 and German Mark futures. The evidence presented here indicates that market prices for these options deviate substantially from their corresponding model prices. In addition, it is shown that a hedging strategy originated at prices that indicate a deviation of market from model is successful in translating the observed mispricing into excess profits after transactions costs. However, these net profits are eliminated if the origination of the strategy is delayed by one trade, or if bid-ask spreads are accounted for.

Year: 1986
Month: December 
Abstract: This paper explores the effects of mergers on the investment incentives of the levered firm and on levered firm value. Under a fairly broad set of assumptions, it is shown that most firm combinations “improve” investment incentives, bringing about a reduction in the agency costs of underinvestment associated with risky debt. The effect of the merger on debt and equity claim values is also explored. If not properly anticipated, the merger may create a wealth transfer from equity holders to bondholders. Such a wealth transfer includes, but is not limited to, the “coinsurance effect.”

Abstract: Three alternative characterizations of corporate debt management policy, which have had wide currency in the literature, are examined. They are shown to give rise to substantial differences in their predictions of total-firm value. This study concludes that, of the three, the one that assumes that management periodically rebalances the firm's debt levels in response to evolving new information on expected future operating cash flows is the most logically consistent. On that basis, a reinterpretation of the available empirical evidence on the “tax effect” of debt is indicated.

Title: State Taxes and Reserve Requirements as Major Determinants of Yield Spreads among Money Market Instruments
Journal: Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis
Pages: 427-436
Issue: 04

Abstract: Empirical studies and much marketplace opinion have it that the spread between private money market rates and the U.S. Treasury bill rate of comparable maturity is due to differential default risk, liquidity risk, and relative supplies. This paper presents an argument and empirical evidence that the bulk of the systematic and medium-term differential between privates rates—in this case, domestic CDs, commercial paper, bankers' acceptances, and Eurodollar CDs—and the T-bill rate is due to the exemption of interest on Treasury securities from state and local taxation. In the case of Eurodollar CDs, the additional and major systematic factor explaining the spread (<italic>vis a vis</italic> T-bills) is the exemption of Eurodollar CDs from the Federal Reserve's “tax” via reserve requirements. An empirical section confirms the role of standard default risk, liquidity risk, and market “absorption” variables in determining short-term deviations from tax-adjusted parity. The taxadjusted parity condition, however, remains the major systematic and medium-term determinant—certainly more important than has been suggested previously in the literature.

Title: A General Derivation of the Jump Process Option Pricing Formula
Journal: Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis
Pages: 437-446
Issue: 04
Volume: 21

Abstract: The following paper presents a general derivation of the jump process option pricing formula. In particular, a general jump process formula is derived via an analysis of the limiting behavior of the binomial option pricing formula. In deriving the formula, a very simple central limit theorem known as Poisson's Limit Theorem is applied. The simplicity of the analysis allows the establishment of precisely the connections between the specification of the underlying binomial stock return process and the specific form of the corresponding continuous-time jump process formula. Several examples are provided to illustrate these connections.

Title: Using Jump-Diffusion Return Models to Measure Differential Information by Firm Size
Journal: Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis
Pages: 447-458
Issue: 04
Volume: 21
Year: 1986

Abstract: Portfolios of stocks issued by small firms are well known to earn rates of return in excess of those commensurate with their market sensitivities. One common explanation for this phenomenon is that small firm stocks are riskier than large firm stocks because less information is available about the former than about the latter. A necessary condition for such an explanation to be valid is that the information effect not be eliminated by combining the individual stocks into portfolios. This paper uses jump-diffusion return models to gauge the impact of information by firm size. The results show that portfolios of small firm stocks are no more prone to information surprises than are portfolios of large firm stocks. However, portfolios of small firm stocks are found to react more severely than portfolios of large firm stocks when surprises do occur.

Title: Financial Innovation: The Last Twenty Years and the Next
Journal: Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis

Month: December 
Abstract: The word revolution is entirely appropriate for describing the changes in financial institutions and instruments that have occurred in the past twenty years. The major impulses to successful financial innovations have come from regulations and taxes. The outlook for the future is for a slowing down of the rate of financial innovation, but much growth and improvement are still in prospect.
