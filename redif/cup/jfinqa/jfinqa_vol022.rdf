Title: Transaction Data Tests of the Mixture of Distributions Hypothesis
Journal: Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis
Pages: 127-141
Issue: 02
Volume: 22
Year: 1987
Month: June     
Abstract: This paper presents new tests of the mixture of distributions hypothesis. Previous tests examined security prices and volume measured only at daily intervals. Here, differential implications of the hypothesis for transaction data are derived and tested. The new predictions emanate from the assumption that prices and volume evolve at uniform rates in transaction time. The results support this assumption and the mixture of distributions hypothesis in general. In addition, the tests suggest that the daily transaction-count may be a useful instrumental variable for estimating unobserved realizations of stochastic price variances.

Title: Tests of an American Option Pricing Model on the Foreign Currency Options Market
Journal: Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis
Pages: 153-167
Issue: 02
Volume: 22
Year: 1987
Month: June     
Abstract: This paper tests the ability of the American option pricing model proposed by Parkinson [18] or Mason [14] to explain the pricing of the foreign currency options traded on the Philadelphia Stock Exchange from February 28, 1983 to March 26, 1985. We find that the model underprices out-of-the-money options relative to at-the-money and in-the-money options. This relative underpricing is driven by an underpricing of out-of-the-money call options of short maturity. In addition, the degree of relative mispricing for most categories of options is shown to be a decreasing function of the time to maturity of the options. Longer maturity options appear to trade at similar levels of implied volatility whether they are in, at, or out of the money. Most of these biases appear consistent with the fact that the underlying spot currency rate follows a mixed jump diffusion process as described in [17].

Title: Commodity Contracts and Common Stocks as Hedges against Relative Consumer Price Risk
Journal: Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis
Pages: 169-188
Issue: 02
Volume: 22
Year: 1987
Month: June     
Abstract: Evidence provided here suggests that investors could have identified, <italic>ex ante</italic>, portfolios that hedge against uncertainty in the prices of three major categories of consumption: food, shelter, and transportation. This finding has implications for the practical importance of multi-period capital asset pricing theories that assume investors can identify such hedge portfolios. The study also provides some surprising evidence about the usefulness of common stocks and commodity futures contracts in hedging against specific price inflation. Certain combinations of common stocks serve as effective hedges, but combinations of commodity futures contracts contribute nothing to hedging ability.

Abstract: This paper studies the impact of market consolidation or fragmentation on its performance, examining four alternative models of exchange: a consolidated clearing house, fragmented clearing houses, a monopoly dealer market, and an interdealer market. The effects of the market mechanism on the expected quantity traded, the price variance faced by individual traders, the quality of market price signals, the expected gains from trade, and the exchange implementation costs are studied.

Title: An Optimal Financial Response to Variable Demand
Journal: Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis
Pages: 209-225
Issue: 02
Volume: 22
Year: 1987
Month: June     
Abstract: This paper develops a positive theory of trade credit based on its use as a financial response to deterministic variations in demand. The operating alternatives to trade credit, which include the use of storage or additional capacity, are modeled using results from the peak-load pricing literature. The paper shows that the extension of credit partitions the buyer's inventory cost and permits specialization at incurring the components of this cost. This specialization is economical when the seller has an advantage at incurring the financial cost <italic>and</italic> does not have an advantage at incurring the operating cost of accommodating variable demand. Conditions that provide these necessary and sufficient cost relationships are described. The paper also shows that a reduction in costs rather than an increase in revenues is the source of both the buyer's and seller's increase in wealth.

Title: Risk Decomposition: Variance or Standard Deviation—A Reexamination and Extension
Journal: Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis
Pages: 237-247
Issue: 02
Volume: 22
Year: 1987
Month: June     
Abstract: This paper reexamines and extends the work of Ben Horim and Levy [1], which argued that risk decomposition should be based on standard deviation rather than on variance. Their analysis showed that decomposition of variance is wrong when β < 0 and that, in general, this procedure produces incorrect estimates of undiversifiable risk. This paper shows that these conclusions also apply to the no-risk-free asset extended CAPM if risk is adjusted for the unavoidable risk associated with the global minimum variance portfolio.

Month: June     
Abstract: Our paper extends prior work on abandonment and replacement policies by analyzing the effects of both the Darby and the Fisher interest rate hypotheses. In most of the new cases developed, the effect of increased inflation on economic life is ambiguous. In the abandonment problem, we find a greater tendency under the Fisher hypothesis than under the Darby hypothesis for increased inflation to result in an extension of economic life. In contrast, for the replacement problem, there is a greater tendency under the Fisher hypothesis (than under Darby) for inflation to shorten the asset holding period.

Volume: 22
Year: 1987
Month: September
Abstract: We construct a simple economy with consumption only at the final date in which we “endogenize” the stochastic behavior of prices assumed in the Black-Scholes model. Certain preferences (constant proportional risk aversion) and beliefs are shown to be sufficient and necessary, in certain respects, for the existence of such an equilibrium. The analysis is then generalized to a continuous-consumption framework, in which we embed the Merton proportional dividend model.

Title: Equilibrium under Uncertain Inflation: A Discrete Time Approach
Journal: Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis
Pages: 285-297
Issue: 03
Volume: 22
Year: 1987
Month: September
Abstract: Most research dealing with portfolio selection under uncertain inflation is carried out by assuming either one of the following two approximations: a linear or a quadratic approximation. In this paper, we analyze the general case, namely assume that the nominal return is the product of the real return and one plus the rate of inflation. We demonstrate that the general analysis leads to the following results that are not found in the two approximations: (1) even if we assume that nominal returns are independent of inflation, the nominal and real efficient sets will not necessarily coincide. Mean-Variance (M-V) analysis leads to a nominal efficient set, that is, a subset of the real M-V efficient set, whereas the opposite holds assuming investors maximize expected utility of real wealth. (2) Similar results are obtained when real returns are independent of inflation (the Fisher hypothesis). Assuming normality of nominal returns, we derive the CAPM in real terms or its zero beta counterpart.

Volume: 22
Year: 1987
Month: September
Abstract: This paper examines the demand for municipal bond insurance in the context of a competitive signaling equilibrium model. The study compares the pricing of new bond issues that are insured to similar issues that are not insured. The results indicate that issuers who purchase bond insurance, on average, are able to reduce their new issue borrowing cost more than enough to offset the cost of the insurance premium. Furthermore, the net benefit to the issuer increases as the underlying credit quality of the bond declines.

Title: Optimal Managerial Incentive Contracts and the Value of Corporate Insurance
Journal: Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis
Pages: 315-328
Issue: 03
Volume: 22
Year: 1987
Month: September
Abstract: This paper investigates the impact of managerial hedging on shareholder wealth when managers are able to choose the level of effort they expend in managing firms' investments. We demonstrate that shareholders will prefer managers to hedge observable unsystematic risks because they expect that this will induce managers to be more productive. We begin with the case where the risk being hedged is independent of managerial effort. In this case, we show that if shareholders are able to adjust incentive contracts either in anticipation of hedging or after observing hedging, but before managers expend effort, then they will benefit from that hedging. When the insurable risk is also dependent on managerial effort, then we have what we term an “embedded moral hazard” problem. In this case, the optimal contract may entail either over or under insurance by the manager, relative to that preferred by shareholders.

Journal: Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis

Issue: 03
Volume: 22
Year: 1987
Month: September
Abstract: This paper argues that an aggregate preferred habitat for investors exists on (or about) the last day of the calendar month, due to standardizations in the nation's payments system resulting in a concentrated flow of funds on this date. Thus, equilibrium yield discounts are predicted for securities maturing on such dates. Empirical tests on monthly and daily Treasury bill data support the principal hypothesis, as well as several ancillary hypotheses. The results have implications for Treasury debt management, for the short-term cash and debt management practices of businesses and banks, and for the empirical estimation of daily, weekly, or monthly return premiums on risky securities.

Title: The Influence of Market Conditions on Event-Study Residuals
Journal: Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis
Pages: 345-351
Issue: 03
Volume: 22
Year: 1987
Month: September
Abstract: This paper presents evidence that the mean-adjusted returns and raw-market returns models are misspecified when the event under investigation occurs during either bull or bear markets. To demonstrate this phenomenon, simulation techniques as well as an actual event are employed to examine the reliability of four different return-generating models. When the event occurs during a bull (bear) market, both the mean-adjusted and raw-market returns models produce upwardly (downwardly) biased positive (negative) abnormal returns. This results in statistically significant cumulative abnormal returns over selected preevent and postevent intervals. In contrast, both the market-adjusted and single-index models show far less evidence of any unusual price activity over these same intervals.

Abstract: We show that a well-diversified portfolio of randomly chosen stocks must include at least 30 stocks for a borrowing investor and 40 stocks for a lending investor. This contradicts the widely accepted notion that the benefits of diversification are virtually exhausted when a portfolio contains approximately 10 stocks. We also contrast our result with the levels of diversification found in studies of individuals' portfolios.

Abstract: This paper demonstrates that the impact of the existing tax law is not uniform across projects with different variances of payoffs. A bias exists against projects with greater uncertainty of payoffs, which leads to an underinvestment in high risk projects. The bias against higher variance projects offers a theoretical justification for such tax incentives as the research and development tax credit.

Abstract: This paper points out an error and implications of the error in the model of hedging effectiveness proposed by Howard and D'Antonio (1). The error would lead to ambiguous results if the model were used in practical applications to select the best hedging instrument. This paper proposes a new measure of hedging effectiveness that eliminates the error in the original model and resolves the ambiguity.
