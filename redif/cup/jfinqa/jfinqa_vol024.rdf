Title: The Pricing of Stock Index Options in a General Equilibrium Model
Journal: Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis
Pages: 1-12
Issue: 01
Volume: 24
Year: 1989
Month: March    
Abstract: This paper analyzes the pricing of stock index options in a simple general equilibrium model. In this model, the volatility of the stock index and the spot rate of interest are functions of a stochastic variable. The paper investigates the biases that arise when using the Black-Scholes model with the assumed volatility and interest rate dynamics. It is shown that the model can, in principle, explain the biases observed in empirical work on stock index options.

Title: All Roads Lead to Risk Preference: A Turnpike Theorem for Conditionally Independent Returns
Journal: Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis
Pages: 13-28
Issue: 01
Volume: 24
Year: 1989
Month: March    
Abstract: An individual is repeatedly offered the opportunity to invest in a risky asset whose return distribution is unknown. Because the return distribution is constant over time, however, he is able to learn about that distribution by observing investment outcomes. Results are presented regarding the asymptotically optimal investment behavior of a risk-averse individual under these circumstances when his aim is to maximize the expected utility of his end-of-horizon wealth. For the class of isoelastic utility functions with constant relative risk averson less than one, the optimal investment approaches a constant proportion of wealth. The limiting proportion is the same as the proportion put up by the most optimistic individual when the investment opportunity is offered only once. These results are then extended by generalizing the class of utility functions under consideration and, at the same time, restricting the class of possible investment schemes. This paper is distinguished from the previous literature by the assumption of conditional independence of returns across periods.

Title: Stock Returns as Predictors of Interest Rates and Inflation
Journal: Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis
Pages: 47-58
Issue: 01
Volume: 24
Year: 1989
Month: March    
Abstract: This study examines whether stock returns provide forecasts of changes in interest rates and inflation. In contrast to earlier work that indicated that changes in expected inflation negatively affect stock returns, we find a statistically significant positive relation between stock returns and future inflation rate changes as well as a significant positive relation between stock returns and future interest rate changes. Real estate investment trusts, which are particularly interest- and inflation-sensitive securities, provide better forecasts than a broad market index. Finally, we find that most of the evidence supporting the forecasting ability of stock returns occurs in the October 1979 to October 1982 period when the Federal Reserve Board chose not to counteract interest rate changes.

Title: Seasonal Fluctuations in Industrial Production and Stock Market Seasonals
Journal: Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis
Pages: 59-74
Issue: 01
Volume: 24
Year: 1989
Month: March    
Abstract: February and August peaks in the growth rates of the seasonally unadjusted Industrial Production Index follow the stock market peaks documented by Rozeff and Kinney (1976) by one month. Coefficients on one-month lead growth rates in industrial production for small firms are positive and significant in time-series regressions even in the presence of the market factor. Moreover, whereas returns on large firms' stocks unidirectionally Granger cause (i.e., predict) future growth rates in industrial production at least six months in advance, returns on small firms' stocks reflect one-month lead as well as past growth rates in industrial production. For these reasons, we argue that seasonal real growth provides a partial explanation for the January stock seasonal among small firms.

Title: Market-Making in Initial Public Offerings of Common Stocks:An Empirical Analysis
Journal: Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis
Pages: 75-90
Issue: 01
Volume: 24
Year: 1989
Month: March    
Abstract: In this paper, we examine the behavior of the bid-ask spreads of initial public offerings of common stocks (IPOs) in the over-the-counter market. We find that, in the initial aftermarket, the quoted percentage bid-ask spreads for IPOs are, on average, about threefourths as large as those for seasoned stocks. A cross-sectional and time-series simultaneous equations analysis indicates that significant differences in the IPO and seasoned spreads persist for eight weeks in the aftermarket. Further, we find that the lower IPO spreads stem from their differential elasticities with respect to the determinants of bid-ask spreads and volume as well as from significant differences in the levels of these determinants.

Title: On the Call Provision in Corporate Zero-Coupon Bonds
Journal: Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis
Pages: 91-103
Issue: 01
Volume: 24
Year: 1989
Month: March    
Abstract: A majority of corporate zero-coupon bonds includes a call provision, giving the firm the right to call the bond at par value. In this paper, we investigate whether or not it is optimal for the firm to call such a bond for refunding purposes, taking into consideration the effect of corporate taxes. We find that it is not optimal to refund the bond as long as the corporate tax rate is less than 50 percent. We find that a significantly higher proportion of callable zero-coupon bonds, compared to noncallables, has restrictive financing covenants, suggesting that the call feature is included to provide flexibility at a low cost for future recapitalizations as the firm's investment opportunities change.

Title: The Distribution of Futures Prices: A Test of the Stable Paretian and Mixture of Normals Hypotheses
Journal: Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis
Pages: 105-116
Issue: 01
Volume: 24
Year: 1989

Abstract: Two alternate hypotheses, the stable Paretian and mixture of normals, have been proposed to explain the observed thick-tailed distributions of futures price movements. The two hypotheses are tested by applying the stability-under-addition test of stable distribution parameters to twenty lengthy time series of changes in daily closing futures prices. Tests are conducted on both the original data series and randomized data. The results offer support for the mixture of normals hypothesis.

Title: An Equilibrium Model of Asset Pricing with Progressive Personal Taxes
Journal: Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis
Pages: 117-127
Issue: 01
Volume: 24
Year: 1989
Month: March    
Abstract: This paper examines how the progressive personal tax rate affects the equilibrium asset pricing model. In a continuous-time framework with progressive taxation, it can be shown that the expected excess rate of return on a risky asset is an increasing function of (i) the covariance of asset return with aggregate consumption rate changes, and (ii) the covariance of asset return with the aggregation of individual wealth change, weighted by the investor's tax scheme progressivity index. The capital asset pricing model derived in the absence of tax is shown to understate the expected excess rate of return and to have a misspecification error under the progressive tax scheme. Furthermore, the expected excess rate of return can be decomposed as the consumption risk premium and tax premium. The tax premium depends on the tax structure prevailing in the economy.

Abstract: We use the modified Black-Scholes model and a random variance option pricing model to study prices of European currency options traded in Geneva. The options, which cannot be exercised early, include calls and puts on the dollar/Swiss franc exchange rate. In the empirical analysis, we examine the model fit and the biases with respect to the strike price, time to maturity, and volatility. There is some evidence of mispricing and there are small gains available by trading with the random variance model.

Title: Asset Pricing in a Generalized Mean-Lower Partial Moment Framework: Theory and Evidence
Journal: Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis
Pages: 285-311
Issue: 03
Volume: 24
Year: 1989
Month: September
Abstract: A new asset pricing model that generalizes earlier results in the downside risk literature is developed and empirically tested using a multivariate approach. By specifying risk as deviations below <italic>any</italic> arbitrary target rate of return, the generalized Mean-Lower Partial Moment (MLPM) model overcomes the limited appeal of earlier formulations, and, moreover, a large class of extant pricing models using alternative risk measures (variance, semivariance, semideviation, probability of loss, etc.) becomes special cases of the new framework. Empirical tests indicate that the new model cannot be rejected against an unspecified alternative for a large set of target rates of return. The traditional CAPM, on the other hand, is rejected as a well-specified alternative. The MLPM target rates inferred from market data appear to be related to equity market mean returns rather than to the riskfree rate, the target rate that is <italic>implicit</italic> in the CAPM and <italic>explicit</italic> in earlier downside risk formulations.

Title: Determinants of Hedging and Risk Premia in Commodity Futures Markets
Journal: Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis
Pages: 313-331
Issue: 03
Volume: 24
Year: 1989
Month: September
Abstract: This paper examines the determinants of commodity futures hedging and of risk premia arising from covariation of the futures price with stock market returns, and with the revenues of producers. Owing to supply shocks that stochastically redistribute real wealth (surplus) between producers and consumers, and to limited participation in the futures market, the total risk premium in the model is not proportional to the contract's covariance with aggregate consumption. Stock market variability interacts with the incentive to hedge, causing the producer hedging component of the risk premium to increase (decrease) with income elasticity, for a normal (inferior) good. Production costs that depend on output raise the premium. We argue that output and demand shocks will typically be positively correlated, raising the premium. High supply elasticity reduces the absolute heding premium by reducing the variability of spot price and revenue.

Issue: 03
Volume: 24
Year: 1989

Abstract: This paper provides a simple method to account for heteroskedasticity and cross-sectional dependence in samples with large cross sections and relatively few time-series observations. The method is motivated by cross-sectional regression studies in finance and accounting. Simulation evidence suggests that these estimators are dependable in small samples and may be useful when generalized least squares is infeasible, unreliable, or computationally too burdensome. We also consider efficiency issues and show that, in principle, asymptotic efficiency can be improved using a technique due to Cragg (1983).

Abstract: This paper examines rational expectations in the Treasury bill market from 1961 to 1988 with a risk premium specified to be proportional to the volatility of excess returns using instrumental variables. From 1961 to 1972 and from 1972 to 1979, rational expectations cannot be rejected, and both the predictive power of the yield curve and the risk premium are highly significant. By contrast, with just a constant risk premium and with a risk premium proxied by moving averages of absolute interest rate changes, rational expectations are rejected for each subperiod, and the yield curve has significant predictive information only from 1972 to 1979.

Abstract: This paper attempts to characterize liquidity-driven noise in the CRSP Government Bond price data set by comparing these price records to the independently collected Shearson Lehman Brothers (SLB) Bond Data Base. We argue that discrepancies between the data sets are due largely to liquidity-driven price errors, and we show that they are systematically related to certain bond characteristics. On the other hand, these discrepancies are small in magnitude and are approximately mean zero. We examine data filters based on observable bond characteristics and show that these filters can reduce the noise in price records while preserving their mean zero nature. The effects of these errors on performance evaluation are investigated by comparing results using filtered and unfiltered data.

Issue: 03
Volume: 24
Year: 1989
Month: September
Abstract: Critics claim that theories of secured debt fail to explain the widespread use of collateral because they incorrectly predict when a loan will be secured. This paper provides the first rigorous statistical test of the transaction cost models of secured debt. Data from two samples of over 1,000 small business loans generally support the common set of predictions of these theories. The incidence of secured debt is positively related to probability of default, loan size, loan maturity, and marketability of assets. Changes in the legal and economic environment also alter firms' decisions regarding the pledging of collateral.

Abstract: This paper examines the seasonal behavior of proportional dealer spreads for OTC NASDAQ common stocks. Results indicate there is seasonality in dealer spreads. Spreads tend to be larger in the second half of the calendar year, peaking in December. At the turn-ofthe-year, spreads tend to peak in mid- to late December and then recede during January. The last trading day in December produces the largest daily decline in spreads during the turn-of-the-year period.

Month: December 
Abstract: This paper examines the association between the <italic>initial</italic>adoption of stock options for senior-level executives and subsequent changes in corporate dividend policy. The primary research hypothesis is that the addition of a stock option to a manager's compensation package provides an incentive for the executive to reduce corporate dividends. This hypothesis follows from the observation that executive stock options are generally not “dividend protected.” The results suggest that dividends are reduced relative to expected dividends. We interpret these results as suggesting that the personal incentives of executives can affect certain aspects of the observed corporate dividend policy.

Title: Dynamic Recapitalization Policies and the Role of Call Premia and Issue Discounts
Journal: Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis
Pages: 427-446
Issue: 04
Volume: 24
Year: 1989
Month: December 
Abstract: In a dynamic framework, the advantage of leverage depends upon the firm's recapitalization policy. We show that if bonds are callable at par, then equityholders have an incentive to recapitalize too early. Call premia and issue discounts, however, mitigate the agency problem of early recapitalization. The model provides the optimal call premium and issue discount as a function of firm-specific characteristics. An analysis of a bond sample supports the model's prediction that the optimal call premium is positively related to firm risk.

Title: Pricing Stock and Bond Options when the Default-Free Rate is Stochastic
Journal: Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis
Pages: 447-457
Issue: 04
Volume: 24
Year: 1989
Month: December 
Abstract: We derive formulas for the valuation of call options on stocks and bonds when the defaultfree rate is stochastic. The formulas highlight the role of the correlation between the unanticipated returns on the underlying security and the changes in the short-term rate in determining the options value. Our numerical analysis indicates that option prices predicted by the proposed formula differ from those predicted by the Black and Scholes formula when this correlation is relatively large and the short-term rate's instantaneous variance is relatively large as well. Moreover, the proposed formula predicts higher (lower) stock option prices than those predicted by the Black and Scholes formula for correlation values that are lower (higher) than some positive critical value.

Title: Mergers, Executive Risk Reduction, and Stockholder Wealth
Journal: Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis
Pages: 459-472
Issue: 04
Volume: 24
Year: 1989
Month: December 
Abstract: Among the possible consequences of agency problems between corporate owners and managers is a tendency by managers to make investment decisions for their firms that are deliberately aimed at reducing firm risk, as a means to control managers’ personal wealth risk. The literature has suggested that such behavior may occur to the detriment of shareholder wealth, and that mergers may be a particular class of investment decisions for which the behavior would be observable. We test these hypotheses empirically, but find no evidence from our merger sample that risk reduction for the acquiring firm is the typical outcome nor that, when it occurs, it is differentially costly for shareholders.

Title: The Valuation of Forestry Resources under Stochastic Prices and Inventories
Journal: Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis
Pages: 473-487
Issue: 04
Volume: 24
Year: 1989
Month: December 
Abstract: A contingent claims approach to capital budgeting may be preferable to traditional methods where uncertainty and managers' strategic reactions to changing conditions are important. As an example of such a case, we solve the classical problem of the duration of an investment in forestry resources (i.e., when to cut down the trees) in the general case of stochastic output prices and stochastic natural growth rate and timber inventories. A contingent claims approach is used to value the forestry resources as a function of: (1) stochastic prices and inventories, and (2) an asymmetric, optimal production policy that incorporates the option to halt timber production temporarily.

Title: Assessing Credit Risk in a Financial Institution's Off-Balance Sheet Commitments
Journal: Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis
Pages: 489-501
Issue: 04
Volume: 24
Year: 1989
Month: December 
Abstract: The first part of this paper presents a general approach to valuing a financial institution's contracts when there is credit risk. The approach uses contingent claims pricing theory and is particularly appropriate for an off-balance sheet contract, such as a swap, that can have either a positive or a negative value to the counterparty. The second part of the paper extends the analysis by considering the problem, faced by bank supervisory authorities, of determining capital requirements for off-balance sheet contracts.

Title: Security Analyst Monitoring Activity: Agency Costs and Information Demands
Journal: Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis
Pages: 503-512
Issue: 04
Volume: 24
Year: 1989
Month: December 
Abstract: This paper explores the determinants of monitoring activity provided by security analysts. Jensen and Meckling have argued that analysts play the role of monitors of managerial performance as a means of reducing agency costs of debt and equity. The other major role analysts play is that of making security markets more informationally efficient. The empirical results reported in this paper support the role of analyst monitoring as an efficient device for controlling agency-related costs of debt and equity and as a response to the information demands of investors.

Title: Errors in Recorded Security Prices and the Turn-ofthe-Year Effect
Journal: Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis
Pages: 513-526
Issue: 04
Volume: 24
Year: 1989
Month: December 
Abstract: Errors in recorded security prices are a source of misspecification in the market model. If recorded price errors are sufficiently nonrandom, they result in biased returns and in biased and inconsistent estimates of market model regression coefficients. This paper argues that tax-induced flow-supply pressures cause end-of-the-year recorded price errors to be nonrandom enough to create the appearance of anomalous turn-of-the-year stock return behavior. Empirical tests of returns and market model regression coefficients during the turn-of-the-year period cannot reject this errors-in-variables explanation of the turn-ofthe-year effect.

Title: Black-Scholes Approximations of Call Option Prices with Stochastic Volatilities: A Note
Journal: Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis
Pages: 527-532
Issue: 04
Volume: 24
Year: 1989
Month: December 
Abstract: A piecewise linear weighting function for Black-Scholes implied volatilities is used in conjunction with the Black-Scholes call pricing model to approximate stochastic volatility European call prices. A sensitivity analysis is conducted to compare simulated stochastic volatility call prices to the Black-Scholes prices calculated with the weighted implied volatilities. The analysis indicates that a simple model can provide close approximations to the simulated prices with far less computational effort.

Abstract: An analysis of the dual problem described by Ronn (1987) reveals that it provides a powerful and easily interpretable test for the hypothesis of a single class of marginal investors, including models of equilibrium based on a “representative tax bracket.” When Ronn's empirical tests are interpreted via the dual, they lend additional support to his conclusions in providing a strong rejection of the representative tax bracket hypothesis. A valid dual LP used to test the hypothesis can be obtained with fewer assumptions than Ronn's primal; in addition, a minor error in Ronn's presentation of the dual is corrected.
