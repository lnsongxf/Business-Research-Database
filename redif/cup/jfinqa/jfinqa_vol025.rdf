Title: Large Shareholders and the Monitoring of Managers: The Case of Antitakeover Charter Amendments
Journal: Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis
Pages: 143-161
Issue: 02
Volume: 25
Year: 1990
Month: June     
Abstract: This paper examines the role of large shareholders in monitoring managers when they propose antitakeover charter amendments. We attempt to distinguish between two competing hypotheses: the “active monitoring hypothesis” and the “passive voting hypothesis.” We find a statistically significant positive relation between institutional ownership and the stockholder wealth effects of various types of amendments, after controlling for ownership concentration among institutions, managerial ownership, and firm size. Our empirical evidence lends support to the “active monitoring hypothesis” proposed by Demsetz (1983) and Shleifer and Vishny (1986) that the existence of large shareholders leads to better monitoring of managers.

Title: Multivariate Tests of Asset Pricing: The Comparative Power of Alternative Statistics
Journal: Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis
Pages: 163-185
Issue: 02
Volume: 25
Year: 1990
Month: June     
Abstract: This paper examines estimation issues associated with multivariate tests of asset pricing. Two issues are considered: (1) the constraint that the sample size (<italic>N</italic>) must be less than the time series (<italic>T</italic>), and (2) the relative effect on power of using the multivariate statistic versus a univariate counterpart. We find that an alternative statistic that allows for large <italic>N</italic> does not dominate the usual portfolio tests. More notably, we find that the power of a simple diagonal statistic usually dominates the multivariate statistic for cases considered in this study.

Title: Stock Return Seasonalities and Earnings Information
Journal: Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis
Pages: 187-201
Issue: 02
Volume: 25
Year: 1990
Month: June     
Abstract: Previous literature documents significant seasonalities in stock market returns. One explanation is seasonality in earnings information. If true, a return index comprised solely of firms reporting earnings should exhibit stronger intertemporal seasonalities than a return index comprised of firms not reporting earnings. Employing all New York and American Stock Exchange firms over six years, this study examines the seasonality of stock returns. Generally, seasonal patterns for reporting returns are found to be similar to or slightly weaker than for nonreporting returns. Thus, it is doubtful that earnings news seasonality induces stock return seasonality.

Title: Stock Returns and Volatility
Journal: Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis
Pages: 203-214
Issue: 02
Volume: 25
Year: 1990
Month: June     
Abstract: Most asset pricing models postulate a positive relationship between a stock portfolio's expected returns and risk, which is often modeled by the variance of the asset price. This paper uses GARCH in mean models to examine the relationship between mean returns on a stock portfolio and its conditional variance or standard deviation. After estimating a variety of models from daily and monthly portfolio return data, we conclude that any relationship between mean returns and own variance or standard deviation is weak. The results suggest that investors consider some other risk measure to be more important than the variance of portfolio returns.

Title: An Algorithm for Computing Values of Options on the Maximum or Minimum of Several Assets
Journal: Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis
Pages: 215-227
Issue: 02
Volume: 25
Year: 1990
Month: June     
Abstract: An approximate method is developed for computing the values of European options on the maximum or the minimum of several assets. The method is very fast and is accurate for parameter ranges that are often of the most interest. The approach casts the problem in terms of order statistics and can be used to handle situations where the initial asset prices, the asset variances, and the covariances are all unequal. Numerical values are given to illustrate the accuracy of the method.

Title: Informative Conversion Ratios: A Signalling Approach
Journal: Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis
Pages: 229-243
Issue: 02
Volume: 25
Year: 1990
Month: June     
Abstract: The paper uses a signalling equilibrium to explain the market's reaction to the announcement of a firm's financing decision. In our model, a firm can issue one of the following securities: convertible debt with a different conversion ratio, straight debt, and stock. We identify conditions under which the conversion ratio of a convertible debt issue serves as a credible signal of a firm's private information, given the continuous distribution of attributes (information) across firms. In this signalling equilibrium, we find that the lower the expected future earnings, the higher the conversion ratio of a convertible debt issue. At the limit, firms that expect the highest earnings will use straight debt financing, and firms that expect the lowest earnings will use equity financing. Based on the signalling equilibrium, we predict that at announcement of a convertible debt issue, negative abnormal common stock return increases in absolute value with the conversion ratio.

Title: Shelf Registration and the Reduced Due Diligence Argument: Implications of the Underwriter Certification and the Implicit Insurance Hypotheses
Journal: Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis
Pages: 245-259
Issue: 02
Volume: 25
Year: 1990
Month: June     
Abstract: Critics argue that shelf registration greatly reduces the ability of underwriters to perform adequate due diligence. This argument suggests underwriters will demand greater compensation for shelf issues compared to such traditional issues as an insurance premium for protection against potential litigation or loss of reputation caused by inadequate due diligence. Our findings suggest the presence of such a premium, that the premium is higher for firms with higher expected due diligence liabilities, and that underwriters perceive that shelf registration erodes due diligence and, subsequently, price the due diligence erosion accordingly. This pricing behavior is consistent with our findings that firms with higher expected due diligence liabilities are more likely to choose traditional registration.

Title: An Empirical Analysis of Common Stock Delistings
Journal: Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis
Pages: 261-272
Issue: 02
Volume: 25
Year: 1990
Month: June     
Abstract: This paper presents an empirical analysis of firms that are delisted from a major stock exchange. The delisting process is described and stock price movements surrounding delisting are analyzed. For firms with prior announcements, equity values decline by approximately 8.5 percent on announcement day. For firms without prior announcements, a similar adjustment takes place between the last day of trading in the initial market and the close of the first day of trading in the new market. Four hypotheses concerning the decline in firm value are examined. These are the liquidity hypothesis, the management signalling hypothesis, the exchange certification hypothesis, and the downward sloping demand curve hypothesis. Evidence consistent with the liquidity hypothesis is presented in the paper. Unlike evidence on stock exchange listings, returns in the post-delisting period do not appear to be anomalous.

Title: Short Interest: Explanations and Tests
Journal: Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis
Pages: 273-289
Issue: 02
Volume: 25
Year: 1990
Month: June     
Abstract: Cross-sectional and time series tests are performed to explain levels and changes in short interest. Explanatory variables and tests are chosen based on tax, arbitrage, and speculative reasons for going short. Short interest is found to follow a seasonal pattern that is weakly consistent with tax-based trading. Stocks with high betas and the existence of convertible securities or options tend to have higher levels of short interest, which is consistent with arbitrage efforts. For firms with traded options, there is a positive association between the month-to-month changes in option open interest and short interest. Prior months' returns and changes in short interest are positively related, but there is no relationship between changes in short interest and returns in the subsequent month.

Abstract: This paper studies the binomial approximation to the continuous trading term structure model of Heath, Jarrow, and Morton (1987). The discrete time approximation makes the original methodology accessible to a wider audience, and provides a computational procedure necessary for calculating the contingent claim values derived in the continuous time paper. This paper also extends and generalizes Ho and Lee's (1986) model to include multiple random shocks to the forward rate process and to include an analysis of continuous time limits. The generalization provides insights into the limitations of the existing empirical implementation of Ho and Lee's model.

Journal: Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis

Issue: 04
Volume: 25
Year: 1990
Month: December 
Abstract: In rational, efficiently functioning markets, the returns on stock index and stock index futures contracts should be perfectly, contemporaneously correlated. This study investigates the time series properties of 5-minute, intraday returns of stock index and stock index futures contracts, and finds that S&P 500 and MM index futures returns tend to lead stock market returns by about five minutes, on average, but occasionally as long as 10 minutes or more, even after stock index returns have been purged of infrequent trading effects; however, the effect is not completely unidirectional, with lagged stock index returns having a mild positive predictive impact on futures returns.

Month: December 
Abstract: In a credit market characterized by a priori asymmetric information, collateral not only can identify credit applicants but also can result in moral hazard involving the borrower's use of pledged assets. The borrower's other alternatives are to apply for unsecured bank credit and be priced as “average,” or to acquire financing by selling an asset and subsequently renting it for continued use. The optimal secured loan contract for higher quality firms is shown to involve overcollateralization. There is underinvestment relative to first best in maintenance of the pledged assets but overinvestment relative to the level that would be chosen without bank monitoring. Self-financing and unsecured credit are chosen by the intermediate and lowest quality groups, respectively.

Title: Valuation Effects of Greenmail Prohibitions
Journal: Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis
Pages: 491-505
Issue: 04
Volume: 25
Year: 1990
Month: December 
Abstract: Greenmail payments are widely viewed as actions designed by managers to perpetuate their tenure in office. This view, which suggests that greenmail prohibitions would enhance shareholder wealth, receives mixed empirical support in this paper. The average market reaction to charter amendments prohibiting greenmail payments is weakly negative, suggesting there is a value to maintaining managerial flexibility. Nonlinear maximum likelihood estimation, however, reveals a strong positive correlation between the market reaction and the firm's abnormal stock price runup over the three months just prior to the proxy mailing date. For the subsample of firms with a relatively large prior runup, the precommitment not to pay greenmail is value enhancing. If the prior runup reflects takeover rumors, then this evidence is consistent with the proposition that greenmail payments amidst takeover speculations are value decreasing.

Abstract: This paper demonstrates that Black-Scholes option pricing model hedge positions that are risk free when rebalanced continuously will frequently exhibit substantial systematic risk when rebalanced at finite intervals. This systematic risk may have biased important empirical tests of the option pricing model. Moreover, this systematic risk means that the Black-Scholes option pricing model is inherently inconsistent with the discrete time version of the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM).

Title: Stock Market Seasonals and Prespecified Multifactor Pricing Relations

Abstract: Despite nonstationarities in the factor betas and factor prices of the Chen, Roll, Ross (1986) multifactor model, investors are rewarded for bearing risks associated with the change in expected inflation and industrial production in non-January months; however, variations in these factors have opposite influences on stock prices. These findings may partially explain why several recent studies fail to detect a significant non-January risk premium in the stock market, but this evidence is only suggestive since theoretical and statistical difficulties prevent precise interpretations of specific pricing relations in the Chen, Roll, Ross model.

Title: Price Reversals, Bid-Ask Spreads, and Market Efficiency

Abstract: We examine the behavior of common stock prices after a large change in price occurs during a single trading day and find evidence that the stock market appears to have overreacted, especially in the case of price declines; however, the magnitude of the overreaction is small compared to the bid-ask spreads observed for the individual stocks in the sample. We interpret this finding as being consistent with a market that is efficient after transactions costs are considered.

Title: Stock Returns before and after Calls of Convertible Bonds
Journal: Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis
Pages: 549-554
Issue: 04
Volume: 25
Year: 1990
Month: December 
Abstract: Ofer and Natarajan (1987) report negative, statistically significant cumulative average abnormal returns over five years following convertible bond calls. We show that these results are obtained only if returns preceding the call dates are used for market model parameter estimation. Returns preceding calls tend to be positive and unusually large. This means that predicted post-call returns, based on pre-call parameter estimates, are biased upward. Consequently, the corresponding abnormal returns are biased downward. We also discuss a corrected test statistic. We conclude that the evidence does not indicate market inefficiency in the stock price reaction to convertible calls.
