Title: Currency Option Pricing with Stochastic Domestic and Foreign Interest Rates
Journal: Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis
Pages: 139-151
Issue: 02
Volume: 26
Year: 1991
Month: June     
Abstract: This study develops a currency option pricing model under stochastic interest rates when interest rate parity holds, and it is assumed that domestic and foreign bond prices have local variances that depend only on time. We demonstrate how existing currency option models are simply derived from one framework. Empirical tests employing transactions option data reveal that a particularly simple form of the stochastic rate model is uniformly more accurate than a constant rate model for all boundaries and maturities tested.

Month: June     
Abstract: This paper describes the application of a convergence acceleration technique to the binomial option pricing model. The resulting model, termed the accelerated binomial option pricing model, also can be viewed as an approximation to the Geske-Johnson model for the value of the American put. The new model is accurate and faster than the conventional binomial model. It is applicable to a wide range of option pricing problems.

Title: Financial Signalling by Committing to Cash Outflows
Journal: Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis
Pages: 165-180
Issue: 02
Volume: 26
Year: 1991
Month: June     
Abstract: We analyze a model in which firms signal their quality by using financial policies to commit to cash outflows. Two financial policies may be used: dividend and debt-service obligations. We find sufficient conditions for the informational equilibrium to entail concommitant use of both dividends and leverage in the cost-minimizing combination of the commitment signal. In this equilibrium, better firms pay higher dividends and are more highly levered than lower quality firms.

Title: Information Asymmetry and Equity Issues
Journal: Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis

Issue: 02
Volume: 26
Year: 1991
Month: June     
Abstract: The paper examines the relevance of information asymmetry between the managers of the firm and the market for the equity issue process. It uses four proxies for information asymmetry and presents three groups of tests: cross-sectional regressions of the reaction at equity issue announcements, comparisons of information asymmetry before and after the announcements, and analyses of the timing behavior observed during the equity issue process. The results show that information asymmetry is a significant variable for equity issues.

Title: The Call, Sinking Fund, and Term-To-Maturity Features of Corporate Bonds: An Empirical Investigation
Journal: Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis
Pages: 201-222
Issue: 02
Volume: 26
Year: 1991
Month: June     
Abstract: Do bond-issuing firms attempt to choose the call, sinking fund, and term-to-maturity features of bonds to improve shareholder wealth? This paper develops and tests two hypotheses about the determinants of bond features using a conditional logistic model. The model is estimated on a sample of bonds issued between 1982 and 1986. Model estimates show that a bond's call, sinking fund, and term-to-maturity features are statistically related to the issuing firm's retention ratio, ratio of convertible to long-term debt, two-year change in net operating income, and whether the firm is listed on the NYSE and included in the S&P400. These findings support the view that firms financing highquality projects, but facing information asymmetries, choose shorter-term (medium-term) callable bonds with and without the sinking fund feature.

Title: The Multi-Period CAPM and the Valuation of Multi-Period Stochastic Cash Flows
Journal: Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis
Pages: 223-231
Issue: 02
Volume: 26
Year: 1991
Month: June     
Abstract: This paper develops a valuation formula for multi-period stochastic cash flows consistent with rational risk-averse investor behavior and equilibrium in securities markets. It shows that the CAPM does not have to be sequentially applied in discounting of the cash flows of multi-period projects, and a single beta can be used to measure the riskiness of an uncertain income stream. Hence, a multi-period project is priced as if it offers a single payment. The formula uses a set of assumptions that is slightly more restrictive than the minimum set Constantinides (1980) uses to produce the multi-period version of the CAPM. This paper also demonstrates that, under certain assumptions, covariances of stochastic cash flows with changes in the term structure may be sufficient measures of the cash flows' riskiness.

Title: Share Repurchase as a Takeover Defense
Journal: Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis
Pages: 233-244
Issue: 02
Volume: 26
Year: 1991
Month: June     
Abstract: This paper presents a model in which managers of firms that are takeover targets use debt-financed share repurchase to bond themselves to reduce perquisite consumption and increase investment in the firm. The resulting value increase makes the firm a less attractive target. The optimal level of share repurchase is the result of a trade-off between the benefit of a reduced probability of takeover and the cost of an increased probability of bankruptcy. Unlike earlier explanations of defensive repurchases, which are based on information signalling or control of voting rights, this explanation is independent of the extent of shareholding by target management.

Title: Testing the Unbiased Forward Rate Hypothesis: Evidence on Unit Roots, Co-Integration, and Stochastic Coefficients
Journal: Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis
Pages: 245-267
Issue: 02
Volume: 26
Year: 1991
Month: June     
Abstract: In this paper, we demonstrate that the conflicting results found in the literature of tests of the unbiased forward rate hypothesis (UFRH) depend upon the econometric specification used as well as differences in the time period of estimation. It is established that the time series properties of spot and forward exchange rate data rule out certain econometric specifications used to test the UFRH. Specifically, we find that both spot and forward exchange rates for the U.K., Germany, Japan, and Canada have unit roots and are cointegrated. We also find that the co-integrating parameter in the regression of realized spot on forward rates for each currency is approximately one, implying that researchers who use this specification to test the UFRH may falsely accept the hypothesis simply because of the specification used in the test. Using an alternative error correction specification, we find that the UFRH is resoundingly rejected for all currencies and that the coefficients in this specification exhibit temporal instability. More importantly, we find that the evolution of the estimated parameters is becoming increasingly inconsistent with the UFRH with the passage of time. We conclude the paper with an investigation into potential causes for the gross violation of the UFRH.

Title: Seasonality in Daily Bond Returns
Journal: Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis
Pages: 269-285
Issue: 02
Volume: 26
Year: 1991
Month: June     
Abstract: This paper tests for seasonal patterns in corporate bond returns using the Dow Jones Composite Bond Average. Each seasonal pattern documented for equities is investigated. For the period 1963–1986, corporate bond returns exhibit January, turn-of-the-year, and weekof-the-month effects, but no significant day-of-the-week or turn-of-the-month effects. In contrast, for the S&P 500 stock index, the turn-of-the-month and day-of-the-week effects are highly significant, but the week-of-the-month effect is less significant, and the January and turn-of-the-year effects are insignificant. The behavior of an equity index constructed using companies in the bond index is similar to that of the S&P, except the turn-of-the-year effect is significant.

Journal: Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis
Pages: 435-443
Issue: 04
Volume: 26
Year: 1991
Month: December 
Abstract: This paper derives a new and intuitive estimation procedure for the term structure under potential tax arbitrage. No a priori assumptions regarding the equality of the prices and present values of bonds are made. The data are employed to determine whether this equality holds, and an appropriate estimator is thereby endogenously derived. The suggested estimator is based on the optimizing behavior of an investor in a market with frictions, and emerges directly from the solution of the dual of the no-arbitrage optimization problem. In addition, the proposed estimator benefits from being both theoretically sound and straightforward to apply.

Abstract: This study examines the hypothesis that in the presence of market frictions, relative put and call prices contain information concerning future returns of the underlying asset. A measure of relative prices is derived from the put-call parity relationship for index options and applied to a three-year sample of OEX option transactions. The results show that the measure of relative index option prices leads the stock market by at least 15 minutes.

Abstract: This paper examines the pricing of S&P 100 calls using 14 months of transactions data. We find that market prices of S&P 100 calls differ systematically from Black-Scholes values. The biases in Black-Scholes model prices are both statistically and economically significant and correspond to biases that arise if market prices incorporate a stochastically changing volatility of the index.

Journal: Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis
Pages: 477-495
Issue: 04
Volume: 26
Year: 1991
Month: December 
Abstract: We develop a class of discrete, path-independent models to compute prices of American options within the Black-Scholes (1973) framework, including models in which state variables have time-varying volatility functions and models with multiple state variables. Time-varying volatility functions are illustrated with applications to term structure models developed by Vasicek (1977) and Heath, Jarrow, and Morton (1988), (1990). Distinct from previous work in the literature, the multivariate models suggested in this paper are consistent with arbitrarily large, though constant, covariance functions. Finally, we compare and contrast the numerical accuracy of a large number of models with simulation results.

Abstract: This study examines initial public offering contract choice decisions. In best-efforts offerings, minimum sales constraints allow issuers to precommit to withdraw the offering if a fixed minimum number of shares is not sold. In firm-commitment offerings, the over-allotment option allows the underwriter to increase sales when demand is strong. Two theories of contract choice–Benveniste and Spindt (1989) and Ritter's (1987) extension of Rock (1986)–offer predictions about the role of these contract features. We find that the 1977–1982 evidence is consistent with Benveniste and Spindt (1989). The evidence is less supportive of the Ritter (1987) hypothesis that minimum sales constraints serve to reduce the winner's curse of the riskier issuers.

Title: Forward Contracts and Firm Value: Investment Incentive and Contracting Effects
Journal: Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis
Pages: 519-532
Issue: 04
Volume: 26
Year: 1991
Month: December 
Abstract: Corporate risk hedging with forward contracts increases value by reducing incentives to underinvest. This occurs because the hedge decreases the sensitivity of senior claim value to incremental investment, allowing equity holders to capture a larger portion of the incremental benefit from new investment. Hedging also allows the firm to credibly commit to meet obligations in states where it otherwise could not, which improves contract terms the firm can negotiate with customers, creditors, and managers. These benefits cannot be duplicated by individual hedging, and each result holds independent of agents' risk preferences.

Title: The Relevance of Fiduciary Conflict-of-Interests in Control versus Issue Proxy Contests
Journal: Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis
Pages: 533-547
Issue: 04
Volume: 26
Year: 1991
Month: December 
Abstract: The role of fiduciaries with conflicting interests has received considerable attention recently. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the role of a fiduciary casting votes under conflicting interests in proxy contests that seek to control the corporation and those waged solely for the purpose of deciding an issue. By deriving comparisons across types of contests, we provide implications concerning differences in success probabilities and resolution effects for the two types of contests. The empirical verification (refutation) of such effects would provide insight regarding the (ir)relevance of fiduciary conflict-of-interests in proxy contests.

Title: The Stock Price Effect of Risky versus Safe Debt
Journal: Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis
Pages: 549-558
Issue: 04
Volume: 26
Year: 1991
Month: December 
Abstract: This paper tests whether there is a difference in the stock price reactions to industrial straight debt offerings of different risk. Using bond ratings at the time of announcement as a measure of risk, we find that there is no monotonic relation between stock price impact and rating and no statistically significant difference across risk classes, even though the sample includes low-rated debt issues from recent years. This confirms earlier evidence on straight debt issues, but differs from the evidence on convertible securities. The paper also finds that the results for straight debt are not affected by shelf registrations or by the issuing firms' involvement in merger and acquisition-related activity.

Title: Macroeconomic Forces, Systematic Risk, and Financial Variables: An Empirical Investigation
Journal: Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis
Pages: 559-564
Issue: 04
Volume: 26
Year: 1991
Month: December 
Abstract: This paper assesses the ability of financial statement variables to forecast sensitivities to systematic risk factors generated by a multifactor, macroeconomic forces model. Forecasts of beta derived from financial variables are shown to outperform naive, random walk forecasts, although Bayesian-adjusted betas perform as well as the financial variables model.

Title: The Hedging of an Uncertain Future Foreign Currency Cash Flow
Journal: Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis
Pages: 565-578
Issue: 04
Volume: 26
Year: 1991
Month: December 
Abstract: This paper derives the optimal hedge of an uncertain (unknown quantity) future foreign currency cash flow. This more general optimal hedge includes the traditional hedge for a certain (known quantity) future foreign currency cash flow as a special case. The optimal hedge is found to be unbounded and determined by firm-specific conditions, including the variance of the expected cash flow, and the correlation of that future cash flow with actual exchange rate movements. Simulated optimal hedge values are found for U.S.-based multinational firms possessing S/<italic>Dm</italic> cash flows, using exchange rate data for the 1981–1987 period. Special cases in which the optimal hedge ratio equals zero and one also are identified, and we show that cash flow uncertainty can strongly affect the effectiveness of hedging.
