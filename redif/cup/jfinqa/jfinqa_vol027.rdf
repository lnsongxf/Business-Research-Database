Title: Long-Horizon Mean-Reverting Stock Prices Revisited
Journal: Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis
Pages: 1-18
Issue: 01
Volume: 27
Year: 1992
Month: March    
Abstract: This paper reexamines long-horizon stock returns and finds that previous work overstates the evidence of mean reversion. The overstatement is largely due to the implicit weighting of ordinary least-squares tests, which place more weight on the Depression and World War II observations, which have both large error variances and stronger mean-reverting tendencies. Additionally, the reliance on asymptotic statistics and the improper focus on only the most negative estimates of mean reversion contribute to the overstatement. Using generalized least-squares randomization tests on the 1926 to 1987 period, the random walk cannot be rejected for value- or equally-weighted real returns at any of 10 return horizons or by joint tests over all 10 horizons simultaneously. Additionally, the random walk cannot be rejected for the extended 1871 to 1987 period.

Title: On Universal Currency Hedges
Journal: Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis
Pages: 19-38
Issue: 01
Volume: 27
Year: 1992
Month: March    
Abstract: This paper identifies five universal currency hedge ratio (UHR) definitions. These are hedge positions in foreign bonds, stated as a fraction of national or global equity portfolios, that are the same for all investors, regardless of nationality. The first three involve the total demand for foreign bonds and depend on equities not being held for hedging purposes. The last two are associated with variance-minimizing regression hedges. These hold, in general, but are designed exclusively for hedging other traded asset positions. Jensen's inequality makes the choice of measurement currency irrelevant and makes the HRs universal without affecting their values.

Title: Standard Errors in Event Studies
Journal: Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis
Pages: 39-53
Issue: 01
Volume: 27
Year: 1992
Month: March    
Abstract: Even if true abnormal returns are uncorrelated, estimated abnormal returns are not. This paper presents a simple formula for the variance of estimated cumulative abnormal returns. Both returns and dummy variable procedures for estimating the standard error correctly, taking account of both intertemporal and contemporaneous correlation of estimated residuals, are discussed. They are then applied to an event study of post-merger performance. It is shown that ignoring either the intertemporal or contemporaneous correlation of residuals can result in significant underestimates of standard errors.

Title: The Effect of the Secondary Market on the Pricing of Initial Public Offerings: Theory and Evidence
Journal: Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis
Pages: 55-79
Issue: 01
Volume: 27
Year: 1992
Month: March    
Abstract: This paper provides a theoretical and empirical investigation of the role of the secondary market in the pricing of initial public offerings. We argue that incomplete spanning of the primary issues in the secondary market and limited investor access play an important role in the pricing of initial public offerings. Utilizing a segmented market approach wherein IPO offering values are determined in the primary market and after-market bid prices are determined in the centrally accessed secondary market, we derive a price differential in the primary and secondary markets that is consistent with the received notion of IPO underpricing. Empirical tests on a large sample of IPOs provide results that are consistent with the predictions of our theoretical analysis.

Title: Empirical Tests of a Principal-Agent Model of the Investor-Investment Advisor Relationship
Journal: Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis
Pages: 81-95
Issue: 01
Volume: 27
Year: 1992
Month: March    
Abstract: This paper develops a specialized principal-agent model of the investor-investment advisor relationship and embeds the standard advisory compensation schedule in the model. Advisors are endowed with information-gathering abilities and investors are endowed with funds. Information-gathering services are traded indirectly through the investor's receipt of portfolio returns net of advisory fees. Model results show that the parameters of the compensation schedule are both a function of the idiosyncracies of an advisor's information services and the degree of risk sharing between the advisor and investor. Several predictions of the model are supported using data on mutual fund advisors. Unsupported predictions may be due to self-selection of advisors by risk tolerance.

Title: Target Firm Abnormal Returns and Trading Volume around the Initiation of Change in Control Transactions
Journal: Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis
Pages: 109-129
Issue: 01
Volume: 27
Year: 1992
Month: March    
Abstract: This study examines the average abnormal returns, average abnormal trading volume, and reported insider trading of corporate control target firms during a period of possibly informed trading. This period begins on the unpublicized initiation date (as reported in a postannouncement date proxy statement or 14-D1) and ends on the publication date of the first <italic>Wall Street Journal</italic> story signalling an impending change in corporate control. We find that the preannouncement date average abnormal return noted by other researchers begins after the unpublicized initiation date of the transaction. We find no evidence of the preannouncement date average abnormal trading volume noted by previous researchers; instead, we find average abnormal volume beginning with the first public information regarding the transaction.

Title: The Estimation of Quality-Adjusted Auction Returns with Varying Transaction Intervals
Journal: Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis
Pages: 131-142
Issue: 01
Volume: 27
Year: 1992
Month: March    
Abstract: Previous research has separately addressed the problem of estimating risk in the presence of infrequent trading and the problem of estimating quality-adjusted returns in markets with quality variation in the observed price series. This paper simultaneously addresses both problems by applying a signal extraction method for unequally spaced data to decompose the observed price series with varying times between transactions into a quality-adjusted, permanent component (which would be observable in the absence of quality variation) plus a stationary, transitory quality variation component. Stamp auction transaction prices provide an application. Auction quality grading is treated in a manner analogous to bond ratings. Almost all of the observed variance is attributed to the auction quality variation. The observed auction returns and stock index returns are not well related.

Title: Optimal Bank Interest Margin under Capital Regulation and Deposit Insurance
Journal: Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis
Pages: 143-149
Issue: 01
Volume: 27
Year: 1992
Month: March    
Abstract: This paper examines the relationships among capital regulation, deposit insurance, and the optimal bank interest margin. In a model where loan losses are the source of uncertainty, changes in capital regulation or deposit insurance premiums have direct effects on the bank's interest margin. An increase in bank capital requirement or in deposit insurance premiums results in a reduced interest margin under nonincreasing risk aversion. Comparative static analysis also explores the relation between asset quality and interest margin. It is shown that a mean-preserving spread of the distribution of loan losses results in a reduced margin.

Abstract: This paper investigates market manipulation trading strategies by large traders in a securities market. A large trader is defined as any investor whose trades change prices. A market manipulation trading strategy is one that generates positive real wealth with no risk. Market manipulation trading strategies are shown to exist under reasonable hypotheses on the equilibrium price process. Sufficient conditions for their nonexistence are also provided.

Abstract: This paper critically evaluates the claim in recent papers that precisely estimated betas explain the cross-sectional differences in expected returns across size-based portfolios. In these studies, the correlations between firm size and betas across the test portfolios are <italic>close to one</italic> in magnitude, yielding potentially spurious inferences. This paper shows that when the test portfolios are constructed so that the correlations between firm size and beta are small, the betas explain virtually <italic>none</italic> of the cross-sectional differences in portfolio returns.

Title: The International Crash of October 1987: Causality Tests
Journal: Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis
Pages: 353-364
Issue: 03
Volume: 27
Year: 1992
Month: September
Abstract: The paper analyzes lead-lag relationships for six major stock market indexes: New York S&P 500, Tokyo Nikkei, London FT–30, Hong Kong Hang Seng, Singapore Straits Times, and Australia All Ordinaries, for time periods before, during, and after the October 1987 market crash. Unidirectional and bidirectional causality tests are conducted by means of the Granger methodology. Practically no lead-lag relationships are found for the pre-crash and post-crash periods. However, important feedback relationships and unidirectional causality are detected for the month of the crash. There is also an increase in contemporaneous causality during and after the month of the crash. In general, our findings suggest that the October 1987 market crash probably was an international crisis of the equity markets and that it might have begun simultaneously in all the national stock markets.

Volume: 27
Year: 1992
Month: September
Abstract: A number of recent papers have reported evidence that stock prices are more volatile than is consistent with efficient markets. We argue that the excess volatility tests address a definition of efficient markets that makes an extreme information assumption. We go on to test a weaker definition of efficient markets, due to Jensen (1978). We show the existence of a profitable trading rule that earns a significantly higher rate of return than a buy-and-hold strategy, and so conclude that stock prices are too volatile, even when judged by this weaker definition.

Title: The Contrarian Investment Strategy Does Not Work in Canadian Markets
Journal: Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis
Pages: 383-395
Issue: 03
Volume: 27
Year: 1992
Month: September
Abstract: This paper tests the overreaction hypothesis using monthly data for stocks listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange over the 1950–1988 period. Unlike De Bondt and Thaler (1985), (1987), it finds statistically significant continuation behavior for the next one (and two) year(s) for winners and losers, and insignificant reversal behavior for winners and losers over longer formation/test periods of up to ten years. While the systematic risks of the winners decrease significantly over all test periods, the systematic risks of the losers increase significantly for only the 12-month formation/test periods (unlike Chan (1988)). The only significant change in variance from the formation to test periods occurs for the losers for the 12-month formation/test periods. The findings are robust for January versus non-January and size-based portfolios (unlike Zarowin (1989), (1990)). The findings are robust for various performance measures (specifically, market-adjusted CAR, and the Jensen (1968) and Sharpe (1966) portfolio performance measures).

Title: Equity Issues with Time-Varying Asymmetric Information
Journal: Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis

Issue: 03
Volume: 27
Year: 1992
Month: September
Abstract: This paper develops a formal model of the effect of time-varying asymmetric information on the timing and pricing of equity issues when managers are better informed than outside investors. We assume that as time passes, the adverse selection problem becomes more severe as more managers receive a private signal. Under this assumption, the model predicts temporal variation in the quantity of issues, with a bunching of issues after information releases. It also predicts that the price drop at issue announcement increases with the time since the last information release. These predictions are consistent with several recent empirical studies relating equity issues to earnings and dividend announcements.

Title: The Robustness of Risk-Return Nonlinearities to the Normality Assumption
Journal: Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis
Pages: 419-435
Issue: 03
Volume: 27
Year: 1992
Month: September
Abstract: In a recent study, Tinic and West (1986) empirically reexamine the risk-return relationship posited by the traditional mean-variance CAPM. They find a positive nonlinear relationship between risk and return, except during January when the market rewards bearing nonsystematic risk. This study examines the hypothesis that nonnormality of return distributions may account for some of these anomalous results. We compare Shalit and Yitzhaki's (1984) mean-extended Gini CAPM—an equilibrium asset pricing relation that is independent of the form of the underlying asset distribution—with the traditional CAPM. Our results indicate that the nonlinear risk-return relationship and the size and January effects are robust to nonnormality of return distributions.

Title: Implied volatilities and Transaction Costs

Volume: 27
Year: 1992
Month: September
Abstract: Using data that contain bid and ask quotes for both options and stocks, the analysis investigates the constant volatility assumption of the Black-Scholes model. The analysis adjusts for bid-ask spreads and finds evidence that is inconsistent with the constant volatility assumption. Instead, the results reveal a strong negative correlation between volatility and stock price, and they suggest that using a nonconstant volatility model such as the CEV model would be more appropriate to price long-term options. Finally, transaction costs associated with the dynamic hedge tend to increase with an option's maturity, but decrease as a percentage of the option's price.

Title: The Treasury Yield Curve as a Cointegrated System
Journal: Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis
Pages: 449-463
Issue: 03
Volume: 27
Year: 1992
Month: September
Abstract: This paper examines the temporal relationship between interest rates on Treasury securities ranging in maturity from three months to 30 years. We find strong empirical support that the seven Treasury rates selected are cointegrated, a conclusion that is insensitive to the normalization chosen. In particular, the hypothesis of noncointegration is rejected decisively regardless of the rate selected as the dependent variable in the cointegrating equation. To determine whether this information can be used to improve forecasts of Treasury rates, the seven rates are forecasted with a corresponding errorcorrection model that is shown to outperform an augmented VAR model that ignores the cointegration of the rates. The results are consistent with the belief that arbitrage limits the extent to which rates on different maturities of a given security diverge. In addition, the results confirm the appropriateness of imposing a common stochastic process for interest rates in equilibrium models of the term structure.

Title: The Specification and Power of the Sign Test in Event Study Hypothesis Tests Using Daily Stock Returns
Journal: Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis
Pages: 465-478
Issue: 03
Volume: 27
Year: 1992
Month: September
Abstract: This paper evaluates a nonparametric sign test for abnormal security price performance in event studies. The sign test statistic examined here does not require a symmetrical distribution of security excess returns for correct specification. Sign test performance is compared to a parametric <italic>t</italic>-test and a nonparametric rank test. Simulations with daily security return data show that the sign test is better specified under the null hypothesis and often more powerful under the alternative hypothesis than a <italic>t</italic>-test. The performance of the sign test is dominated by the performance of a rank test, however, indicating that the rank test is preferable to the sign test in obtaining nonparametric inferences concerning abnormal security price performance in event studies.
