Title: The Nature of Option Interactions and the Valuation of Investments with Multiple Real Options
Journal: Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis
Pages: 1-20
Issue: 01
Volume: 28
Year: 1993
Month: March    
Abstract: This paper deals with the nature of option interactions and the valuation of capital budgeting projects possessing flexibility in the form of multiple real options. It identifies situations where option interactions can be small or large, negative or positive. Interactions generally depend on the type, separation, degree of being “in the money,” and the order of the options involved. The paper illustrates, through a generic example, the importance of properly accounting for interactions among the options to defer, abandon, contract or expand investment, and switch use. It is shown that the incremental value of an additional option, in the presence of other options, is generally less than its value in isolation, and declines as more options are present. Therefore, valuation errors from ignoring a particular option may be small. However, configurations of real options exhibiting precisely the opposite behavior are identified. Comparative statics results confirm that the value of flexibility, despite interactions, manifests familiar option properties.

Title: Price Volatility, Trading Volume, and Market Depth: Evidence from Futures Markets
Journal: Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis
Pages: 21-39
Issue: 01
Volume: 28
Year: 1993
Month: March    
Abstract: The relations between volume, volatility, and market depth in eight physical and financial futures markets are examined. Evidence suggests that linking volatility to total volume does not extract all information. When volume is partitioned into expected and unexpected components, the paper finds that unexpected volume shocks have a larger effect on volatility. Further, the relation is asymmetric; the impact of positive unexpected volume shocks on volatility is larger than the impact of negative shocks. Finally, consistent with theories of market depth, the study shows large open interest mitigates volatility.

Title: Implications of Nonlinear Dynamics for Financial Risk Management
Journal: Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis
Pages: 41-64
Issue: 01
Volume: 28
Year: 1993
Month: March    
Abstract: This paper demonstrates that when log price changes are not IID, their conditional density may be more accurate than their unconditional density for describing short-term behavior. Using the BDS test of independence and identical distribution, daily log price changes in four currency futures contracts are found to be not IID. While there appear to be no predictable conditional mean changes, conditional variances are predictable, and can be described by an autoregressive volatility model that seems to capture all the departures from independence and identical distribution. Based on this model, daily log price changes are decomposed into a predictable part, which is described parametrically by the autoregressive volatility model, and an unpredictable part, which can be modeled by an empirical density, either parametrically or nonparametrically. This two-step seminonparametric method yields a conditional density for daily log price changes, which has a number of uses in financial risk management.

Title: No Arbitrage and Valuation in Markets with Realistic Transaction Costs
Journal: Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis
Pages: 65-80
Issue: 01
Volume: 28
Year: 1993
Month: March    
Abstract: One of the most fundamental results in finance is the equivalence of a no-arbitrage condition to the existence of a pricing operator in markets without transaction costs (see Ross (1978)). Garman and Ohlson (1981) extended this to markets with proportional transaction costs. The current paper further extends this result to markets with realistic (and nonproportional) transaction costs. These costs include all investors' market-impact and short-borrowing costs, large investors' institutional commissions, and for small investors only the additional cost of retail commissions. They are functions of the value of the trade and have increasing, increasing, constant, and decreasing marginal rates, respectively, in that value. Garman and Ohlson showed that equilibrium prices in their notion of a “corresponding” cost-free market, plus a certain factor, prevail under equilibrium in markets with proportional transaction costs. The current paper extends this to realistic transaction costs and establishes the functional relation between this factor and the form of such costs.

Title: Arbitrage Pricing with Estimation Risk
Journal: Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis
Pages: 81-100
Issue: 01
Volume: 28
Year: 1993
Month: March    
Abstract: This paper considers the Arbitrage Pricing Theory when investors have incomplete information on the parameters generating asset returns. Each asset in the economy may have a different amount of information available on it. Bayesian investors use their prior beliefs in conjunction with the total available information to assign an expected return and a set of factor betas to each asset. The assigned expected returns are shown to be linear in their associated factor betas. However, the factor betas and prices of assets differ from those under complete information. Specifically, risky assets with high (low) information are priced relatively higher (lower). On the other hand, factor betas of high (low) information assets are relatively lower (higher). The analysis has econometric implications for testing the APT. In this paper's framework, maximum likelihood estimates of factor betas, which are based on normality assumptions, are too high (low) for high (low) information assets. In addition, sequentially increasing the sample size by adding new securities to a factor analysis procedure can result in the detection of apparent additional priced factors when they do not really exist.

Title: The Risk and Required Return of Common Stock following Major Price Innovations
Journal: Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis
Pages: 101-116
Issue: 01
Volume: 28
Year: 1993
Month: March    
Abstract: This paper presents empirical evidence demonstrating that the risk and expected returns of common stocks typically change in the aftermath of large price movements. When temporary changes in uncertainty follow major financial events, subsequent stock returns should be positively correlated with the shift in return volatility. This prediction is strongly supported by the data on more than 9,100 daily price change events during 1962–1985. Moreover, the data also suggest that ex ante returns on common stocks may incorporate a premium for increases in parameter uncertainty associated with the events.

Title: Optimal Replication of Options with Transactions Costs and Trading Restrictions
Journal: Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis
Pages: 117-138
Issue: 01
Volume: 28
Year: 1993
Month: March    
Abstract: This paper analyzes the strategy that minimizes the initial cost of replicating a contingent claim in a market with transactions costs and trading constraints. The linear programming and two-stage backward recursive models developed are applicable to the replication of convex as well as nonconvex payoffs and to a portfolio of options with different maturities. The paper's formulation conveniently accounts for fixed and variable transactions costs, lot size constraints, and position limits on trading. The article shows that in the presence of trading frictions, it is no longer optimal to revise one's portfolio in each period. At the optimum, cash flows in excess of the desired ones may be generated. The optimal policy trades off the curvature of the payoff that is generated against the terminal slack.

Title: Optimality of Spin-Offs and Allocation of Debt
Journal: Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis
Pages: 139-160
Issue: 01
Volume: 28
Year: 1993
Month: March    
Abstract: Recent empirical studies have indicated that spin-offs are value enhancing, yet the theoretical aspects of spin-off gains have not been as well explored. This paper presents a theoretical analysis of spin-offs. In the model of the firm presented, outstanding risky debt gives rise to agency costs of underinvestment, which are offset by the benefit of debt-related tax shields. The trade-off specifies the optimal leverage for a firm. Within this framework, the paper considers whether and under what circumstances firm value could be enhanced by a spin-off. It is shown that a spin-off in which parent company debt is optimally allocated between the post-spin-off firms increases value by reducing agency costs and increasing the value of tax shields when the component firm cash flows are positively correlated. The optimal allocation is characterized in terms of the parameters of the technologies of the component firms. When the component cash flows are negatively correlated, under the sufficient conditions developed, a combined firm operation dominates spin-offs. Here, the coinsurance effect on investment incentives dominates the effect of a flexible allocation of debt across technologies in a spin-off.

Title: Price Barriers in the Dow Jones Industrial Average
Journal: Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis
Pages: 313-330
Issue: 03
Volume: 28
Year: 1993
Month: September
Abstract: This study tests the popular claim that the DJIA's movements around key reference points affect “investor sentiment” and thus price behavior. It is found that the DJIA's rise and fall is indeed restrained by “support” and “resistance” levels at multiples of 100 (e.g., 2800, 2900, 3000, etc.) but that, having broken through a 100-level, the DJIA then moves by more than otherwise warranted. A Monte Carlo study and comparisons with other indices confirm the significance of these findings. This suggests that some agents may trade on the basis of the DJIA but does not necessarily suggest that the market is inefficient.

Title: Explaining the Cross-Section of Returns via a Multi-Factor APT Model
Journal: Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis

Issue: 03
Volume: 28
Year: 1993
Month: September
Abstract: This paper uses an autoregressive approach to test a multi-factor model with time-varying risk premiums. A quasi-differencing approach is used to eliminate the unobservable factors in the model. It is found that the model is capable of capturing the “size effect” and the “dividend yield effect,” but is incapable of explaining the “book-to-market effect” and the “earnings-price ratio effect.” Thus, it is concluded that a constant-beta multi-factor model will not be able to explain the cross-sectional variation in expected returns.

Title: Motives for Takeovers: An Empirical Investigation
Journal: Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis
Pages: 347-362
Issue: 03
Volume: 28
Year: 1993
Month: September
Abstract: Three major motives have been suggested for takeovers: synergy, agency, and hubris. Existing empirical evidence is unable to clearly distinguish among these motives probably due to the simultaneous existence of all three in any sample of takeovers. This paper suggests a way of distinguishing among these competing hypotheses by looking at the correlation between target and total gains. It is argued that this correlation should be positive if synergy is the motive, negative if agency is the motive, and zero if hubris is the motive. The empirical results show that synergy is the primary motive in takeovers with positive total gains even though the evidence is consistent with the simultaneous existence of hubris in this sample. It is also found that agency is the primary motive in takeovers with negative total gains.

Journal: Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis
Pages: 363-379
Issue: 03
Volume: 28
Year: 1993
Month: September
Abstract: This paper presents evidence on how the Williams Act affected the corporate acquisitions market. The acquisition process is modeled and three hypotheses about the Act's effects are discussed. These hypotheses imply differing restrictions on how the Act changes the model's parameters. Parameter changes are estimated but we are unable to reliably discriminate between two of the three hypotheses using the classical statistical testing approach, though the third hypothesis is reliably rejected. Bayesian analysis using a diffuse prior is employed to make formal probability comparisons among the hypotheses. The most probable hypothesis, according to the results, implies that the Williams Act reduced the expected gross present value of acquisition attempts.

Volume: 28
Year: 1993

Abstract: This paper examines the cross-sectional distribution of bid-ask spreads in the S&P 100 index options market. Cross-sectional differences in bid-ask spreads are found to be directly related to differences in market-making costs and trading activity across options. We also examine the relation of an option's bid-ask spread and trading activity to the spread and trading activity in other options. Call option trading activity is inversely related to the call option bid-ask spread but positively related to the spread of the put option having the same strike price and maturity, and vice versa. These findings suggest that traders view call and put options as substitutes.

Abstract: This paper examines the signalling implications of sinking funds and shows that under information asymmetry the sinking fund amortization rate provides a credible signal for the quality of the firm. In a separating equilibrium, better quality firms choose higher sinking fund amortization rates in their bond issues. A latent index model is proposed for testing the hypothesis of sinking fund signalling. Empirical evidence indicates that the sinking fund amortization rate signals the credit quality of the firm.

Abstract: Rogalski-Tinic have reported a monthly pattern in ex post stock return variances that differs between small and large market capitalization firms. Maloney-Rogalski find that option prices reflect these monthly patterns ex ante. This study extends Maloney-Rogalski's work by devising an expiration-specific weighted implied standard deviation (WISD). It is found that: i) the monthly patterns in one-month WISDs are basically similar to the monthly patterns in ex post variances detected by Rogalski-Tinic for both large and small size firms, and ii) use of expiration-specific WISDs, as opposed to standard composite WISDs, results in improved performance of option pricing models.

Title: The Relation between Aggregate Insider Transactions and Stock Market Returns
Journal: Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis

Month: September
Abstract: A vector autoregressive (VAR) model is used to examine the relation between aggregate insider transactions and stock market returns. Consistent with the extant literature, there is some predictive content associated with aggregate insider transactions, but its magnitude is slight. In contrast, market returns have substantial influence on the aggregate purchases and sales of corporate insiders. The findings suggest that: 1) the degree of mispricing observed by insiders is small; 2) very little of the mispricing is associated with unanticipated macroeconomic factors; and 3) investors cannot use aggregate insider transactions to profitably predict future market returns over the following eight weeks.

Abstract: This paper studies the dynamic investment policies of firms under asymmetric information.Managers make decisions to maximize the wealth of <italic>existing</italic> shareholders. In equilibrium, the superior firms invest “myopically”, choosing intrinsically lower-valued projects that produce “early” cash flows. The inferior firms follow the socially preferred rule of investing in intrinsically higher-valued projects that produce “late” cash flows. In addition to explaining investment myopia, the model generates numerous predictions regarding announcement effects of equity issues and attempts by firms to stockpile cash, firms' preferences for limits on mandatory disclosure rules, and the effects of managerial entrenchment motives.

Title: Testing the Heath-Jarrow-Morton/Ho-Lee Model of Interest Rate Contingent Claims Pricing
Journal: Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis
Pages: 483-495
Issue: 04
Volume: 28
Year: 1993
Month: December 
Abstract: This paper presents empirical tests of the constant volatility version of the Heath, Jarrow, and Morton model, which is also the continuous time limit of the Ho and Lee model. Using a generalized method of moments (GMM) test on three years of daily data for Eurodollar futures and futures options, the model can be rejected for most subperiods. Various biases in the fitted option prices relative to the market prices are documented through a regression study. The small sample properties and power of the GMM framework to this setting are also studied through simulations.

Title: International Evidence on the Robustness of the Day-of-the-Week Effect
Journal: Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis
Pages: 497-513
Issue: 04
Volume: 28
Year: 1993
Month: December 
Abstract: Consistent with Connolly's (1989), (1991) evidence, this study finds that sample size and/or error term adjustments render U.S. day-of-the-week effects statistically insignificant. In contrast, day-of-the-week effects in seven European countries and in Canada and Hong Kong are robust to individual sample size or error term adjustments, and day-of-the-week effects in five European countries survive the simultaneous imposition of both types of adjustments. In most countries where day-of-the-week effects are robust, however, the effects are statistically significant in not more than two weeks out of the month. These findings are inconsistent with explanations of the day-of-the-week effect based on institutional differences or on the arrival of new information. Thus, in the absence of other potential explanations already dismissed by Jaffe and Westerfield (1985), evidence in this study further complicates the international day-of-the-week effect puzzle.

Title: Privileged Traders and Asset Market Efficiency: A Laboratory Study
Journal: Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis
Pages: 515-534
Issue: 04
Volume: 28
Year: 1993
Month: December 
Abstract: The 39 experiments reported here examine the impact on trading profits and on market performance of awarding special trading privileges to some traders and not others. In call market experiments, the last-mover and orderflow access privileges are both modestly profitable and neither impairs market performance. In continuous market experiments, quicker access to orderflow information is quite profitable and more detailed access is possibly profitable; both privileges seem to enhance market performance slightly. By contrast, privileged marketmaking is extremely profitable and greatly impairs market performance.

Title: Time-Varying Distributions and Dynamic Hedging with Foreign Currency Futures
Journal: Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis
Pages: 535-551
Issue: 04
Volume: 28
Year: 1993
Month: December 
Abstract: Most research on hedging has disregarded both the long-run cointegrating relationship between financial assets and the dynamic nature of the distributions of the assets. This study argues that neglecting these affects the hedging performance of the existing models and proposes an alternative model that accounts for both of them. Using a bivariate error correction model with a GARCH error structure, the risk-minimizing futures hedge ratios for several currencies are estimated. Both within-sample comparisons and out-of-sample comparisons reveal that the proposed model provides greater risk reduction than the conventional models. Furthermore, a dynamic hedging strategy is proposed in which the potential risk reduction is more than enough to offset the transactions costs for most investors.

Title: Changes in Organizational Structure and Shareholder Wealth: The Case of Limited Partnerships
Journal: Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis
Pages: 553-564
Issue: 04
Volume: 28
Year: 1993
Month: December 
Abstract: This paper analyzes the consequence for shareholders of a change in organizational form, the conversion of a corporation, or the spin-off of a unit into a limited partnership. Theory suggests that, prior to the Tax Reform Act of 1986, the tax benefits of conversion to a limited partnership and the creation of a new entity separate from the parent corporation should have a positive effect on shareholder wealth. On the other hand, the increase in agency costs of such an organizational change should decrease the wealth of shareholders. Empirical results lend support to hypotheses that predict an increase in stock price at the announcement of the conversion, but cannot identify the source of the gain.

Title: Bond and Stock Market Response to Unexpected Earnings Announcements
Journal: Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis
Pages: 565-577
Issue: 04
Volume: 28
Year: 1993
Month: December 
Abstract: This study examines whether earnings changes convey information in bond markets and finds a significant positive (negative) reaction to unexpected earnings increases (decreases). The results are consistent whether earnings announcements precede or follow dividend announcements. Thus, earnings surprises convey information to bond markets and changes in firm value are split among bondholders and stockholders. This is in contrast to evidence from studies examining unexpected dividend announcements where bond price reaction is asymmetric. Cross-sectional analysis reveals that bond excess returns are positively related to earnings surprises.

Title: A Bayesian Approach to Modeling Stock Return Volatility for Option Valuation
Journal: Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis
Pages: 579-594
Issue: 04
Volume: 28
Year: 1993
Month: December 
Abstract: New measures of stock return volatility are developed to increase the precision of stock option price estimates. With Bayesian statistical methods, volatility estimates for a given stock are developed using prior information on the cross-sectional patterns in return volatilities for groups of stocks sorted on size, financial leverage, and trading volume. Call option values computed with the Bayesian procedure generally improve prediction accuracy for market prices of call options relative to those computed using implied volatility, standard historical volatility, or even the actual ex post volatility that occurred during each option's life. Although the Bayesian methods produce biased call price estimators, they do reduce the systematic tendency of standard pricing approaches to overprice (underprice) options on high (low) volatility stocks. Little bias improvement is observed with respect to the time to maturity and moneyness of the call options.
