Title: Gains to Bidder Firms Revisited: Domestic and Foreign Acquisitions in Canada
Journal: Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis
Pages: 1-25
Issue: 01
Volume: 35
Year: 2000
Month: March    
Abstract: We present large sample evidence on the performance of domestic and U.S. (foreign) bidder firms acquiring Canadian targets. Domestic bidders earn significantly positive average announcement period abnormal returns, while U.S. bidder returns are indistinguishable from zero. Measures of pre- and post-acquisition abnormal accounting performance are also consistent with a superior domestic bidder performance. Domestic bidder announcement returns are, on average, greatest for offers involving stock payment and for the bidders with the smallest equity size relative to the target. Neither direct foreign investment controls, horizontal product market relationships, nor acquisition propensities explain why domestic bidders outperform their U.S. competitors.

Title: A Two-Factor Hazard Rate Model for Pricing Risky Debt and the Term Structure of Credit Spreads
Journal: Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis
Pages: 43-65
Issue: 01
Volume: 35
Year: 2000
Month: March    
Abstract: This paper proposes a two-factor hazard rate model, in closd form, to price risky debt. The likelihood of default is captured by the firm's non-interest sensitive assets and default-free interest rates. The distinguishing features of the model are threefold. First, the impact of capital structure changes on credit spreads can be analyzed. Second, the model allows stochastic interest rates to impact current asset values as well as their evolution. Finally, the proposed model is in closed fom, enabling us to undertake comparative statics analysis, compute parameter deltas of the model, calibrate empirical credit spreads, and determine hedge positions. Credit spreads generated by our model are consistent with empirical observations.

Title: A Rexamination of the Motives and Gains in Joint Ventures
Journal: Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis
Pages: 67-85
Issue: 01
Volume: 35
Year: 2000
Month: March    
Abstract: We distinguish between horizontal and vertical joint ventures, and find correspondingly different valuation effects. Horizontal joint ventures create synergistic gains that are shared by the partners. In contrast, vertical joint ventures generate gains only for suppliers. This is similar to the patter we find for simple contracts, which suggests economic similiarities between vertical joint ventures and contracts. Analysing firms' choices between these contracting options, we find that firms choose vertical joint ventures over simple contracts when potential hold-up problems are severe and when suppliers face finance constraints. The results d not support a risk-sharing motive for joint ventures.

Title: The Determinants of Contract Terms in Bank Revolving Credit Agreements
Journal: Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis
Pages: 87-110
Issue: 01
Volume: 35
Year: 2000
Month: March    
Abstract: The paper examines the determinats of contract terms on bank revolving credit agreements (revolvers) of medium/large publicly traded companies. We model the duration (maturity), secured status, and pricing decisions within a simultaneous decision framework, thereby overcoming the biased and inconsistent estimates in prior single equations studies of debt contract terms. We find strong interrelationaships between contract terms with significant bi-directorinal relationships between duration and secure status and between the all-in-spread and commitment fees and aunidirectional relationship from both duration and secured status to all-in-spread. We also illustrate how several single equation studies of contract terms draw incorrect conclusions because of their (inappropriate) assumption that other contract therms and leverage were exogenous. Finally, our results support the hypothesis that the setting of contract terms plays and important role in alleviating contracting problems.

Title: Prices as Aggregators of Private Information: Evidence from S&P 500 Futures Data
Journal: Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis
Pages: 111-126
Issue: 01
Volume: 35
Year: 2000
Month: March    
Abstract: This paper assesses the importance of the role of prices as aggregators of private information in the S&P 500 future market. We estimate primitive parameters of the Hellwig (1980) noisy rational expectations model, when both prices and terminal values are observable. The variance-covariance parameters governing futuers prices and terminal values can be inverted to obtain estimate of the primitive parmeters, including the precision of private infromation and the variance of liquidity-motivated trades. We also estimate coefficients in the linear price conjecture, weights that agents place on different sources of information, and the informativeness of prices. We find that the variance of the error term in agents' private signals is several orders of magnitude larger than the variance of liquidity-motivated trades. But, in a large market, prices are still so informative that the market as a whole appears to weight them more than prior beliefs.

Title: Behavioral Portfolio Theory
Journal: Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis
Pages: 127-151
Issue: 02
Volume: 35
Year: 2000
Month: June     
Abstract: We develop a positive behavioral portfolio theory (BPT) and explore its implications for portfolio constrution and security design. The optimal portfolios of BPT investors resemble combinations of bonds and lotterly tickets consistent with Friedman and Savage's (1948) observation. We compare the BPT efficient frontier with the mean-variance efficient frontier and show that, in general, the two frontiers do not coincide. Optimal BPT portfolios are also different from optimal CAPM portfolios. In particular, the CAPM two-fund separation does not hold in BPT. We present BPT in a single mental account version (BPT-SA) and a multiple mental account version (BPT-SA). BPT-SA investors integrate their portfolios into a single mental account, while BPT-SA investors segregate their portfolios into several mental accounts. BPT-SA portfolios resemble layered pyramids, where layers are associated with aspirations. We explore a two-layer portfolio where the low aspiration layer is designed to avoid poverth while the high aspiration layer is designed for a shot at riches.

Title: Profitability of Momentum Stragegies in the International Equity Markets
Journal: Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis
Pages: 153-172
Issue: 02
Volume: 35
Year: 2000
Month: June     
Abstract: This paper examines the profitability of momentum strategies implemented on international stock market indices. Our results indicate statiscally significant evidence of momentum profits. The momentum profits arise mainly from time-series predictability in stock market indices—very little profit comes from predictability in the currency markets. We also find higher profits for momentum portfolios implemented on markets with higher volume in the previous period, indicating that return continuation is stronger following an increase in trading volume. This result confirms the informational role of volume and its applicability in technical analysis.

Title: Dividend Behaviour and Dividend Signaling
Journal: Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis
Pages: 173-189
Issue: 02
Volume: 35
Year: 2000
Month: June     
Abstract: We analyze the dividend behaviour of the aggregate stock market. We propose a model that assumes managers minimize the costs of adjustment associated with being away from their target dividend payout. The target is expressed as a function of lagged stock prices and permanent earnings, generalizing previous models of dividend behaviour. We present a new method for measuring unobserved permanent earning based on the Kalman filter. Our specification of dividend behaviour is strongly supported by the data relative to both alternative models and over time. We find significant evidence of dividends conveying information regarding unexpected positive changes in current permanent earnigs. We also find that both the speed of adjustment of dividends to target dividends and tests of signaling are sensitive to the specification of the model.

Title: Testing the Empirical Performance of Stochastic Volatility Models of the Short-Term Interest Rate
Journal: Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis
Pages: 191-215
Issue: 02
Volume: 35
Year: 2000
Month: June     
Abstract: I introduce two-factor discrete time stochastic volatility models of the short-term interest rate to compare the relative performance of existing and alternative empiricial specificattions. I develop a nonlinear asymmmetric framework that allows for comparisons of non-nested models featuring conditional heteoskedasticity and sensitivity of the volatility process to interest rate levels. A new class of stochastic volatility models with asymmetric GARCH models. The existing models are rejected in favor of the newly proposed models because of the asymmetric drift of the short rate, and the presence of nonlinearity, asymmetry, GARCH, and level effects in its volatility. I test the predictive power of nested and non-nested models in capturing the stochastic behavior of the risk-free rate. Empirical evidence on three-, six-, and 12-month U.S. Treasury bills indicates but that two-factor stochastic volatility models are better than diffusion and GARCH models in forecasting the future level and volatility of interest rate changes.

Issue: 02
Volume: 35
Year: 2000

Abstract: We examine the impact of merger announcements on protfolios of acquiring firm and target firm common stock from 1919 to 1930. despite vast changes in the economic and regulatory environment, overall acquisition profitability has remained remarkably constant over the last 70 and 80 years. Target firm shareholders in the 1920s clearly gained from takeovers, averaging abnormal retruns in excess of 15%, while acquiring firm shareholders essentially broke even. synergistic or monopolistic gains from consolidation were minimal. Unlike the more recent experience, target firm and acquiring firm abnormal returns were largely unaffected by the mode of acquisition, the means of financing, or the degree of industrial relatedness.

Title: Monthly Measurement of Daily Timers
Journal: Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis
Pages: 257-290
Issue: 03
Volume: 35
Year: 2000
Month: September
Abstract: This paper addresses the bias associated with parametric measurement of timing skill based on monthly timer returns when timers can make daily timing decisions. Simulations suggest that the classic Henriksson-Merton parametric measure of timing skill is weak and biased downward when applied to the monthly returns of a daily timer. The paper proposes an adjustment that mitigates this problem without the need to collect daily timer returns. Four tests of timing skill, carried out on a sample of 558 mutual funds, show that very few funds exhibit statistically significant timing skill. More encompassing, the adjusted-FF3 test (based on the specification that incorporates both the proposed adjustment and the Fama-French three-factor model) is the least biased measure of timing skill among the four—it provides for a sharper inference regarding timing skill and helps mitigate biases associated with the choice of investment style.

Title: Performance Characteristics of Hedge Funds and Commodity Funds: Natural vs. Spurious Biases
Journal: Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis
Pages: 291-307
Issue: 03
Volume: 35
Year: 2000
Month: September
Abstract: It is well known that the pro forma performance of a sample of investment funds contains biases. These biases are documented in Brown, Goetzmann, Ibbotson, and Ross (1992) using mutual funds as subjects. The organization structure of hedge funds, as private and often offshore vehicles, makes data collection a much more onerous task, amplifying the impact of performance measurement biases. Theis paper reviews these biases in hedge funds. We also propose using funds-of-hedge funds to measure aggregate hedge fund performance, based on the idea that the investment experience of hedge fund investors can be used to estimate the performance of hedge funds.

Journal: Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis

Issue: 03
Volume: 35
Year: 2000
Month: September
Abstract: In this paper, I examine survivorship bias in hedge fund returns by comparing two large databases. I find that the survivorship bias exceeds 2% per year. Results of survivorship bias by investment styles indicate that the biases are different across styles. I reconcile the conflicting results about survivorship bias in previous studies by showing that the two major hedge fund databases contain different amounts of dissolved funds. Empirical results show that poor performance is the main reason for a fund's disappearance. Furthermore, I find that there are significant differences in fund returs, inception date, net assets value, incentive fee, management fee, and investment styles forthe 465 common funds covered by both databases. Mismatching between reported returns andthe percentage change in NAVs can partially explain the differences in returns.

Title: Multi-Period Performance Persistence Analysis of Hedge Funds
Journal: Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis
Pages: 327-342
Issue: 03
Volume: 35
Year: 2000
Month: September
Abstract: Since hedge funds specify significant lock-up periods, we investigate persistence in the performance of hedge funds using a multi-period framework in which the likelihood of observing persistence by chance is lower than in the traditional two-period framework. Under the null hypothesis of no manager skill (no persistence), the theoretical distribution of observing wins or losses follows a binormial distribution. We test this hypothesis using the traditional two-period framework and compare the findings with the results obtained using our multi-period framework. We examine whether persistence is sensitive to the length of return measurement intervals by using quarterly, half-yearly and yearly returns. We find maximum persistence at the quarterly horizon indicating that presistence among hedge fund managers is short term in nature.

Year: 2000

Abstract: We investigate the value of active mutual fund management by examining the stockholdings and trades of mutual funds. We fine that stocks widely held by funds do not outperform other stocks. However, stocks purchased by funds have significantly higher returns than stocks they sell—this is true for large stocks as well as small stocks, and for value stocks as well as growth stocks. We find that growth-oriented funds exhibit better stock selection skills than income-oriented funds. Finally, we find only weak evidence that funds with the best past performance have better stock-picking skills than funds with the worst past performance.

Title: Tax-Motivated Trading and Price Pressure: An Analysis of Mutual Fund Holdings
Journal: Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis
Pages: 369-386
Issue: 03
Volume: 35
Year: 2000
Month: September
Abstract: The 1986 Tax Reform Act (TRA) replaced non-synchronous tax year-ends with a common October 31 year-end for all mutual funds. After the TRA, we find that funds systematically accelerated the sale of losers prior to October 31. A similar pattern is not present for funds before the TRA, of for other types of institutions either befor or after the TRA. Examining stock returns in the first year the new TRA regulations became fully effective, we find evidence of a strong “November effect” for prior losers in which funds collectively had large holdings. Interestingly, fund managers appear to have learned from this experience. In subsequent years, our resuts suggest that funds were able to mitigate potential price pressures by having the foresight to spread tax-motivated sales over relatively long time horizons.

Abstract: This paper empirically analyzes REIT mutual funds. We show that, contrary to mostmutual fund studies, the average and median alphas (net of expenses) are positive. We also findthat time-varying positive alphas are much more likely to occur when the real asset market is performing poorly, suggesting that managers add more value in down markets than in up markets. We examine the cross-sectional determinants of both standard alphas and the average of time-varing alphas and find that both increase with assets and turnover. Cross-sectinally, we find that actively managed funds have higher alphas than passively managed funds.

Abstract: This paper studies the relation between fund performance and fund attributes in the Swedish market. Performance is measured as the alpha in a linear regression of fund returns on several benchmark assets, allowing for time-varying betas. The estimated performance is then used in a cross-sectinal analysis of the relation between performance and fund attributes such as past performance, flow, size, turnover, and proxies for expenses and trading activity. The results show that good performance occurs among small equity funds, low fee funds, funds whose trading activity is high and, in some cases, funds with good past performance.

Abstract: This paper reviews and extends definitions and properties of the three classical performance statistics (the Sharpe Ratio, the Treynor Index, and Jensen's Alpha) by locating them in a more general framework: the Asymmetric Response Mode. This allows various notions of beta, which can be related to downside risk, to be employed, and includes, as special cases, a market timing model and the mean-variance CAPM. Due to the general lack of data on fund performance in practice, our emphasis is on small sample analysis where possible. We illustrate our results empirically using data on 15 U.S.-based emerging markets investment funds.

Abstract: This study examines the Morningstar rating system as a predictor of mutual fund performance for U.S. domestic equit funds. We also compare the predictive abilities of the Morningstar rating system with those of alternative predictors. The results indicate findings that are robust across different samples, ages and styles of funds, and performance measures. First, low ratings from Morningstar generally indicate relatively poor future performance. Second, there is little statistical evidence that Morningstar's highest-rated funds outperform the next-to-highest and median-rated funds. Third, Morningstar ratings, at best, do only slightly better than the alternative predictors in forecasting future fund performance.

In addition, recommendations that have experienced recent earnings surprises are purged to eliminate the effects of post-earnings announcement drift. There is evidence that Value Line recommendations exhibit performance beyond what is predicted by existing models of expected return. However, once transactions costs have been accounted for, it is doubtful profitable abnormal returns could have been realized.

Month: December 
Abstract: We investigate the long-run return performance of non-U.S. firms that raise equity capital in U.S. markets. Overall, between 1982 and 1996, our sample of 333 global equity offerings with U.S. depositary receipt (ADR) tranches from 35 countries in Asia, Latin America, and Europe under-perform local market benchmarks of comparable firms by 8%–15% over the three years following issuance. We show that differences in long-run returns are related to the scope and magnitude of investment barriers that induce segmentation of capital markets around the world. While companies from markets with significant investment barriers for foreigners that issue equity on major U.S. exchanges outperform their benchmarks, those from segmented markets that issue equity in the U.S. by way of Rule 144A private placements significantly under-perform. We also show that inter-market competition for order flow in the post-issuance period affects long-run return performance. Post-issuance buy-and-hold abnormal returns are most significantly and positively related to the offering's ability to generate a larger share of U.S. trading volume.

Title: The Accuracy of Trade Classification Rules: Evidence from Nasdaq
Journal: Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis
Pages: 529-551
Issue: 04
Volume: 35
Year: 2000

Abstract: Researchers are increasingly using data from the Nasdaq market to examine pricing behavior, market design, and other microstructure phenomena. The validity of any study that classifies trades as buys or sells depends on the accuracy of the classification method. Using a Nasdaq proprietary data set that identifies trade direction, we examine the validity of several trade classification algorithms. We find that the quote rule, the tick rule, and the Lee and Ready (1991) rule correctly classify 76.4%, 77.66%, and 81.05% of the trades, respectively. However, all classification rules have only a very limited success in classifying trades executed inside the quotes, introducing a bias in the accuracy of classifying large trades, trades during high volume periods, and ECN trades. We also find that extant algorithms do a mediocre job when used for calculating effective spreads. For Nasdaq trades, we propose a new and simple classification algorithm that improves over extant algorithms.

Title: A Direct Test of Methods for Inferring Trade Direction from Intra-Day Data
Journal: Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis
Pages: 553-576

Volume: 35

Abstract: This study directly tests the ability of several competing methods to identify market buy and sell orders using intra-day quote and trade prices, and identifies factors that affect the accuracy of the methods. Lee and Ready's (1991) algorithm performs about the same as the tick test, but the performance of both methods is worse than expected. The results show that the use of either algorithm to classify trades can lead to significantly biased estimates of effective spreads and signed volume, but the tick test provides better estimates of effective spreads and signed volume than Lee and Ready's method.

Title: Market Segmentation and the Cost of the Capital in International Equity Markets
Journal: Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis
Pages: 577-600
Issue: 04
Volume: 35
Year: 2000
Month: December 
Abstract: While theoretical models predict a decrease in the cost of capital from depositary receipt offerings, the economic benefits of this liberalization have been difficult to quantify, Using a sample of 126 firms from 32 countries, we document a significant decline of 42% in the cost of capital. In addition, we show the decline is driven by the ability of U.S. investors to span the foreign security prior to cross-listing. Our findings support eh hypothesis that financial market liberalizations have significant economic benefits.

Title: Predictability in International Asset Returns: A Reexamination
Journal: Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis
Pages: 601-620
Issue: 04
Volume: 35
Year: 2000
Month: December 
Abstract: This paper argues that inferring long-horizon asset return predictability from the properties of vector autoregressive (VAR) models on relatively short spans of data is potentially unreliable. We illustrate the problems that can arise by reexamining the findings of Bekaert and Hodrick(1992), who detected evidence of in-sample predictability in international equity and foreign exchange markets using VAR methodology for a variety of countries from 1981–1989. The VAR predictions are significantly biased in most out-of-sample forecasts and are conclusively outperformed by a simple benchmark model at horizons of up to six months. This remains true even after corrections for small sample bias and the introduction Bayesian parameter restrictions. A Monte Carlo analysis indicates that the data are unlikely to have been generated by a stable VAR. This conclusion is supported by an examination of structural break statistics. We show that implied long-horizon statistics calculated from the VAR parameter estimates are very unreliable.

Title: Blockholder Ownership and Market Liquidity

Abstract: This paper examines the association between block ownership and market liquidity. Blockholders are believed to have access to private, value-relevant information via their roles as monitors of firms' operations. consistent with this, we find that firms with greater blockholder ownership, either by managers or external entities, have larger quoted spreads, effective spreads, adverse selection spread components, and smaller quoted depths.
