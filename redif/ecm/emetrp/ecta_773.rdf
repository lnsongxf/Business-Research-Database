Title: The Impact of Uncertainty Shocks 
Abstract:
				 Uncertainty appears to jump up after major
 shocks like the Cuban Missile crisis, the assassination of JFK, the OPEC I
 oil-price shock, and the 9/11 terrorist attacks. This paper offers a
 structural framework to analyze the impact of these uncertainty shocks. I
 build a model with a time-varying second moment, which is numerically
 solved and estimated using firm-level data. The parameterized model is
 then used to simulate a macro uncertainty shock, which produces a rapid
 drop and rebound in aggregate output and employment. This occurs because
 higher uncertainty causes firms to temporarily pause their investment and
 hiring. Productivity growth also falls because this pause in activity
 freezes reallocation across units. In the medium term the increased
 volatility from the shock induces an overshoot in output, employment, and
 productivity. Thus, uncertainty shocks generate short sharp recessions and
 recoveries. This simulated impact of an uncertainty shock is compared to
 vector autoregression estimations on actual data, showing a good match in
 both magnitude and timing. The paper also jointly estimates labor and
 capital adjustment costs (both convex and nonconvex). Ignoring capital
 adjustment costs is shown to lead to substantial bias, while ignoring
 labor adjustment costs does not. Copyright  2009 The Econometric Society.

Title: Generalized Method of Moments With Many Weak Moment Conditions 
Abstract:
				 Using many moment conditions can improve
 efficiency but makes the usual generalized method of moments (GMM)
 inferences inaccurate. Two-step GMM is biased. Generalized empirical
 likelihood (GEL) has smaller bias, but the usual standard errors are too
 small in instrumental variable settings. In this paper we give a new
 variance estimator for GEL that addresses this problem. It is consistent
 under the usual asymptotics and, under many weak moment asymptotics, is
 larger than usual and is consistent. We also show that the Kleibergen
 (2005) Lagrange multiplier and conditional likelihood ratio statistics are
 valid under many weak moments. In addition, we introduce a jackknife GMM
 estimator, but find that GEL is asymptotically more efficient under many
 weak moments. In Monte Carlo examples we find that t-statistics based on
 the new variance estimator have nearly correct size in a wide range of
 cases. 			       Copyright  2009 The Econometric Society.

Title: Hybrid and Size-Corrected Subsampling Methods 
Abstract:
				 This paper considers inference in a broad
 class of nonregular models. The models considered are nonregular in the
 sense that standard test statistics have asymptotic distributions that are
 discontinuous in some parameters. It is shown in Andrews and Guggenberger
 (2009a) that standard fixed critical value, subsampling, and m out of n
 bootstrap methods often have incorrect asymptotic size in such models.
 This paper introduces general methods of constructing tests and confidence
 intervals that have correct asymptotic size. In particular, we consider a
 hybrid subsampling/fixed-critical-value method and size-correction
 methods. The paper discusses two examples in detail. They are (i)
 confidence intervals in an autoregressive model with a root that may be
 close to unity and conditional heteroskedasticity of unknown form and (ii)
 tests and confidence intervals based on a post-conservative model
 selection estimator.				     Copyright  2009 The Econometric Society.

Title: The Microeconomics of Efficient Group Behavior: Identification  							  				 
Abstract:
				 Consider a group consisting of S members
 facing a common budget constraint p'xi=1: any demand vector belonging to
 the budget set can be (privately or publicly) consumed by the members.
 Although the intragroup decision process is not known, it is assumed to
 generate Pareto-efficient outcomes; neither individual consumptions nor
 intragroup transfers are observable. The paper analyzes when, to what
 extent, and under which conditions it is possible to recover the
 underlying structure-individual preferences and the decision process-from
 the group's aggregate behavior. We show that the general version of the
 model is not identified. However, a simple exclusion assumption (whereby
 each member does not consume at least one good) is sufficient to guarantee
 generic identifiability of the welfare-relevant structural concepts.	     Copyright  2009 The Econometric Society.

Title: Vector Expected Utility and Attitudes Toward Variation 
Abstract:
				 This paper proposes a model of decision
 under ambiguity deemed vector expected utility, or VEU. In this model, an
 uncertain prospect, or Savage act, is assessed according to (a) a baseline
 expected-utility evaluation, and (b) an adjustment that reflects the
 individual's perception of ambiguity and her attitudes toward it. The
 adjustment is itself a function of the act's exposure to distinct sources
 of ambiguity, as well as its variability. The key elements of the VEU
 model are a baseline probability and a collection of random variables, or
 adjustment factors, which represent acts exposed to distinct ambiguity
 sources and also reflect complementarities among ambiguous events. The
 adjustment to the baseline expected-utility evaluation of an act is a
 function of the covariance of its utility profile with each adjustment
 factor, which reflects exposure to the corresponding ambiguity source.      Copyright  2009 The Econometric Society.

Title: Optimal Stopping With Multiple Priors 
Abstract:
				 We develop a theory of optimal stopping
 under Knightian uncertainty. A suitable martingale theory for multiple
 priors is derived that extends the classical dynamic programming or Snell
 envelope approach to multiple priors. We relate the multiple prior theory
 to the classical setup via a minimax theorem. In a multiple prior version
 of the classical model of independent and identically distributed random
 variables, we discuss several examples from microeconomics, operation
 research, and finance. For monotone payoffs, the worst-case prior can be
 identified quite easily with the help of stochastic dominance arguments.
 For more complex payoff structures like barrier options, model ambiguity
 leads to stochastic changes in the worst-case beliefs. Copyright  2009 The Econometric Society.

Title: Incentives to Exercise 
Abstract:
				 Can incentives be effective in encouraging
 the development of good habits? We investigate the post-intervention
 effects of paying people to attend a gym a number of times during one
 month. In two studies we find marked attendance increases after the
 intervention relative to attendance changes for the respective control
 groups. This is entirely driven by people who did not previously attend
 the gym on a regular basis. In our second study, we find improvements on
 health indicators such as weight, waist size, and pulse rate, suggesting
 the intervention led to a net increase in total physical activity rather
 than to a substitution away from nonincentivized ones. We argue that there
 is scope for financial intervention in habit formation, particularly in
 the area of health. Copyright  2009 The Econometric Society.

Title: A Double-Track Adjustment Process for Discrete Markets With Substitutes and Complements 
Abstract:
				 We propose a new Walrasian
 tatonnement process called a double-track procedure for efficiently
 allocating multiple heterogeneous indivisible items in two distinct sets
 to many buyers who view items in the same set as substitutes but items
 across the two sets as complements. In each round of the process, a
 Walrasian auctioneer first announces the current prices for all items,
 buyers respond by reporting their demands at these prices, and then the
 auctioneer adjusts simultaneously the prices of items in one set upward
 but those of items in the other set downward. It is shown that this
 procedure converges globally to a Walrasian equilibrium in finitely many
 rounds. Copyright  2009 The Econometric Society.

Title: Unconditional Quantile Regressions 
Abstract:
				 We propose a new regression method to
 evaluate the impact of changes in the distribution of the explanatory
 variables on quantiles of the unconditional (marginal) distribution of an
 outcome variable. The proposed method consists of running a regression of
 the (recentered) influence function (RIF) of the unconditional quantile on
 the explanatory variables. The influence function, a widely used tool in
 robust estimation, is easily computed for quantiles, as well as for other
 distributional statistics. Our approach, thus, can be readily generalized
 to other distributional statistics. Copyright  2009 The Econometric Society.

Title: Classification Error in Dynamic Discrete Choice Models: Implications for Female Labor Supply Behavior 
Abstract:
				 Two key issues in the literature on female
 labor supply are (i) whether persistence in employment status is due to
 unobserved heterogeneity or state dependence, and (ii) whether fertility
 is exogenous to labor supply. Until recently, the consensus was that
 unobserved heterogeneity is very important and fertility is endogenous.
 Hyslop (1999) challenged this. Using a dynamic panel probit model of
 female labor supply including heterogeneity and state dependence, he found
 that adding autoregressive errors led to a substantial diminution in the
 importance of heterogeneity. This, in turn, meant he could not reject that
 fertility is exogenous. Here, we extend Hyslop (1999) to allow
 classification error in employment status, using an estimation procedure
 developed by Keane and Wolpin (2001) and Keane and Sauer (2005). We find
 that a fairly small amount of classification error is enough to overturn
 Hyslop's conclusions, leading to overwhelming rejection of the hypothesis
 of exogenous fertility. Copyright  2009 The Econometric Society.
