Title: An Economic Model of Friendship: Homophily, Minorities, and Segregation 
Abstract:
				 We develop a model of friendship formation
 that sheds light on segregation patterns observed in social and economic
 networks. Individuals have types and see type-dependent benefits from
 friendships. We examine the properties of a steady-state equilibrium of a
 matching process of friendship formation. We use the model to understand
 three empirical patterns of friendship formation: (i) larger groups tend
 to form more same-type ties and fewer other-type ties than small groups,
 (ii) larger groups form more ties per capita, and (iii) all groups are
 biased towards same-type relative to demographics, with the most extreme
 bias coming from middle-sized groups. We show how these empirical
 observations can be generated by biases in preferences and biases in
 meetings. We also illustrate some welfare implications of the model. Copyright  2009 The Econometric Society.

Title: Social Connections and Incentives in the Workplace: Evidence From Personnel Data 
Abstract:
				 We present evidence on the effect of
 social connections between workers and managers on productivity in the
 workplace. To evaluate whether the existence of social connections is
 beneficial to the firm's overall performance, we explore how the effects
 of social connections vary with the strength of managerial incentives and
 worker's ability. To do so, we combine panel data on individual worker's
 productivity from personnel records with a natural field experiment in
 which we engineered an exogenous change in managerial incentives, from
 fixed wages to bonuses based on the average productivity of the workers
 managed. We find that when managers are paid fixed wages, they favor
 workers to whom they are socially connected irrespective of the worker's
 ability, but when they are paid performance bonuses, they target their
 effort toward high ability workers irrespective of whether they are
 socially connected to them or not. Although social connections increase
 the performance of connected workers, we find that favoring connected
 workers is detrimental for the firm's overall performance. Copyright  2009 The Econometric Society.

Title: Collusion via Resale 
Abstract:
				 The English auction is susceptible to
 tacit collusion when post-auction interbidder resale is allowed. We show
 this by constructing equilibria where, with positive probability, one
 bidder wins the auction without any competition and divides the spoils by
 optimally reselling the good to the other bidders. These equilibria
 interim Pareto-dominate (among bidders) the standard value-bidding
 equilibrium without requiring the bidders to make any commitment on
 bidding behavior or postbidding spoil division. Copyright  2009 The Econometric Society.

Title: Bubbles and Self-Enforcing Debt 
Abstract:
				 We characterize equilibria with endogenous
 debt constraints for a general equilibrium economy with limited commitment
 in which the only consequence of default is losing the ability to borrow
 in future periods. First, we show that equilibrium debt limits must
 satisfy a simple condition that allows agents to exactly roll over
 existing debt period by period. Second, we provide an equivalence result,
 whereby the resulting set of equilibrium allocations with self-enforcing
 private debt is equivalent to the allocations that are sustained with
 unbacked public debt or rational bubbles. In contrast to the classic
 result by Bulow and Rogoff (1989a), positive levels of debt are
 sustainable in our environment because the interest rate is sufficiently
 low to provide repayment incentives. Copyright  2009 The Econometric Society.

Title: An Elementary Theory of Comparative Advantage 
Abstract:
				 Comparative advantage, whether driven by
 technology or factor endowment, is at the core of neoclassical trade
 theory. Using tools from the mathematics of complementarity, this paper
 offers a simple yet unifying perspective on the fundamental forces that
 shape comparative advantage. The main results characterize sufficient
 conditions on factor productivity and factor supply to predict patterns of
 international specialization in a multifactor generalization of the
 Ricardian model which we refer to as an "elementary neoclassical economy."
 These conditions, which hold for an arbitrarily large number of countries,
 goods, and factors, generalize and extend many results from the previous
 trade literature. They also offer new insights about the joint effects of
 technology and factor endowments on international specialization. Copyright  2009 The Econometric Society.

Title: Nonparametric Identification of Risk Aversion in  First-Price Auctions Under Exclusion Restrictions 
Abstract:
				 This paper studies the nonparametric
 identification of the first-price auction model with risk averse bidders
 within the private value paradigm. First, we show that the benchmark model
 is nonindentified from observed bids. We also derive the restrictions
 imposed by the model on observables and show that these restrictions are
 weak. Second, we establish the nonparametric identification of the
 bidders' utility function under exclusion restrictions. Our primary
 exclusion restriction takes the form of an exogenous bidders'
 participation, leading to a latent distribution of private values that is
 independent of the number of bidders. The key idea is to exploit the
 property that the bid distribution varies with the number of bidders while
 the private value distribution does not. We then extend these results to
 endogenous bidders' participation when the exclusion restriction takes the
 form of instruments that do not affect the bidders' private value
 distribution. Though derived for a benchmark model, our results extend to
 more general cases such as a binding reserve price, affiliated private
 values, and asymmetric bidders. Last, possible estimation methods are
 proposed. Copyright  2009 The Econometric Society.

Title: Panel Data Models With Interactive Fixed Effects 
Abstract:
				 This paper considers large N and large T
 panel data models with unobservable multiple interactive effects, which
 are correlated with the regressors. In earnings studies, for example,
 workers' motivation, persistence, and diligence combined to influence the
 earnings in addition to the usual argument of innate ability. In
 macroeconomics, interactive effects represent unobservable common shocks
 and their heterogeneous impacts on cross sections. We consider
 identification, consistency, and the limiting distribution of the
 interactive-effects estimator. Under both large N and large T, the
 estimator is shown to be	root(N T) consistent, which is valid in the
 presence of correlations and heteroskedasticities of unknown form in both
 dimensions. We also derive the constrained estimator and its limiting
 distribution, imposing additivity coupled with interactive effects. The
 problem of testing additive versus interactive effects is also studied. In
 addition, we consider identification and estimation of models in the
 presence of a grand mean, time-invariant regressors, and common
 regressors. Given identification, the rate of convergence and limiting
 results continue to hold.			      Copyright  2009 The Econometric Society.

Title: Testing Models With Multiple Equilibria by Quantile Methods 
Abstract:
				 This paper proposes a method for testing
 complementarities between explanatory and dependent variables in a large
 class of economic models. The proposed test is based on the monotone
 comparative statics (MCS) property of equilibria. Our main result is that
 MCS produces testable implications on the (small and large) quantiles of
 the dependent variable, despite the presence of multiple equilibria. The
 key features of our approach are that (i) we work with a nonparametric
 structural model of a continuous dependent variable in which the
 unobservable is allowed to be correlated with the explanatory variable in
 a reasonably general way; (ii) we do not require the structural function
 to be known or estimable; (iii) we remain fairly agnostic on how an
 equilibrium is selected. We illustrate the usefulness of our result for
 policy evaluation within Berry, Levinsohn, and Pakes's (1999) model. Copyright  2009 The Econometric Society.

Title: More on Confidence Intervals for Partially Identified Parameters 
Abstract:
