Title: The Unemployment Volatility Puzzle: Is Wage Stickiness the Answer? 
Abstract:
				 I discuss the failure of the canonical
 search and matching model to match the cyclical volatility in the job
 finding rate. I show that job creation in the model is influenced by wages
 in new matches. I summarize microeconometric evidence and find that wages
 in new matches are volatile and consistent with the model's key
 predictions. Therefore, explanations of the unemployment volatility puzzle
 have to preserve the cyclical volatility of wages. I discuss a
 modification of the model, based on fixed matching costs, that can
 increase cyclical unemployment volatility and is consistent with wage
 flexibility in new matches. Copyright  2009 The Econometric Society.

Title: Decision Makers as Statisticians: Diversity, Ambiguity, and Learning 
Abstract:
				 I study individuals who use frequentist
 models to draw uniform inferences from independent and identically
 distributed data. The main contribution of this paper is to show that
 distinct models may be consistent with empirical evidence, even in the
 limit when data increases without bound. Decision makers may then hold
 different beliefs and interpret their environment differently even though
 they know each other's model and base their inferences on the same
 evidence. The behavior modeled here is that of rational individuals
 confronting an environment in which learning is hard, rather than
 individuals beset by cognitive limitations or behavioral biases. Copyright  2009 The Econometric Society.

Title: Inference for Continuous Semimartingales Observed at High Frequency 
Abstract:
				 The econometric literature of high
 frequency data often relies on moment estimators which are derived from
 assuming local constancy of volatility and related quantities. We here
 study this local-constancy approximation as a general approach to
 estimation in such data. We show that the technique yields asymptotic
 properties (consistency, normality) that are correct subject to an ex post
 adjustment involving asymptotic likelihood ratios. These adjustments are
 derived and documented. Several examples of estimation are provided:
 powers of volatility, leverage effect, and integrated betas. The first
 order approximations based on local constancy can be over the period of
 one observation or over blocks of successive observations. It has the
 advantage of gaining in transparency in defining and analyzing estimators.
 The theory relies heavily on the interplay between stable convergence and
 measure change, and on asymptotic expansions for martingales. Copyright  2009 The Econometric Society.

Title: Testing Hypotheses About the Number of Factors in Large Factor Models 
Abstract:
				 In this paper we study high-dimensional
 time series that have the generalized dynamic factor structure. We develop
 a test of the null of k<sub>0</sub> factors against the alternative that
 the number of factors is larger than k<sub>0</sub> but no larger than
 k<sub>1</sub>>k<sub>0</sub>. Our test statistic equals
 max<sub>k<sub>0</sub>>k&les;k<sub>1</sub></sub>(Gamma<sub>k</sub> -
 Gamma<sub>k+1</sub>)(Gamma<sub>k+1</sub> - Gamma<sub>k+2</sub>), where
 Gamma<sub>i</sub> is the ith largest eigenvalue of the smoothed
 periodogram estimate of the spectral density matrix of data at a
 prespecified frequency. We describe the asymptotic distribution of the
 statistic, as the dimensionality and the number of observations rise, as a
 function of the Tracy-Widom distribution and tabulate the critical values
 of the test. As an application, we test different hypotheses about the
 number of dynamic factors in macroeconomic time series and about the
 number of dynamic factors driving excess stock returns.		     Copyright  2009 The Econometric Society.

Title: Identification and Estimation of Triangular Simultaneous Equations Models Without Additivity 
Abstract:
				 This paper uses control variables to
 identify and estimate models with nonseparable, multidimensional
 disturbances. Triangular simultaneous equations models are considered,
 with instruments and disturbances that are independent and a reduced form
 that is strictly monotonic in a scalar disturbance. Here it is shown that
 the conditional cumulative distribution function of the endogenous
 variable given the instruments is a control variable. Also, for any
 control variable, identification results are given for quantile, average,
 and policy effects. Bounds are given when a common support assumption is
 not satisfied. Estimators of identified objects and bounds are provided,
 and a demand analysis empirical example is given. Copyright  2009 The Econometric Society.

Title: Information Percolation With Equilibrium Search Dynamics 
Abstract:
				 We solve for the equilibrium dynamics of
 information sharing in a large population. Each agent is endowed with
 signals regarding the likely outcome of a random variable of common
 concern. Individuals choose the effort with which they search for others
 from whom they can gather additional information. When two agents meet,
 they share their information. The information gathered is further shared
 at subsequent meetings, and so on. Equilibria exist in which agents search
 maximally until they acquire sufficient information precision and then
 search minimally. A tax whose proceeds are used to subsidize the costs of
 search improves information sharing and can, in some cases, increase
 welfare. On the other hand, endowing agents with public signals reduces
 information sharing and can, in some cases, decrease welfare. Copyright  2009 The Econometric Society.

Title: Ambiguity and Second-Order Belief 
Abstract:
				 Anscombe and Aumann (1963) wrote a classic
 characterization of subjective expected utility theory. This paper employs
 the same domain for preference and a closely related (but weaker) set of
 axioms to characterize preferences that use second-order beliefs (beliefs
 over probability measures). Such preferences are of interest because they
 accommodate Ellsberg-type behavior. Copyright  2009 The Econometric Society.

Title: Social Image and the 50-50 Norm: A Theoretical and Experimental Analysis of Audience Effects 
Abstract:
				 A norm of 50-50 division appears to have
 considerable force in a wide range of economic environments, both in the
 real world and in the laboratory. Even in settings where one party
 unilaterally determines the allocation of a prize (the dictator game),
 many subjects voluntarily cede exactly half to another individual. The
 hypothesis that people care about fairness does not by itself account for
 key experimental patterns. We consider an alternative explanation, which
 adds the hypothesis that people like to be perceived as fair. The
 properties of equilibria for the resulting signaling game correspond
 closely to laboratory observations. The theory has additional testable
 implications, the validity of which we confirm through new experiments.     Copyright  2009 The Econometric Society.

Title: Gender Differences in Competition: Evidence From a Matrilineal and a Patriarchal Society 
Abstract:
				 We use a controlled experiment to explore
 whether there are gender differences in selecting into competitive
 environments across two distinct societies: the Maasai in Tanzania and the
 Khasi in India. One unique aspect of these societies is that the Maasai
 represent a textbook example of a patriarchal society, whereas the Khasi
 are matrilineal. Similar to the extant evidence drawn from experiments
 executed in Western cultures, Maasai men opt to compete at roughly twice
 the rate as Maasai women. Interestingly, this result is reversed among the
 Khasi, where women choose the competitive environment more often than
 Khasi men, and even choose to compete weakly more often than Maasai men.
 These results provide insights into the underpinnings of the factors
 hypothesized to be determinants of the observed gender differences in
 selecting into competitive environments. Copyright  2009 The Econometric Society.

Title: Inference in Dynamic Discrete Choice Models With Serially orrelated Unobserved State Variables 
Abstract:
				 This paper develops a method for inference
 in dynamic discrete choice models with serially correlated unobserved
 state variables. Estimation of these models involves computing
 high-dimensional integrals that are present in the solution to the dynamic
 program and in the likelihood function. First, the paper proposes a
 Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo estimation procedure that can handle the
 problem of multidimensional integration in the likelihood function.
 Second, the paper presents an efficient algorithm for solving the dynamic
 program suitable for use in conjunction with the proposed estimation
 procedure. Copyright  2009 The Econometric Society.

Title: Asymptotics for Statistical Treatment Rules 
Abstract:
				 This paper develops asymptotic optimality
 theory for statistical treatment rules in smooth parametric and
 semiparametric models. Manski (2000, 2002, 2004) and Dehejia (2005) have
 argued that the problem of choosing treatments to maximize social welfare
 is distinct from the point estimation and hypothesis testing problems
 usually considered in the treatment effects literature, and advocate
 formal analysis of decision procedures that map empirical data into
 treatment choices. We develop large-sample approximations to statistical
 treatment assignment problems using the limits of experiments framework.
 We then consider some different loss functions and derive treatment
 assignment rules that are asymptotically optimal under average and minmax
 risk criteria. Copyright  2009 The Econometric Society.
