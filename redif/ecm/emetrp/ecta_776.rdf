Title: A Parsimonious Macroeconomic Model for Asset Pricing 
Abstract:
				 I study asset prices in a two-agent
 macroeconomic model with two key features: limited stock market
 participation and heterogeneity in the elasticity of intertemporal
 substitution in consumption (EIS). The model is consistent with some
 prominent features of asset prices, such as a high equity premium,
 relatively smooth interest rates, procyclical stock prices, and
 countercyclical variation in the equity premium, its volatility, and in
 the Sharpe ratio. In this model, the risk-free asset market plays a
 central role by allowing non-stockholders (with low EIS) to smooth the
 fluctuations in their labor income. This process concentrates
 non-stockholders' labor income risk among a small group of stockholders,
 who then demand a high premium for bearing the aggregate equity risk.
 Furthermore, this mechanism is consistent with the very small share of
 aggregate wealth held by non-stockholders in the U.S. data, which has
 proved problematic for previous models with limited participation. I show
 that this large wealth inequality is also important for the model's
 ability to generate a countercyclical equity premium. When it comes to
 business cycle performance, the model's progress has been more limited:
 consumption is still too volatile compared to the data, whereas investment
 is still too smooth. These are important areas for potential improvement
 in this framework. Copyright  2009 The Econometric Society.

Title: Liquidity and Trading Dynamics 
Abstract:
				 In this paper, we build a model where the
 presence of liquidity constraints tends to magnify the economy's response
 to aggregate shocks. We consider a decentralized model of trade, where
 agents may use money or credit to buy goods. When agents do not have
 access to credit and the real value of money balances is low, agents are
 more likely to be liquidity constrained. This makes them more concerned
 about their short-term earning prospects when making their consumption
 decisions and about their short-term spending opportunities when making
 their production decisions. This generates a coordination element in
 spending and production which leads to greater aggregate volatility and
 greater comovement across producers. Copyright  2009 The Econometric Society.

Title: Market Structure and Multiple Equilibria in Airline Markets 
Abstract:
				 We provide a practical method to estimate
 the payoff functions of players in complete information, static, discrete
 games. With respect to the empirical literature on entry games originated
 by Bresnahan and Reiss (1990) and Berry (1992), the main novelty of our
 framework is to allow for general forms of heterogeneity across players
 without making equilibrium selection assumptions. We allow the effects
 that the entry of each individual airline has on the profits of its
 competitors, its "competitive effects," to differ across airlines. The
 identified features of the model are sets of parameters (partial
 identification) such that the choice probabilities predicted by the
 econometric model are consistent with the empirical choice probabilities
 estimated from the data. Copyright  2009 The Econometric Society.

Title: Longevity and Lifetime Labor Supply: Evidence and Implications 
Abstract:
				 Conventional wisdom suggests that
 increased life expectancy had a key role in causing a rise in investment
 in human capital. I incorporate the retirement decision into a version of
 Ben-Porath's (1967) model and find that a necessary condition for this
 causal relationship to hold is that increased life expectancy will also
 increase lifetime labor supply. I then show that this condition does not
 hold for American men born between 1840 and 1970 and for the American
 population born between 1890 and 1970. The data suggest similar patterns
 in Western Europe. I end by discussing the implications of my findings for
 the debate on the fundamental causes of long-run growth. Copyright  2009 The Econometric Society.

Title: Bayesian Estimation of Dynamic Discrete Choice Models 
Abstract:
				 We propose a new methodology for
 structural estimation of infinite horizon dynamic discrete choice models.
 We combine the dynamic programming (DP) solution algorithm with the
 Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm into a single algorithm that
 solves the DP problem and estimates the parameters simultaneously. As a
 result, the computational burden of estimating a dynamic model becomes
 comparable to that of a static model. Another feature of our algorithm is
 that even though the number of grid points on the state variable is small
 per solution-estimation iteration, the number of effective grid points
 increases with the number of estimation iterations. This is how we help
 ease the "curse of dimensionality." We simulate and estimate several
 versions of a simple model of entry and exit to illustrate our
 methodology. We also prove that under standard conditions, the parameters
 converge in probability to the true posterior distribution, regardless of
 the starting values. Copyright  2009 The Econometric Society.

Title: Structural Nonparametric Cointegrating Regression 
Abstract:
				 Nonparametric estimation of a structural
 cointegrating regression model is studied. As in the standard linear
 cointegrating regression model, the regressor and the dependent variable
 are jointly dependent and contemporaneously correlated. In nonparametric
 estimation problems, joint dependence is known to be a major complication
 that affects identification, induces bias in conventional kernel
 estimates, and frequently leads to ill-posed inverse problems. In
 functional cointegrating regressions where the regressor is an integrated
 or near-integrated time series, it is shown here that inverse and
 ill-posed inverse problems do not arise. Instead, simple nonparametric
 kernel estimation of a structural nonparametric cointegrating regression
 is consistent and the limit distribution theory is mixed normal, giving
 straightforward asymptotics that are useable in practical work. It is
 further shown that use of augmented regression, as is common in linear
 cointegration modeling to address endogeneity, does not lead to bias
 reduction in nonparametric regression, but there is an asymptotic gain in
 variance reduction. The results provide a convenient basis for inference
 in structural nonparametric regression with nonstationary time series when
 there is a single integrated or near-integrated regressor. The methods may
 be applied to a range of empirical models where functional estimation of
 cointegrating relations is required. Copyright  2009 The Econometric Society.

Title: Comparative Statics, Informativeness, and the Interval Dominance Order 
Abstract:
				 We identify a new way to order functions,
 called the interval dominance order, that generalizes both the single
 crossing property and a standard condition used in statistical decision
 theory. This allows us to provide a unified treatment of the major
 theorems on monotone comparative statics with and without uncertainty, the
 comparison of signal informativeness, and a non-Bayesian theorem on the
 completeness of increasing decision rules. We illustrate the concept and
 results with various applications, including an application to optimal
 stopping time problems where the single crossing property is typically
 violated.				     Copyright  2009 The Econometric Society.

Title: Observing Unobservables: Identifying Information Asymmetries With a Consumer Credit Field Experiment 
Abstract:
				 Information asymmetries are important in
 theory but difficult to identify in practice. We estimate the presence and
 importance of hidden information and hidden action problems in a consumer
 credit market using a new field experiment methodology. We randomized
 58,000 direct mail offers to former clients of a major South African
 lender along three dimensions: (i) an initial "offer interest rate"
 featured on a direct mail solicitation; (ii) a "contract interest rate"
 that was revealed only after a borrower agreed to the initial offer rate;
 and (ii) a dynamic repayment incentive that was also a surprise and
 extended preferential pricing on future loans to borrowers who remained in
 good standing. These three randomizations, combined with complete
 knowledge of the lender's information set, permit identification of
 specific types of private information problems. Our setup distinguishes
 hidden information effects from selection on the offer rate (via
 unobservable risk and anticipated effort), from hidden action effects (via
 moral hazard in effort) induced by actual contract terms. We find strong
 evidence of moral hazard and weaker evidence of hidden information
 problems. A rough estimate suggests that perhaps 13% to 21% of default is
 due to moral hazard. Asymmetric information thus may help explain the
 prevalence of credit constraints even in a market that specializes in
 financing high-risk borrowers. Copyright  2009 The Econometric Society.

Title: Comments on "Convergence Properties of the Likelihood of Computed Dynamic Models" 
Abstract:
				 We show by counterexample that Proposition
 2 in Fernandez-Villaverde, Rubio-RamÌrez, and Santos (Econometrica (2006),
 74, 93-119) is false. We also show that even if their Proposition 2 were
 corrected, it would be irrelevant for parameter estimates. As a more
 constructive contribution, we consider the effects of approximation error
 on parameter estimation, and conclude that second order approximation
 errors in the policy function have at most second order effects on
 parameter estimates.				     Copyright  2009 The Econometric Society.
