Title: Insider Trading With a Random Deadline 
Abstract:
				 We consider a model of strategic trading
 with asymmetric information of an asset whose value follows a Brownian
 motion. An insider continuously observes a signal that tracks the
 evolution of the asset's fundamental value. The value of the asset is
 publicly revealed at a random time. The equilibrium has two regimes
 separated by an endogenously determined time T. In [0, T), the insider
 gradually transfers her information to the market. By time T, all her
 information has been transferred and the price agrees with the market
 value of the asset. In the interval [T, &infin;), the insider trades large
 volumes and reveals her information immediately, so market prices track
 the market value perfectly. Despite this market efficiency, the insider is
 able to collect strictly positive rents after T.			     Copyright  2010 The Econometric Society.

Title: Mediated Partnerships 
Abstract:
				 This paper studies partnerships that
 employ a mediator to improve their contractual ability. Intuitively,
 profitable deviations must be attributable, that is, there must be some
 group behavior such that an individual can be statistically identified as
 innocent, to provide incentives in partnerships. Mediated partnerships add
 value by effectively using different behavior to attribute different
 deviations. As a result, mediated partnerships are necessary to provide
 the right incentives in a wide range of economic environments. Copyright  2010 The Econometric Society.

Title: Recursive Equilibrium in Stochastic Overlapping-Generations Economies 
Abstract:
				 We prove the generic existence of a
 recursive equilibrium for overlapping-generations economies with
 uncertainty. "Generic" here means in a residual set of utilities and
 endowments. The result holds provided there is a sufficient number of
 potentially different individuals within each cohort. Copyright  2010 The Econometric Society.

Title: Multiple Temptations 
Abstract:
				 We use a preference-over-menus framework
 to model a decision maker who is affected by multiple temptations. Our two
 main axioms on preference-exclusion and inclusion-identify when the agent
 would want to restrict his choice set and when he would want to expand his
 choice set. An agent who is tempted would want to restrict his choice set
 by excluding the normatively worst alternative of that choice set.
 Simultaneously, he would want to expand his choice set by including a
 normatively superior alternative. Our representation identifies the
 agent's normative preference and temptations, and suggests the agent is
 uncertain which of these temptations will affect him. We provide examples
 to illustrate how our model improves on those of Gul and Pesendorfer
 (2001) and Dekel, Lipman, and Rustichini (2009).			     Copyright  2010 The Econometric Society.

Title: Evaluating Marginal Policy Changes and the Average Effect of Treatment for Individuals at the Margin 
Abstract:
				 This paper develops methods for evaluating
 marginal policy changes. We characterize how the effects of marginal
 policy changes depend on the direction of the policy change, and show that
 marginal policy effects are fundamentally easier to identify and to
 estimate than conventional treatment parameters. We develop the connection
 between marginal policy effects and the average effect of treatment for
 persons on the margin of indifference between participation in treatment
 and nonparticipation, and use this connection to analyze both parameters.
 We apply our analysis to estimate the effect of marginal changes in
 tuition on the return to going to college. Copyright  2010 The Econometric Society.

Title: Copulas and Temporal Dependence 
Abstract:
				 An emerging literature in time series
 econometrics concerns the modeling of potentially nonlinear temporal
 dependence in stationary Markov chains using copula functions. We obtain
 sufficient conditions for a geometric rate of mixing in models of this
 kind. Geometric &beta;-mixing is established under a rather strong
 sufficient condition that rules out asymmetry and tail dependence in the
 copula function. Geometric &rho;-mixing is obtained under a weaker
 condition that permits both asymmetry and tail dependence. We verify one
 or both of these conditions for a range of parametric copula functions
 that are popular in applied work.			        Copyright  2010 The Econometric Society.

Title: State Capacity, Conflict, and Development 
Abstract:
				 The absence of state capacities to raise
 revenue and to support markets is a key factor in explaining the
 persistence of weak states. This paper reports on an ongoing project to
 investigate the incentive to invest in such capacities. The paper sets out
 a simple analytical structure in which state capacities are modeled as
 forward looking investments by government. The approach highlights some
 determinants of state building including the risk of external or internal
 conflict, the degree of political instability, and dependence on natural
 resources. Throughout, we link these state capacity investments to
 patterns of development and growth. Copyright  2010 The Econometric Society.

Title: What Drives Media Slant? Evidence From U.S. Daily Newspapers 
Abstract:
				 We construct a new index of media slant
 that measures the similarity of a news outlet's language to that of a
 congressional Republican or Democrat. We estimate a model of newspaper
 demand that incorporates slant explicitly, estimate the slant that would
 be chosen if newspapers independently maximized their own profits, and
 compare these profit-maximizing points with firms' actual choices. We find
 that readers have an economically significant preference for like-minded
 news. Firms respond strongly to consumer preferences, which account for
 roughly 20 percent of the variation in measured slant in our sample. By
 contrast, the identity of a newspaper's owner explains far less of the
 variation in slant. Copyright  2010 The Econometric Society.

Title: Large Risks, Limited Liability, and Dynamic Moral Hazard 
Abstract:
				 We study a continuous-time principal-agent
 model in which a risk-neutral agent with limited liability must exert
 unobservable effort to reduce the likelihood of large but relatively
 infrequent losses. Firm size can be decreased at no cost or increased
 subject to adjustment costs. In the optimal contract, investment takes
 place only if a long enough period of time elapses with no losses
 occurring. Then, if good performance continues, the agent is paid. As soon
 as a loss occurs, payments to the agent are suspended, and so is
 investment if further losses occur. Accumulated bad performance leads to
 downsizing. We derive explicit formulae for the dynamics of firm size and
 its asymptotic growth rate, and we provide conditions under which firm
 size eventually goes to zero or grows without bounds. Copyright  2010 The Econometric Society.

Title: Inference for Parameters Defined by Moment Inequalities Using Generalized Moment Selection 
Abstract:
				 The topic of this paper is inference in
 models in which parameters are defined by moment inequalities and/or
 equalities. The parameters may or may not be identified. This paper
 introduces a new class of confidence sets and tests based on generalized
 moment selection (GMS). GMS procedures are shown to have correct
 asymptotic size in a uniform sense and are shown not to be asymptotically
 conservative. Copyright  2010 The Econometric Society.

Title: Binary Response Models for Panel Data: Identification and Information 
Abstract:
				 This paper considers a panel data model
 for predicting a binary outcome. The conditional probability of a positive
 response is obtained by evaluating a given distribution function (F) at a
 linear combination of the predictor variables. One of the predictor
 variables is unobserved. It is a random effect that varies across
 individuals but is constant over time. The semiparametric aspect is that
 the conditional distribution of the random effect, given the predictor
 variables, is unrestricted.				       Copyright  2010 The Econometric Society.

Title: Inference for the Identified Set in Partially Identified Econometric Models 
Abstract:
				 This paper provides computationally
 intensive, yet feasible methods for inference in a very general class of
 partially identified econometric models. Let P denote the distribution of
 the observed data. The class of models we consider is defined by a
 population objective function Q(&theta;, P) for &theta; is an element of
 &Theta;. The point of departure from the classical extremum estimation
 framework is that it is not assumed that Q(&theta;, P) has a unique
 minimizer in the parameter space &Theta;. The goal may be either to draw
 inferences about some unknown point in the set of minimizers of the
 population objective function or to draw inferences about the set of
 minimizers itself. In this paper, the object of interest is
 &Theta;<sub>0</sub>(P)=argmin<sub>&theta; is an element of
 &Theta;</sub>Q(&theta;, P), and so we seek random sets that contain this
 set with at least some prespecified probability asymptotically. We also
 consider situations where the object of interest is the image of
 &Theta;<sub>0</sub>(P) under a known function. Random sets that satisfy
 the desired coverage property are constructed under weak assumptions.
 Conditions are provided under which the confidence regions are
 asymptotically valid not only pointwise in P, but also uniformly in P. We
 illustrate the use of our methods with an empirical study of the impact of
 top-coding outcomes on inferences about the parameters of a linear
 regression. Finally, a modest simulation study sheds some light on the
 finite-sample behavior of our procedure.			     Copyright  2010 The Econometric Society.

Title: A Model of Delegated Project Choice 
Abstract:
				 We present a model in which a principal
 delegates the choice of project to an agent with different preferences.
 The principal determines the set of projects from which the agent may
 choose. The principal can verify the characteristics of the project chosen
 by the agent, but does not know which other projects were available to the
 agent. We consider situations where the collection of available projects
 is exogenous to the agent but uncertain, where the agent must invest
 effort to discover a project, where the principal can pay the agent to
 choose a desirable project, and where the principal can adopt more complex
 schemes than simple permission sets. Copyright  2010 The Econometric Society.
