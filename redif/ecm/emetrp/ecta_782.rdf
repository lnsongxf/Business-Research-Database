Title: Learning-by-Doing, Organizational Forgetting, and Industry Dynamics 
Abstract:
				 Learning-by-doing and organizational
 forgetting are empirically important in a variety of industrial settings.
 This paper provides a general model of dynamic competition that accounts
 for these fundamentals and shows how they shape industry structure and
 dynamics. We show that forgetting does not simply negate learning. Rather,
 they are distinct economic forces that interact in subtle ways to produce
 a great variety of pricing behaviors and industry dynamics. In particular,
 a model with learning and forgetting can give rise to aggressive pricing
 behavior, varying degrees of long-run industry concentration ranging from
 moderate leadership to absolute dominance, and multiple equilibria. Copyright  2010 The Econometric Society.

Title: An Equilibrium Theory of Learning, Search, and Wages 
Abstract:
				 We examine the labor market effects of
 incomplete information about the workers' own job-finding process. Search
 outcomes convey valuable information, and learning from search generates
 endogenous heterogeneity in workers' beliefs about their job-finding
 probability. We characterize this process and analyze its interactions
 with job creation and wage determination. Our theory sheds new light on
 how unemployment can affect workers' labor market outcomes and wage
 determination, providing a rational explanation for discouragement as the
 consequence of negative search outcomes. In particular, longer
 unemployment durations are likely to be followed by lower reemployment
 wages because a worker's beliefs about his job-finding process deteriorate
 with unemployment duration. Moreover, our analysis provides a set of
 useful results on dynamic programming with optimal learning. Copyright  2010 The Econometric Society.

Title: Sorting and Decentralized Price Competition 
Abstract:
				 We investigate the role of search
 frictions in markets with price competition and how it leads to sorting of
 heterogeneous agents. There are two aspects of value creation: the match
 value when two agents actually trade and the probability of trading
 governed by the search technology. We show that positive assortative
 matching obtains when complementarities in the former outweigh
 complementarities in the latter. This happens if and only if the
 match-value function is root-supermodular, that is, its nth root is
 supermodular, where n reflects the elasticity of substitution of the
 search technology. This condition is weaker than the condition required
 for positive assortative matching in markets with random search.	     Copyright  2010 The Econometric Society.

Title: Instrumental Variable Models for Discrete Outcomes 
Abstract:
				 Single equation instrumental variable
 models for discrete outcomes are shown to be set identifying, not point
 identifying, for the structural functions that deliver the values of the
 discrete outcome. Bounds on identified sets are derived for a general
 nonparametric model and sharp set identification is demonstrated in the
 binary outcome case. Point identification is typically not achieved by
 imposing parametric restrictions. The extent of an identified set varies
 with the strength and support of instruments, and typically shrinks as the
 support of a discrete outcome grows. The paper extends the analysis of
 structural quantile functions with endogenous arguments to cases in which
 there are discrete outcomes. Copyright  2010 The Econometric Society.

Title: Solving the Feldstein-Horioka Puzzle With Financial Frictions 
Abstract:
				 Unlike the prediction of a frictionless
 open economy model, long-term average savings and investment rates are
 highly correlated across countries-a puzzle first identified by Feldstein
 and Horioka (1980). We quantitatively investigate the impact of two types
 of financial frictions on this correlation. One is limited enforcement,
 where contracts are enforced by the threat of default penalties. The other
 is limited spanning, where the only asset available is noncontingent
 bonds. We find that the calibrated model with both frictions produces a
 savings-investment correlation and a volume of capital flows close to the
 data. To solve the puzzle, the limited enforcement friction needs low
 default penalties under which capital flows are much lower than those in
 the data, and the limited spanning friction needs to exogenously restrict
 capital flows to the observed level. When combined, the two frictions
 interact to endogenously restrict capital flows and thereby solve the
 Feldstein-Horioka puzzle.			        Copyright  2010 The Econometric Society.

Title: Axioms for Deferred Acceptance 
Abstract:
				 The deferred acceptance algorithm is often
 used to allocate indivisible objects when monetary transfers are not
 allowed. We provide two characterizations of agent-proposing deferred
 acceptance allocation rules. Two new axioms-individually rational
 monotonicity and weak Maskin monotonicity-are essential to our analysis.
 An allocation rule is the agent-proposing deferred acceptance rule for
 some acceptant substitutable priority if and only if it satisfies
 non-wastefulness and individually rational monotonicity. An alternative
 characterization is in terms of non-wastefulness, population monotonicity,
 and weak Maskin monotonicity. We also offer an axiomatization of the
 deferred acceptance rule generated by an exogenously specified priority
 structure. We apply our results to characterize efficient deferred
 acceptance rules. Copyright  2010 The Econometric Society.

Title: Framing Contingencies 
Abstract:
				 The subjective likelihood of a contingency
 often depends on the manner in which it is described to the decision
 maker. To accommodate this dependence, we introduce a model of decision
 making under uncertainty that takes as primitive a family of preferences
 indexed by partitions of the state space. Each partition corresponds to a
 description of the state space. We characterize the following
 partition-dependent expected utility representation. The decision maker
 has a nonadditive set function &nu; over events. Given a partition of the
 state space, she computes expected utility with respect to her
 partition-dependent belief, which weights each cell in the partition by
 &nu;. Nonadditivity of &nu; allows the probability of an event to depend
 on the way in which the state space is described. We propose behavioral
 definitions for those events that are transparent to the decision maker
 and those that are completely overlooked, and connect these definitions to
 conditions on the representation.				    Copyright  2010 The Econometric Society.

Title: Constructing Optimal Instruments by First-Stage Prediction Averaging 
Abstract:
				 This paper considers model averaging as a
 way to construct optimal instruments for the two-stage least squares
 (2SLS), limited information maximum likelihood (LIML), and Fuller
 estimators in the presence of many instruments. We propose averaging
 across least squares predictions of the endogenous variables obtained from
 many different choices of instruments and then use the average predicted
 value of the endogenous variables in the estimation stage. The weights for
 averaging are chosen to minimize the asymptotic mean squared error of the
 model averaging version of the 2SLS, LIML, or Fuller estimator. This can
 be done by solving a standard quadratic programming problem. Copyright  2010 The Econometric Society.

Title: A Dynamic Model for Binary Panel Data With Unobserved Heterogeneity Admitting a &radic;n-Consistent Conditional Estimator  				 
Abstract:
				 A model for binary panel data is
 introduced which allows for state dependence and unobserved heterogeneity
 beyond the effect of available covariates. The model is of quadratic
 exponential type and its structure closely resembles that of the dynamic
 logit model. However, it has the advantage of being easily estimable via
 conditional likelihood with at least two observations (further to an
 initial observation) and even in the presence of time dummies among the
 regressors. Copyright  2010 The Econometric Society.

Title: Bootstrap Inference in Partially Identified Models Defined by Moment Inequalities: Coverage of the Identified Set 
Abstract:
				 This paper introduces a novel bootstrap
 procedure to perform inference in a wide class of partially identified
 econometric models. We consider econometric models defined by finitely
 many weak moment inequalities, 				   -super-2
					 which encompass many applications
 of economic interest. The objective of our inferential procedure is to
 cover the identified set with a prespecified probability.		   
		    -super-3					     We
 compare our bootstrap procedure, a competing asymptotic approximation, and
 subsampling procedures in terms of the rate at which they achieve the
 desired coverage level, also known as the error in the coverage
 probability. Under certain conditions, we show that our bootstrap
 procedure and the asymptotic approximation have the same order of error in
 the coverage probability, which is smaller than that obtained by using
 subsampling. This implies that inference based on our bootstrap and
 asymptotic approximation should eventually be more precise than inference
 based on subsampling. A Monte Carlo study confirms this finding in a small
 sample simulation.			        Copyright  2010 The Econometric Society.

				 A decision maker (DM) is characterized by

Title: The Dynamic Pivot Mechanism 
Abstract:
				 We consider truthful implementation of the
 socially efficient allocation in an independent private-value environment
 in which agents receive private information over time. We propose a
 suitable generalization of the pivot mechanism, based on the marginal
 contribution of each agent. In the dynamic pivot mechanism, the ex post
 incentive and ex post participation constraints are satisfied for all
 agents after all histories. In an environment with diverse preferences it
 is the unique mechanism satisfying ex post incentive, ex post
 participation, and efficient exit conditions. Copyright  2010 The Econometric Society.

Title: Mechanism Games With Multiple Principals and Three or More Agents 
Abstract:
				 We consider a class of mechanism games in
 which there are multiple principals and three or more agents. For a
 mechanism game in this class, a sort of folk theorem holds: there is a
 threshold value for each of the principals such that an allocation is
 achieved at a pure-strategy sequential equilibrium of the game if and only
 if (i) it is incentive compatible and (ii) it attains an expected utility
 for each principal that is greater than or equal to the threshold value
 for the principal. Copyright  2010 The Econometric Society.

Title: Solving, Estimating, and Selecting Nonlinear Dynamic Models Without the Curse of Dimensionality 
Abstract:
				 We present a comprehensive framework for
 Bayesian estimation of structural nonlinear dynamic economic models on
 sparse grids to overcome the curse of dimensionality for approximations.
 We apply sparse grids to a global polynomial approximation of the model
 solution, to the quadrature of integrals arising as rational expectations,
 and to three new nonlinear state space filters which speed up the
 sequential importance resampling particle filter. The posterior of the
 structural parameters is estimated by a new Metropolis-Hastings algorithm
 with mixing parallel sequences. The parallel extension improves the global
 maximization property of the algorithm, simplifies the parameterization
 for an appropriate acceptance ratio, and allows a simple implementation of
 the estimation on parallel computers. Finally, we provide all algorithms
 in the open source software JBendge for the solution and estimation of a
 general class of models. Copyright  2010 The Econometric Society.

Title: Strongly Consistent Self-Confirming Equilibrium 
Abstract:
				 Fudenberg and Levine (1993a) introduced
 the notion of self-confirming equilibrium, which is generally less
 restrictive than Nash equilibrium. Fudenberg and Levine also defined a
 concept of consistency, and claimed in their Theorem 4 that with
 consistency and other conditions on beliefs, a self-confirming equilibrium
 has a Nash equilibrium outcome. We provide a counterexample that disproves
 Theorem 4 and prove an alternative by replacing consistency with a more
 restrictive concept, which we call strong consistency. In games with
 observed deviators, self-confirming equilibria are strongly consistent
 self-confirming equilibria. Hence, our alternative theorem ensures that
 despite the counterexample, the corollary of Theorem 4 is still valid.      Copyright  2010 The Econometric Society.

Title: Sequential Estimation of Dynamic Discrete Games: A Comment 
Abstract:
				 Recursive procedures which are based on
 iterating on the best response mapping have difficulties converging to all
 equilibria in multi-player games. We illustrate these difficulties by
 revisiting the asymptotic properties of the iterative nested pseudo
 maximum likelihood method for estimating dynamic games introduced by
 Aguirregabiria and Mira (2007). An example shows that the iterative method
 may not be consistent. Copyright  2010 The Econometric Society.
