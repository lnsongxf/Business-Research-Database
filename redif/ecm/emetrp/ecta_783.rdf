Title: The Role of Information in Repeated Games With Frequent Actions 
Abstract:
				 We show that in repeated interactions the
 avenues for effective provision of incentives depend crucially on the type
 of information players observe. We establish this conclusion for general
 repeated two-player games in which information arrives via a
 continuous-time stationary process that has a continuous multidimensional
 Brownian component and a Poisson component, and in which the players act
 frequently. The Poisson jumps can be used to effectively provide
 incentives both with transfers and value burning, while continuous
 Brownian information can be used to provide incentives only with
 transfers. Copyright  2010 The Econometric Society.

Title: Estimating the Technology of Cognitive and Noncognitive Skill Formation 
Abstract:
				 This paper formulates and estimates
 multistage production functions for children's cognitive and noncognitive
 skills. Skills are determined by parental environments and investments at
 different stages of childhood. We estimate the elasticity of substitution
 between investments in one period and stocks of skills in that period to
 assess the benefits of early investment in children compared to later
 remediation. We establish nonparametric identification of a general class
 of production technologies based on nonlinear factor models with
 endogenous inputs. A by-product of our approach is a framework for
 evaluating childhood and schooling interventions that does not rely on
 arbitrarily scaled test scores as outputs and recognizes the differential
 effects of the same bundle of skills in different tasks. Using the
 estimated technology, we determine optimal targeting of interventions to
 children with different parental and personal birth endowments.
 Substitutability decreases in later stages of the life cycle in the
 production of cognitive skills. It is roughly constant across stages of
 the life cycle in the production of noncognitive skills. This finding has
 important implications for the design of policies that target the
 disadvantaged. For most configurations of disadvantage it is optimal to
 invest relatively more in the early stages of childhood than in later
 stages. Copyright  2010 The Econometric Society.

Title: Learning While Voting: Determinants of Collective Experimentation 
Abstract:
				 This paper combines dynamic social choice
 and strategic experimentation to study the following question: How does a
 society, a committee, or, more generally, a group of individuals with
 potentially heterogeneous preferences, experiment with new opportunities?
 Each voter recognizes that, during experimentation, other voters also
 learn about their preferences. As a result, pivotal voters today are
 biased against experimentation because it reduces their likelihood of
 remaining pivotal. This phenomenon reduces equilibrium experimentation
 below the socially efficient level, and may even result in a negative
 option value of experimentation. However, one can restore efficiency by
 designing a voting rule that depends deterministically on time. Another
 main result is that even when payoffs of a reform are independently
 distributed across the population, good news about any individual's payoff
 increases other individuals' incentives to experiment with that reform,
 due to a positive voting externality. Copyright  2010 The Econometric Society.

Title: Fear of Miscoordination and the Robustness of Cooperation in Dynamic Global Games With Exit 
Abstract:
				 This paper develops a framework to assess
 how fear of miscoordination affects the sustainability of cooperation.
 Building on theoretical insights from Carlsson and van Damme (1993), it
 explores the effect of small amounts of private information on a class of
 dynamic cooperation games with exit. Lack of common knowledge leads
 players to second guess each other's behavior and makes coordination
 difficult. This restricts the range of equilibria and highlights the role
 of miscoordination payoffs in determining whether cooperation is
 sustainable or not. The paper characterizes the range of perfect Bayesian
 equilibria as the players' information becomes arbitrarily precise. Unlike
 in one-shot two-by-two games, the global games information structure does
 not yield equilibrium uniqueness. Copyright  2010 The Econometric Society.

Title: Signal Orderings Based on Dispersion and the Supply of Private Information in Auctions 
Abstract:
				 This paper provides a novel approach to
 ordering signals based on the property that more informative signals lead
 to greater variability of conditional expectations. We define two nested
 information criteria (supermodular precision and integral precision) by
 combining this approach with two variability orders (dispersive and convex
 orders). We relate precision criteria with orderings based on the value of
 information to a decision maker. We then use precision to study the
 incentives of an auctioneer to supply private information. Using integral
 precision, we obtain two results: (i) a more precise signal yields a more
 efficient allocation; (ii) the auctioneer provides less than the efficient
 level of information. Supermodular precision allows us to extend the
 previous analysis to the case in which supplying information is costly and
 to obtain an additional finding; (iii) there is a complementarity between
 information and competition, so that both the socially efficient and the
 auctioneer's optimal choice of precision increase with the number of
 bidders. Copyright  2010 The Econometric Society.

Title: Optimal Mandates and the Welfare Cost of Asymmetric Information: Evidence From the U.K. Annuity Market 
Abstract:
				 Much of the extensive empirical literature
 on insurance markets has focused on whether adverse selection can be
 detected. Once detected, however, there has been little attempt to
 quantify its welfare cost or to assess whether and what potential
 government interventions may reduce these costs. To do so, we develop a
 model of annuity contract choice and estimate it using data from the U.K.
 annuity market. The model allows for private information about mortality
 risk as well as heterogeneity in preferences over different contract
 options. We focus on the choice of length of guarantee among individuals
 who are required to buy annuities. The results suggest that asymmetric
 information along the guarantee margin reduces welfare relative to a
 first-best symmetric information benchmark by about &pound;127 million per
 year or about 2 percent of annuitized wealth. We also find that by
 requiring that individuals choose the longest guarantee period allowed,
 mandates could achieve the first-best allocation. However, we estimate
 that other mandated guarantee lengths would have detrimental effects on
 welfare. Since determining the optimal mandate is empirically difficult,
 our findings suggest that achieving welfare gains through mandatory social
 insurance may be harder in practice than simple theory may suggest. Copyright  2010 The Econometric Society.

Title: Quantile and Probability Curves Without Crossing 
Abstract:
				 This paper proposes a method to address
 the longstanding problem of lack of monotonicity in estimation of
 conditional and structural quantile functions, also known as the quantile
 crossing problem (Bassett and Koenker (1982)). The method consists in
 sorting or monotone rearranging the original estimated non-monotone curve
 into a monotone rearranged curve. We show that the rearranged curve is
 closer to the true quantile curve than the original curve in finite
 samples, establish a functional delta method for rearrangement-related
 operators, and derive functional limit theory for the entire rearranged
 curve and its functionals. We also establish validity of the bootstrap for
 estimating the limit law of the entire rearranged curve and its
 functionals. Our limit results are generic in that they apply to every
 estimator of a monotone function, provided that the estimator satisfies a
 functional central limit theorem and the function satisfies some
 smoothness conditions. Consequently, our results apply to estimation of
 other econometric functions with monotonicity restrictions, such as
 demand, production, distribution, and structural distribution functions.
 We illustrate the results with an application to estimation of structural
 distribution and quantile functions using data on Vietnam veteran status
 and earnings. Copyright  2010 The Econometric Society.

Title: Existence and Uniqueness of a Fixed Point for Local Contractions 
Abstract:
				 This paper proves the existence and
 uniqueness of a fixed point for local contractions without assuming the
 family of contraction coefficients to be uniformly bounded away from 1.
 More importantly it shows how this fixed-point result can apply to study
 the existence and uniqueness of solutions to some recursive equations that
 arise in economic dynamics. Copyright  2010 The Econometric Society.

Title: Does Experience Teach? Professionals and Minimax Play in the Lab 
Abstract:
				 Does expertise in strategic behavior
 obtained in the field transfer to the abstract setting of the laboratory?
 Palacios-Huerta and Volij (2008) argued that the behavior of professional
 soccer players in mixed-strategy games conforms closely to minimax play,
 while the behavior of students (who are presumably novices in strategic
 situations requiring unpredictability) does not. We reexamine their data,
 showing that the play of professionals is inconsistent with the minimax
 hypothesis in several respects: (i) professionals follow nonstationary
 mixtures, with action frequencies that are negatively correlated between
 the first and the second half of the experiment, (ii) professionals tend
 to switch between under- and overplaying an action relative to its
 equilibrium frequency, and (iii) the distribution of action frequencies
 across professionals is far from the distribution implied by minimax. In
 each respect, the behavior of students conforms more closely to the
 minimax hypothesis. Copyright  2010 The Econometric Society.

Title: Corrigendum to "Games With Imperfectly Observable Actions in Continuous Time" 
Abstract:
				 Sannikov (2007) investigated properties of
 perfect public equilibria in continuous-time repeated games. This note
 points out that the proof of Lemma 6, required for the proof of the main
 theorem (Theorem 2), contains an error in computing a Hessian matrix. A
 correct proof of Lemma 6 is provided using an additional innocuous
 assumption and a generalized version of Lemma 5. Copyright  2010 The Econometric Society.
