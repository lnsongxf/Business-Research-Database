Title: Noncontractible Heterogeneity in Directed Search 
Abstract:
				 This paper provides a directed search
 model designed to explain the residual part of wage variation left over
 after the impact of education and other observable worker characteristics
 have been removed. Workers have private information about their
 characteristics at the time they apply for jobs. Firms value these
 characteristics differently and can observe them once workers apply. They
 hire the worker they most prefer. However, the characteristics are not
 contractible, so firms cannot condition their wages on them. This paper
 shows how to extend arguments from directed search to handle this,
 allowing for arbitrary distributions of worker and firm types. The model
 is used to provide a functional relationship that ties together the wage
 distribution and the wage-duration function. This relationship provides a
 testable implication of the model. This relationship suggests a common
 property of wage distributions that guarantees that workers who leave
 unemployment at the highest wages also have the shortest unemployment
 duration. This is in strict contrast to the usual (and somewhat
 implausible) directed search story in which high wages are always
 accompanied by higher probability of unemployment. Copyright  2010 The Econometric Society.

Title: Incentive Problems With Unidimensional Hidden Characteristics: A Unified Approach 
Abstract:
				 This paper develops a technique for
 studying incentive problems with unidimensional hidden characteristics in
 a way that is independent of whether the type set is finite, the type
 distribution has a continuous density, or the type distribution has both
 mass points and an atomless part. By this technique, the proposition that
 optimal incentive schemes induce no distortion "at the top" and downward
 distortions "below the top" is extended to arbitrary type distributions.
 However, mass points in the interior of the type set require pooling with
 adjacent higher types and, unless there are other complications, a
 discontinuous jump in the transition from adjacent lower types. Copyright  2010 The Econometric Society.

Title: Inequality and Unemployment in a Global Economy 
Abstract:
				 This paper develops a new framework for
 examining the determinants of wage distributions that emphasizes
 within-industry reallocation, labor market frictions, and differences in
 workforce composition across firms. More productive firms pay higher wages
 and exporting increases the wage paid by a firm with a given productivity.
 The opening of trade enhances wage inequality and can either raise or
 reduce unemployment. While wage inequality is higher in a trade
 equilibrium than in autarky, gradual trade liberalization first increases
 and later decreases inequality. Copyright  2010 The Econometric Society.

Title: A Unique Costly Contemplation Representation 
Abstract:
				 We study preferences over menus which can
 be represented as if the individual is uncertain of her tastes, but is
 able to engage in costly contemplation before selecting an alternative
 from a menu. Since contemplation is costly, our key axiom, aversion to
 contingent planning, reflects the individual's preference to learn the
 menu from which she will be choosing prior to engaging in contemplation
 about her tastes for the alternatives. Our representation models
 contemplation strategies as subjective signals over a subjective state
 space. The subjectivity of the state space and the information structure
 in our representation makes it difficult to identify them from the
 preference. To overcome this issue, we show that each signal can be
 modeled in reduced form as a measure over ex post utility functions
 without reference to a state space. We show that in this reduced-form
 representation, the set of measures and their costs are uniquely
 identified. Finally, we provide a measure of comparative contemplation
 costs and characterize the special case of our representation where
 contemplation is costless. Copyright  2010 The Econometric Society.

Title: Foundations of Intrinsic Habit Formation 
Abstract:
				 We provide theoretical foundations for
 several common (nested) representations of intrinsic linear habit
 formation. Our axiomatization introduces an intertemporal theory of
 weaning a decision-maker from her habits using the device of compensation.
 We clarify differences across specifications of the model, provide
 measures of habit-forming tendencies, and suggest methods for axiomatizing
 time-nonseparable preferences. Copyright  2010 The Econometric Society.

Title: Risk and Rationality: Uncovering Heterogeneity in Probability Distortion 
Abstract:
				 It has long been recognized that there is
 considerable heterogeneity in individual risk taking behavior, but little
 is known about the distribution of risk taking types. We present a
 parsimonious characterization of risk taking behavior by estimating a
 finite mixture model for three different experimental data sets, two Swiss
 and one Chinese, over a large number of real gains and losses. We find two
 major types of individuals: In all three data sets, the choices of roughly
 80% of the subjects exhibit significant deviations from linear probability
 weighting of varying strength, consistent with prospect theory. Twenty
 percent of the subjects weight probabilities near linearly and behave
 essentially as expected value maximizers. Moreover, individuals are
 cleanly assigned to one type with probabilities close to unity. The
 reliability and robustness of our classification suggest using a mix of
 preference theories in applied economic modeling. Copyright  2010 The Econometric Society.

Title: What Happens in the Field Stays in the Field: Exploring Whether Professionals Play Minimax in Laboratory Experiments 
Abstract:
				 The minimax argument represents game
 theory in its most elegant form: simple but with stark predictions.
 Although some of these predictions have been met with reasonable success
 in the field, experimental data have generally not provided results close
 to the theoretical predictions. In a striking study, Palacios-Huerta and
 Volij (				    2008) presented evidence that
 potentially resolves this puzzle: both amateur and professional soccer
 players play nearly exact minimax strategies in laboratory experiments. In
 this paper, we establish important bounds on these results by examining
 the behavior of four distinct subject pools: college students, bridge
 professionals, world-class poker players, who have vast experience with
 high-stakes randomization in card games, and American professional soccer
 players. In contrast to Palacios-Huerta and Volij's results, we find
 little evidence that real-world experience transfers to the lab in these
 games-indeed, similar to previous experimental results, all four subject
 pools provide choices that are generally not close to minimax predictions.
 We use two additional pieces of evidence to explore why professionals do
 not perform well in the lab: (i) complementary experimental treatments
 that pit professionals against preprogrammed computers and (ii)
 post-experiment questionnaires. The most likely explanation is that these
 professionals are unable to transfer their skills at randomization from
 the familiar context of the field to the unfamiliar context of the lab.     Copyright  2010 The Econometric Society.

Title: Can Relaxation of Beliefs Rationalize the Winner's Curse?: An Experimental Study 
Abstract:
				 We use a second-price common-value
 auction, called the maximal game, to experimentally study whether the
 winner's curse (WC) can be explained by models which retain best-response
 behavior but allow for inconsistent beliefs. We compare behavior in a
 regular version of the maximal game, where the WC can be explained by
 inconsistent beliefs, to behavior in versions where such explanations are
 less plausible. We find little evidence of differences in behavior.
 Overall, our study casts a serious doubt on theories that posit the WC is
 driven by beliefs.				   Copyright  2010 The Econometric Society.
