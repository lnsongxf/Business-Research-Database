Title: Last-In First-Out Oligopoly Dynamics 
Abstract:
				 This paper extends the static analysis of
 oligopoly structure into an infinite-horizon setting with sunk costs and
 demand uncertainty. The observation that exit rates decline with firm age
 motivates the assumption of last-in first-out dynamics: An entrant expects
 to produce no longer than any incumbent. This selects an essentially
 unique Markov-perfect equilibrium. With mild restrictions on the demand
 shocks, sequences of thresholds describe firms' equilibrium entry and
 survival decisions. Bresnahan and Reiss' (1993) empirical analysis of
 oligopolists' entry and exit assumes that such thresholds govern the
 evolution of the number of competitors. Our analysis provides an
 infinite-horizon game-theoretic foundation for that structure. Copyright  2010 The Econometric Society.

Title: Identification and Estimation of a Discrete Game of Complete Information 
Abstract:
				 We discuss the identification and
 estimation of discrete games of complete information. Following Bresnahan
 and Reiss (1990, 1991), a discrete game is a generalization of a standard
 discrete choice model where utility depends on the actions of other
 players. Using recent algorithms to compute all of the Nash equilibria to
 a game, we propose simulation-based estimators for static, discrete games.
 We demonstrate that the model is identified under weak functional form
 assumptions using exclusion restrictions and an identification at infinity
 approach. Monte Carlo evidence demonstrates that the estimator can perform
 well in moderately sized samples. As an application, we study entry
 decisions by construction contractors to bid on highway projects in
 California. We find that an equilibrium is more likely to be observed if
 it maximizes joint profits, has a higher Nash product, uses mixed
 strategies, and is not Pareto dominated by another equilibrium. Copyright  2010 The Econometric Society.

Title: Nonparametric Identification and Estimation of Nonadditive Hedonic Models 
Abstract:
				 This paper studies the identification and
 estimation of preferences and technologies in equilibrium hedonic models.
 In it, we identify nonparametric structural relationships with nonadditive
 heterogeneity. We determine what features of hedonic models can be
 identified from equilibrium observations in a single market under weak
 assumptions about the available information. We then consider use of
 additional information about structural functions and heterogeneity
 distributions. Separability conditions facilitate identification of
 consumer marginal utility and firm marginal product functions. We also
 consider how identification is facilitated using multimarket data. Copyright  2010 The Econometric Society.

Title: The Coalitional Nash Bargaining Solution 
Abstract:
				 The coalitional Nash bargaining solution
 is defined to be the core allocation for which the product of players'
 payoffs is maximal. We consider a non-cooperative model with discounting
 in which one team may form and every player is randomly selected to make a
 proposal in every period. The grand team, consisting of all players,
 generates the largest surplus. But a smaller team may form. We show that
 as players get more patient if an efficient and stationary equilibrium
 exists, it must deliver payoffs that correspond to the coalitional Nash
 bargaining solution. We also characterize when an efficient and stationary
 equilibrium exists, which requires conditions that go beyond the
 nonemptiness of the core. Copyright  2010 The Econometric Society.

Title: Asymptotic Equivalence of Probabilistic Serial and Random Priority Mechanisms 
Abstract:
				 The random priority (random serial
 dictatorship) mechanism is a common method for assigning objects. The
 mechanism is easy to implement and strategy-proof. However, this mechanism
 is inefficient, because all agents may be made better off by another
 mechanism that increases their chances of obtaining more preferred
 objects. This form of inefficiency is eliminated by a mechanism called
 probabilistic serial, but this mechanism is not strategy-proof. Thus,
 which mechanism to employ in practical applications is an open question.
 We show that these mechanisms become equivalent when the market becomes
 large. More specifically, given a set of object types, the random
 assignments in these mechanisms converge to each other as the number of
 copies of each object type approaches infinity. Thus, the inefficiency of
 the random priority mechanism becomes small in large markets. Our result
 gives some rationale for the common use of the random priority mechanism
 in practical problems such as student placement in public schools. Copyright  2010 The Econometric Society.

Title: Repeated Games Where the Payoffs and Monitoring Structure Are Unknown 
Abstract:
				 This paper studies repeated games with
 imperfect public monitoring where the players are uncertain both about the
 payoff functions and about the relationship between the distribution of
 signals and the actions played. We introduce the concept of perfect public
 ex post equilibrium (PPXE), and show that it can be characterized with an
 extension of the techniques used to study perfect public equilibria. We
 develop identifiability conditions that are sufficient for a folk theorem;
 these conditions imply that there are PPXE in which the payoffs are
 approximately the same as if the monitoring structure and payoff functions
 were known. Finally, we define perfect type-contingently public ex post
 equilibria (PTXE), which allows players to condition their actions on
 their initial private information, and we provide its linear programming
 characterization. Copyright  2010 The Econometric Society.

Title: An Axiomatization of the Serial Cost-Sharing Method 
Abstract:
				 We offer an axiomatization of the serial
 cost-sharing method of Friedman and Moulin (1999). The key property in our
 axiom system is Group Demand Monotonicity, asking that when a group of
 agents raise their demands, not all of them should pay less. Copyright  2010 The Econometric Society.

Title: Monotonicity and Implementability 
Abstract:
				 Consider an environment with a finite
 number of alternatives, and agents with private values and quasilinear
 utility functions. A domain of valuation functions for an agent is a
 monotonicity domain if every finite-valued monotone randomized allocation
 rule defined on it is implementable in dominant strategies. We fully
 characterize the set of all monotonicity domains. Copyright  2010 The Econometric Society.
