Title: Business Cycle Accounting 
Abstract:
				 We propose a simple method to help
 researchers develop quantitative models of economic fluctuations. The
 method rests on the insight that many models are equivalent to a prototype
 growth model with time-varying wedges that resemble productivity, labor
 and investment taxes, and government consumption. Wedges that correspond
 to these variables-efficiency, labor, investment, and government
 consumption wedges-are measured and then fed back into the model so as to
 assess the fraction of various fluctuations they account for. Applying
 this method to U.S. data for the Great Depression and the 1982 recession
 reveals that the efficiency and labor wedges together account for
 essentially all of the fluctuations; the investment wedge plays a
 decidedly tertiary role, and the government consumption wedge plays none.
 Analyses of the entire postwar period and alternative model specifications
 support these results. Models with frictions manifested primarily as
 investment wedges are thus not promising for the study of U.S. business
 cycles.			    Copyright The Econometric Society 2007.

Title:  Rational Asset Pricing Bubbles
Abstract: This paper provides a fairly systematic study of rational asset pricing
	bubbles in an intertemporal competitive equilibrium framework that allows for
	incomplete markets, productive assets, borrowing limits, and incomplete
	participation of agents in markets. The main results are concerned with
	nonexistence of asset pricing bubbles. These results imply that the
	conditions under which bubbles are possible--including some well-known
	examples of monetary equilibria--are relatively fragile.

Title:  Instrumental Variables Regression with Weak Instruments
Abstract: This paper develops asymptotic distribution theory for instrumental
	variables regression when the partial correlations between the instruments
	and the endogenous variables are weak, here modeled as local to zero.
	Asymptotic representation are provided for various statistics, including
	two-stage least squares and limited information maximum likelihood
	estimators, Wald statistics, and statistics testing overidentification and
	endogeneity. The asymptotic distributions provide good approximations to
	sampling distributions with ten-twenty observations per instrument. The
	theory suggests concrete guidelines for applied work, including using
	nonstandard methods for construction of confidence regions. These results are
	used to interpret J. D. Angrist and A. B. Krueger's (1991) estimates of the
	returns to education.

Title: Stepwise Multiple Testing as Formalized Data Snooping 
Abstract:
				 In econometric applications, often several
 hypothesis tests are carried out at once. The problem then becomes how to
 decide which hypotheses to reject, accounting for the multitude of tests.
 This paper suggests a stepwise multiple testing procedure that
 asymptotically controls the familywise error rate. Compared to related
 single-step methods, the procedure is more powerful and often will reject
 more false hypotheses. In addition, we advocate the use of studentization
 when feasible. Unlike some stepwise methods, the method implicitly
 captures the joint dependence structure of the test statistics, which
 results in increased ability to detect false hypotheses. The methodology
 is presented in the context of comparing several strategies to a common
 benchmark. However, our ideas can easily be extended to other contexts
 where multiple tests occur. Some simulation studies show the improvements
 of our methods over previous proposals. We also provide an application to
 a set of real data. Copyright The Econometric Society 2005.

Title: Fair Production and Allocation of an Excludable Nonrival Good 
Abstract:
				 We study fairness in economies with one
 private good and one partially excludable nonrival good. A social ordering
 function determines for each profile of preferences an ordering of all
 conceivable allocations. We propose the following Free Lunch Aversion
 condition: if the private good contributions of two agents consuming the
 same quantity of the nonrival good have opposite signs, reducing that gap
 improves social welfare. This condition, combined with the more standard
 requirements of Unanimous Indifference and Responsiveness, delivers a form
 of welfare egalitarianism in which an agent's welfare is measured by the
 quantity of the nonrival good that, consumed at no cost, would leave her
 indifferent to the bundle she is assigned. Copyright The Econometric Society 2004.

Title:   Flexible Functional Forms and Global Curvature Conditions. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 43-68
Issue: 1
Volume: 55
Year: 1987
Month:  January 
Abstract:
  Two methods are developed for imposing curvature conditions globally in
 the estimation of cost functions. The first adopts a procedure due to Lau,
 for imposing the conditions locally, to a generalization of a functional
 form proposed by McFadden. With this functional form, imposing the
 appropriate conditions at one data point imposes the conditions globally.
 The second method adopts a technique used by Diewert, McFadden, and
 Barnett, which is based on the fact that a nonnegative sum of concave
 functions is concave. The suggested techniques are illustrated using the
 U.S. Manufacturing data utilized by E. R. Berndt and M. S. Khaled_(1979).   Copyright 1987 by The Econometric Society.

Title:   Efficient Tests for an Autoregressive Unit Root. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 813-36
Issue: 4
Volume: 64
Year: 1996
Month:  July 
Abstract:
  The asymptotic power envelope is derived for point-optimal tests of a
 unit root in the autoregressive representation of a Gaussian time series.
 The authors propose a family of tests whose asymptotic power functions are
 tangent to the power envelope at one point and are never far below. When
 the series has an unknown mean or linear trend, commonly used tests are
 found to be dominated by members of the family of point-optimal invariant
 tests. The authors propose a modified version of the Dickey-Fuller t test
 which has desirable size properties and substantially improved power when
 an unknown mean or trend is present.   Copyright 1996 by The Econometric Society.

Title: An Evaluation of Econometric Models of Adaptive Learning 
Abstract:
 This paper evaluates the effectiveness of four econometric approaches
 intended to identify the learning rules being used by subjects in
 experiments with normal form games. This is done by simulating
 experimental data and then estimating the econometric models on the
 simulated data to determine if they can correctly identify the rule that
 was used to generate the data. The results show that all of the models
 examined possess difficulties in accurately distinguishing between the
 data generating processes. Copyright The Econometric Society.

Title:   Subjective Probability without Monotonicity: Or How Machina's Mom May Also Be Probabilistically Sophisticated. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 159-89
Issue: 1
Volume: 63
Year: 1995
Month:  January 
Abstract:
  If an agent's preferences over subjectively uncertain acts are consistent
 with him having a subjective probability distribution over the states of
 nature, then those preferences can induce consistent preferences over
 'objectively' risky lotteries. Such 'probabilistically sophisticated'
 behavior allows us to treat decision making under uncertainty as though it
 is under risk. This paper first characterizes exactly what probabilistic
 sophistication entails for an agent's beliefs about the likelihood of
 states of nature. Secondly, it presents characterizations of
 probabilistically sophisticated individuals whose induced lottery
 preferences obey neither the independence axiom nor a monotonicity
 property that is shown to share some of the nature of independence.   Copyright 1995 by The Econometric Society.

Title: The Impact of Trade on Intra-Industry Reallocations and Aggregate Industry Productivity 
Abstract:
				 This paper develops a dynamic industry
 model with heterogeneous firms to analyze the intra-industry effects of
 international trade. The model shows how the exposure to trade will induce
 only the more productive firms to enter the export market (while some less
 productive firms continue to produce only for the domestic market) and
 will simultaneously force the least productive firms to exit. It then
 shows how further increases in the industry's exposure to trade lead to
 additional inter-firm reallocations towards more productive firms. The
 paper also shows how the aggregate industry productivity growth generated
 by the reallocations contributes to a welfare gain, thus highlighting a
 benefit from trade that has not been examined theoretically before. The
 paper adapts Hopenhayn's (1992a) dynamic industry model to monopolistic
 competition in a general equilibrium setting. In so doing, the paper
 provides an extension of Krugman's (1980) trade model that incorporates
 firm level productivity differences. Firms with different productivity
 levels coexist in an industry because each firm faces initial uncertainty
 concerning its productivity before making an irreversible investment to
 enter the industry. Entry into the export market is also costly, but the
 firm's decision to export occurs after it gains knowledge of its
 productivity. Copyright The Econometric Society 2003.

Title: Cross Section and Panel Data Estimators for Nonseparable Models with Endogenous Regressors 
Abstract:
				 We propose two new methods for estimating
 models with nonseparable errors and endogenous regressors. The first
 method estimates a local average response. One estimates the response of
 the conditional mean of the dependent variable to a change in the
 explanatory variable while conditioning on an external variable and then
 undoes the conditioning. The second method estimates the nonseparable
 function and the joint distribution of the observable and unobservable
 explanatory variables. An external variable is used to impose an equality
 restriction, at two points of support, on the conditional distribution of
 the unobservable random term given the regressor and the external
 variable. Our methods apply to cross sections, but our lead examples
 involve panel data cases in which the choice of the external variable is
 guided by the assumption that the distribution of the unobservable
 variables is exchangeable in the values of the endogenous variable for
 members of a group. Copyright The Econometric Society 2005.

Title:   Research, Patenting, and Technological Change
Abstract: This paper develops a search-theoretic model of technological change to
	explain why both patenting and the growth of productivity have remained
	roughly constant while research employment in the United States has increased
	by a factor of six over the past four decades. In the model, researchers
	sample from probability distributions determining the efficiency of potential
	new production techniques. Technological breakthroughs, resulting in patents,
	become increasingly hard to find as the level of technology advances. Given
	certain restrictions on the search distributions, the equilibrium of the
	model replicates the U.S. time-series pattern of research, patenting, and
	productivity.

Abstract:
  Continuous-time Markov processes can be characterized conveniently by
 their infinitesimal generators. For such processes there exist forward and
 reverse-time generators. The authors show how to use these generators to
 construct moment conditions implied by stationary Markov processes.
 Generalized method of moments estimators and tests can be constructed
 using these moment conditions. The resulting econometric methods are
 designed to be applied to discrete-time data obtained by sampling
 continuous-time Markov processes.   Copyright 1995 by The Econometric Society.

Title:   Testing for Parameter Constancy in Linear Regressions: An Empirical Distribution Function Approach. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 597-622
Issue: 3
Volume: 64
Year: 1996
Month:  May 
Abstract:
  This paper proposes some tests for parameter constancy in linear
 regressions. The tests use weighted empirical distribution functions of
 estimated residuals and are asymptotically distribution free. The proposed
 tests have nontrivial local power against a wide range of alternatives. In
 particular, the tests are capable of detecting error heterogeneity that is
 not necessarily manifested in the form of changing variances. The model
 allows for both dynamic and trending regressors. As an intermediate
 result, some weak convergence for (stochastically) weighted sequential
 empirical processes is established.   Copyright 1996 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Equivalence Scales Reconsidered 
Abstract:
 The paper proposes a new and normative approach for adjusting households'
 incomes in order to account for the heterogeneity of needs across income
 recipients when measuring inequality and welfare. We derive the
 implications for the structure of the adjustment method of two conditions
 concerned with the way the ranking of situations is modified by a change
 in the reference household type and by more equally distributed living
 standards across households. Our results suggest that concern for greater
 equality in living standards conflicts with the basic welfarist principle
 of symmetrical treatment of individuals that is at the core of the
 standard equivalence scale approach. Copyright The Econometric Society 2003.

Title: Tax and Education Policy in a Heterogeneous-Agent Economy: What Levels of Redistribution Maximize Growth and Efficiency? 
Abstract:
 This paper studies the effects of progressive income taxes and education
 finance in a dynamic heterogeneous-agent economy. Such redistributive
 policies entail distortions to labor supply and savings, but also serve as
 partial substitutes for missing credit and insurance markets. The
 resulting tradeoffs for growth and efficiency are explored, both
 theoretically and quantitatively, in a model that yields complete
 analytical solutions. Progressive education finance always leads to higher
 income growth than taxes and transfers, but at the cost of lower
 insurance. Overall efficiency is assessed using a new measure that
 properly reflects aggregate resources and idiosyncratic risks but, unlike
 a standard social welfare function, does not reward equality per se.
 Simulations using empirical parameter estimates show that the efficiency
 costs and benefits of redistribution are generally of the same order of
 magnitude, resulting in plausible values for the optimal rates. Aggregate
 income and aggregate welfare provide only crude lower and upper bounds
 around the true efficiency tradeoff. Copyright The Econometric Society 2002.

Title: GMM Estimation of Autoregressive Roots Near Unity with Panel Data 
Abstract:
				 This paper investigates a generalized
 method of moments (GMM) approach to the estimation of autoregressive roots
 near unity with panel data and incidental deterministic trends. Such
 models arise in empirical econometric studies of firm size and in dynamic
 panel data modeling with weak instruments. The two moment conditions in
 the GMM approach are obtained by constructing bias corrections to the
 score functions under OLS and GLS detrending, respectively. It is shown
 that the moment condition under GLS detrending corresponds to taking the
 projected score on the Bhattacharya basis, linking the approach to recent
 work on projected score methods for models with infinite numbers of
 nuisance parameters (Waterman and Lindsay (1998)). Assuming that the
 localizing parameter takes a nonpositive value, we establish consistency
 of the GMM estimator and find its limiting distribution. A notable new
 finding is that the GMM estimator has convergence rate

Volume: 59

Month:  January 
Abstract:
  The authors present a new approach to the theory of imperfect competition
 and apply it to study price competition among differentiated products. The
 central result provides general conditions for existence and uniqueness of
 a pure-strategy price equilibrium given any number of firms producing any
 set of products. This includes products with multidimensional attributes.
 The authors' analysis covers location models, the characteristics
 approach, and probabilistic choice in a unified framework. To prove
 existence, they employ aggregation theorems due to A. Pr$8Ekopa (1971) and
 C. Borell (1975). A companion paper introduces these theorems and develops
 the application to super-majority voting rules.   Copyright 1991 by The Econometric Society.

Issue: 2
Volume: 56

Month:  March 
Abstract:
  Vehicles damage roads and, thus, increase road repair costs and create a
 road damage externality by raising the operating costs of subsequent
 vehicles. The main result is that if periodic road maintenance is
 condition responsive and if all road damage is attributable to traffic,
 then, in steady state with zero traffic growth, the average road damage
 externality is zero a nd the appropriate road damage charge is the average
 maintenance cost. Where weather accounts for some road damage, the road
 damage externality is no longer identically zero, but is quantitatively
 negligible. Road charges now recover a fraction of road costs.   Copyright 1988 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Testing Multiple Forecasters 
Abstract:
				 We consider a cross-calibration test of
 predictions by multiple potential experts in a stochastic environment.
 This test checks whether each expert is calibrated conditional on the
 predictions made by other experts. We show that this test is good in the
 sense that a true expert-one informed of the true distribution of the
 process-is guaranteed to pass the test no matter what the other potential
 experts do, and false experts will fail the test on all but a small
 (category I) set of true distributions. Furthermore, even when there is no
 true expert present, a test similar to cross-calibration cannot be
 simultaneously manipulated by multiple false experts, but at the cost of
 failing some true experts.				 Copyright Copyright  2008 by The Econometric Society.

Title:   The Organization of Decentralized Information Processing. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 1109-46
Issue: 5
Volume: 61
Year: 1993
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  In a decision-theoretic model of a firm, the author represents managers
 as information processors of limited capacity; efficiency is measured in
 terms of (1) the number of processors and (2) the delay between the
 receipt of information by the organization and the implementation of the
 decision. The author characterizes efficient networks for both one-shot
 and repeated regimes, as well as the corresponding 'production function'
 relating the number of items processed to the number of processors and the
 delay. He sketches some applications to common decision paradigms, and
 implications for decentralization and organizational returns to scale.   Copyright 1993 by The Econometric Society.

Title:   The Permanent Income Hypothesis Revisited. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 397-423
Issue: 2
Volume: 59
Year: 1991
Month:  March 
Abstract:
  Measured aggregate U.S. consumption does not behave like a martingale.
 The authors develop and test two variants of the permanent income model
 which reflect that. In both, agents make decisions in continuous time. In
 one variant, martingale behavior holds; serial persistence in measured
 consumption reflects only time aggregation. In the other, serial
 persistence also reflects technology shocks, and martingale behavior does
 not hold. Using both structural and atheoretical econometric models, the
 authors find little evidence against either variant: aggregate quarterly
 U.S. data do not convincingly distinguish between their continuous time
 models.   Copyright 1991 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Equilibrium Bias of Technology 
Abstract:
				 This paper presents three sets of results
 about equilibrium bias of technology. First, I show that when the menu of
 technological possibilities only allows for factor-augmenting
 technologies, the increase in the supply of a factor induces technological
 change relatively biased toward that factor-meaning that the induced
 technological change increases the relative marginal product of the factor
 becoming more abundant. Moreover, this induced bias can be strong enough
 to make the relative marginal product of a factor increasing in response
 to an increase in its supply, thus leading to an upward-sloping relative
 demand curve. I also show that these results about relative bias do not
 generalize when more general menus of technological possibilities are
 considered. Second, I prove that under mild assumptions, the increase in
 the supply of a factor induces technological change that is absolutely
 biased toward that factor-meaning that it increases its marginal product
 at given factor proportions. The third and most important result in the
 paper establishes the possibility of and conditions for strong absolute
 equilibrium bias-whereby the price (marginal product) of a factor
 increases in response to an increase in its supply. I prove that, under
 some regularity conditions, there will be strong absolute equilibrium bias
 if and only if the aggregate production function of the economy fails to
 be jointly concave in factors and technology. This type of failure of
 joint concavity is possible in economies where equilibrium factor demands
 and technologies result from the decisions of different agents.	     Copyright The Econometric Society 2007.

Volume: 63
Year: 1995
Month:  January 
Abstract:
  Different information systems are compared in terms of their relative
 efficiencies in an agency model. The mean preserving spread relation
 between the likelihood ratio distributions derived from the original
 information systems is found to be sufficient to rank information systems
 under quite general assumptions about the agent's utility function.
 Furthermore, it is shown that the mean preserving spread criterion can be
 applied to a broader set of information systems than Holmstrom's
 informativeness criterion and Blackwell's theorem.   Copyright 1995 by The Econometric Society.

Issue: 3
Volume: 62
Year: 1994
Month:  May 
Abstract:
  The distinction between nonatomicity and thick markets as the source of
 perfect competition is examined. The authors construct a model of an
 imperfectly competitive economy with a nonatomic continuum of traders and
 a continuum of differentiated commodities for which Walrasian equilibria
 exist. The failure of perfect competition is identified in two ways:
 individuals can affect prices and the core is strictly larger than the set
 of Walrasian allocations. By contrast, it is shown that, when markets are
 physically or economically thick (or both), then individuals cannot
 typically affect prices and the core always coincides with the set of
 Walrasian allocations.   Copyright 1994 by The Econometric Society.

Title:  Estimating and Testing Linear Models with Multiple Structural Changes
Abstract: This paper develops the statistical theory for testing and estimating
	multiple change points in regression models. The rate of convergence and
	limiting distribution for the estimated parameters are obtained. Several test
	statistics are proposed to determine the existence as well as the number of
	change points. A partial structural change model is considered. The authors
	study both fixed and shrinking magnitudes of shifts. In addition, the models
	allow for serially correlated disturbances (mixingales). An estimation
	strategy for which the location of the breaks need not be simultaneously
	determined is discussed. Instead, the authors' method successively estimates
	each break point.

Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 327-70
Issue: 2
Volume: 63
Year: 1995
Month:  March 
Abstract:
  This paper models and estimates congestion prices and capacity for large
 hub airports with stochastic queues, time-varying traffic rates, and
 endogenous intertemporal adjustment of traffic in response to queuing
 delay and fees. Relative costs of queuing and schedule delays are
 estimated using data from Minneapolis-St. Paul. Simulations calculate
 equilibrium traffic patterns, queuing delays, schedule delays, congestion
 fees, airport revenues, airport capacity, and efficiency gains. The paper
 also investigates whether a dominant airline internalizes delays its
 aircraft impose. It tests game-theoretic specifications with atomistic,
 Nash-dominant, Stackelberg-dominant, and collusive-airline traffic.   Copyright 1995 by The Econometric Society.

Title:  Is Perfect Price Discrimination Really Efficient?: Welfare and Existence in General Equilibrium	
Abstract: The authors examine the welfare properties of surplus maximization by
	embedding a perfectly discriminating monopoly in an otherwise standard
	Arrow-Debreu economy.  Although they discover an inefficient equilibrium, the
	authors validate partial equilibrium intuition by showing that equilibria are
	efficient provided that the monopoly goods are costly and that a natural
	monopoly can typically use personalized two-part tariffs in these equilibria.
	However, they find that Pareto optima are sometimes incompatible with surplus
	maximization, even when transfer payments are used. The authors provide
	insight into the source of this difficulty and give some instructive examples
	of economies where a second welfare theorem holds.

Title:   Econometric Analysis of Aggregation in the Context of Linear Prediction Models. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 861-88
Issue: 4
Volume: 57
Year: 1989
Month:  July 
Abstract:
  This paper focuses on whether to use macro or micro equations to predict
 aggregate variables. The Grunfeld-Griliches prediction criterion is
 generalized to allow for contemporaneous covariances across the micro
 equations and for parametric restrictions on the disaggregate equations.
 An econometric test is proposed of the hypothesis of "perfect
 aggregation." An application is made to employment demand functions for
 the U.K. economy disaggregated by forty industries. The hypothesis of
 perfect aggregation is firmly rejected. The prediction criterion
 marginally favors the aggregate equation when aggregating over the
 manufacturing industries, but over all industries the disaggregated
 equations are strongly preferred.   Copyright 1989 by The Econometric Society.

Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 405-58
Issue: 2
Volume: 62
Year: 1994
Month:  March 
Abstract:
  A recently developed quantile regression technique, which parsimoniously
 describes the entire conditional distribution, is applied to every March
 Current Population Survey since 1964. The study examines changes in the
 returns to schooling and experience at different points of the wage
 distribution and changes in within-group wage inequality. The results from
 the one-group and sixteen-group linear models show that the returns to
 schooling and experience differ across quantiles of the wage distribution
 but that their patterns of change are similar. Significant differences in
 wage inequality are also found across the various skill groups.   Copyright 1994 by The Econometric Society.

Title:  The Robustness of Equilibria to Incomplete Information
Abstract: A number of papers have shown that a strict Nash equilibrium action
	profile of a game may never be played if there is a small amount of
	incomplete information.  The authors present a general approach to analyzing
	the robustness of equilibria to a small amount of incomplete information. A
	Nash equilibrium of a complete information game is said to be robust to
	incomplete information if every incomplete information game with payoffs
	almost always given by the complete information game has an equilibrium which
	generates behavior close to the Nash equilibrium. The authors show that many
	games with strict equilibria have no robust equilibrium and examine why they
	get such different results from existing refinements. If a game has a unique
	correlated equilibrium, it is robust. A natural many-player many-action
	generalization of risk dominance is a sufficient condition for robustness.

Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 627-49
Issue: 3
Volume: 60
Year: 1992
Month:  May 
Abstract:
  A weakening of D. Kreps and R. Wilson's (1982) notion of sequential
 rationality is presented. The motivation stems from the difficulty in
 justifying sequentially rational behavior in subgames reachable only
 through a violation of sequential rationality. Although the present notion
 of weak sequential rationality is based upon extensive form
 considerations, it bears a close relation to R. Selten's (1975) normal
 form perfect equilibria. Backward induction outcomes can be achieved in
 generic games of perfect information with additional restrictions on
 beliefs. An example with imperfect information shows that sequential
 rationality is not the consequence of equilibrium play and the absence of
 incredible threats.   Copyright 1992 by The Econometric Society.

Title:   Semi-nonparametric Maximum Likelihood Estimation. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 363-90
Issue: 2
Volume: 55
Year: 1987
Month:  March 
Abstract:
  Often maximum likelihood is the method of choice for fitting an
 econometric model to data but cannot be used because the correct specific
 ation of (multivariate) density that defines the likelihood is unknown. In
 this situation, simply put the density equal to a Hermite series and apply
 standard finite dimensional maximum likelihood methods. Model parameters
 and nearly all aspects of the unknown density itself will be estimated
 consistently provided that the length of the series increases with sample
 size. The rule for increasing series length can be data dependent. The
 method is applied to nonlinear regression with sample selection.   Copyright 1987 by The Econometric Society.

Title:   Market for Information: Experimental Evidence. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 667-95
Issue: 3
Volume: 60
Year: 1992
Month:  May 
Abstract:
  Equilibrium predictions of the noisy rational expectations model are
 relatively accurate for laboratory asset and information markets. When
 information about an asset's uncertain dividend is sold to a fixed number
 of highest bidders, prices, allocations, efficiency, and a distribution of
 profit predictions of the full revelation rational expectations model in
 the asset market dominate the predictions of the Walrasian model; demand
 for information shifts leftward and its price approaches zero. When the
 price of information is fixed, the number of informed agents and the
 informativeness of the asset market adjusts to permit the information
 buyers to recover their investment in information.   Copyright 1992 by The Econometric Society.

Title:   Choosing the Number of Instruments. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 1161-91
Issue: 5
Volume: 69
Year: 2001
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  Properties of instrumental variable estimators are sensitive to the
 choice of valid instruments, even in large cross-section applications. In
 this paper we address this problem by deriving simple mean-square error
 criteria that can be minimized to choose the instrument set. We develop
 these criteria for two-stage least squares (2SLS), limited information
 maximum likelihood (LIML), and a bias adjusted version of 2SLS (B2SLS). We
 give a theoretical derivation of the mean-square error and show
 optimality. In Monte Carlo experiments we find that the instrument choice
 generally yields an improvement in performance. Also, in the Angrist and
 Krueger (1991) returns to education application, when the instrument set
 is chosen in the way we consider, it turns out that both 2SLS and LIML
 give similar (large) returns to education.

Title: Efficient Estimation of Models with Conditional Moment Restrictions Containing Unknown Functions 
Abstract:
				 We propose an estimation method for models
 of conditional moment restrictions, which contain finite dimensional
 unknown parameters (theta) and infinite dimensional unknown functions
 (h). Our proposal is to approximate h with a sieve and to estimate theta
 and the sieve parameters jointly by applying the method of minimum
 distance. We show that: (i) the sieve estimator of h is consistent with a
 rate faster than n-super--1/4 under certain metric; (ii) the estimator of
 theta is root-n consistent and asymptotically normally distributed;
 (iii) the estimator for the asymptotic covariance of the theta estimator
 is consistent and easy to compute; and (iv) the optimally weighted minimum
 distance estimator of	theta attains the semiparametric efficiency bound.
 We illustrate our results with two examples: a partially linear regression
 with an endogenous nonparametric part, and a partially additive IV
 regression with a link function.			     Copyright The Econometric Society 2003.

Title:   Efficiency of Weighted Average Derivative Estimators and Index Models. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 1199-223
Issue: 5
Volume: 61
Year: 1993
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  Weighted average derivatives are useful parameters for semiparametric
 index models and nonparametric demand analysis. This paper gives
 efficiency results for average derivative estimators, including
 formulating estimators that have high efficiency. The authors derive the
 efficiency bound for weighted average derivatives of conditional location
 functionals, such as the conditional mean and median. They also derive the
 efficiency bound for semiparametric index models, where the location
 measure depends on indices or linear combinations of the regressors. The
 authors derive the efficient weight function when the distribution of the
 regressors is elliptically symmetric. They also discuss how to combine
 estimators with different known weight functions to achieve efficiency.   Copyright 1993 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Sequential Estimation of Dynamic Discrete Games 
Abstract:
				 This paper studies the estimation of
 dynamic discrete games of incomplete information. Two main econometric
 issues appear in the estimation of these models: the indeterminacy problem
 associated with the existence of multiple equilibria and the computational
 burden in the solution of the game. We propose a class of pseudo maximum
 likelihood (PML) estimators that deals with these problems, and we study
 the asymptotic and finite sample properties of several estimators in this
 class. We first focus on two-step PML estimators, which, although they are
 attractive for their computational simplicity, have some important
 limitations: they are seriously biased in small samples; they require
 consistent nonparametric estimators of players' choice probabilities in
 the first step, which are not always available; and they are
 asymptotically inefficient. Second, we show that a recursive extension of
 the two-step PML, which we call nested pseudo likelihood (NPL), addresses
 those drawbacks at a relatively small additional computational cost. The
 NPL estimator is particularly useful in applications where consistent
 nonparametric estimates of choice probabilities either are not available
 or are very imprecise, e.g., models with permanent unobserved
 heterogeneity. Finally, we illustrate these methods in Monte Carlo
 experiments and in an empirical application to a model of firm entry and
 exit in oligopoly markets using Chilean data from several retail
 industries.				    Copyright The Econometric Society 2007.

Title: Consistent Estimation of Models Defined by Conditional Moment Restrictions 
Abstract:
				 In econometrics, models stated as
 conditional moment restrictions are typically estimated by means of the
 generalized method of moments (GMM). The GMM estimation procedure can
 render inconsistent estimates since the number of arbitrarily chosen
 instruments is finite. In fact, consistency of the GMM estimators relies
 on additional assumptions that imply unclear restrictions on the data
 generating process. This article introduces a new, simple and consistent
 estimation procedure for these models that is directly based on the
 definition of the conditional moments. The main feature of our procedure
 is its simplicity, since its implementation does not require the selection
 of any user-chosen number, and statistical inference is straightforward
 since the proposed estimator is asymptotically normal. In addition, we
 suggest an asymptotically efficient estimator constructed by carrying out
 one Newton-Raphson step in the direction of the efficient GMM estimator. Copyright The Econometric Society 2004.

Title: An Empirical Model of Growth Through Product Innovation 
Abstract:
				 Productivity differences across firms are
 large and persistent, but the evidence for worker reallocation as an
 important source of aggregate productivity growth is mixed. The purpose of
 this paper is to estimate the structure of an equilibrium model of growth
 through innovation designed to identify and quantify the role of resource
 reallocation in the growth process. The model is a version of the
 Schumpeterian theory of firm evolution and growth developed by Klette and
 Kortum (2004) extended to allow for firm heterogeneity. The data set is a
 panel of Danish firms that includes information on value added,
 employment, and wages. The model's fit is good. The estimated model
 implies that more productive firms in each cohort grow faster and
 consequently crowd out less productive firms in steady state. This
 selection effect accounts for 53% of aggregate growth in the estimated
 version of the model. Copyright  2008 The Econometric Society.

Issue: 5
Volume: 63
Year: 1995
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  We add a round of pre-play communication to a finite two-player game
 played by a population of players. Pre-play communication is cheap talk in
 the sense that it does not directly enter the payoffs. The paper
 characterizes the set of strategies that are stable with respect to a
 stochastic dynamic adaptive process. Periodically players have an
 opportunity to change their strategy with a strategy that is more
 successful against the current population. Any strategy that weakly
 improves upon the current poorest performer in the population enters with
 positive probability. When there is no conflict of interest between the
 players, only the efficient outcome is stable with respect to these
 dynamics. For general games the set of stable payoffs is typically large.
 Every efficient payoff recurs infinitely often.   Copyright 1995 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Nonparametric Estimation with Nonlinear Budget Sets 
Abstract:
 Choice models with nonlinear budget sets provide a precise way of
 accounting for the nonlinear tax structures present in many applications.
 In this paper we propose a nonparametric approach to estimation of these
 models. The basic idea is to think of the choice, in our case hours of
 labor supply, as being a function of the entire budget set. Then we can do
 nonparametric regression where the variable in the regression is the
 budget set. We reduce the dimensionality of this problem by exploiting
 structure implied by utility maximization with piecewise linear convex
 budget sets. This structure leads to estimators where the number of
 segments can differ across observations and does not affect accuracy. We
 give consistency and asymptotic normality results for these estimators.
 The usefulness of the estimator is demonstrated in an empirical example,
 where we find it has a large impact on estimated effects of the Swedish
 tax reform. Copyright The Econometric Society 2002.

Title:   Behavior in Multi-unit Demand Auctions: Experiments with Uniform Price and Dynamic Vickrey Auctions. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 413-54
Issue: 2
Volume: 69
Year: 2001
Month:  March 
Abstract:
  We experimentally investigate the sensitivity of bidders demanding
 multiple units of a homogeneous commodity to the demand reduction
 incentives inherent in uniform price auctions. There is substantial demand
 reduction in both sealed bid and ascending price clock auctions with
 feedback regarding rivals' drop-out prices. Although both auctions have
 the same normal form representation, bidding is much closer to equilibrium
 in the ascending price auctions. We explore the behavioral process
 underlying these differences along with dynamic Vickrey auctions designed
 to eliminate the inefficiencies resulting from demand reduction in the
 uniform price auctions.

Title: Equilibrium Wage Dispersion with Worker and Employer Heterogeneity 
Abstract:
 We construct and estimate an equilibrium search model with
 on-the-job-search. Firms make take-it-or-leave-it wage offers to workers
 conditional on their characteristics and they can respond to the outside
 job offers received by their employees. Unobserved worker productive
 heterogeneity is introduced in the form of cross-worker differences in a
 "competence" parameter. On the other side of the market, firms also are
 heterogeneous with respect to their marginal productivity of labor. The
 model delivers a theory of steady-state wage dispersion driven by
 heterogenous worker abilities and firm productivities, as well as by
 matching frictions. The structural model is estimated using matched
 employer and employee French panel data. The exogenous distributions of
 worker and firm heterogeneity components are nonparametrically estimated.
 We use this structural estimation to provide a decomposition of
 cross-employee wage variance. We find that the share of the
 cross-sectional wage variance that is explained by person effects varies
 across skill groups. Specifically, this share lies close to 40% for
 high-skilled white collars, and quickly decreases to 0% as the observed
 skill level decreases. The contribution of market imperfections to wage
 dispersion is typically around 50%. Copyright The Econometric Society 2002.

Title: Worms: Identifying Impacts on Education and Health in the Presence of Treatment Externalities 
Abstract:
				 Intestinal helminths-including hookworm,
 roundworm, whipworm, and schistosomiasis-infect more than one-quarter of
 the world's population. Studies in which medical treatment is randomized
 at the individual level potentially doubly underestimate the benefits of
 treatment, missing externality benefits to the comparison group from
 reduced disease transmission, and therefore also underestimating benefits
 for the treatment group. We evaluate a Kenyan project in which
 school-based mass treatment with deworming drugs was randomly phased into
 schools, rather than to individuals, allowing estimation of overall
 program effects. The program reduced school absenteeism in treatment
 schools by one-quarter, and was far cheaper than alternative ways of
 boosting school participation. Deworming substantially improved health and
 school participation among untreated children in both treatment schools
 and neighboring schools, and these externalities are large enough to
 justify fully subsidizing treatment. Yet we do not find evidence that
 deworming improved academic test scores. Copyright Econometric Society 2004.

Title: Job Matching and the Wage Distribution 
Abstract:
				 This paper brings together the
 microeconomic-labor and the macroeconomic-equilibrium views of matching in
 labor markets. We nest a job matching model à la Jovanovic (1984) into a
 Mortensen and Pissarides (1994)-type equilibrium search environment. The
 resulting framework preserves the implications of job matching theory for
 worker turnover and wage dynamics, and it also allows for aggregation and
 general equilibrium analysis. We obtain two new equilibrium implications
 of job matching and search frictions for wage inequality. First, learning
 about match quality and worker turnover map Gaussian output noise into an
 ergodic wage distribution of empirically accurate shape: unimodal, skewed,
 with a Paretian right tail. Second, high idiosyncratic productivity risk
 hinders learning and sorting, and reduces wage inequality. The equilibrium
 solutions for the wage distribution and for the aggregate worker
 flows-quits to unemployment and to other jobs, displacements,
 hires-provide the likelihood function of the model in closed form. Copyright The Econometric Society 2005.

Title:   Renegotiation of Sales Contracts. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 567-89
Issue: 3
Volume: 63
Year: 1995
Month:  May 
Abstract:
  This paper studies moral hazard contracts that may be renegotiated after
 an agent chooses an unobservable effort. Unlike in previous models, a
 contract contains just one scheme and the agent has the renegotiation
 bargaining power. All equilibria satisfying a weak forward-induction
 refinement are shown to be (second-best) efficient. Renegotiation
 necessarily occurs. If the effort set is rich, the initial contract must
 be a sales contract 'selling the project' to the agent. Thus, a party (the
 principal) who has an inherently weak renegotiation position should
 sometimes insist on a simple initial contract.   Copyright 1995 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Quantile Regression under Misspecification, with an Application to the U.S. Wage Structure 
Abstract:
				 Quantile regression (QR) fits a linear
 model for conditional quantiles just as ordinary least squares (OLS) fits
 a linear model for conditional means. An attractive feature of OLS is that
 it gives the minimum mean-squared error linear approximation to the
 conditional expectation function even when the linear model is
 misspecified. Empirical research using quantile regression with discrete
 covariates suggests that QR may have a similar property, but the exact
 nature of the linear approximation has remained elusive. In this paper, we
 show that QR minimizes a weighted mean-squared error loss function for
 specification error. The weighting function is an average density of the
 dependent variable near the true conditional quantile. The weighted least
 squares interpretation of QR is used to derive an omitted variables bias
 formula and a partial quantile regression concept, similar to the
 relationship between partial regression and OLS. We also present
 asymptotic theory for the QR process under misspecification of the
 conditional quantile function. The approximation properties of QR are
 illustrated using wage data from the U.S. census. These results point to
 major changes in inequality from 1990 to 2000. Copyright The Econometric Society 2006.

Issue: 1
Volume: 58
Year: 1990
Month:  January 
Abstract:
  A method for computing (approximate) cost-of-living index numbers for
 arbitrary reference income levels is presented. It combines the use of
 fairly disaggregated data with a relatively modest use of econometric
 methods. The basis ingredients are (1) a series of chained Tornqvist price
 index numbers relating to per capital total expenditure, (2) price index
 numbers for the commodities distinguished, and (3) the income parameters
 of a differential demand system. This method attains second order
 precision and is equivalent to a full econometric method based on a
 translog utility function. The method is demonstrated on Netherlands data
 for 1952-81.   Copyright 1990 by The Econometric Society.

 likely to end up in an impasse. In contrast, when offers are hidden,
 agreement is always reached, although with delay. Copyright  2009 The Econometric Society.

Title: Toward a Strategic Foundation for Rational Expectations Equilibrium 
Abstract:
				 A step toward a strategic foundation for
 rational expectations equilibrium is taken by considering a double auction
 with n buyers and m sellers with interdependent values and affiliated
 private information. If there are sufficiently many buyers and sellers,
 and their bids are restricted to a sufficiently fine discrete set of
 prices, then, generically, there is an equilibrium in nondecreasing
 bidding functions that is arbitrarily close to the unique fully revealing
 rational expectations equilibrium of the limit market with unrestricted
 bids and a continuum of agents. In particular, the large double-auction
 equilibrium is almost efficient and almost fully aggregates the agents'
 information.				     Copyright The Econometric Society 2006.

Title: Default and Punishment in General Equilibrium  					 
Abstract:
				 We extend the standard model of general
 equilibrium with incomplete markets to allow for default and punishment by
 thinking of assets as pools. The equilibrating variables include expected
 delivery rates, along with the usual prices of assets and commodities. By
 reinterpreting the variables, our model encompasses a broad range of
 adverse selection and signalling phenomena in a perfectly competitive,
 general equilibrium framework. Copyright The Econometric Society 2005.

Journal: Econometrica

Issue: 6
Volume: 56

Month:  November 
Abstract:
  This paper considers estimation and testing of vector autoregressio n
 coefficients in panel data, and applies the techniques to analyze the
 dynamic relationships between wages an d hours worked in two samples of
 American males. The model allows for nonstationary individual effects and
 is estimated by applying instrumental variables to the quasi-differenced
 autoregressive equations. The empirical results suggest the absence of
 lagged hours in the wage forecasting equation. The results also show that
 lagged hours is important in the hours equation.   Copyright 1988 by The Econometric Society.

Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 1127-52
Issue: 4
Volume: 59
Year: 1991
Month:  July 
Abstract:
  Starting from a tariff-distorted equilibrium of international trade, the
 authors examine the welfare effects of a gradual multilateral reform of
 tariffs (and other trade taxes and subsidies). Necessary and sufficient
 conditions for the existence of strict Pareto improving multilateral
 (differential) tariff reforms, accompanied by international transfers of
 income, are obtained. These results are then applied to various concrete
 tariff reform proposals such as proportional reductions in tariffs and the
 reduction of the highest ad valorem tariff rates. Some of the authors'
 theorems extend the generality of previously obtained results and some new
 tariff reform proposals are also made.   Copyright 1991 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Bootstrap Methods for Markov Processes 
Abstract:
				 The block bootstrap is the best known
 bootstrap method for time-series data when the analyst does not have a
 parametric model that reduces the data generation process to simple random
 sampling. However, the errors made by the block bootstrap converge to zero
 only slightly faster than those made by first-order asymptotic
 approximations. This paper describes a bootstrap procedure for data that
 are generated by a Markov process or a process that can be approximated by
 a Markov process with sufficient accuracy. The procedure is based on
 estimating the Markov transition density nonparametrically. Bootstrap
 samples are obtained by sampling the process implied by the estimated
 transition density. Conditions are given under which the errors made by
 the Markov bootstrap converge to zero more rapidly than those made by the
 block bootstrap. Copyright The Econometric Society 2003.

Pages: 1019-45
Issue: 5
Volume: 61
Year: 1993
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  Subjective utility maximizers, in an infinitely repeated game, will learn
 to predict opponents' future strategies and will converge to play
 according to a Nash equilibrium of the repeated game. Players' initial
 uncertainty is placed directly on opponents' strategies and the above
 result is obtained under the assumption that the individual beliefs are
 compatible with the chosen strategies. An immediate corollary is that,
 when playing a Harsanyi-Nash equilibrium of a repeated game of incomplete
 information about opponents' payoff matrices, players will eventually play
 a Nash equilibrium of the real game, as if they had complete information.   Copyright 1993 by The Econometric Society.

Abstract:
  The author proves several versions of the second welfare theorem for

 given a Pareto optimum f, one can find income transfers and a Walrasian
 quasiequilibrium g s uch that all but k agents are indifferent between f
 and g, where k is the number of commodities. Another theorem shows that,
 with probabil ity one in a particular formulation of a random sequence of
 economies , every Pareto optimum is close to a Walrasian equilibrium with
 incom e transfers.   Copyright 1988 by The Econometric Society.

Issue: 6
Volume: 55
Year: 1987
Month:  November 
Abstract:
  This paper provides two results that are useful in proving the exist ence
 of and characterizing separating equilibria in signaling games. A key
 element in the analysis of separating equilibria is the examina tion of
 the implied incentive compatibility constraints. It is shown that these
 constraints imply differentiability of strategies. In addi tion, a
 monotonicity condition (which is similar to the single crossi ng
 condition) is analyzed that is necessary and sufficient for there to be a
 strategy satisfying the incentive compatibility constraints. As a direct
 consequence of these two results, the analysis of Paul Milgrom and John
 Roberts (1982) is considerably strengthened.   Copyright 1987 by The Econometric Society.

Title: A Quantitative Theory of Unsecured Consumer Credit with Risk of Default 
Abstract:
				 We study, theoretically and
 quantitatively, the general equilibrium of an economy in which households
 smooth consumption by means of both a riskless asset and unsecured loans
 with the option to default. The default option resembles a bankruptcy
 filing under Chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Competitive financial
 intermediaries offer a menu of loan sizes and interest rates wherein each
 loan makes zero profits. We prove the existence of a steady-state
 equilibrium and characterize the circumstances under which a household
 defaults on its loans. We show that our model accounts for the main
 statistics regarding bankruptcy and unsecured credit while matching key
 macroeconomic aggregates, and the earnings and wealth distributions. We
 use this model to address the implications of a recent policy change that
 introduces a form of "means testing" for households contemplating a
 Chapter 7 bankruptcy filing. We find that this policy change yields large
 welfare gains. Copyright The Econometric Society 2007.

Month:  November 
Abstract:
  To accommodate the observed pattern of risk-aversion and risk-seeking, as
 well as common violations of expected utility (e.g., the certainty
 effect), the authors introduce and characterize a weighting function
 according to which an event has greater impact when it turns impossibility
 into possibility, or possibility into certainty, than when it merely makes
 a possibility more or less likely. The authors show how to compare such
 weighting functions (of different individuals) with respect to the degree
 of departure from expected utility and they present a method for comparing
 an individual's weighting functions for risk and for uncertainty.  Copyright 1995 by The Econometric Society.

Title:  Reciprocity as a Contract Enforcement Device: Experimental Evidence
Abstract: Numerous experimental studies indicate that people tend to reciprocate
	favors and punish unfair behavior. It is hypothesized that these behavioral
	responses contribute to the enforcement of contracts and increase gains from
	trade. It turns out that, if only one side of the market has opportunities
	for reciprocal responses, the impact of reciprocity on contract enforcement
	depends on the details of the pecuniary incentive system. If both sides of
	the market have opportunities for reciprocal responses, robust and powerful
	reciprocity effects occur. In particular, reciprocal behavior causes a
	substantial increase in the set of enforceable actions and large efficiency
	gains.

Abstract:
  T. J. Rothenberg's (1984) Edgeworth test size correction for the linear
 model with a nonscalar covariance matrix is applied to the special case of
 AR(1) errors. Simulations show that the correction reduces the
 overrejection that is commonly encountered in this model, although
 substantial overrejection remains when the original amount is large. When
 the regressors are autocorrelated and collinear (for example, two trended
 regressors) there is not nearly as much overrejection when testing a
 single restriction as there is when the model contains only one
 autocorrelated regressor.   Copyright 1989 by The Econometric Society.

Issue: 6
Volume: 64
Year: 1996
Month:  November 
Abstract:
  This paper examines how proportional transaction costs, short-sale
 constraints, and margin requirements affect inferences based on asset
 return data about intertemporal marganil rates of substitution (IMRSs).
 Small transaction costs greatly reduce the required variability of IMRSs,
 suggesting that the low variability of many parametric, aggregate
 consumption based IMRSs need not be inconsistent with asset return data.
 Euler inequalities for a transaction cost economy with power utility are
 tested using aggregate consumption data and returns on stocks and U.S.
 Treasury bills. In the majority of cases, there is little evidence against
 power utility specifications with a low risk-aversion parameter.   Copyright 1996 by The Econometric Society.

Title:   Extensive Form Games in Continuous Time: Pure Strategies. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 1171-1214
Issue: 5
Volume: 57
Year: 1989
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  A new framework for games in continuous time is proposed. The
 continuous-time model conforms as closely as possible to the conventional
 discrete-time framework. Indeed, continuous time is viewed as "discrete
 time, but with a grid that is infinitely fine." The paper presents several
 examples illustrating the difficulties that arise in continuous-time game
 theory. Theorems relate the equilibria of continuous time games to the
 equilibria of approximating discrete time games. A variety of industrial
 organization applications are studied, yielding sharp predictions.
 Applications include continuously repeated games, preemption models, and
 patent races.	 Copyright 1989 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Price Manipulation and Quasi-Arbitrage 
Abstract:
				 In an environment where trading volume
 affects security prices and where prices are uncertain when trades are
 submitted, quasi-arbitrage is the availability of a series of trades that
 generate infinite expected profits with an infinite Sharpe ratio. We show
 that when the price impact of trades is permanent and time-independent,
 only linear price-impact functions rule out quasi-arbitrage and thus
 support viable market prices. When trades have also a temporary price
 impact, only the permanent price impact must be linear while the temporary
 one can be of a more general form. We also extend the analysis to a
 time-dependent framework. Copyright The Econometric Society 2004.

Abstract:
  Spot contracting generally involves efficiency losses relative to
 long-term contracting. It is proved here that short-term contracting and
 renegotiation allow to achieve long-run efficiency when transfers are not
 limited, objectives are conflicting, and no relevant asymmetric
 information appears at recontracting dates. This last assumption excludes
 adverse selection, but not moral hazard when technologies and preferences
 are time separable.   Copyright 1990 by The Econometric Society.

Volume: 63
Year: 1995
Month:  November 
Abstract:
  A common interest game is a game in which there exists a unique pair of
 payoffs which strictly Pareto dominates all other payoffs. The authors
 consider the undiscounted repeated game obtained by the infinite
 repetition of such a two-player stage game. They show that, if supergame
 strategies are restricted to be computable within Church's thesis, the
 only pair of payoffs that survives any computable tremble with
 sufficiently large support is the Pareto-efficient pair. The result is

Title: Two Competing Models of How People Learn in Games 
Abstract:
 Reinforcement learning and stochastic fictitious play are apparent rivals
 as models of human learning. They embody quite different assumptions about
 the processing of information and optimization. This paper compares their
 properties and finds that they are far more similar than were thought. In
 particular, the expected motion of stochastic fictitious play and
 reinforcement learning with experimentation can both be written as a
 perturbed form of the evolutionary replicator dynamics. Therefore they
 will in many cases have the same asymptotic behavior. In particular, local
 stability of mixed equilibria under stochastic fictitious play implies
 local stability under perturbed reinforcement learning. The main
 identifiable difference between the two models is speed: stochastic
 fictitious play gives rise to faster learning. Copyright The Econometric Society 2002.

Title: Nonparametric Matching and Efficient Estimators of Homothetically Separable Functions 
Abstract:
				 For vectors z and w and scalar v, let r(v,
 z, w) be a function that can be nonparametrically estimated consistently
 and asymptotically normally, such as a distribution, density, or
 conditional mean regression function. We provide consistent,
 asymptotically normal nonparametric estimators for the functions G and H,
 where r(v, z, w) = H[vG(z), w], and some related models. This framework
 encompasses homothetic and homothetically separable functions, and
 transformed partly additive models r(v, z, w) = h[v + g(z), w] for unknown
 functions gand h Such models reduce the curse of dimensionality, provide a
 natural generalization of linear index models, and are widely used in
 utility, production, and cost function applications. We also provide an
 estimator of Gthat is oracle efficient, achieving the same performance as
 an estimator based on local least squares when H is known.		     Copyright The Econometric Society 2007.

Title:   Asymptotics for Semiparametric Econometric Models via Stochastic Equicontinuity. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 43-72
Issue: 1
Volume: 62
Year: 1994
Month:  January 
Abstract:
  This paper provides a general framework for proving the "square root of"
 T-consistency and asymptotic normality of a wide variety of semiparametric
 estimators. The class of estimators considered consists of estimators that
 can be defined as the solution to a minimization problem based on a
 criterion function that may depend on a preliminary infinite dimensional
 nuisance parameter estimator. The method of proof exploits results
 concerning the stochastic equicontinuity of stochastic processes. The
 results are applied to the problem of semiparametric weighted least
 squares estimation of partially parametric regression models. Primitive
 conditions are given for "square root of" T-consistency and asymptotic
 normality of this estimator.   Copyright 1994 by The Econometric Society.

Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 413-30
Issue: 2
Volume: 64
Year: 1996
Month:  March 
Abstract:
  The authors study the asymptotic distribution of econometric tests
 involving nuisance parameters that are not identified under the null
 hypotheses. In general, the asymptotic distributions depend upon a large
 number of unknown parameters. The authors show that a transformation based
 upon a conditional probability measure yields an asymptotic distribution
 free of nuisance parameters and they show that this transformation can be
 easily approximated via simulation. The theory is applied to threshold
 models. Monte Carlo methods are used to assess the finite sample
 distributions. The authors' tests show that S. M. Potter's (1995) finding
 of a threshold effect in U.S. GNP growth rates can be possibly explained
 by sampling variation.   Copyright 1996 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Consistent Testing of Cointegrating Relationships 
Abstract:
				 In this paper we investigate methods for
 testing the existence of a cointegration relationship among the components
 of a nonstationary fractionally integrated (NFI) vector time series. Our
 framework generalizes previous studies restricted to unit root integrated
 processes and permits simultaneous analysis of spurious and cointegrated
 NFI vectors. We propose a modified F-statistic, based on a particular
 studentization, which converges weakly under both hypotheses, despite the
 fact that OLS estimates are only consistent under cointegration. This
 statistic leads to a Wald-type test of cointegration when combined with a
 narrow band GLS-type estimate. Our semiparametric methodology allows
 consistent testing of the spurious regression hypothesis against the
 alternative of fractional cointegration without prior knowledge on the
 memory of the original series, their short run properties, the
 cointegrating vector, or the degree of cointegration. This semiparametric
 aspect of the modelization does not lead to an asymptotic loss of power,
 permitting the Wald statistic to diverge faster under the alternative of
 cointegration than when testing for a hypothesized cointegration vector.
 In our simulations we show that the method has comparable power to
 customary procedures under the unit root cointegration setup, and
 maintains good properties in a general framework where other methods may
 fail. We illustrate our method testing the cointegration hypothesis of
 nominal GNP and simple-sum (M1, M2, M3) monetary aggregates.		     Copyright The Econometric Society 2004.

Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 103-37
Issue: 1
Volume: 64
Year: 1996
Month:  January 
Abstract:
  This paper shows how to estimate a model in which an unknown
 transformation of the dependent variable is a linear function of
 explanatory variables plus an unobserved random variable, U, whose
 distribution is unknown. The model nests many familiar parametric and
 semiparametric models, including models with Box-Cox transformed dependent
 variables and proportional hazards models with and without unobserved
 heterogeneity. The paper develops root-n consistent, asymptotically normal
 estimators of the transformation function, coefficients of the explanatory
 variables, and distribution of U. The results of Monte Carlo experiments
 indicate that the estimators work well in samples of size one hundred.   Copyright 1996 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Local Partitioned Regression 
Abstract:
				 In this paper, we introduce a kernel-based
 estimation principle for nonparametric models named local partitioned
 regression (LPR). This principle is a nonparametric generalization of the
 familiar partition regression in linear models. It has several key
 advantages: First, it generates estimators for a very large class of semi-
 and nonparametric models. A number of examples that are particularly
 relevant for economic applications will be discussed in this paper. This
 class contains the additive, partially linear, and varying coefficient
 models as well as several other models that have not been discussed in the
 literature. Second, LPR-based estimators achieve optimality criteria: They
 have optimal speed of convergence and are oracle-efficient. Moreover, they
 are simple in structure, widely applicable, and computationally
 inexpensive. A Monte Carlo simulation highlights these advantages. Copyright The Econometric Society 2006.

Abstract:
  The unit root hypothesis is examined allowing a possible one-time change
 in the level or in the slope of the trend function. When fluctuations are
 stationary around a breaking trend function, standard tests cannot reject
 the unit root, even asymptotically. Consistent tests are derived and
 applied to the Nelson-Plosser data set (allowing a change in level for the
 1929 crash) and to the postwar quarterly real GNP series (allowing a
 change in slope after 1973). The unit root hypothesis is rejected at a
 high confidence level for most series. Fluctuations are stationary. The
 only persistent "shocks" are the 1929 crash and the 1973 oil price shock.   Copyright 1989 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Financial Innovation and the Transactions Demand for Cash 
Abstract:
				 We document cash management patterns for
 households that are at odds with the predictions of deterministic
 inventory models that abstract from precautionary motives. We extend the
 Baumol-Tobin cash inventory model to a dynamic environment that allows for
 the possibility of withdrawing cash at random times at a low cost. This
 modification introduces a precautionary motive for holding cash and
 naturally captures developments in withdrawal technology, such as the
 increasing diffusion of bank branches and ATM terminals. We characterize
 the solution of the model, which qualitatively reproduces several
 empirical patterns. We estimate the structural parameters using micro data
 and show that quantitatively the model captures important economic
 patterns. The estimates are used to quantify the expenditure and interest
 rate elasticity of money demand, the impact of financial innovation on
 money demand, the welfare cost of inflation, and the benefit of ATM
 ownership. Copyright  2009 The Econometric Society.

Title:   Nonparametric Estimation of Exact Consumers Surplus and Deadweight Loss. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 1445-76
Issue: 6
Volume: 63
Year: 1995
Month:  November 
Abstract:
  The authors apply nonparametric regression models to estimation of demand
 curves of the type most often used in applied research. From the demand
 curve estimators they derive estimates of exact consumers surplus and
 deadweight loss. The authors also develop tests of the symmetry and
 downward sloping properties of compensated demand. They work out
 asymptotic normal sampling theory for kernel and series nonparametric
 estimators as well as for the parametric case. The paper includes an
 application to gasoline demand that estimates the shape of the demand
 curve and the average magnitude of welfare loss from a tax on gasoline.   Copyright 1995 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Asymptotic Efficiency in Parametric Structural Models with Parameter-Dependent Support 
Abstract:
				 In certain auction, search, and related
 models, the boundary of the support of the observed data depends on some
 of the parameters of interest. For such nonregular models, standard
 asymptotic distribution theory does not apply. Previous work has focused
 on characterizing the nonstandard limiting distributions of particular
 estimators in these models. In contrast, we study the problem of
 constructing efficient point estimators. We show that the maximum
 likelihood estimator is generally inefficient, but that the Bayes
 estimator is efficient according to the local asymptotic minmax criterion
 for conventional loss functions. We provide intuition for this result
 using Le Cam's limits of experiments framework. Copyright The Econometric Society 2003.

Title:  Choice without Beliefs		
Journal: Econometrica
Abstract:
  This paper provides an axiomatic foundation for decision making in complex
  settings in which the decision maker does not have complete structural
  knowledge of the environment. The agent knows the set of actions he can take,
  he formulates preferences directly on the actions, and chooses according to
  these preferences. On the basis of experience he modifies these preferences
  according to a systematic procedure. A group of natural structural
  restrictions and a group of independence axioms are imposed on this
  procedure. The main result is an axiomatic foundation for a set of simple
  adaptive learning procedures which include the replicator dynamic.

Abstract:
  The authors present a finite system of polynomial inequalities in

 individual incomes and, aggregate endowments must satisfy to be consistent
 with the equilibrium behavior of some pure trade economy. Quantifier
 elimination is used to derive testable restrictions on finite data sets
 for the pure trade model. A characterization of observations on aggregate
 endowments and market prices that are consistent with a Robinson Crusoe's
 economy is also provided.   Copyright 1996 by The Econometric Society.

Title: On the Existence of Pure Strategy Monotone Equilibria in Asymmetric First-Price Auctions 
Abstract:
				 We establish the existence of pure
 strategy equilibria in monotone bidding functions in first-price auctions
 with asymmetric bidders, interdependent values, and affiliated
 one-dimensional signals. By extending a monotonicity result due to Milgrom
 and Weber (1982), we show that single crossing can fail only when ties
 occur at winning bids or when bids are individually irrational. We avoid
 these problems by considering limits of ever finer finite bid sets such
 that no two bidders have a common serious bid, and by recalling that
 single crossing is needed only at individually rational bids. Two examples
 suggest that our results cannot be extended to multidimensional signals or
 to second-price auctions. Copyright The Econometric Society 2004.

Title: Two Questions about European Unemployment 
Abstract:
				 A general equilibrium search model makes
 layoff costs affect the aggregate unemployment rate in ways that depend on
 equilibrium proportions of frictional and structural unemployment that in
 turn depend on the generosity of government unemployment benefits and
 skill losses among newly displaced workers. The model explains how, before
 the 1970s, lower flows into unemployment gave Europe lower unemployment
 rates than the United States and also how, after 1980, higher durations
 have kept unemployment rates in Europe persistently higher than in the
 United States. These outcomes arise from the way Europe's higher firing
 costs and more generous unemployment compensation make its unemployment
 rate respond to bigger skill losses among newly displaced workers. Those
 bigger skill losses also explain why U.S. workers have experienced more
 earnings volatility since 1980 and why, especially among older workers,
 hazard rates of gaining employment in Europe now fall sharply with
 increases in the duration of unemployment. Copyright The Econometric Society 2008.

Title: A Mechanism-Design Approach to Speculative Trade 
Abstract:
				 When two parties have different prior
 beliefs about some future event, they can realize gains through
 speculative trade. Can these gains be realized when the parties' prior
 beliefs are not common knowledge? We examine a simple example in which two
 parties having heterogeneous prior beliefs, independently drawn from some
 distribution, bet on what future action one of them will choose. We define
 a notion of "constrained interim-efficient" best and ask whether they can
 be implemented in Bayesian equilibrium by some mechanism. Our main result
 establishes that as the costs of unilaterally manipulating the bet's
 outcome become more symmetric across states, implementation becomes
 easier. In particular, when these costs are equal in both states,
 implementation is possible for any distribution. Copyright The Econometric Society 2007.

Title:   Asymptotic Distributions of Impulse Responses, Step Responses, and Variance Decompositions of Estimated Linear Dynamic Models. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 857-70
Issue: 4
Volume: 61
Year: 1993

Abstract:
  Formulas are derived for computing asymptotic covariance matrices of sets
 of impulse responses, step responses, or variance decompositions of
 estimated dynamic simultaneous-equations models in vector autoregressive
 moving-average (VARMA) form. Computed covariances would be used to test
 linear restrictions on sets of impulse responses, step responses, or
 variance decompositions. The results unify and extend previous formulas to
 handle any model in VARMA form, provide accurate computations based on

Title:   Spatial Patterns in Household Demand. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 953-65
Issue: 4
Volume: 59
Year: 1991
Month:  July 
Abstract:
  This paper discusses economic processes that may give rise to spatial
 patterns in data and explores the relative merits of alternative modeling
 approaches when data are spatially correlated. An estimation scheme is
 presented that allows for spatial random effects and attention is focused
 on cases in which such a framework may be preferred to the more general
 fixed effects framework that nests it. The models presented are used
 together with information on the location of households in an Indonesian
 socioeconomic survey to test spatial relationships in Indonesian demand
 for rice.   Copyright 1991 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Finite Order Implications of Common Priors 
Abstract:
				 I characterize the implications of the
 common prior assumption for finite orders of beliefs about beliefs at a
 state and show that in finite models, the only such implications are those
 stemming from the weaker assumption of a common support. More precisely,
 given any finite N and any finite partitions model where priors have the
 same support, there is another finite partitions model with common priors
 that has the same nth order beliefs and knowledge for all n&le;N.	     Copyright The Econometric Society 2003.

Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 1251-89
Issue: 6
Volume: 62
Year: 1994
Month:  November 
Abstract:
  Recent experimental choice studies compare expected utility with
 competing theories of decision-making under risk. Formal tests used to
 judge the theories usually count the number of consistent responses,
 ignoring systematic variation in inconsistent responses. A
 maximum-likelihood estimation method is developed that extracts more
 information from the data and enables one to judge the predictive
 utility--fit and parsimony--of utility theories. Analyses of twenty-three
 data sets suggest a menu of theories that sacrifice the least parsimony
 for the biggest improvement in fit. The menu is mixed fanning, prospect
 theory, expected utility, and expected value.	 Copyright 1994 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Isotone Equilibrium in Games of Incomplete Information 
Abstract:
				 An isotone pure strategy equilibrium
 exists in any game of incomplete information in which each player's action
 set is a finite sublattice of multidimensional Euclidean space, types are
 multidimensional and atomless, and each player's interim expected payoff
 function satisfies two "nonprimitive conditions" whenever others adopt
 isotone pure strategies: (i) single-crossing in own action and type and
 (ii) quasi-supermodularity in own action. Conditions (i), (ii) are
 satisfied in supermodular and log-supermodular games given affiliated
 types,and in games with independent types in which each player's ex post
 payoff satisfies supermodularity in own action and nondecreasing
 differences in own action and type. This result is applied to provide the
 first proof of pure strategy equilibrium existence in the uniform price
 auction when bidders have multi-unit demand, nonprivate values, and
 independent types. Copyright The Econometric Society 2003.

Title:  Private Observation, Communication and Collusion
Abstract: The authors examine discounted repeated games where players privately
	observe different signals. A leading example is secret price cutting; a firm
	cannot directly observe rival firms' price cutting but its own sales can
	imperfectly indicate what is going on. The characterization of equilibria in
	this class of games has been an open question. The authors construct
	equilibria where players voluntarily communicate what they have observed and
	prove folk theorems. Their results thus provide a theoretical support for the
	conventional wisdom that communication facilitates collusion.

Title: The Law of Large Demand for Information 
Abstract:
 An unresolved problem in Bayesian decision theory is how to value and
 price information. This paper resolves both problems assuming inexpensive
 information. Building on Large Deviation Theory, we produce a generically
 complete asymptotic order on samples of i.i.d. signals in finite-state,
 finite-action models. Computing the marginal value of an additional
 signal, we find it is eventually exponentially falling in quantity, and
 higher for lower quality signals. We provide a precise formula for the
 information demand, valid at low prices: asymptotically a constant times
 the log price, and falling in the signal quality for a given price. Copyright The Econometric Society 2002.

Title:  Why Youths Drop Out of High School: The Impact of Preferences, Opportunities, and Abilities
Journal: Econometrica
Abstract:
  In this paper, we structurally estimate a sequential model of high school
  attendance and work decisions. The estimates imply that youths who drop out
  of high school have different traits than those who graduate, e.g., they have
  lower school ability and/or motivation, lower expectations about the rewards
  from graduation, and a comparative advantage at jobs that are done by
  non-graduates. We also found that working while in school reduces school
  performance. However, policy experiments indicate that even a complete
  prohibition on working would have a limited impact on the high school
  graduation rates of white males.

Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 1-18
Issue: 1
Volume: 55
Year: 1987
Month:  January 
Abstract:
  If it is common knowledge that the players in a game are Bayesian utility
 maximizers who treat uncertainty about other players' actions like any
 other uncertainty, then the outcome is necessarily a correlated
 equilibrium. Random strategies appear as an expression of each player's
 uncertainty about what the others will do, not as the result of willful
 randomization. Use is made of the common prior assumption, according to
 which differences in probability assessments by different individuals are
 due to the different information that they have (where "information" may
 be interpreted broadly, to include experience, upbringing, and genetic
 makeup).   Copyright 1987 by The Econometric Society.

Title:   A Simple Axiomatization of Nonadditive Expected Utility. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 1255-72
Issue: 6
Volume: 60
Year: 1992
Month:  November 
Abstract:
  This paper provides an extension of L. J. Savage's subjective expected
 utility theory for decisions under uncertainty. It includes in the set of
 events both unambiguous events for which probabilities are additive and
 ambiguous events for which probabilities are permitted to be nonadditive.
 The main axiom is cumulative dominance, which adapts stochastic dominance
 to decision-making under uncertainty. The authors derive a Choquet
 expected utility representation and show that a modification of cumulative
 dominance leads to the classical expected utility representation. The
 relationship of their approach with that of D. Schmeidler, who uses a
 two-stage formulation to derive Choquet expected utility, is also
 explored.   Copyright 1992 by The Econometric Society.

Title:   Renegotiation Design with Unverifiable Information. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 257-82
Issue: 2
Volume: 62
Year: 1994
Month:  March 
Abstract:
  It has been emphasized that when contracts are incomplete (e.g., because
 some relevant variables are not verifiable by outsiders), the possibility
 of contract negotiation may prevent achieving desirable allocations that
 could be implemented otherwise. The authors analyze a situation where
 renegotiation is always possible but contracts can influence the
 renegotiation process; they show that some flexibility in the choice of
 this process allows to achieve efficiency in a variety of situations,
 including optimal risk-sharing and investment decisions.   Copyright 1994 by The Econometric Society.

Title:   The Structure of Financial Equilibrium with Exogenous Yields: The Case of Incomplete Markets. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 135-62
Issue: 1
Volume: 57
Year: 1989
Month:  January 
Abstract:
  This paper presents an analysis of the structure of competitive
 equilibrium in a smooth, exchange economy where there are incomplete
 markets in financial instruments whose overall payoffs (both prices and
 yields) are fixed in units of account. The main result establishes that
 such market incompleteness generates a comparable degree of allocation
 indeterminateness. It is also shown how this real indeterminacy may
 increase when prices and yields are treated as variables rather than
 parameters.   Copyright 1989 by The Econometric Society.

Title:   Empirical Evidence on the Law of Demand. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 1525-49
Issue: 6
Volume: 59
Year: 1991
Month:  November 
Abstract:
  For market demand to satisfy the law of demand, it is sufficient that the
 mean of all households' income effect matrices is positive definite. The
 authors show how this mean income effect matrix can be estimated from
 cross section data under metonymy, an assumption about the distribution of
 household characteristics. The estimation uses the nonparametric method of
 average derivatives. When the method is applied to U.K. family expenditure
 data, the estimated mean income effect matrices are positive definite.
 This can be explained by a special form of heteroskedasticity in the data:
 households' demands are more dispersed at higher income levels.   Copyright 1991 by The Econometric Society.

Title:   Marginal Cost Pricing under Bounded Marginal Returns. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 859-76
Issue: 4
Volume: 60
Year: 1992
Month:  July 
Abstract:
  Most of the available results on the existence of marginal cost pricing
 equilibrium are unsatisfactory in that they make a survival assumption
 that is stated as a condition on the production equilibria of the economy.
 The primary objective of this paper is to provide a relatively elementary
 existence result that replaces such an assumption with one on the
 primitive data of the economy. The author's main assumption is that no
 firm faces unbounded increasing returns in the sense that if it uses some
 input then the rate at which this input can be substituted into an output
 is finite.   Copyright 1992 by The Econometric Society.

Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 783-94
Issue: 4
Volume: 62
Year: 1994
Month:  July 
Abstract:
  Two of the most important refinements of the Nash equilibrium concept for
 extensive form games are (trembling hand) perfect equilibrium and
 sequential equilibrium. It is shown here that, for almost all assignments
 of payoffs to outcomes, the sets of sequential and perfect equilibrium
 strategy profiles are identical. This result is obtained by exploiting the
 semialgebraic nature of equilibrium correspondences, following from a deep
 theorem of mathematical logic.   Copyright 1994 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Driving Forces Behind Informal Sanctions 
Abstract:
				 This paper investigates the driving forces
 behind informal sanctions in cooperation games and the extent to which
 theories of fairness and reciprocity capture these forces. We find that
 cooperators' punishment is almost exclusively targeted toward the
 defectors, but the latter also impose a considerable amount of spiteful
 punishment on the cooperators. However, spiteful punishment vanishes if
 the punishers can no longer affect the payoff differences between
 themselves and the punished individual, whereas the cooperators even
 increase the resources devoted to punishment in this case. Our data also
 discriminate between different fairness principles. Fairness theories that
 are based on the assumption that players compare their own payoff to the
 group's average or the group's total payoff cannot explain the fact that
 cooperators target their punishment at the defectors. Fairness theories
 that assume that players aim to minimize payoff inequalities cannot
 explain the fact that cooperators punish defectors even if payoff
 inequalities cannot be reduced. Therefore, retaliation, i.e., the desire
 to harm those who committed unfair acts, seems to be the most important
 motive behind fairness-driven informal sanctions. Copyright The Econometric Society 2005.

Title:   Household Choices in Equilibrium. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 543-70
Issue: 3
Volume: 58
Year: 1990
Month:  May 
Abstract:
  This paper is an empirical investigation of equilibrium restrictions on
 household consumption and male labor supply. It exploits a simple factor
 structure, rationalized by two assumptions, that household allocations are
 Pareto optimal and that the labor market is competitive. The paper
 estimates household preferences, and tests how well this parsimonious
 factor structure represents panel data on married couples and time series
 data on asset returns. Most of the estimates are roughly comparable to
 those found in previous work; no evidence against the simple factor
 representation is found and the intertemporal capital asset pricing model
 is not rejected.   Copyright 1990 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Temptation and Self-Control 
Abstract:
 We study a two-period model where ex ante inferior choice may tempt the
 decision-maker in the second period. Individuals have preferences over
 sets of alternatives that represent second period choices. Our axioms
 yield a representation that identifies the individual&apos;s commitment
 ranking, temptation ranking, and cost of self-control. An agent has a
 preference for commitment if she strictly prefers a subset of alternatives
 to the set itself. An agent has self-control if she resists temptation and
 chooses an option with higher ex ante utility. We introduce comparative
 measures of preference for commitment and self-control and relate them to
 our representations. Copyright The Econometric Society.

Title:  Bargaining and Reputation
Abstract:   A complete information bargaining model is amended to accommodate
 "irrational types" who are inflexible in their offers and demands.
 An "independence of procedures" result is derived: the bargaining
 outcome is independent of the details of the bargaining protocol if
 players can make offers frequently. In the limiting continuous-time
 game, equilibrium is unique, and entails delay, consequently
 inefficiency. As the probability of irrationality goes to zero,
 delay and inefficiency disappear; furthermore, if there are a rich
 set of types for both agents, their limit equilibrium payoffs are
 inversely proportional to their rates of time preference.

Title:   On the Generic Nonoptimality of Dominant-Strategy Allocation Mechanisms: A General Theorem That Includes Pure Exchange Economies. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 683-704
Issue: 3
Volume: 58
Year: 1990
Month:  May 
Abstract:
  It is shown that if an economy's participants cannot be separated into
 groups across which there are no potentially conflicting interests--i.e.,
 if the economy is "indecomposable"--then every continuous truth-dominant
 allocation mechanism will attain nonoptimal allocations on an open dense
 set of preference profiles. Classical "Edgeworth-box" exchange economies
 (economies with no externalities and no production, but with arbitrary
 numbers of consumers and goods), as well as economies with public goods
 and economies with other kinds of externalities, are all shown via simple
 arguments to be indecomposable. The results are extended to cover
 nonrevelation mechanisms.   Copyright 1990 by The Econometric Society.

Title:  The Method of Simulated Scores for the Estimation of LDV Models
Abstract: The method of simulated scores (MSS) is presented for estimating
	limited dependent variables models (LDV) with flexible correlation structure
	in the unobservables. The authors propose simulators that are continuous in
	the unknown parameter vectors, and hence standard optimization methods can be
	used to compute the MSS estimators that employ these simulators. The first
	continuous method relies on a recursive conditioning of the multivariate
	normal density through a Cholesky triangularization of its
	variance-covariance matrix. The second method combines results about the
	conditionals of the multivariate normal distribution with Gibbs resampling
	techniques. The authors establish consistency and asymptotic normality of the
	MSS estimators and derive suitable rates at which the number of simulations
	must rise if biased simulators are used.

Title: Moral Hazard Contracting and Private Credit Markets 
Abstract:
				 This paper studies the impact of credit
 markets on optimal contracting, when the agent's "interim preference" over
 upcoming contracts is private information because personal financial
 decisions affect it via the wealth effect. The main result is a severe
 loss of incentive provision: equilibrium contracts invariably cause the
 agent to shirk (i.e., exert minimal effort) if the agent's private
 financial decision precedes moral hazard contracting. The basic intuition
 is that committing on another private variable, other than the effort
 level, exposes the parties to further exploitation of efficient
 risk-sharing by relaxing the incentive constraint that was binding ex
 ante, unless the risk-sharing was fully efficient to begin with. Copyright The Econometric Society 2004.

Abstract:
  This paper provides a proof of the consistency and asymptotic normality
 of the quasi-maximum likelihood estimator in GARCH(1,1) and IGARCH(1,1)
 models. In contrast to the case of a unit root in the conditional mean,
 the presence of a 'unit root' in the conditional variance does not affect
 the limiting distribution of the estimators; in both models, estimators
 are normally distributed. In addition, a consistent estimator of the
 covariance matrix is available, enabling the use of standard test
 statistics for inference.   Copyright 1996 by The Econometric Society.

Issue: 4
Volume: 59
Year: 1991
Month:  July 
Abstract:
  The authors describe a model of general equilibrium with incomplete
 markets in which firms can innovate by issuing arbitrary, costly
 securities.  When short sales are prohibited, firms behave competitively
 and equilibrium is efficient. When short sales are allowed, these
 classical properties may fail. If unlimited short sales are allowed,
 imperfect competition may persist even when the number of potential
 innovators is large. If limited short sales are allowed, perfect
 competition may obtain in the limit, but equilibrium can be inefficient
 because of the presence of an externality: the private benefits of
 innovation for firms differ from the social benefits.	 Copyright 1991 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Gift Exchange in the Field 
Abstract:
				 This study reports evidence from a field
 experiment that was conducted to investigate the relevance of gift
 exchange in a natural setting. In collaboration with a charitable
 organization, we sent roughly 10,000 solicitation letters to potential
 donors. One-third of the letters contained no gift, one-third contained a
 small gift, and one-third contained a large gift. Treatment assignment was
 random. The results confirm the economic importance of gift exchange.
 Compared to the no gift condition, the relative frequency of donations
 increased by 17 percent if a small gift was included and by 75 percent for
 a large gift. The study extends the current body of research on gift
 exchange, which is almost exclusively confined to laboratory studies. Copyright The Econometric Society 2007.

Title: Random Effects Estimators with many Instrumental Variables 
Abstract:
				 In this paper we propose a new estimator
 for a model with one endogenous regressor and many instrumental variables.
 Our motivation comes from the recent literature on the poor properties of
 standard instrumental variables estimators when the instrumental variables
 are weakly correlated with the endogenous regressor. Our proposed
 estimator puts a random coefficients structure on the relation between the
 endogenous regressor and the instruments. The variance of the random
 coefficients is modelled as an unknown parameter. In addition to proposing
 a new estimator, our analysis yields new insights into the properties of
 the standard two-stage least squares (TSLS) and limited-information
 maximum likelihood (LIML) estimators in the case with many weak
 instruments. We show that in some interesting cases, TSLS and LIML can be
 approximated by maximizing the random effects likelihood subject to
 particular constraints. We show that statistics based on comparisons of
 the unconstrained estimates of these parameters to the implicit TSLS and
 LIML restrictions can be used to identify settings when standard large
 sample approximations to the distributions of TSLS and LIML are likely to
 perform poorly. We also show that with many weak instruments, LIML
 confidence intervals are likely to have under-coverage, even though its
 finite sample distribution is approximately centered at the true value of
 the parameter. In an application with real data and simulations around
 this data set, the proposed estimator performs markedly better than TSLS
 and LIML, both in terms of coverage rate and in terms of risk. Copyright Econometric Society 2004.

Title:   Fair Allocation of Indivisible Goods and Criteria of Justice. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 1023-39
Issue: 4
Volume: 59
Year: 1991
Month:  July 
Abstract:
  A set of n objects and an amount M of money is to be distributed among m
 people. Example: the objects are tasks and the money is compensation from
 a fixed budget. An elementary argument via constrained optimization shows
 that for M sufficiently large the set of efficient, envy free allocations
 is nonempty and has a nice structure. In particular, various criteria of
 justice lead to unique best fair allocations that are well behaved with
 respect to changes of M. This is in sharp contrast to the usual fair
 division theory with divisible goods.	 Copyright 1991 by The Econometric Society.

Title: The Effects of a Baby Boom on Stock Prices and Capital Accumulation in the Presence of Social Security 
Abstract:
 Is the stock market boom a result of the baby boom? This paper develops an
 overlapping generations model in which a baby boom is modeled as a high
 realization of a random birth rate, and the price of capital is determined
 endogenously by a convex cost of adjustment. A baby boom increases
 national saving and investment and thus causes an increase in the price of
 capital. The price of capital is mean--reverting so the initial increase
 in the price of capital is followed by a decrease. Social Security can
 potentially affect national saving and investment, though in the long run,
 it does not affect the price of capital. Copyright The Econometric Society 2003.

Title:   Innovation, Imitation, and Intellectual Property Rights. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 1247-80
Issue: 6
Volume: 61
Year: 1993
Month:  November 
Abstract:
  The debate between the North and the South about the enforcement of
 intellectual property rights is examined within a dynamic general
 equilibrium framework in which the North invents new products and the
 South imitates them. A welfare evaluation of a policy of tighter
 intellectual property rights is provided by decomposing its response into
 four items: (1) terms of trade; (2) production composition; (3) available
 products; and (4) intertemporal allocation of consumption The paper
 proceeds in stages. It begins with an exogenous rate of innovation in
 order to focus on the first two elements. The following two components are
 added by endogenizing the rate of innovation. Finally, foreign direct
 investment is added to the model.   Copyright 1993 by The Econometric Society.

Title:   Stationary Markov Equilibria. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 745-81
Issue: 4
Volume: 62
Year: 1994
Month:  July 
Abstract:
  Conditions are established under which there are equilibria (in various
 settings) described by ergodic Markov processes with a Borel state space
 S. Let [Rho](S) denote the probability measures on S, and let s
 [approaching] G(s) [is a subset of] [Rho](S) be a (possibly empty-valued)
 correspondence with closed graph. A non-empty measurable set J [is a
 subset of] S is self-justified if G(s) [intersects] [Rho](J) is not empty
 for all s [an element of] J. A Time-Homogeneous Markov Equilibrium (THME)
 for G is a self-justified set J and a measurable selection II: J
 [approaching] [Rho] (J) from the restriction of G to J. The paper gives
 sufficient conditions for existence of compact self-justified sets, and
 applies the theorem: If G is convex-valued and has a compact
 self-justified set, then G has an THME with an ergodic measure. Coauthors
 are J. Geanakoplos, A. Mas-Colell, and A. McLennan.   Copyright 1994 by The Econometric Society.

Title:   Efficiency Bounds for Semiparametric Regression. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 567-96
Issue: 3
Volume: 60
Year: 1992
Month:  May 
Abstract:
  Efficiency bounds for conditional moment restrictions with a
 nonparametric component are derived. There is a given function of the data
 (a random sample from a distribution F) and a parameter. The restriction
 is that a conditional expectation of this function is zero at some point
 in the parameter space. The parameter has two parts: a finite-dimensional
 component and a general function evaluated at a subset of the conditioning
 variables. An example is a regression function that is additive in
 parametric and nonparametric component, as arises in sample selection
 models.   Copyright 1992 by The Econometric Society.

Title:   Estimation of Multi-market Fix-Price Models: An Application of Pseudo Maximum Likelihood Methods. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 831-60
Issue: 4
Volume: 57
Year: 1989
Month:  July 
Abstract:
  The past decade has seen the econometric implementation of macroeconomic
 multimarket fix-price models for a number of European countries. The
 procedure in use, the full information maximum likelihood method,
 unfortunately becomes very cumbersome and seems out of reach when
 additional features are incorporated in the model (disaggregation into
 micro markets, opinion surveys ...). One purpose of the present work is to
 prove the fruitfulness of the following estimation strategy: use Monte
 Carlo simulations to compute the first- and second-order moments of the
 endogenous variables, and maximize a resulting pseudo likelihood function
 to estimate the parameters.   Copyright 1989 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Idiosyncratic Shocks and the Role of Nonconvexities in Plant and Aggregate Investment Dynamics 
Abstract:
				     We study a model of lumpy investment
 wherein establishments face persistent shocks to common and plant-specific
 productivity, and nonconvex adjustment costs lead them to pursue
 generalized (S, s) investment rules. We allow persistent heterogeneity in
 both capital and total factor productivity alongside low-level investments
 exempt from adjustment costs to develop the first model consistent with
 the cross-sectional distribution of establishment investment rates.
 Examining the implications of lumpy investment for aggregate dynamics in
 this setting, we find that they remain substantial when factor supply
 considerations are ignored, but are quantitatively irrelevant in general
 equilibrium.					    Copyright The Econometric Society 2008.

  S. Scotchmer has shown that, even if the population is homogeneous,
 hedonic prices do not correctly measure long-run benefit s of a large

 that the use of cross-sectional land rent differentials leads to
 overestimation of the benefits. The short-run benefits with fixed lot size
 are also considered.   Copyright 1988 by The Econometric Society.

Title:   Does Saving Anticipate Declining Labor Income? An Alternative Test of the Permanent Income Hypothesis. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 1249-73
Issue: 6
Volume: 55
Year: 1987
Month:  November 
Abstract:
  The permanent income hypothesis implies that people save because they
 rationally expect their permanent income to decline; they save "for a
 rainy day." It follows that saving should be at l east as good a predictor
 of declines in labor income as any other for ecast that can be constructed
 from publicly available information. Th e paper tests this hitherto
 ignored implication of the permanent inco me hypothesis, using quarterly
 aggregate data for the period 1953-84 in the United States. By contrast
 with much of the recent literature, the results here are valid when income
 is stationary in first differ ences rather than levels.   Copyright 1987 by The Econometric Society.

Title:   Justifying the First-Order Approach to Principal-Agent Problems. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 1177-90
Issue: 5
Volume: 56
Year: 1988
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  It is of interest to know when the incentive compatibility conditio n in
 principal-agent problems can be replaced by the condition that the agent's
 expected utility be stationary in effort. The Mirrlees-Rogerson conditions
 do not work if the principal can observe more than one observable
 statistic. Also, the Mirrlees-Rogerson assumption that the distribution
 function of output is convex in the agent's action is unsatisfactory even
 in the context of the basi c model; it is too restrictive. The paper
 presents a suite of conditio ns that are applicable to the multistatistic
 case and replaces the objectionable convex distribution function
 assumption.   Copyright 1988 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Simultaneous Search 
Abstract:
				 We introduce and solve a new class of
 "downward-recursive" static portfolio choice problems. An individual
 simultaneously chooses among ranked stochastic options, and each choice is
 costly. In the motivational application, just one may be exercised from
 those that succeed. This often emerges in practice, such as when a student
 applies to many colleges or when a firm simultaneously tries several
 technologies. Copyright The Econometric Society 2006.

Title:   Optimal Tests When a Nuisance Parameter Is Present Only under the Alternative. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 1383-1414
Issue: 6
Volume: 62
Year: 1994
Month:  November 
Abstract:
  This paper derives asymptotically optimal tests for testing problems in
 which a nuisance parameter exists under the alternative hypothesis but not
 under the null. For example, the results apply to tests of structural
 change with unknown changepoint. The testing problem considered is
 nonstandard and the classical asymptotic optimality results for the
 Lagrange multiplier, Wald, and likelihood ratio do not apply. A weighted
 average power criterion is used here to generate optimal tests. This
 criterion is similar to that used by A. Wald (1943) to obtain the
 classical asymptotic optimality properties of Wald tests in 'regular'
 testing problems.   Copyright 1994 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Tests of Conditional Predictive Ability 
Abstract:
				 We propose a framework for out-of-sample
 predictive ability testing and forecast selection designed for use in the
 realistic situation in which the forecasting model is possibly
 misspecified, due to unmodeled dynamics, unmodeled heterogeneity,
 incorrect functional form, or any combination of these. Relative to the
 existing literature (Diebold and Mariano (1995) and West (1996)), we
 introduce two main innovations: (i) We derive our tests in an environment
 where the finite sample properties of the estimators on which the
 forecasts may depend are preserved asymptotically. (ii) We accommodate
 conditional evaluation objectives (can we predict which forecast will be
 more accurate at a future date?), which nest unconditional objectives
 (which forecast was more accurate on average?), that have been the sole
 focus of previous literature. As a result of (i), our tests have several
 advantages: they capture the effect of estimation uncertainty on relative
 forecast performance, they can handle forecasts based on both nested and
 nonnested models, they allow the forecasts to be produced by general
 estimation methods, and they are easy to compute. Although both
 unconditional and conditional approaches are informative, conditioning can
 help fine-tune the forecast selection to current economic conditions. To
 this end, we propose a two-step decision rule that uses current
 information to select the best forecast for the future date of interest.
 We illustrate the usefulness of our approach by comparing forecasts from
 leading parameter-reduction methods for macroeconomic forecasting using a
 large number of predictors.				      Copyright The Econometric Society 2006.

Title:   Common Knowledge with Monotone Statistics. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 1315-32
Issue: 5
Volume: 69
Year: 2001
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  When individual statistics are aggregated through a strictly monotone
 function to an aggregate statistic, common knowledge of the value of the
 aggregate statistic does not imply, in general, that the individual
 statistics are either equal or constant. This paper discusses
 circumstances where constancy and equality both hold. The first case
 arises when partitions are independently drawn, and each individual's
 information is determined by their own partition and some public signal.
 In this case common knowledge of the value of the aggregator function
 implies (with probability one) that the individual statistics are
 constant, so that in the case where the individual statistics have the
 same expected value, they must all be equal. The second circumstance is
 where private statistics are related: affiliation of individual statistics
 and a lattice condition imply that the individual statistics are equal
 when the value of the aggregate statistic is common knowledge.

Title:   Equilibrium in a Production Economy with an Income Tax. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 1091-1104
Issue: 4
Volume: 59
Year: 1991
Month:  July 
Abstract:
  This paper develops a method to study an infinite-horizon production
 economy distorted by a state-dependent income tax. This setting permits
 taxes to depend on the capital stock, an endogenous state variable, and
 thus captures situations where the evolution for capital and taxes is
 jointly determined. To solve this model, the consumption function is
 represented as a fixed point of a nonlinear monotone operator that is
 defined such that its nth iteration computes the consumption function n
 steps away from the horizon for a corresponding finite-horizon economy.
 The oparator's monotonicity is exploited in proving the existence of, and
 constructing, an equilibrium.	 Copyright 1991 by The Econometric Society.

Journal: Econometrica

Volume: 57
Year: 1989
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  A general central limit theorem is proved for estimators defined by
 minimization of the length of a vector-valued, random criterion function.
 No smoothness assumptions are imposed on the criterion function in order
 that the results might apply to a broad class of simulation estimators.
 Complete analyses of two simulation estimators, one introduced by A. Pakes
 (1986) and the other by D.  McFadden (1989), illustrate the application of
 the general theorems. These examples illustrate how simulation can be used
 to circumvent two computational problems that arise frequently in applied
 econometrics: evaluating intractable aggregation formulae and evaluating
 discrete response probabilities.   Copyright 1989 by The Econometric Society.

Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 889-910
Issue: 4
Volume: 57
Year: 1989
Month:  July 
Abstract:
  In this paper, the author considers how boundedly rational agents learn
 rational expectations when all equilibrium price functions or forecasts of
 future equilibrium prices are required to be computable. The paper
 examines two learning environments. In the first, agents have perfect
 information about the state of nature. In this case, the theory of machine
 inference can be applied to show that there is a broad class of computable
 economies whose rational expectations equilibria can be learned by
 inductive inference. In the second environment, agents do not have perfect
 information about the state of nature. In this case, a version of Godel's
 incompleteness theorem implies that rational expectations equilibria
 cannot be learned.   Copyright 1989 by The Econometric Society.

Title:   State Dependence, Serial Correlation and Heterogeneity in Intertemporal Labor Force Participation of Married Women	
Journal: Econometrica
Abstract:
  The intertemporal labor force participation of married women is analyzed
  using a dynamic search framework. Maximum simulated likelihood (MSL)
  estimation is used to estimate dynamic Probit models, and the sensitivity to
  alternative assumptions examined using Linear Probability models.
  Participation decisions are characterized by significant positive state
  dependence, unobserved heterogeneity, and negatively correlated errors. The
  hypothesis that women's participation is exogenous to their fertility
  decisions is rejected when dynamics are ignored, but there is no evidence
  against this hypothesis in dynamic specifications. Women's participation
  response is stronger to permanent than current non-labor income, reflecting
  unobserved taste factors.

Title: Swapping the Nested Fixed Point Algorithm: A Class of Estimators for Discrete Markov Decision Models 
Abstract:
 This paper proposes a new nested algorithm (NPL) for the estimation of a
 class of discrete Markov decision models and studies its statistical and
 computational properties. Our method is based on a representation of the
 solution of the dynamic programming problem in the space of conditional
 choice probabilities. When the NPL algorithm is initialized with
 consistent nonparametric estimates of conditional choice probabilities,
 successive iterations return a sequence of estimators of the structural
 parameters which we call "K"-stage policy iteration estimators. We show
 that the sequence includes as extreme cases a Hotz-Miller estimator (for
 "K"=1) and Rust's nested fixed point estimator (in the limit when
 "K approaches infinity). Furthermore, the asymptotic distribution of all the
 estimators in the sequence is the same and equal to that of the maximum
 likelihood estimator. We illustrate the performance of our method with
 several examples based on Rust's bus replacement model. Monte Carlo
 experiments reveal a trade-off between finite sample precision and
 computational cost in the sequence of policy iteration estimators. Copyright The Econometric Society 2002.

Year: 1990

Abstract:
  This paper considers a general equilibrium model of an economy where some
 firms may exhibit increasing returns to scale or more general types of
 nonconvexities. The firms are instructed to follow the standard marginal
 cost pricing rule or to fulfill the first-order necessary conditions for
 profit maximization. A general existence theorem of equilibria is proved
 in the case of an arbitrary number of firms. No assumption is made to
 imply the aggregate productive efficiency of equilibria, a condition that
 must be excluded in the nonconvex case.   Copyright 1990 by The Econometric Society.

Title:   Inference-Without-Smoothing in the Presence of Nonparametric Autocorrelation
Abstract: The author gives conditions under which nonparametric
	autocorrelation-consistent variance estimation is possible without smoothing.
	The conditions are relevant to inference on slope parameters in models with
	an intercept and strictly exogenous regressors, and allow regressors and
	disturbances to collectively have considerable stationary long memory and to
	satisfy only mild, in some cases minimal, moment conditions. His estimate
	dominates smoothed ones in the sense that it can have mean squared error
	proportional to the reciprocal of sample size. Under standard additional
	regularity conditions, the author shows that the estimate can validly
	studentize asymptotically normal estimates of structural parameters in linear
	simultaneous equations systems.

Title: The Time Structure of Self-Enforcing Agreements 
Abstract:
 A principal and an agent enter into a sequence of agreements. The
 principal faces an interim participation constraint at each date, but can
 commit to the current agreement; in contrast, the agent has the
 opportunity to renege on the current agreement. We study the time
 structure of agreement sequences that satisfy participation and
 no-deviation constraints and are (constrained) efficient. We show that
 every such sequence must, after a finite number of dates, exhibit a
 continuation that maximizes the "agent&apos;s" payoff over all such
 efficient, self-enforcing sequences. Additional results are provided for
 situations with transferable payoffs. Copyright The Econometric Society 2002.

Title:   A Dynamic Stochastic Model of Medical Care Use and Work Absence
Abstract: This research explores the medical care consumption and absenteeism
	decisions of employed individuals with acute illnesses in an effort to better
	understand health care behavior.  Using data from the 1987 National Medical
	Expenditure Survey, the author estimates the structural parameters of an
	individual's discrete choice stochastic optimization problem, as opposed to
	employing conventional reduced form estimation methods that are prevalent in
	the health care literature. The estimates allow for predictions of the change
	in physician services use and illness-related absenteeism that arise with the
	introduction of new public policy initiatives involving health insurance and
	sick-leave coverage.

Abstract:
  This paper develops techniques for empirically analyzing demand and
 supply in differentiated product markets and then applies these techniques
 to the U.S. automobile industry. The authors' framework enables one to
 obtain estimates of demand and cost parameters for a class of
 oligopolistic differentiated products markets. These estimates can be
 obtained using only widely available product-level and aggregate
 consumer-level data, and they are consistent with a structural model of
 equilibrium in an oligopolistic industry. Applying these techniques, the
 authors obtain parameters for essentially all autos sold over a
 twenty-year period.   Copyright 1995 by The Econometric Society.

Title:   Growth and Indeterminacy in Dynamic Models with Externalities. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 323-42
Issue: 2
Volume: 62
Year: 1994
Month:  March 
Abstract:
  In this paper we study the indeterminacy of equilibria in infinite
 horizon capital accumulation models with technological externalities. Our
 investigation encompasses both models with bounded and unbounded
 accumulation paths, and models with one and two sectors of production.
 Under reasonable assumptions we find that equilibria are locally unique in
 the one sector economies. The situation is different in economies with two
 sectors of production. Here it is very easy to construct analytical
 examples where a positive external effect induces a two dimensional
 manifold of equilibria converging to the same steady state (in the bounded
 case) or to the constant growth rate (in the unbounded case). For the
 latter we also point out that the dynamic behavior of these equilibria is
 quite complicated and that persistent fluctuations in their growth rates
 are possible.	 Copyright 1994 by The Econometric Society.

Title:   The Large Sample Correspondence between Classical Hypothesis Tests and Bayesian Posterior Odds Tests. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 1207-32
Issue: 5
Volume: 62
Year: 1994
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  This paper establishes a correspondence in large samples between
 classical hypothesis tests and Bayesian posterior odds tests for models
 without trends. More specifically, tests of point null hypotheses and one-
 or two-sided alternatives are considered (where nuisance parameters may be
 present under both hypotheses). It is shown that, for certain priors, the
 Bayesian posterior odds test is equivalent in large samples to classical
 Wald, Lagrange multiplier, and likelihood ratio tests for some
 significance level and vice versa. The priors considered under the
 alternative hypothesis are taken to shrink to the null hypothesis at rate
 n[superscript -1/2] as the sample size n increases.   Copyright 1994 by The Econometric Society.

Title:   Multiproduct Nonlinear Pricing. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 51-75
Issue: 1
Volume: 64
Year: 1996
Month:  January 
Abstract:
  Typically, work on mechanism design has assumed that all private
 information can be captured in a single scalar variable. This paper
 explores one way in which this assumption can be relaxed in the context of
 the multiproduct nonlinear pricing problem. It is shown that the firm will
 choose to exclude some low-value consumers from all markets. A class of
 cases that allow explicit solution is derived by making use of a
 multivariate form of 'integration by parts.' In such cases the optimal
 tariff is cost-based.	 Copyright 1996 by The Econometric Society.

Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 815-40
Issue: 4
Volume: 56
Year: 1988
Month:  July 
Abstract:
  This paper presents a theory of equilibrium asset pricing that
 generalizes the recent work of G. Connor (1984). Th e model extends
 Connor's results to more general sets of asset return s and consumer
 preferences; introduces production; and provides a fra mework for
 analyzing exact and approximate equilibrium asset pricing. The other major
 contribution of the paper is the introduction of geo metric arguments that
 exploit the properties of induced preferences o ver assets. This method of
 analyzing asset pricing provides an intuit ively appealing way of
 analyzing equilibrium asset pricing theories.	 Copyright 1988 by The Econometric Society.

Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 29-50
Issue: 1
Volume: 63
Year: 1995
Month:  January 
Abstract:
  This paper examines the effect on health outcomes of moving from
 cost-based to prospective reimbursement of hospitals. The paper reaches
 two conclusions. First, hospitals that experienced average price declines
 had a greater share of deaths occur in the hospital or shortly after
 discharge. By one year postdischarge, however, this increased mortality
 was eliminated. Second, there was an increase in readmission rates as
 hospitals were no longer reimbursed for marginal units of care they
 provided. This increased readmission appears to be due to accounting
 changes on the part of hospitals rather than changes in patient morbidity.    Copyright 1995 by The Econometric Society.

Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 1279-313
Issue: 5
Volume: 59
Year: 1991
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  A test for long-term memory that is robust to short-range dependence is
 developed. It is a modification of the R/S statistic, and the relevant
 asymptotic sampling theory is derived via functional central limit theory.
 Contrary to previous findings, when applied to daily and monthly stock
 returns indexes over several time periods this test yields no evidence of
 long-range dependence once short-range dependence is accounted for. Monte
 Carlo experiments show that the modified R/S test has power against at
 least two specific models of long-term memory, suggesting that models with
 short-range dependence may adequately capture the behavior of historical
 stock returns.   Copyright 1991 by The Econometric Society.

Title:  Inflation and Welfare  
Abstract:   This paper reviews research on the welfare cost of inflation. New
 estimates are provided, based on U.S. time series for 1900-94,
 interpreted in a variety of ways. It is estimated that the gain from
 reducing the annual inflation rate from 10 percent to zero is
 equivalent to an increase in real income of slightly less than one
 percent. Using aggregate evidence only, it may not be possible to
 estimate reliably the gains from reducing inflation to a rate
 consistent with zero nominal interest.

Title: Limited Information and Advertising in the U.S. Personal Computer Industry 
Abstract:
				 Traditional discrete-choice models assume
 buyers are aware of all products for sale. In markets where products
 change rapidly, the full information assumption is untenable. I present a
 discrete-choice model of limited consumer information, where advertising
 influences the set of products from which consumers choose to purchase. I
 apply the model to the U.S. personal computer market where top firms spend
 over $2 billion annually on advertising. I find estimated markups of 19%
 over production costs, where top firms advertise more than average and
 earn higher than average markups. High markups are explained to a large
 extent by informational asymmetries across consumers, where full
 information models predict markups of one-fourth the magnitude. I find
 that estimated product demand curves are biased toward being too elastic
 under traditional models. I show how to use data on media exposure to
 improve estimated price elasticities in the absence of micro ad data. Copyright  2008 The Econometric Society.

Title: Consistent Estimation with a Large Number of Weak Instruments 
Abstract:
				 This paper analyzes the conditions under
 which consistent estimation can be achieved in instrumental variables (IV)
 regression when the available instruments are weak and the number of
 instruments, K<sub>n</sub>, goes to infinity with the sample size. We show
 that consistent estimation depends importantly on the strength of the
 instruments as measured by r<sub>n</sub>, the rate of growth of the
 so-called concentration parameter, and also on K<sub>n</sub>. In
 particular, when K<sub>n</sub>&rarr;&infin;, the concentration parameter
 can grow, even if each individual instrument is only weakly correlated
 with the endogenous explanatory variables, and consistency of certain
 estimators can be established under weaker conditions than have previously
 been assumed in the literature. Hence, the use of many weak instruments
 may actually improve the performance of certain point estimators. More
 specifically, we find that the limited information maximum likelihood
 (LIML) estimator and the bias-corrected two-stage least squares (B2SLS)
 estimator are consistent when

Title: The Optimal Degree of Discretion in Monetary Policy 
Abstract:
				 How much discretion should the monetary
 authority have in setting its policy&quest; This question is analyzed in
 an economy with an agreed-upon social welfare function that depends on the
 economy's randomly fluctuating state. The monetary authority has private
 information about that state. Well designed rules trade off society's
 desire to give the monetary authority discretion to react to its private
 information against society's need to prevent that authority from giving
 in to the temptation to stimulate the economy with unexpected inflation,
 the time inconsistency problem. Although this dynamic mechanism design
 problem seems complex, its solution is simple: legislate an inflation cap.
 The optimal degree of monetary policy discretion turns out to shrink as
 the severity of the time inconsistency problem increases relative to the
 importance of private information. In an economy with a severe time
 inconsistency problem and unimportant private information, the optimal
 degree of discretion is none.				      Copyright The Econometric Society 2005.

Abstract:
  Comparative static properties of optimal nonlinear income taxes are
 obtained for a finite population version o f the Mirrlees income-tax model
 with a weighted utilitarian social we lfare function and quasilinear
 preferences. The parameters which are varied are the weights in the
 welfare function, the slope of the prod uction constraint, and a parameter
 in the utility function. The endog enous variables are the consumers'
 consumption levels, pretax incomes (labor supplies in efficiency units),
 utility levels, and marginal t ax rates.   Copyright 1987 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Optimal Bandwidth Selection in Heteroskedasticity-Autocorrelation Robust Testing 
Abstract:
				 This paper considers studentized tests in
 time series regressions with nonparametrically autocorrelated errors. The
 studentization is based on robust standard errors with truncation lag M=bT
 for some constant b is an element of (0, 1] and sample size T. It is shown
 that the nonstandard fixed-b limit distributions of such nonparametrically
 studentized tests provide more accurate approximations to the finite
 sample distributions than the standard small-b limit distribution. We
 further show that, for typical economic time series, the optimal bandwidth
 that minimizes a weighted average of type I and type II errors is larger
 by an order of magnitude than the bandwidth that minimizes the asymptotic
 mean squared error of the corresponding long-run variance estimator. A
 plug-in procedure for implementing this optimal bandwidth is suggested and
 simulations (not reported here) confirm that the new plug-in procedure
 works well in finite samples.				   Copyright The Econometric Society 2008.

Title:   The Existence of Subgame-Perfect Equilibrium in Continuous Games with Almost Perfect Information: A Case for Public Randomization. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 507-44
Issue: 3
Volume: 63
Year: 1995
Month:  May 
Abstract:
  The starting point of this paper is a simple, regular, dynamic game in
 which a subgame-perfect equilibrium fails to exist. Examination of this
 example shows that existence would be restored if players were allowed to
 observe the output of a public-randomization device. The main result of
 the paper shows that the introduction of public randomization yields
 existence not only in the example but also in a large class of dynamic
 games. It is also argued that the introduction of public randomization is
 the minimal robust extension of subgame-perfect equilibrium in this class
 of games.   Copyright 1995 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Long Cheap Talk 
Abstract:
				 With cheap talk, more can be achieved by
 long conversations than by a single message-even when one side is strictly
 better informed than the other. ("Cheap talk" means plain
 conversation-unmediated, nonbinding, and payoff-irrelevant.) This work
 characterizes the equilibrium payoffs for all two-person games in which
 one side is better informed than the other and cheap talk is permitted. Copyright The Econometric Society 2003.

Title:   The Dual Theory of Choice under Risk. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 95-115
Issue: 1
Volume: 55
Year: 1987
Month:  January 
Abstract:
  This paper investigates the consequences of the following modification of
 Expected Utility theory: instead of requiring independence with respect to
 probability mixtures of risky prospects, require independence with respect
 to direct mixing of payments o f risky prospects. A new theory of choice
 under risk- a so-called Dual theory-is obtained. Within this new theory,
 the following questions are considered: (1) numerical representation of
 preferences; (2) properties of the utility function; ( 3) the possibility
 for resolving the "paradoxes" of Expected Utilit y theory; ( 4) the
 characterization of risk aversion; and (5) comparative statics. The paper
 ends with a discussion of other non-Expected Utility theories proposed
 recently.   Copyright 1987 by The Econometric Society.

Title:   Hedging Pressure and Futures Price Movements in a General Equilibrium Model. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 411-28
Issue: 2
Volume: 58
Year: 1990
Month:  March 
Abstract:
  Futures hedging and pricing are examined in a model with two consumption
 goods, stochastic output, and sequential information arrival. Positive
 (negative) complementarity in consumer preferences promotes greater
 futures risk premia. The partial equilibrium conclusion that risk premia
 are a function of hedging pressure fails in the general equilibrium
 analysis with costless trading. As preferences are varied, producer
 hedging can change from long to short, while the futures risk premium
 remains unchanged. However, hedging pressure is reinstated as a
 determinant of risk premia, provided (as is usually valid) that fixed
 setup costs of trading deter consumers more than producers from
 participating in the futures market.   Copyright 1990 by The Econometric Society.

Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 1327-47
Issue: 6
Volume: 62
Year: 1994
Month:  November 
Abstract:
  'No trade' theorems have shown that new information will not lead to
 trade when agents share the same prior beliefs. This paper explores the
 structure of no trade theorems with heterogeneous prior beliefs. It is
 shown how different notions of efficiency under asymmetric information--ex
 ante, interim, ex post--are related to agents' prior beliefs as well as
 incentive compatible and public versions of those efficiency concepts.
 These efficiency results are used to characterize necessary and sufficient
 conditions on agents' beliefs for no trade theorems in different trading
 environments.	 Copyright 1994 by The Econometric Society.

Abstract:
  This paper contains the likelihood analysis of vector autoregressive
 models allowing for cointegration. The author derives the likelihood ratio
 test for cointegrating rank and finds it asymptotic distribution. He shows
 that the maximum likelihood estimator of the cointegrating relations can
 be found by reduced rank regression and derives the likelihood ratio test
 of structural hypotheses about these relations. The author shows that the
 asymptotic distribution of the maximum likelihood estimator is mixed
 Gaussian, allowing inference for hypotheses on the cointegrating relation
 to be conducted using the Chi(" squared") distribution.   Copyright 1991 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Two New Conditions Supporting the First-Order Approach to Multisignal Principal-Agent Problems 
Abstract:
				 This paper presents simple new multisignal
 generalizations of the two classic methods used to justify the first-order
 approach to moral hazard principal-agent problems, and compares these two
 approaches with each other. The paper first discusses limitations of
 previous generalizations. Then a state-space formulation is used to obtain
 a new multisignal generalization of the Jewitt (1988) conditions. Next,
 using the Mirrlees formulation, new multisignal generalizations of the
 convexity of the distribution function condition (CDFC) approach of
 Rogerson (1985) and Sinclair-Desgagné (1994) are obtained. Vector calculus
 methods are used to derive easy-to-check local conditions for our
 generalization of the CDFC. Finally, we argue that the Jewitt conditions
 may generalize more flexibly than the CDFC to the multisignal case. This
 is because, with many signals, the principal can become very well informed
 about the agent's action and, even in the one-signal case, the CDFC must
 fail when the signal becomes very accurate. Copyright  2009 The Econometric Society.

Title: On the Discrete Version of the Aumann-Shapley Cost-Sharing Method 
Abstract:
				 Each agent in a finite set requests an
 integer quantity of an idiosyncratic good; the resulting total cost must
 be shared among the participating agents. The Aumann-Shapley prices are
 given by the Shapley value of the game where each unit of each good is
 regarded as a distinct player. The Aumann-Shapley cost-sharing method
 charges to an agent the sum of the prices attached to the units she
 consumes.				 Copyright The Econometric Society 2005.

Title: Hard-to-Solve Bimatrix Games 
Abstract:
				 The Lemke-Howson algorithm is the
 classical method for finding one Nash equilibrium of a bimatrix game. This
 paper presents a class of square bimatrix games for which this algorithm
 takes, even in the best case, an exponential number of steps in the
 dimension d of the game. Using polytope theory, the games are constructed
 using pairs of dual cyclic polytopes with 2d suitably labeled facets in
 d-space. The construction is extended to nonsquare games where, in
 addition to exponentially long Lemke-Howson computations, finding an
 equilibrium by support enumeration takes on average exponential time.	     Copyright The Econometric Society 2006.

Title: Testing for Regime Switching 
Abstract:
				 We analyze use of a quasi-likelihood ratio
 statistic for a mixture model to test the null hypothesis of one regime
 versus the alternative of two regimes in a Markov regime-switching
 context. This test exploits mixture properties implied by the
 regime-switching process, but ignores certain implied serial correlation
 properties. When formulated in the natural way, the setting is
 nonstandard, involving nuisance parameters on the boundary of the
 parameter space, nuisance parameters identified only under the
 alternative, or approximations using derivatives higher than second order.
 We exploit recent advances by Andrews (2001) and contribute to the
 literature by extending the scope of mixture models, obtaining asymptotic
 null distributions different from those in the literature. We further
 provide critical values for popular models or bounds for tail
 probabilities that are useful in constructing conservative critical values
 for regime-switching tests. We compare the size and power of our
 statistics to other useful tests for regime switching via Monte Carlo
 methods and find relatively good performance. We apply our methods to
 reexamine the classic cartel study of Porter (1983) and reaffirm Porter's
 findings. Copyright The Econometric Society 2007.

Title: Time Consistency of Fiscal and Monetary Policy: A Solution 
Abstract:
				 This paper demonstrates how time
 consistency of the Ramsey policy-the optimal fiscal and monetary policy
 under commitment-can be achieved. Each government should leave its
 successor with a unique maturity structure for nominal and indexed debt,
 such that the marginal benefit of a surprise inflation exactly balances
 the marginal cost. Unlike in earlier papers on the topic, the result holds
 for quite general Ramsey policies, including time-varying polices with
 positive inflation and positive nominal interest rates. We compare our
 results with those in Persson, Persson, and Svensson (1987), Calvo and
 Obstfeld (1990), and Alvarez, Kehoe, and Neumeyer (2004). Copyright The Econometric Society 2006.

Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 1065-81
Issue: 5
Volume: 58
Year: 1990
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  In this paper, the authors reexamine the data from B. O'Neill's (1987)
 experiment involving a repeated, two-person, constant-sum game. They find
 that there is less evidence in support of the minimax hypothesis than
 indicated by O'Neill. There is strong evidence of serial correlation in
 players' choices, with several players displaying statistically
 significant dependence on the past moves of their opponents. The authors
 interpret this finding as evidence that the plays themselves rejected
 minimax play as the appropriate model for their opponents' behavior. They
 find no evidence that players' behavior approached minimax behavior as
 players became more experienced.   Copyright 1990 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Zero Expected Wealth Taxes: A Mirrlees Approach to Dynamic Optimal Taxation 
Abstract:
				 In this paper, I consider a dynamic
 economy in which a government needs to finance a stochastic process of
 purchases. The agents in the economy are privately informed about their
 skills, which evolve stochastically over time; I impose no restriction on
 the stochastic evolution of skills. I construct a tax system that
 implements a symmetric constrained Pareto optimal allocation. The tax
 system is constrained to be linear in an agent's wealth, but can be
 arbitrarily nonlinear in his current and past labor incomes. I find that
 wealth taxes in a given period depend on the individual's labor income in
 that period and previous ones. However, in any period, the expectation of
 an agent's wealth tax rate in the following period is zero. As well, the
 government never collects any net revenue from wealth taxes. Copyright The Econometric Society 2005.

Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 849-74
Issue: 4
Volume: 55
Year: 1987
Month:  July 
Abstract:
  The authors consider estimation of simultaneous equations models with
 covariance restrictions. They consider FIML estimation and extend J. A.
 Hausman's instrumental variables interpretation of the FIML estim ator to
 the covariance restrictions case. A slight variation on the i nstrumental
 variables theme yields a simple, efficient alternative to FIML. The
 authors augment the original equation system by equations implied by the
 covariance restrictions, linearized around an initial consistent
 estimator, and perform three-stage least squares to obtain an
 asymptotically efficient estimator. They also present a simple me thod of
 obtaining an initial consistent estimator when the covariance restrictions
 are needed for identification. Finally, they consider i dentification from
 the standpoint of the moment restrictions implied by instrument-residual
 orthogonality and covariance restrictions.   Copyright 1987 by The Econometric Society.

Abstract:
  The theoretical foundations of efficiency wages are explored for a model
 with employees' performance unverifiable. The set of outcomes
 implementable by self-enforcing (perfect equilibrium) implicit bilateral
 contracts is characterized. Market equilibrium is then analyzed. Perfect
 equilibria exist with any division between firm and employee of the gains
 from employment and with unfilled vacancies and unemployed workers
 occurring together. A renegotiation proofness criterion ensures that
 either all workers are employed or all jobs filled, but any division of
 the gains is still possible. Restrictions on beliefs that result in a
 Walrasian outcome, and in an efficiency wage outcome, are explored.   Copyright 1989 by The Econometric Society.

Title:   Single Crossing Properties and the Existence of Pure Strategy Equilibria in Games of Incomplete Information. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 861-89
Issue: 4
Volume: 69
Year: 2001
Month:  July 
Abstract:
  This paper analyzes a class of games of incomplete information where each
 agent has private information about her own type, and the types are drawn
 from an atomless joint probability distribution. The main result
 establishes existence of pure strategy Nash equilibria (PSNE) under a
 condition we call the single crossing condition (SCC), roughly described
 as follows: whenever each opponent uses a nondecreasing strategy (in the
 sense that higher types choose higher actions), a player's best response
 strategy is also nondecreasing. When the SCC holds, a PSNE exists in every
 finite-action game. Further, for games with continuous payoffs and a
 continuum of actions, there exists a sequence of PSNE to finite-action
 games that converges to a PSNE of the continuum-action game. These
 convergence and existence results also extend to some classes of games
 with discontinuous payoffs, such as first-price auctions, where bidders
 may be heterogeneous and reserve prices are permitted. Finally, the paper
 characterizes the SCC based on properties of utility functions and
 probability distributions over types. Applications include first-price,
 multi-unit, and all-pay auctions; pricing games with incomplete
 information about costs; and noisy signaling games.

Title: Event Exchangeability: Probabilistic Sophistication Without Continuity or Monotonicity 
Abstract:
				 Building on the Ramsey-de Finetti idea of
 event exchangeability, we derive a characterization of probabilistic
 sophistication without requiring any of the various versions of
 monotonicity, continuity, or comparative likelihood assumptions imposed by
 Savage (1954), Machina and Schmeidler (1992), and Grant (1995). Our
 characterization identifies a unique and finitely-additive subjective
 probability measure over an algebra of events. Copyright The Econometric Society 2006.

Journal: Econometrica

Issue: 2
Volume: 57
Year: 1989
Month:  March 
Abstract:
  Altruistic parents make choices of family size along with decisions about
 consumption and intergenerational transfers. The authors apply this
 framework to a closed economy, where the determination of interest rates
 and wage rates is simultaneous with the determination of population growth
 and the accumulation of capital. Thus, they extend the literature on
 optimal economic growth to allow for optimizing choices of fertility and
 intergenerational transfers. The authors use the model to assess the
 effects of child-rearing costs, the tax system, the conditions of
 technology and preferences, and shocks to the initial levels of population
 and the capital stock.   Copyright 1989 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Modeling Denomination Structures 
Abstract:
				 Previous work on the denomination
 structure of currency treats as exogenous the distribution of transactions
 and the denominations held by people. Here, by way of a matching model,
 both are endogenous. In the model, trades in pairwise meetings alternate
 in time with the opportunity to freely choose a portfolio of denominations
 and there is a trade-off between the benefits of small-denomination money
 for transacting and the costliness of carrying a large quantity of
 small-denomination money. For a given denomination structure, a monetary
 steady state is shown to exist. The model implies that too small
 denominations are abandoned. Copyright The Econometric Society 2005.

Title: Collusion With Persistent Cost Shocks 
Abstract:
				 We consider a dynamic Bertrand game in
 which prices are publicly observed and each firm receives a privately
 observed cost shock in each period. Although cost shocks are independent
 across firms, within a firm costs follow a first-order Markov process. We
 analyze the set of collusive equilibria available to firms, emphasizing
 the best collusive scheme for the firms at the start of the game. In
 general, there is a trade-off between productive efficiency, whereby the
 low-cost firm serves the market in a given period, and high prices. We
 show that when costs are perfectly correlated over time within a firm, if
 the distribution of costs is log-concave and firms are sufficiently
 patient, then the optimal collusive scheme entails price rigidity: firms
 set the same price and share the market equally, regardless of their
 respective costs. When serial correlation of costs is imperfect, partial
 productive efficiency is optimal. For the case of two cost types,
 first-best collusion is possible if the firms are patient relative to the
 persistence of cost shocks, but not otherwise. We present numerical
 examples of first-best collusive schemes. Copyright Copyright  2008 by The Econometric Society.

Abstract:
  This paper suggests an alternative to the weighted average utility

 of Savage's sure-thing principle, imposed on Schmeidler's nonadditive

 utility, as well as a weighted average of the utility's variation between
 each two consecutive periods. The analysis allows for definition and
 characterization of variation aversion, liking, and neutrality.   Copyright 1989 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Approximate versus Exact Equilibria in Dynamic Economies 
Abstract:
				 This paper develops theoretical
 foundations for an error analysis of approximate equilibria in dynamic
 stochastic general equilibrium models with heterogeneous agents and
 incomplete financial markets. While there are several algorithms that
 compute prices and allocations for which agents' first-order conditions
 are approximately satisfied ("approximate equilibria"), there are few
 results on how to interpret the errors in these candidate solutions and
 how to relate the computed allocations and prices to exact equilibrium
 allocations and prices. We give a simple example to illustrate that
 approximate equilibria might be very far from exact equilibria. We then
 interpret approximate equilibria as equilibria for close-by economies;
 that is, for economies with close-by individual endowments and
 preferences. Copyright The Econometric Society 2005.

Title:  Assortative Matching and Search 
Abstract:   In Becker's (1973) neoclassical marriage market model, matching is
 positively assortative if types are complements: i.e. match output
 is supermodular. We reprise this famous result assuming
 time-intensive partner search and transferable output. We prove
 existence of a search equilibrium with a continuum of types, and
 then characterize matching.  After showing that Becker's conditions
 no longer suffice for assortative matching, we find sufficient
 conditions valid for any search frictions and type distribution:
 supermodularity not only of match output, but also of its marginal
 product and cross partial derivative. Symmetric submodularity
 conditions imply negatively assortative matching. Examples show
 these conditions are necessary.

Title:   Pensions, the Option Value of Work, and Retirement. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 1151-80
Issue: 5
Volume: 58
Year: 1990
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  The effects of firm pension plan provisions on the retirement decisions
 of older employees are analyzed. The empirical results are based on data
 from a large firm, with a typical defined benefit pension plan. The
 "option value" of continued work is the central feature of the analysis.
 Estimation relies on a retirement decision rule that is close in spirit to
 the dynamic programming rule, but is considerably less complex than a
 comprehensive implementation of that rule, thus greatly facilitating the
 numerical analysis.   Copyright 1990 by The Econometric Society.

Title:   Unemployment Insurance Rules, Joblessness, and Part-Time Work. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 647-82
Issue: 3
Volume: 64
Year: 1996
Month:  May 
Abstract:
  In most states, unemployment insurance recipients accepting part-time
 work can earn up to a specific amount (the 'disregard') with no reduction
 in benefits. For earnings above the disregard, benefits are reduced dollar
 for dollar. This paper analyzes the effects of changes in the disregard on
 job search behavior. Using data from the Current Population Survey's
 Displaced Worker Supplements and a competing risks model with correlated
 risks and time-varying coefficients, an increase in the disregard is found
 to significantly increase the conditional probability of part-time
 reemployment during the first three months of joblessness.   Copyright 1996 by The Econometric Society.

Title:   Monte Carlo Methodology and the Finite Sample Properties of Instrumental Variables Statistics for Testing Nested and Non-nested Hypotheses. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 1249-77
Issue: 5
Volume: 59
Year: 1991
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  Using Monte Carlo methodology, this paper investigates the effect of
 dynamics and simultaneity on the finite sample properties of instrumental
 variables statistics for testing nested and nonnested hypotheses. Simple
 numerical-analytical formulae (response surfaces) are obtained which
 closely approximate the statistics' unknown size and power functions for a
 dynamic simultaneous-equations model. The analysis illustrates the value
 and limitations of asymptotic theory in interpreting finite sample
 properties. Two practical results arise. The F form and the Wald statistic
 is favored over its chi-squared form, and "large-sigma" and small
 "effective" sample size strongly affect the test of over-identifying
 restrictions and the Cox-type test.   Copyright 1991 by The Econometric Society.

Title:   Discontinuous Games and Endogenous Sharing Rules. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 861-72
Issue: 4
Volume: 58
Year: 1990
Month:  July 
Abstract:
  This paper proposes a new approach to the study of economic problems that
 have hitherto been modeled as games with discontinuous payoffs. Typically,
 the discontinuities arise from indeterminacies in the underlying problem.
 The authors' point of departure from the conventional approach is to view
 the sharing rules that resolve these indeterminacies as part of the
 solution rather than as part of the description of the model. A solution
 to the authors' model is a sharing rule, together with a profile of
 (mixed) strategies that satisfies the usual (Nash) best response
 criterion. Their main result is that such a solution always exists.   Copyright 1990 by The Econometric Society.

Title:   The Limiting Distribution of the Maximum Rank Correlation Estimator. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 123-37
Issue: 1
Volume: 61
Year: 1993
Month:  January 
Abstract:
  Han's maximum rank correlation estimator is shown to be square-root
 n-consistent and asymptotically normal. The proof rests on a general
 method for determining the asymptotic distribution of a maximization
 estimator, a simple U-statistic decomposition, and a uniform bound for
 degenerate U-processes. A consistent estimator of the asymptotic
 covariance matrix is provided, along with a result giving the explicit
 form of this matrix for any model within the scope of the maximum rate
 correlation estimator. The latter result is applied to the binary choice
 model, and it is found that the maximum rate correlation estimator does
 not achieve the semiparametric efficiency bound.   Copyright 1993 by The Econometric Society.

Title:   Regression Theory for Near-Integrated Time Series. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 1021-43
Issue: 5
Volume: 56
Year: 1988
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  The concept of a near-integrated vector random process is introduce d,
 helping the author work towards a general asymptotic theory of regression
 fo r multiple time series in which some series may be integrated processe
 s of the ARIMA type, others may be stable ARMA processes with near unit
 roots, and yet others may be mildly explosive. A limit theory for th e
 sample moments of such time series is developed using weak convergence.
 The theory is applied to the study of vector autoregress ions and
 cointegrating regressions of the type advanced by R. F. Engle and C. W.
 Granger (1987). A noncentral limiting distribution theory is derived for
 some recently-proposed multivariate unit root tests. Models with drift and
 near-integration are also studied.   Copyright 1988 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Efficiency of Large Double Auctions 
Abstract:
				 We consider large double auctions with
 private values. Values need be neither symmetric nor independent. Multiple
 units may be owned or desired. Participation may be stochastic. We
 introduce a very mild notion of "a little independence." We prove that all
 nontrivial equilibria of auctions that satisfy this notion are
 asymptotically efficient. For any alpha>0, inefficiency disappears at
 rate (1/n)^(2 alpha).				   Copyright The Econometric Society 2006.

Title: Overcoming Incentive Constraints by Linking Decisions  					-super-1  					  				 
Abstract:
				 Consider a Bayesian collective decision
 problem in which the preferences of agents are private information. We
 provide a general demonstration that the utility costs associated with
 incentive constraints become negligible when the decision problem is
 linked with a large number of independent copies of itself. This is
 established by defining a mechanism in which agents must budget their
 representations of preferences so that the frequency of preferences across
 problems mirrors the underlying distribution of preferences, and then
 arguing that agents' incentives are to satisfy their budget by being as
 truthful as possible. We also show that all equilibria of the linking
 mechanisms converge to the target utility levels. The mechanisms do not
 require transferable utility or interpersonal comparisons of utility, and
 are immune to manipulations by coalitions. Copyright The Econometric Society 2007.

Title: Why Do People Keep Their Promises? An Experimental Test of Two Explanations  					-super-1  					  				 
Abstract:
				 Numerous psychological and economic
 experiments have shown that the exchange of promises greatly enhances
 cooperative behavior in experimental games. This paper seeks to test two
 theories to explain this effect. The first posits that individuals have a
 preference for keeping their word. The second assumes that people dislike
 letting down others' payoff expectations. According to the latter account,
 promises affect behavior only indirectly, because they lead to changes in
 the payoff expectations attributed to others. I conduct an experiment
 designed to distinguish between and test these alternative explanations.
 The results demonstrate that the effects of promises cannot be accounted

Title:   The Stochastic Difference between Econometric Statistics. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 531-48
Issue: 3
Volume: 56
Year: 1988
Month:  May 
Abstract:
  In a somewhat general context, the author calculate s the order in
 probability of the difference between consistent roots of rival estimating
 equations, with application to point estimates i n parametric and
 nonparametric models, interval estimates, and test s tatistics.
 Differences in the statistical performances of various com monly-used
 iterative procedures are detected. He discusses implicatio ns of his
 results for higher-order efficiency comparisons and for mat ching the
 first-order efficiency of an implicitly defined target stat istic in
 finitely-many iterative steps. He justifies estimates obtain ed via a
 search of the objective function. His results are applied to the
 linear-in-variables simultaneous equations system.   Copyright 1988 by The Econometric Society.

Issue: 6
Volume: 61

Month:  November 
Abstract:
  Systems of consumer expenditure functions are estimated from Norwegian
 household panel data. Total consumption expenditure is modeled as a latent
 variable, as indicators of it are purchase expenditures on different goods
 and two income measures. The usual assumption of no measurement error in
 total expenditure is clearly rejected while a parsimonious alternative is
 not. The authors test hypotheses regarding the distribution of measurement
 errors, the evolution of the distribution of latent total expenditure
 across households, the distribution of individual differences in
 preferences, and the possible correlation between preferences and latent
 total expenditure.   Copyright 1993 by The Econometric Society.

Title:   Lexicographic Probabilities and Choice under Uncertainty. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 61-79
Issue: 1
Volume: 59
Year: 1991
Month:  January 
Abstract:
  Conventional Bayesian theory of choice under uncertainty, subjective
 expected utility theory, fails to satisfy the properties of admissibility
 and existence of well-defined conditional probabilities; weakly dominated
 acts may be chosen, and the usual definition of conditional probabilities
 applies only to nonnull events. This paper develops a non-Archimedean
 variant of subjective expected utility where decisionmakers have
 lexicographic beliefs. This generalization can be made to satisfy
 admissibility and yield well-defined conditional probabilities and at the
 same time allow for "null" events.   Copyright 1991 by The Econometric Society.

Journal: Econometrica

Issue: 3
Volume: 63
Year: 1995
Month:  May 
Abstract:
  Under certain regularity conditions, if the distribution of income is
 price independent and satisfies a condition on the shape of its graph,
 then total market demand is monotone. The author's methods allow for
 density functions increasing on some intervals, like unimodal
 distributions or even densities with more than one peak. Similar
 assumptions on the distribution of endowments yield a restricted
 monotonicity property on the aggregate excess demand function of a
 Walrasian pure exchange economy with wealth determined by market prices.
 It follows that the unique equilibrium price is stable.   Copyright 1995 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Inference in Censored Models with Endogenous Regressors 
Abstract:
	 This paper analyzes the linear regression model y &equals;
 x&bgr;&plus;&epsi; with a conditional median assumption med (&epsi;| z)
 &equals; 0, where z is a vector of exogenous instrument random variables.
 We study inference on the parameter &bgr; when y is censored and x is
 endogenous. We treat the censored model as a model with interval
 observation on an outcome, thus obtaining an incomplete model with
 inequality restrictions on conditional median regressions. We analyze the
 identified features of the model and provide sufficient conditions for
 point identification of the parameter &bgr;. We use a minimum distance
 estimator to consistently estimate the identified features of the model.
 We show that under point identification conditions and additional
 regularity conditions, the estimator based on inequality restrictions is
 <formula format="inline"><file name="ecta_430_m1.gif"
 type="gif"/></formula> normal and we derive its asymptotic variance. One
 can use our setup to treat the identification and estimation of endogenous
 linear median regression models with no censoring. A Monte Carlo analysis
 illustrates our estimator in the censored and the uncensored case. Copyright Econometric Society, 2002.

Title:   Multiproduct Duopolists. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 533-57
Issue: 3
Volume: 57
Year: 1989
Month:  May 
Abstract:
  The authors study a differentiated industry in which two firms compete by
 offering intervals of qualities to heterogenous consumers. They establish
 conditions which, for perfect competition and monopoly, imply that
 different consumers choose different qualities. Under these conditions,
 they show existence and essential uniqueness of a price equilibrium. At
 all price equilibria in which both firms make a positive profit,
 discrimination of consumers is incomplete. The authors also discuss the
 choice of product lines, and show that the Chamberlinian incentive to
 differentiate its products from those of its competitor dominates for
 intermediate qualities.   Copyright 1989 by The Econometric Society.

Title:   Efficient Instrumental Variables Estimation of Nonlinear Models. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 809-37
Issue: 4
Volume: 58
Year: 1990
Month:  July 
Abstract:
  This paper considers asymptotically efficient instrumental variables
 estimation of nonlinear models in an i.i.d. environment. The optimal
 instruments are estimated by nonparametric methods, either nearest
 neighbor or series regression. Ways of choosing the degree of
 approximation of the nonparametric instruments are discussed. Asymptotic
 efficiency is shown. The finite sample properties of the estimators are
 examined in a small sampling study of an endogenous dummy variable model.   Copyright 1990 by The Econometric Society.

Title:   Estimation of a Model of Entry in the Airline Industry. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 889-917
Issue: 4
Volume: 60
Year: 1992
Month:  July 
Abstract:
  This paper considers the effect of an airline's scale of operation at an
 airport on the profitability of routes flown out of that airport. The
 empirical methodology uses the entry decisions of airlines as indicators
 of underlying profitability; the results extend the empirical literature
 on airport presence by providing a new set of estimates of the
 determinants of city-pair profitability. These estimates imply that
 city-pair profits increase in airport presence and decrease rapidly in the
 number of entering firms. The literature on empirical models of oligopoly
 entry is also extended via a focus on the role of differences between
 firms.   Copyright 1992 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Technology, Geography, and Trade 
Abstract:
 We develop a Ricardian trade model that incorporates realistic geographic
 features into general equilibrium. It delivers simple structural equations
 for bilateral trade with parameters relating to absolute advantage, to
 comparative advantage (promoting trade), and to geographic barriers
 (resisting it). We estimate the parameters with data on bilateral trade in
 manufactures, prices, and geography from 19 OECD countries in 1990. We use
 the model to explore various issues such as the gains from trade, the role
 of trade in spreading the benefits of new technology, and the effects of
 tariff reduction. Copyright The Econometric Society 2002.

Journal: Econometrica

Issue: 1
Volume: 56
Year: 1988
Month:  January 
Abstract:
  In this paper, household is modeled as a two-member collectivity taking
 Pareto-efficient decisions. The consequences of this assumption are
 analyze d in a three-good model, in which only total consumption and each
 mem ber's labor supply are observable. If the agents are assumed egoistic
 (i.e., they are only concerned with their own leisure and consumptio n),
 it is possible to derive falsifiable conditions upon household la bor
 supplies from both a parametric and a nonparametric viewpoint. If ,
 alternatively, agents are altruistic, restrictions obtain in the no
 nparametric context; useful interpretation stems from the comparison with
 the characterization of aggregate demand for a private-good econ omy.	 Copyright 1988 by The Econometric Society.

Title:   Optimal Price Dynamics and Speculation with a Storable Good. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 41-80
Issue: 1
Volume: 57
Year: 1989
Month:  January 
Abstract:
  When the seller of a storable good must keep pace with inflation, buyers
 will speculate on the timing of price increases to buy and store just
 before. The unique Markov perfect equilibrium of this game involves
 recurrent periods during which the firm injects uncertainty into its
 price, while speculators store in increasing numbers, with possibly a
 final "run." The stochastic policies of many firms consistently aggregate
 back to a price index growing at the general rate of inflation. The model
 establishes that (1) inflation causes price uncertainty; and (2)
 speculation can be destabilizing and welfare-reducing even under perfect
 information.   Copyright 1989 by The Econometric Society.

Title:  Asymptotic Bias for Quasi-Maximum-Likelihood Estimators in Conditional Heteroskedasticity Models
Abstract: For conditional heteroskedasticity models, the authors study the
	identification condition that is required for consistency of a non-Gaussian
	quasi-maximum-likelihood estimator. They show that, if the conditional mean
	is zero or if a symmetry condition is satisfied, then the identification
	condition is satisfied. Without symmetry, an additional parameter, for the
	location of the innovation density, must be added for identification. For the
	conditional variance parameters of a GARCH process, there is no efficiency
	loss from adding the parameter under symmetry, when the parameter is not
	needed.

Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 357-62
Issue: 2
Volume: 55
Year: 1987
Month:  March 
Abstract:
  Andersen_(1970) considered the problem of inference on random effects
 linear models from binary response panel data, and showed that inference
 is possible if the disturbances for each panel member are known to be
 white noise with the logistic distribution. The present paper shows that
 inference remains possible if the disturbances are known only to be
 time-stationary. A conditional version of the maximum score estimator
 consistently estimates the parameters up to scale.   Copyright 1987 by The Econometric Society.

Title:   The Dynamics of Productivity in the Telecommunications Equipment Industry. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 1263-97
Issue: 6
Volume: 64
Year: 1996
Month:  November 
Abstract:
  Technological change and deregulation have caused a major restructuring
 telecommunications equipment industry over the last two decades. Our
 empirical focus is on estimating the parameters of a production function
 for the equipment industry, and then using those estimates to analyze the
 evolution of plant-level productivity. The restructuring involved
 significant entry and exit and large changes in the sizes of incumbents.
 This generates a selection and a simultaneity problem when estimating
 production functions. Our theoretical focus is on providing an estimation
 algorithm which takes explicit account of these issues. We find that our
 algorithm produces markedly different estimates of production function
 coefficients than do traditional estimation procedures, and that the
 productivity increases that followed deregulation were primarily a result
 of a reallocation of capital towards more productive establishments.   Copyright 1996 by The Econometric Society.

Title:  Error Bands for Impulse Responses
Journal: Econometrica
Abstract:
  We show how to correctly extend known methods for generating error bands in
  reduced form VAR's to overidentified models. We argue that the conventional
  pointwise bands common in the literature should be supplemented with measures
  of shape uncertainty, and we show how to generate such measures. We focus on
  bands that characterize the shape of the likelihood. Such bands are not
  classical confidence regions. We explain that classical confidence regions
  mix information about parameter location with information about model fit,
  and hence can be misleading as summaries of the implications of the data for
  the location of parameters.

Title:   Organizing the Health Insurance Market. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 1233-54
Issue: 6
Volume: 60
Year: 1992
Month:  November 
Abstract:
  This paper presents a new approach to organizing universal health
 insurance. First, the government divides the entire population into many
 large groups. Then, the government creates a federal health insurance
 system (HealthFed), modeled on the Federal Reserve System, to fill the
 role now played by the benefits office of a large firm. The HealthFed
 would create a short menu of alternatives, solicit bids for insuring the
 entire group, and price alternatives. There would be redistribution
 between groups and pricing of alternatives to reflect optimal social
 insurance principles. There would be no connection between health
 insurance and employment.   Copyright 1992 by The Econometric Society.

Title:   Getting to a Competitive Equilibrium. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 29-49
Issue: 1
Volume: 64
Year: 1996
Month:  January 
Abstract:
  A random price adjustment model is developed for an exchange economy
 which is decentralized in that the trades permitted to an agent and the
 resulting price changes depend only on the commodity vector currently held
 by that agent, and not on the whole economy. We obtain asymptotic results
 as the number of agents goes to infinity, subject to stability assumptions
 on the price paths. With probability arbitrarily close to one the price
 path in our model will approximate the price path of the corresponding
 tatonnement process on a rapid time scale, and will then remain close to a
 limit price. Moreover, the economy will approach a competitive
 equilibrium, and the process will be feasible in the sense that the market
 maker's inventory is approximately constant over time.   Copyright 1996 by The Econometric Society.

Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 357-80
Issue: 2
Volume: 64
Year: 1996
Month:  March 
Abstract:
  The authors present and analyze a model of noncooperative bargaining
 among n participants, applied to situations describable as games in
 coalitional form. This leads to a unified solution theory for such games
 that have as special cases the Shapley value in the transferable utility
 case, the Nash bargaining solution in the pure bargaining case, and the
 recently introduced Maschler-Owen consistent value in the general
 nontransferable utility case. Moreover, the authors show that any
 variation (in a certain class) of their bargaining procedure which
 generates the Shapley value in the transferable utility setup must yield
 the consistent value in the general nontransferable utility setup.   Copyright 1996 by The Econometric Society.

Title: The Nonparametric Identification of Treatment Effects in Duration Models 
Abstract:
				 This paper analyzes the specification and
 identification of causal multivariate duration models. We focus on the
 case in which one duration concerns the point in time a treatment is
 initiated and we are interested in the effect of this treatment on some
 outcome duration. We define "no anticipation of treatment" and relate it
 to a common assumption in biostatistics. We show that (i) no anticipation
 and (ii) randomized treatment assignment can be imposed without
 restricting the observational data. We impose (i) but not (ii) and prove
 identification of models that impose some structure. We allow for
 dependent unobserved heterogeneity and we do not exploit exclusion
 restrictions on covariates. We provide results for both single-spell and
 multiple-spell data. The timing of events conveys useful information on
 the treatment effect. Copyright The Econometric Society 2003.

Title:  A Rational Route to Randomness
Abstract: Adaptively rational equilibrium is introduced, where agents adapt their
	beliefs by choosing from a finite set of predictor functions. Agents make a
	rational predictor choice, based upon a publically available performance
	measure such as realized past profits. This results in an adaptive belief
	system, where predictor choice is coupled to the market equilibrium dynamics.
	As a typical example, the cobweb model with rational versus naive
	expectations is analyzed. If the market is locally unstable and rational
	expectations are costly to obtain, a high intensity of choice for predictor
	selection leads to chaos and strange attractors.

Title: Information in Securities Markets: Kyle Meets Glosten and Milgrom 
Abstract:
				 This paper analyzes models of securities
 markets with a single strategic informed trader and competitive market
 makers. In one version, uninformed trades arrive as a Brownian motion and
 market makers see only the order imbalance, as in Kyle (1985). In the
 other version, uninformed trades arrive as a Poisson process and market
 makers see individual trades. This is similar to the Glosten-Milgrom
 (1985) model, except that we allow the informed trader to optimize his
 times of trading. We show there is an equilibrium in the
 Glosten-Milgrom-type model in which the informed trader plays a mixed
 strategy (a point process with stochastic intensity). In this equilibrium,
 informed and uninformed trades arrive probabilistically, as Glosten and
 Milgrom assume. We study a sequence of such markets in which uninformed
 trades become smaller and arrive more frequently, approximating a Brownian
 motion. We show that the equilibria of the Glosten-Milgrom model converge
 to the equilibrium of the Kyle model. Copyright The Econometric Society 2004.

Title:   Asymptotic Likelihood-Based Prediction Functions. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 1215-34
Issue: 5
Volume: 58
Year: 1990
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  This paper develops asymptotic prediction functions that approximate the
 shape of the density of future observations and correct for parameter
 uncertainty. The functions are based on extensions to a definition of
 predictive likelihood originally suggested by S. L.  Lauritzen (1974) and
 D. Hinkley (1979). The prediction function is shown to possess efficiency
 properties based on the Kullback-Leibler measure of information loss.
 Examples of the application of the prediction function and the derivation
 of relative efficiency are shown for linear-normal models, nonnormal
 models, and ARCH models.   Copyright 1990 by The Econometric Society.

Title: On the Internal Structure of Cities 
Abstract:
 We prove the existence of a symmetric equilibrium in a circular city in
 which businesses and housing can both be located anywhere in the city. In
 this equilibrium, firms balance the external benefits from locating near
 other producers against the costs of longer commutes for workers. An
 equilibrium city need not take the form of a central business district
 surrounded by a residential area. We propose a general algorithm for
 constructing equilibria, and use it to study the way land use is affected
 by changes in the model's underlying parameters. Copyright The Econometric Society 2002.

Title: Statistical Treatment Rules for Heterogeneous Populations 
Abstract:
				 An important objective of empirical
 research on treatment response is to provide decision makers with
 information useful in choosing treatments. This paper studies
 minimax-regret treatment choice using the sample data generated by a
 classical randomized experiment. Consider a utilitarian social planner who
 must choose among the feasible statistical treatment rules, these being
 functions that map the sample data and observed covariates of population
 members into a treatment allocation. If the planner knew the population
 distribution of treatment response, the optimal treatment rule would
 maximize mean welfare conditional on all observed covariates. The
 appropriate use of covariate information is a more subtle matter when only
 sample data on treatment response are available. I consider the class of
 conditional empirical success rules; that is, rules assigning persons to
 treatments that yield the best experimental outcomes conditional on
 alternative subsets of the observed covariates. I derive a closed-form
 bound on the maximum regret of any such rule. Comparison of the bounds for
 rules that condition on smaller and larger subsets of the covariates
 yields sufficient sample sizes for productive use of covariate
 information. When the available sample size exceeds the sufficiency
 boundary, a planner can be certain that conditioning treatment choice on
 more covariates is preferable (in terms of minimax regret) to conditioning
 on fewer covariates.				       Copyright The Econometric Society 2004.

Title: Likelihood-Based Estimation of Latent Generalized ARCH Structures 
Abstract:
				 GARCH models are commonly used as latent
 processes in econometrics, financial economics, and macroeconomics. Yet no
 exact likelihood analysis of these models has been provided so far. In
 this paper we outline the issues and suggest a Markov chain Monte Carlo
 algorithm which allows the calculation of a classical estimator via the
 simulated EM algorithm or a Bayesian solution in O(T) computational
 operations, where T denotes the sample size. We assess the performance of
 our proposed algorithm in the context of both artificial examples and an
 empirical application to 26 UK sectorial stock returns, and compare it to
 existing approximate solutions.			      Copyright The Econometric Society 2004.

Title:   Steady State Learning and Nash Equilibrium. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 547-73
Issue: 3
Volume: 61
Year: 1993
Month:  May 
Abstract:
  The authors study the steady states of a system in which players learn
 about the strategies their opponents are playing by updating their
 Bayesian priors in light of their observations. Players are matched.at
 random to play a fixed extensive-form game and each player observes the
 realized actions in his own matches but not the intended off-path play of
 his opponents or the realized actions in other matches. Because players
 are assumed to live finite lives, there are steady states in which
 learning continually takes place. If lifetimes are long and players are
 very patient, the steady state distribution of actions approximates those
 of a Nash equilibrium.   Copyright 1993 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Fully Nonparametric Estimation of Scalar Diffusion Models 
Abstract:
 We propose a functional estimation procedure for homogeneous stochastic
 differential equations based on a discrete sample of observations and with
 minimal requirements on the data generating process. We show how to
 identify the drift and diffusion function in situations where one or the
 other function is considered a nuisance parameter. The asymptotic behavior
 of the estimators is examined as the observation frequency increases and
 as the time span lengthens. We prove almost sure consistency and weak
 convergence to mixtures of normal laws, where the mixing variates depend
 on the chronological local time of the underlying diffusion process, that
 is the random time spent by the process in the vicinity of a generic
 spatial point. The estimation method and asymptotic results apply to both
 stationary and nonstationary recurrent processes. Copyright The Econometric Society 2003.

Title:  An Empirical Equilibrium Search Model of the Labor Market	
Abstract: The authors investigate whether an equilibrium search model, in which
	the wage offer distribution is endogenous, is able to describe observed labor
	market histories. They find that the distributions of job and unemployment
	spells are consistent with the data, and qualitative predictions of the model
	for the wages set by employers are confirmed.  The authors distinguish
	between separate segments of the labor market, and they show that
	productivity heterogeneity is important to obtain an acceptable fit to the
	data. The results are used to estimate the firms' monopsony power.  The
	effects of changes in the mandatory minimum wage are examined.

Title:   Virtual Implementation in Nash Equilibrium. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 997-1021
Issue: 4
Volume: 59
Year: 1991
Month:  July 
Abstract:
  Consider a social choice correspondence as a mapping from preference
 profiles to lotteries over some finite set of alternatives. A virtually
 implementable social choice function in Nash equilibrium is defined, under
 mild domain restrictions it is shown that in societies with at least three
 individuals all social choice correspondences are virtually implementable
 in Nash equilibrium. This contrasts with Maskin's classic
 characterization, which requires monotonicity as a necessary condition for
 exact implementation in Nash equilibrium. The two person case is
 considered seperately. While not all two-person social choice functions
 are virtually implementable, our necessary and sufficient condition is
 simple, which contrasts with the complex necessary and sufficient
 conditions for exact implementation.   Copyright 1991 by The Econometric Society.

Title:  Preferences over Solutions to the Bargaining Problem
Abstract: There are several solutions to the Nash bargaining problem in the
	literature. Since various authors have expressed preferences for one solution
	over another, the authors find it useful to study preferences over solutions
	in their own right. They identify a set of appealing axioms on such
	preferences that lead to unanimity in the choice of solution, which turns out
	to be the solution of Nash. The key axiom is mixture symmetry, implying that
	if two solutions are equally attractive, then the half-half mixture of them
	is (weakly) preferred to any other mixture of the two.

Title:  Likelihood Ratio Specification Tests
Abstract: Moment based tests for mispecification of parametric models (e.g., of
	mean equals variance in a Poisson model) are studied.  The moment
	restrictions under test are embedded in an extension of the model so that the
	moment test is a score test of the hypothesis that a vector of added
	parameters is zero. Second-order asymptotic properties of the likelihood
	ratio version of this test are studied. Unlike the conventional test, the
	likelihood ratio version is Bartlett correctable.  The correction depends on
	the curvature at the origin of the function used to incorporate the moment
	restriction in the extended model.

Title: Estimating and Testing Structural Changes in Multivariate Regressions 
Abstract:
				 This paper considers issues related to
 estimation, inference, and computation with multiple structural changes
 that occur at unknown dates in a system of equations. Changes can occur in
 the regression coefficients and/or the covariance matrix of the errors. We
 also allow arbitrary restrictions on these parameters, which permits the
 analysis of partial structural change models, common breaks that occur in
 all equations, breaks that occur in a subset of equations, and so forth.
 The method of estimation is quasi-maximum likelihood based on Normal
 errors. The limiting distributions are obtained under more general
 assumptions than previous studies. For testing, we propose likelihood
 ratio type statistics to test the null hypothesis of no structural change
 and to select the number of changes. Structural change tests with
 restrictions on the parameters can be constructed to achieve higher power
 when prior information is present. For computation, an algorithm for an
 efficient procedure is proposed to construct the estimates and test
 statistics. We also introduce a novel locally ordered breaks model, which
 allows the breaks in different equations to be related yet not occurring
 at the same dates. Copyright The Econometric Society 2007.

Volume: 64
Year: 1996
Month:  July 
Abstract:
  Recent evolutionary models have introduced 'small mutation rates' as a
 way of refining predictions of long-run behavior. The authors show that
 this refinement effect can only be obtained by restrictions on how the
 magnitude of the effect of mutation on evolution varies across states of
 the system. In particular, given any model of the effect of mutations, any
 invariant distribution of the 'mutationless' process is close to an
 invariant distribution of the process with appropriately chosen small
 mutation rates.   Copyright 1996 by The Econometric Society.

Abstract:
  An allocation in an infinite horizon capital accumulation model is a
 recursive core allocation provided no coalition can improve upon its
 consumption stream at any time given its accumulation of assets up to that
 period. The authors show for every allocation of consumption in the
 initial core, one can find a distribution of capital stocks among the
 agents where no coalition of agents will break the initial core contract
 at any date. The recursive core links the distribution of capital, the
 problem of trust in the sense of D. Gale, and time consistent
 intertemporal contracts.   Copyright 1995 by The Econometric Society.

Title:   On the Value of Commitment with Asymmetric Information. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 1395-1414
Issue: 6
Volume: 64
Year: 1996
Month:  November 
Abstract:
  The authors show in this paper that renegotiable short-term contracts can
 be as efficient as long-term renegotiation-proof contracts even in
 situations of asymmetric information. They do so by extending their
 earlier results on symmetric information models. Some limited commitment
 thus seems to be a necessary and sufficient condition to achieve long-run
 efficiency. The authors moreover show that, due to ratchet effects and
 time inconsistencies in the structure of informational rents, spot
 contracts are much less efficient under asymmetric information, even is
 there is no need for intertemporal smoothing.	 Copyright 1996 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Weak Monotonicity Characterizes Deterministic Dominant-Strategy Implementation 
Abstract:
				 We characterize dominant-strategy
 incentive compatibility with multidimensional types. A deterministic
 social choice function is dominant-strategy incentive compatible if and
 only if it is weakly monotone (W-Mon). The W-Mon requirement is the
 following: If changing one agent's type (while keeping the types of other
 agents fixed) changes the outcome under the social choice function, then
 the resulting difference in utilities of the new and original outcomes
 evaluated at the new type of this agent must be no less than this
 difference in utilities evaluated at the original type of this agent. Copyright The Econometric Society 2006.

Title:  Robust Rank Tests of the Unit Root Hypothesis
Abstract: The authors consider a family of rank tests based on the regression
	rank score process introduced by C. Gutenbrunner and J. Jureckova (1992) to
	test the unit root hypothesis in economic time series. In contrast to tests
	based on least-squares methods, the rank tests are asymptotically Gaussian
	under the null hypothesis, and have excellent  power--particularly under
	innovation exhibiting heavy tails. These regression rank scores arise as a
	vector of solutions of the dual form of the linear program required to
	compute the regression quantile statistics of R. W. Koenker and G. Bassett
	(1978). For location model, they are simple ranks of the sample observations.

Issue: 2
Volume: 57
Year: 1989

Abstract:
  This paper models occasional, discrete shifts in the growth rate of a
 nonstationary series. Algorithms for inferring these unobserved shifts are
 presented, a byproduct of which permits estimation of parameters by
 maximum likelihood. An empirical application of this technique suggests
 that the periodic shift from a positive growth rate to a negative growth
 rate is a recurrent feature of the U.S. business cycle, and indeed could
 be used as an objective criterion for defining and measuring economic
 recessions. The estimated parameter values suggest that a typical economic
 recession is associated with a 3 percent permanent drop in the level of
 GNP.   Copyright 1989 by The Econometric Society.

Abstract:
  In a multiple-regression model the residual variance is an unknown
 function of the explanatory variables, and estimated by nearest-neighbor
 nonparametric regression. The resulting weighted least-squares estimator
 of the regression coefficients is shown to be adaptive, in the sense of
 having the same asymptotic distribution, to first order, as estimators
 based on knowledge of the actual variance function or a finite
 parameterization of it. A similar result was established by R. J. Carrol l
 (1982) using kernel estimation and under substantially more restrictive
 conditions on the data generating process than ours. Extensions to various
 other models seem to be possible.   Copyright 1987 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Dynamic Global Games of Regime Change: Learning, Multiplicity, and the Timing of Attacks 
Abstract:
				 Global games of regime change-coordination
 games of incomplete information in which a status quo is abandoned once a
 sufficiently large fraction of agents attack it-have been used to study
 crises phenomena such as currency attacks, bank runs, debt crises, and
 political change. We extend the static benchmark examined in the
 literature by allowing agents to take actions in many periods and to learn
 about the underlying fundamentals over time. We first provide a simple
 recursive algorithm for the characterization of monotone equilibria. We
 then show how the interaction of the knowledge that the regime survived
 past attacks with the arrival of information over time, or with changes in
 fundamentals, leads to interesting equilibrium properties. First,
 multiplicity may obtain under the same conditions on exogenous information
 that guarantee uniqueness in the static benchmark. Second, fundamentals
 may predict the eventual fate of the regime but not the timing or the
 number of attacks. Finally, equilibrium dynamics can alternate between
 phases of tranquility-where no attack is possible-and phases of
 distress-where a large attack can occur-even without changes in
 fundamentals. Copyright The Econometric Society 2007.

Abstract:
  This paper extends the spatial theory of voting to the case in which
 policy choices depend upon the interaction between executive and the
 legislature. Voters are strategic and to analyze equilibrium the authors
 apply 'coalition proof' type refinements. The model has implications
 consistent with voting behavior in the United States: (1) split-ticket
 with some voters choosing one party for the presidency and the other for
 Congress; (2) for some parameter values, a divided government with
 different parties controlling the executive and the majority of the
 legislature; and (3) the mid-term electoral cycle with the party holding
 the presidency always losing votes in mid-term legislative elections.	 Copyright 1996 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Inferential Theory for Factor Models of Large Dimensions 
Abstract:
 This paper develops an inferential theory for factor models of large
 dimensions. The principal components estimator is considered because it is
 easy to compute and is asymptotically equivalent to the maximum likelihood
 estimator (if normality is assumed). We derive the rate of convergence and
 the limiting distributions of the estimated factors, factor loadings, and
 common components. The theory is developed within the framework of large
 cross sections ("N") and a large time dimension ("T"), to which classical
 factor analysis does not apply.We show that the estimated common
 components are asymptotically normal with a convergence rate equal to the
 minimum of the square roots of "N" and "T". The estimated factors and
 their loadings are generally normal, although not always so. The
 convergence rate of the estimated factors and factor loadings can be
 faster than that of the estimated common components. These results are
 obtained under general conditions that allow for correlations and
 heteroskedasticities in both dimensions. Stronger results are obtained
 when the idiosyncratic errors are serially uncorrelated and homoskedastic.
 A necessary and sufficient condition for consistency is derived for large
 "N" but fixed "T". Copyright The Econometric Society 2003.

Title: Communication and Equilibrium in Discontinuous Games of Incomplete Information 
Abstract:
 This paper offers a new approach to the study of economic problems usually
 modeled as games of incomplete information with discontinuous payoffs.
 Typically, the discontinuities arise from indeterminacies (ties) in the
 underlying problem. The point of view taken here is that the tie-breaking
 rules that resolve these indeterminacies should be viewed as part of the
 solution rather than part of the description of the model. A solution is
 therefore a tie-breaking rule together with strategies satisfying the
 usual best-response criterion. When information is incomplete, solutions
 need not exist; that is, there may be no tie-breaking rule that is
 compatible with the existence of strategy profiles satisfying the usual
 best-response criteria. It is shown that the introduction of incentive
 compatible communication (cheap talk) restores existence. Copyright The Econometric Society 2002.

Title: Asymptotic Distributions of Quasi-Maximum Likelihood Estimators for Spatial Autoregressive Models 
Abstract:
				 This paper investigates asymptotic
 properties of the maximum likelihood estimator and the quasi-maximum
 likelihood estimator for the spatial autoregressive model. The rates of
 convergence of those estimators may depend on some general features of the
 spatial weights matrix of the model. It is important to make the
 distinction with different spatial scenarios. Under the scenario that each
 unit will be influenced by only a few neighboring units, the estimators

Title:   Public Disclosure and Dissimulation of Insider Trades. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 665-81
Issue: 3
Volume: 69
Year: 2001
Month:  May 
Abstract:
  Regulation requiring insiders to publicly disclose their stock trades
 after the fact complicates the trading decisions of informed, rent-seeking
 insiders. Given this requirement, we present an insider's equilibrium
 trading strategy in a multiperiod rational expectations framework.
 Relative to Kyle (1985), price discovery is accelerated and insider
 profits are lower. The strategy balances immediate profits from informed
 trades against the reduction in future profits following trade disclosure
 and, hence, revelation of some of the insider's information. Our results
 offer a novel rationale for contrarian trading: dissimulation, a
 phenomenon distinct from manipulation, may underlie insiders' trading

Title:   Efficiency of Large Private Value Auctions. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 37-68
Issue: 1
Volume: 69
Year: 2001
Month:  January 
Abstract:
  We consider discriminatory and uniform price auctions for multiple
 identical units of a good. Players have private values, possibly
 asymmetrically distributed and for multiple units. Our setting allows for
 aggregate uncertainty about demand and supply. In this setting, equilibria
 generally will be inefficient. Despite this, we show that such auctions
 become arbitrarily close to efficient if they are "large," and use this to
 derive an asymptotic characterization of revenue and bidding behavior.

Title:   Econometrics of First-Price Auctions. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 953-80
Issue: 4
Volume: 63
Year: 1995
Month:  July 
Abstract:
  This paper proposes a convenient estimation method for the empirical
 study of auction models. The authors focus on first-price sealed-bid and
 descending auctions within the private value paradigm. The method relies
 upon a simulated nonlinear least squares objective function appropriately
 adjusted. Asymptotic properties are established and some extensions are
 discussed. The method is applied to a market of agricultural products. The
 structural modeling takes into account the heterogeneity of the auctioned
 objects and the fact that only the winning bid is observed. Estimates of
 the parameters characterizing the distribution of the unobserved private
 values are provided.   Copyright 1995 by The Econometric Society.

Title:   Testing Instrument Admissibility: Some Refined Asymptotic Results. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 373-404
Issue: 2
Volume: 62
Year: 1994
Month:  March 
Abstract:
  This paper is concerned with the refined asymptotic properties of several
 tests for the admissibility of a subset of (overidentifying) instrumental
 variables. It derives maximum likelihood and linearized maximum likelihood
 tests and calculates size corrections to the order 1/T. The local power
 function of the size-corrected tests is the same to the order 1/T,
 irrespectively of the form of the test statistic or the limited
 information estimator used in its computation. Futher, it compares these
 tests with two previously proposed tests.  The size and the power of the
 original and the size-corrected tests are compared by Monte Carlo
 experiments.   Copyright 1994 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Identification in Nonparametric Simultaneous Equations Models 
Abstract:
				 This paper provides conditions for
 identification of functionals in nonparametric simultaneous equations
 models with nonadditive unobservable random terms. The conditions are
 derived from a characterization of observational equivalence between
 models. We show that, in the models considered, observational equivalence
 can be characterized by a restriction on the rank of a matrix. The use of
 the new results is exemplified by deriving previously known results about
 identification in parametric and nonparametric models as well as new
 results. A stylized method for analyzing identification, which is useful
 in some situations, is also presented. Copyright  2008 The Econometric Society.

Title: All-Pay Contests 
Abstract:
				 This paper studies a class of games,
 "all-pay contests," which capture general asymmetries and sunk investments
 inherent in scenarios such as lobbying, competition for market power,
 labor-market tournaments, and R&D races. Players compete for one of
 several identical prizes by choosing a score. Conditional on winning or
 losing, it is weakly better to do so with a lower score. This formulation
 allows for differing production technologies, costs of capital, prior
 investments, attitudes toward risk, and conditional and unconditional
 investments, among others. I provide a closed-form formula for players'
 equilibrium payoffs and analyze player participation. A special case of
 contests is multiprize, complete-information all-pay auctions. Copyright  2009 The Econometric Society.

Issue: 3

Year: 1987

Abstract:
  This paper shows that: (1) the "preference reversal" phenomenon can be
 consistent with transitive preferences if these preferences violate the
 independence axiom of expected utility theory and (2) for the class of
 experiments that were used to produce the evidence concerning "preference
 reversal," the elicitation of certainty equivalents is possible if, and
 only if, the respondent's preferences can be represented by functionals
 that are linear in the probabilities. Furthermore, a more general class of
 experiments is not immune to "preference reversal" if nonexpected utility
 preferences are admitted.   Copyright 1987 by The Econometric Society.

Title:   Dissolving a Partnership Efficiently. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 615-32
Issue: 3
Volume: 55
Year: 1987
Month:  May 
Abstract:
  Several partners jointly own an asset that may be traded among them. Each
 partner has a valuation for the asset. The valuations are known privately
 and drawn independently from a common probability distribution. The
 authors characterize the set of all incentive- compatible and interim
 individually-rational trading mechanisms, and give a simple necessary and
 sufficient condition for such mechanisms to dissolve the partnership ex
 post efficiently. A bidding game is constructed that achieves such
 dissolution whenever it is possible. Despite incomplete information about
 the valuation of the asset, a partnership can be dissolved ex post
 efficiently provided no single partner owns too large a share.   Copyright 1987 by The Econometric Society.

Title:   International Lending with Moral Hazard and Risk of Repudiation. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 1069-89
Issue: 4
Volume: 59
Year: 1991
Month:  July 
Abstract:
  The author examines the optimal pattern of lending in an environment in
 which there are two impediments to contracting. The first impediment is
 that lenders cannot observe whether borrowers invest or consume borrowed
 funds. This impediment leads to a moral hazard problem in investment. The
 second impediment is that the borrower may choose to repudiate his debts. 
 The optimal contract is shown to specify that the borrowing country
 experience a capital outflow when the worst realizations of output occur.
 This seemingly perverse pattern of capital outflow forms a necessary part
 of the optimal solution to the moral hazard problem in investment.   Copyright 1991 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Does Market Incompleteness Matter? 
Abstract:
 This paper argues that incompleteness of intertemporal financial markets
 has little effect (on welfare, prices, or consumption) in an economy with
 a single consumption good, provided that traders are long-lived and
 patient, a riskless bond is traded, shocks are transitory, and there is no
 aggregate risk. In an economy with aggregate risk, a similar conclusion
 holds, provided traders share the same CRRA utility function and the right
 assets are traded. Examples demonstrate that these conclusions need not
 hold if the wrong assets are traded or if the economy has multiple
 consumption goods. Copyright The Econometric Society 2002.

Title:   Learning, Mutation, and Long Run Equilibria in Games. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 29-56
Issue: 1
Volume: 61
Year: 1993
Month:  January 
Abstract:
  An evolutionary model with a finite number of players and with stochastic
 mutations is analyzed. The expansion and contraction of strategies is
 linked to their current relative success, but mutuation, perturbing the
 system from its deterministic evolution, are present as well. The focus is
 on the long run implications of ongoing mutations, which drastically
 reduce the set of equilibria. For 2 by 2 symmetric games with two
 symmetric strict Nash equilibria the risk dominant equilibrium is
 selected. In particular, if both strategies have equal security levels,
 the Pareto dominant Nash equilibrium is selected. In particular, if both
 strategies have equal security levels, the Pareto dominant Nash
 equilibrium is selected, even though there is another strict Nash
 equilibrium.   Copyright 1993 by The Econometric Society.

Title: On the Trade off Between Deficit and Inefficiency and the Double Auction with a Fixed Transaction Fee 
Abstract:
				 In many trading environments, any
 incentive compatible and individually rational market mechanism will be
 either inefficient or will run a deficit. We prove that as the market size
 m gets large, for any fixed surplus (or deficit) x, m times the minimal
 absolute inefficiency converges to c(x) where c(			   
	 <formula format="inline">					   
      <simplemath>&sdot;</simplemath>					   
   </formula>) is essentially a quadratic function of textitx. We introduce
 a new mechanism, the double auction with a fixed transaction fee. By
 choosing the size of the fee appropriately, any level of deficit or
 surplus can be implemented and the resulting mechanisms achieve the above
 bound. 			      Copyright The Econometric Society 2005.

Title:  Sieve Extremum Estimates for Weakly Dependent Data
Abstract: Many non/semiparametric time series estimates may be regarded as
	different forms of sieve extremum estimates. For stationary absolute regular
	mixing observations, the authors obtain convergence rates of sieve extremurn
	estimates and root-n asymptotic normality of 'plug-in' sieve extremum
	estimates of smooth functionals. As applications to time series models, they
	give convergence rates for nonparametric ARX(p,q) regression via neural
	networks, splines, wavelets; root-n asymptotic normality for partial linear
	additive AR(p) models, and monotone transformation AR(1) models.

Title:   On the Covariance Structure of Earnings and Hours Changes. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 411-45
Issue: 2
Volume: 57
Year: 1989
Month:  March 
Abstract:
  This paper presents an empirical analysis of individual earnings and
 hours data from three different longitudinal surveys. In the first part of
 the paper, the authors catalog the main features of the covariance
 structure of earnings and hours changes. In the second part of the paper,
 they offer an interpretation of this model in terms of a simple
 life-cycle, labor-supply model. On the assumption that they can identify
 individual productivity growth with the shared component of earnings and
 hours variation, the authors obtain estimates of the intertemporal
 substitution elasticity. The results are not favorable to the life-cycle
 model: most of the covariation of earnings occurs at fixed hourly wage
 rates.   Copyright 1989 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Designing Realized Kernels to Measure the ex post Variation of Equity Prices in the Presence of Noise 
Abstract:
				 This paper shows how to use realized
 kernels to carry out efficient feasible inference on the ex post variation
 of underlying equity prices in the presence of simple models of market
 frictions. The weights can be chosen to achieve the best possible rate of
 convergence and to have an asymptotic variance which equals that of the
 maximum likelihood estimator in the parametric version of this problem.
 Realized kernels can also be selected to (i) be analyzed using
 endogenously spaced data such as that in data bases on transactions, (ii)
 allow for market frictions which are endogenous, and (iii) allow for
 temporally dependent noise. The finite sample performance of our
 estimators is studied using simulation, while empirical work illustrates
 their use in practice. Copyright  2008 The Econometric Society.

Title: On Optimal Rules of Persuasion 
Abstract:
				 A speaker wishes to persuade a listener to
 accept a certain request. The conditions under which the request is
 justified, from the listener's point of view, depend on the values of two
 aspects. The values of the aspects are known only to the speaker and the
 listener can check the value of at most one. A mechanism specifies a set
 of messages that the speaker can send and a rule that determines the
 listener's response, namely, which aspect he checks and whether he accepts
 or rejects the speaker's request. We study mechanisms that maximize the
 probability that the listener accepts the request when it is justified and
 rejects the request when it is unjustified, given that the speaker
 maximizes the probability that his request is accepted. We show that a
 simple optimal mechanism exists and can be found by solving a linear
 programming problem in which the set of constraints is derived from what
 we call the L-principle.				    Copyright The Econometric Society 2004.

Title: Individual Sense of Justice: A Utility Representation 
Abstract:
 We present an axiomatic model depicting the choice behavior of a
 self-interest seeking moral individual over random allocation procedures.
 Individual preferences are decomposed into a self-interest component and a
 component representing the individual's moral value judgment. Each
 component has a distinct utility representation, and the preference
 relation depicting the choice behavior is representable by a real-valued
 function defined on the components utilities. The utility representing the
 self-interest component is linear and the utility representing the
 individual's moral value judgment is quasi-concave. The addition of a
 hexagon condition implies that the utility representing the individual's
 preference is additively separable in the components utilities. Copyright The Econometric Society 2002.

Title:   Some Impossibility Theorems in Econometrics with Applications to Structural and Dynamic Models
Abstract: General characterizations of valid confidence sets and tests in
	problems involving (locally almost) unidentified (LAU) parameters are
	presented. In particular, any valid confidence set for an unbounded LAU
	parameter must be unbounded with positive probability. Consequently, almost
	surely bounded confidence sets, like Wald-type confidence sets, have zero
	coverage probability and Wald-type test statistics cannot be pivotal
	functions. The results are applied to simultaneous equations (weak
	instruments), regressions with autoregressive errors, long-run multipliers,
	and cointegrating vectors. For such models, Wald-type procedures are not
	recommended while LR procedures can be shown to be valid.

Title:   Reputation in Bargaining and Durable Goods Monopoly. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 511-31
Issue: 3
Volume: 57
Year: 1989
Month:  May 
Abstract:
  This paper analyzes durable goods monopoly in an infinite-horizon,
 discrete-time game. The authors prove that, as the time interval between
 successive offers approaches zero, all seller payoffs between zero and
 static monopoly profits are supported by subgame perfect equilibria. This
 reverses a well-known conjecture of Coase. Alternatively, one can
 interpret the model as a sequential bargaining game with one-sided
 incomplete information in which an uninformed seller makes all the offers.
 The authors' folk theorem for seller payoffs equally applies to the set of
 sequential equilibria of this bargaining game.   Copyright 1989 by The Econometric Society.

  The authors provide a convergence theory for adaptive learning algorithms

 the framework of L. Ljung previously utilized by A. Marcet-T. J. Sargent
 and M. Woodford by permitting nonlinear laws of motion driven by
 stochastic processes that may exhibit moderate dependence, such as mixing
 and mixingale processes. The authors draw on previous work by H. J.
 Kushner and D. S. Clark to provide readily verifiable and/or interpretable
 conditions ensuring algorithm convergence, chosen for their suitability in
 the context of adaptive learning.   Copyright 1994 by The Econometric Society.

Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 139-63
Issue: 1
Volume: 59
Year: 1991
Month:  January 
Abstract:
  The independence axiom of expected utility theory has recently been
 weakened to the betweenness axiom. In this paper, an even weaker axiom,
 called mixture symmetry, is presented. The corresponding functional
 structure is such that utility is a betweenness functional on part of this
 domain and quadratic in probabilities elsewhere. The experimental evidence
 against betweenness provides one motivation for the more general theory
 presented here. Another advantage of the mixture symmetric class of
 utility functions is that it is sufficiently flexible to permit the
 disentangling of attitudes toward risk and toward randomization.   Copyright 1991 by The Econometric Society.

Title:   Canonical Cointegrating Regressions. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 119-43
Issue: 1
Volume: 60
Year: 1992
Month:  January 
Abstract:
  A new procedure for statistical inference in cointegrating regressions is
 developed. The author introduces canonical cointegrating regressions
 (regressions formulated with the transformed data). The required
 transformations involve simple adjustments of the integrated processes
 using stationary components in cointegrating models. Canonical
 cointegrating regressions, therefore, represent the same cointegrating
 relationships as the original models. They are, however, constructed in
 such a way that the usual least squares procedure yields asymptotically
 efficient estimators and chi-square tests. The methodology presented here
 is applicable to a very wide class of cointegrating models, including
 models with deterministic and singular, as well as stochastic and regular,
 cointegrations.   Copyright 1992 by The Econometric Society.

Title:   Information Aggregation in an Experimental Market. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 309-47
Issue: 2
Volume: 58
Year: 1990
Month:  March 
Abstract:
  In this study, the authors report the results from laboratory asset
 markets designed to test the rational expectations hypothesis that markets
 aggregate and transmit the information of differentially informed traders.
 After documenting evidence in favor of the rational expectations model,
 they examine which features of their environment are necessary or
 sufficient to achieve an rational expectations equilibrium. The authors
 find that trading experience and common knowledge of dividends are jointly
 sufficient to achieve a rational expectations equilibrium, but that
 neither is a sufficient condition by itself. They also present some
 stylized facts about the convergence process leading to a rational
 expectations equilibrium.   Copyright 1990 by The Econometric Society.

Title:   Internal Consistency of Choice. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 495-521
Issue: 3
Volume: 61
Year: 1993
Month:  May 
Abstract:
  Internal consistency of choice has been a central concept in economics,
 decision theory, and social choice. This idea is essentially confused. We
 cannot determine whether a choice function is consistent without referring
 to something external to choice (e.g., objectives, values). The standard
 results have to be reexamined in this light. Kenneth J. Arrow's general
 possibility theorem is extended in this paper without demanding any
 internal consistency of social choice or any notion of 'social
 rationality.'  Copyright 1993 by The Econometric Society.

Title:   Monitoring Structural Change. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 1045-65
Issue: 5
Volume: 64
Year: 1996
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  Contemporary tests for structural change are designed to detect a
 structural break within a given historical data set of fixed size. Due to
 the law of the iterated logarithm, these one-shot tests cannot be applied
 to monitor out-of-sample stability each time new data arrive. The authors
 propose and analyze two real-time monitoring procedures with controlled
 size asymptotically: the fluctuation and CUSUM monitoring procedures.
 Simulation results show that the proposed monitoring procedures indeed
 have controlled asymptotic size and that detection timing depends on the
 magnitude of parameter change, the signal to noise ratio, and the location
 of the out-of-sample break point.   Copyright 1996 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Cointegration in Fractional Systems with Unknown Integration Orders 
Abstract:
				 Cointegrated bivariate nonstationary time
 series are considered in a fractional context, without allowance for
 deterministic trends. Both the observable series and the cointegrating
 error can be fractional processes. The familiar situation in which the
 respective integration orders are 1 and 0 is nested, but these values have
 typically been assumed known. We allow one or more of them to be unknown
 real values, in which case Robinson and Marinucci (2001, 2003) have
 justified least squares estimates of the cointegrating vector, as well as
 narrow-band frequency-domain estimates, which may be less biased. While
 consistent, these estimates do not always have optimal convergence rates,
 and they have nonstandard limit distributional behavior. We consider
 estimates formulated in the frequency domain, that consequently allow for
 a wide variety of (parametric) autocorrelation in the short memory input
 series, as well as time-domain estimates based on autoregressive
 transformation. Both can be interpreted as approximating generalized least
 squares and Gaussian maximum likelihood estimates. The estimates share the
 same limiting distribution, having mixed normal asymptotics (yielding Wald
 test statistics with &chi;-super-2 null limit distributions), irrespective
 of whether the integration orders are known or unknown, subject in the
 latter case to their estimation with adequate rates of convergence. The
 parameters describing the short memory stationary input series are
 &radic;n-consistently estimable, but the assumptions imposed on these
 series are much more general than ones of autoregressive moving average
 type. A Monte Carlo study of finite-sample performance is included.	     Copyright The Econometric Society 2003.

Title:   Cheap Talk and Sequential Equilibria in Signaling Games. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 917-42
Issue: 4
Volume: 64
Year: 1996
Month:  July 
Abstract:
  Well-behaved infinite signaling games may have no sequential equilibria.
 The author proves that adding cheap talk to these games 'solves' the
 nonexistence problem: the limit of sequential equilibrium outcomes of
 finite approximating games is a sequential equilibrium outcome of the
 cheap-talk extension of the limit game. In addition, when the signaling
 space has no isolated points, any cheap-talk sequential equilibrium
 outcome can be approximated by a sequential [epsilon]-equilibrium of the
 game without cheap talk.   Copyright 1996 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Transition Modeling and Econometric Convergence Tests 
Abstract:
				 A new panel data model is proposed to
 represent the behavior of economies in transition, allowing for a wide
 range of possible time paths and individual heterogeneity. The model has
 both common and individual specific components, and is formulated as a
 nonlinear time varying factor model. When applied to a micro panel, the
 decomposition provides flexibility in idiosyncratic behavior over time and
 across section, while retaining some commonality across the panel by means
 of an unknown common growth component. This commonality means that when
 the heterogeneous time varying idiosyncratic components converge over time
 to a constant, a form of panel convergence holds, analogous to the concept
 of conditional sigma convergence. The paper provides a framework of
 asymptotic representations for the factor components that enables the
 development of econometric procedures of estimation and testing. In
 particular, a simple regression based convergence test is developed, whose
 asymptotic properties are analyzed under both null and local alternatives,
 and a new method of clustering panels into club convergence groups is
 constructed. These econometric methods are applied to analyze convergence
 in cost of living indices among 19 U.S. metropolitan cities. Copyright The Econometric Society 2007.

Title:   Noncausality in Continuous Time. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 1195-1212
Issue: 5
Volume: 64
Year: 1996
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  Different concepts of noncausality for continuous time processes, using
 conditional independence and decomposition of semimartingales, are
 defined. As in the discrete-time setup, continuous time noncausality is a
 property concerned with the prediction horizon (global versus
 instantaneous noncausality) and the nature of the prediction (strong
 versus weak noncausality). Relations between the resulting continuous time
 noncausality concepts are then studied for the class of decomposable
 semimartingales for which, in general, the weak instantaneous noncausality
 does not imply the strong global noncausality. The paper then
 characterizes these different concepts in the case of counting processes
 and Markov processes.	 Copyright 1996 by The Econometric Society.

Title:  Edgeworth's Conjecture with Infinitely Many Commodities: L1
Abstract: The authors examine core convergence for economies with a large finite
	number of agents and an infinite number of commodities.  They find a serious
	disconnection between economies with a large finite number of agents and
	economies with a continuum of agents: the authors provide examples of
	nonconvergence of the core for large finite economies in L[superscript 1], a
	commodity space for which core equivalence holds for continuum economies.  In
	addition, they show that, if preferences exhibit uniformly vanishing marginal
	utility of consumption at infinity, core convergence is restored.

Title:   A Refinement of Sequential Equilibrium. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 1367-89
Issue: 6
Volume: 55
Year: 1987
Month:  November 
Abstract:
  The		     author proposes a refinement of seq uential
 equilibrium for extensive form games by generalizing a restri ction
 proposed for signaling games in Cho and D. M. Kreps (1987). The
 restriction is that beliefs must not assign positive weight to the p
 ossibilities that can be excluded through reasonable introspection ba sed
 on the data available as common knowledge. A new technique is dev eloped
 in order to prove the existence of forward induction equilibri um, which
 consists of two steps. First, the author establishes the ge neric
 existence of forward induction equilibrium by exploiting the re sults of
 E. Kohlberg and J. F. Mertens (1986). Then, he shows that th e forward
 induction equilibrium correspondence is upper hemicontinuou s in the
 outcome space with respect to the changes of parameters of t he game.	 Copyright 1987 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Belief-Free Equilibria in Games With Incomplete Information 
Abstract:
				 We define belief-free equilibria in
 two-player games with incomplete information as sequential equilibria for
 which players' continuation strategies are best replies after every
 history, independently of their beliefs about the state of nature. We
 characterize a set of payoffs that includes all belief-free equilibrium
 payoffs. Conversely, any payoff in the interior of this set is a
 belief-free equilibrium payoff. The characterization is applied to the
 analysis of reputations. Copyright  2009 The Econometric Society.

Title:   The Effect of Unions on the Structure of Wages: A Longitudinal Analysis. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 957-79
Issue: 4
Volume: 64
Year: 1996
Month:  July 
Abstract:
  This paper studies the effects of unions on the structure of wages using
 an estimation technique that accounts for misclassification errors in
 reported union status and potential correlations between union status and
 unobserved productivity. The model is estimated separately for five skill
 groups using a panel data set formed from the U.S. Current Population
 Survey. The results suggest that unions raise wages more for workers with
 lower levels of observed skills. Union workers are positively selected
 from the population of workers with lower levels of observed skill and
 negatively selected from the population with higher observed skills.   Copyright 1996 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Estimation and Inference in Large Heterogeneous Panels with a Multifactor Error Structure 
Abstract:
				 This paper presents a new approach to
 estimation and inference in panel data models with a general multifactor
 error structure. The unobserved factors and the individual-specific errors
 are allowed to follow arbitrary stationary processes, and the number of
 unobserved factors need not be estimated. The basic idea is to filter the
 individual-specific regressors by means of cross-section averages such
 that asymptotically as the cross-section dimension (N) tends to infinity,
 the differential effects of unobserved common factors are eliminated. The
 estimation procedure has the advantage that it can be computed by least
 squares applied to auxiliary regressions where the observed regressors are
 augmented with cross-sectional averages of the dependent variable and the
 individual-specific regressors. A number of estimators (referred to as
 common correlated effects (CCE) estimators) are proposed and their
 asymptotic distributions are derived. The small sample properties of mean
 group and pooled CCE estimators are investigated by Monte Carlo
 experiments, showing that the CCE estimators have satisfactory small
 sample properties even under a substantial degree of heterogeneity and
 dynamics, and for relatively small values of N and T.			     Copyright The Econometric Society 2006.

Title:   Measuring Market Power in the Ready-to-Eat Cereal Industry. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 307-42
Issue: 2
Volume: 69
Year: 2001
Month:  March 
Abstract:
  The ready-to-eat cereal industry is characterized by high concentration,
 high price-cost margins, large advertising-to-sales ratios, and numerous
 introductions of new products. Previous researchers have concluded that
 the ready-to-eat cereal industry is a classic example of an industry with
 nearly collusive pricing behavior and intense nonprice competition. This
 paper empirically examines this conclusion. In particular, I estimate
 price-cost margins, but more importantly I am able empirically to separate
 these margins into three sources: (i) that which is due to product
 differentiation; (ii) that which is due to multi-product firm pricing; and
 (iii) that due to potential price collusion. The results suggest that
 given the demand for different brands of cereal, the first two effects
 explain most of the observed price-cost margins. I conclude that prices in
 the industry are consistent with noncollusive pricing behavior, despite
 the high price-cost margins. Leading firms are able to maintain a
 portfolio of differentiated products and influence the perceived product
 quality. It is these two factors that lead to high price-cost margins.

Title: Large Robust Games 
Abstract:
				 With many semi-anonymous players, the
 equilibria of simultaneous-move games are extensively robust. This means
 that the equilibria survive even if the simultaneous-play assumption is
 relaxed to allow for a large variety of extensive modifications. Such
 modifications include sequential play with partial and differential
 revelation of information, commitments, multiple revisions of choices,
 cheap talk announcements, and more.				  Copyright The Econometric Society 2004.

Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 1301-14
Issue: 6
Volume: 56
Year: 1988
Month:  November 
Abstract:
  Household economies of scale (arising from the existence of househo ld
 public goods, increasing returns in household production, and/or bulk
 discounts) are incorporated into a utility-theoretic model of household
 demands. Individuals are assumed to be identical and symmetrically treated
 within households. Economies of scale parameters for five goods are
 estimated using the quadratic expenditu re system and data from the U.S.
 Consumer Expenditure Survey on expenditures by all-adult households.
 Results suggest the existence o f significant economies of scale in the
 consumption of all of the included goods, with economies being especially
 pronounced in the consumption of shelter.   Copyright 1988 by The Econometric Society.

Month:  January 
Abstract:
  The author shows how a group of individuals can learn to play a
 coordination game without any common knowledge and with only a small
 amount of rationality. The game is repeated many times by different
 players. Each player chooses an optimal reply based on incomplete
 information about what other players have done in the past. Occasionally
 they make mistakes. When the likelihood of mistakes is very small,
 typically one coordination equilibrium will be played almost all of the
 time over the long run. This stochastically stable equilibrium can be
 computed analytically using a general theorem the author proves on
 perturbed Markov processes.   Copyright 1993 by The Econometric Society.

Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 283-322
Issue: 2
Volume: 62
Year: 1994
Month:  March 
Abstract:
  The R. E. Lucas (1978) general equilibrium model of asset prices is
 extended to admit beliefs that are represented by a (nonsingleton) set of
 probability measures. A primary motivation is evidence, such as the
 Ellsberg paradox, that people are averse to vague or imprecise
 probabilities. Intertemporal utility functions embodying such aversion are
 formulated and then, in the context of a Lucas-style economy, the
 existence and characterization of equilibria are addressed. A noteworthy
 feature is that (under specified conditions) equilibria are indeterminate.
 Therefore, 'animal spirits' may play a role and sizable price volatility
 may result.   Copyright 1994 by The Econometric Society.

Title:   Auctions for Oil and Gas Leases with an Informed Bidder and a Random Reservation Price. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 1415-44
Issue: 6
Volume: 62
Year: 1994
Month:  November 
Abstract:
  The authors analyze a first-price, sealed bid auction of an object with
 unknown common value, but one buyer has better information. The
 reservation price is correlated with the informed buyer's assessment of
 the value and of the probability of rejection. If all random variables are
 affiliated, the rate of increase in the distribution of the uninformed bid
 is never greater than that of the informed bid, the distributions are
 identical above the support of the reservation price, and the informed
 buyer is more likely to submit low bids. Bids for offshore oil and gas
 leases on drainage tracts satisfy these restrictions.	 Copyright 1994 by The Econometric Society.

Title:   Toward a Theory of Discounted Repeated Games with Imperfect Monitoring. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 1041-63
Issue: 5
Volume: 58
Year: 1990
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  This paper investigates pure strategy sequential equilibria of repeated
 games with imperfect monitoring. The approach emphasizes the equilibrium
 value set and the static optimization problems embedded in extremal
 equilibria. A succession of propositions, central among which is
 "self-generation," allow properties of constrained efficient supergame
 equilibria to be deduced from the solutions of the static problems. The
 authors show that the latter include solutions having a "bang-bang"
 property; this affords a significant simplification of the equilibria that
 need be considered. These results apply to a broad class of asymmetric
 games, thereby generalizing their earlier work on optimal cartel
 equilibria.   Copyright 1990 by The Econometric Society.

Journal: Econometrica

Issue: 4
Volume: 56
Year: 1988
Month:  July 
Abstract:
  Many electoral rules require a super-majority vote to change the status
 quo. Without some restriction on preferences, super-majority rules have
 paradoxical properties. For example, electoral cycles are possible with
 anything other than 100 percent majority rule. The auth ors show that
 these problems do not arise if there is sufficient simi larity of
 attitudes among the voting population. Their definition of social
 consensus involves two restrictions on domain: one on individu al
 preferences, the other on the distribution of preferences. When th is
 consensus exists, 64 percent majority rule has many desirable prop erties,

Title: Efficiency in Repeated Games Revisited: The Role of Private Strategies 
Abstract:
				 Most theoretical or applied research on
 repeated games with imperfect monitoring has focused on public strategies:
 strategies that depend solely on the history of publicly observable
 signals. This paper sheds light on the role of private strategies:
 strategies that depend not only on public signals, but also on players'
 own actions in the past. Our main finding is that players can sometimes
 make better use of information by using private strategies and that
 efficiency in repeated games can be improved. Our equilibrium private
 strategy for repeated prisoners' dilemma games consists of two states and
 has the property that each player's optimal strategy is independent of the
 other player's state.					 Copyright The Econometric Society 2006.

Title:  The Econometrics of Ultra-High Frequency Data
Abstract:     A complete transactions record is defined to be ultra-high
 frequency data. The transaction arrival times and associated
 characteristics can be analyzed by marked point processes. The ACD
 model developed by Engle and Russell (1998) is then applied to IBM
 transactions data to develop semi-parametric hazard estimates and
 measures of conditional variances.  Both returns and variances are
 negatively influenced by surprisingly long durations as suggested by
 asymmetric information models of market micro-structure.

Issue: 6
Volume: 58
Year: 1990

Abstract:
  This paper endogenizes the frequency of major discoveries and the extent
 of their refinement. Four axioms deliver a one-parameter family of beliefs
 that guide exploratory effort. Such effort trades off the prospect of
 major new discovery against the chance of successfully refining
 discoveries made in the past. The only other parameter is the cost of
 making new discoveries relative to the cost of refining old ones. The
 paper derives time-series properties of inventive activity as they relate
 to the two parameters, and it discusses several specific inventions and
 their subsequent refinement.   Copyright 1990 by The Econometric Society.

Issue: 3
Volume: 59
Year: 1991
Month:  May 
Abstract:
  This paper concerns moral hazard problems in multiagent situations where
 cooperation is an issue. Each agent allocates effort to his own task and
 to other tasks as "help." The principal may prefer an unambiguous division
 of labor by inducing each agent to specialize in his own task, or prefer
 teamwork where each agent is motivated to help other agents. A sufficient
 condition for teamwork to be optimal is presented. A nonconvexity of the
 optimal task structure is also shown: the principal wants either strict
 specialization or substantial teamwork.   Copyright 1991 by The Econometric Society.

Title: A Model of Utility Smoothing 
Abstract:
				 Experimental studies have found that a
 decision maker prefers spreading good and bad outcomes evenly over time.
 We propose, in an axiomatic framework, a new model of discount factors
 that captures this preference for spread. The model provides a refinement
 of the discounted utility model while maintaining dynamic consistency. The
 derived discount factors incorporate gain/loss asymmetry recursively: the
 difference between average future utility and current utility defines a
 gain or a loss, and gains are discounted more than losses. This notion of
 utility smoothing can induce a preference for spread: if bad outcomes are
 concentrated on future periods, moving one of the bad outcomes to today
 would be beneficial because such an operation eliminates a large loss and
 replaces it with a small gain. Copyright The Econometric Society 2008.

 of labor markets than segmentation is the presence of comparative
 advantages for individuals between the various economic sectors. The model
 is applied to data on women's labor-force participation in the main towns
 of Colombia in 1980. It uses multivariate probit and Tobit techniques.   Copyright 1991 by The Econometric Society.

Issue: 1
Volume: 69
Year: 2001
Month:  January 
Abstract:
  The paper first develops an economic analysis of the concept of
 shareholder value, describes its approach, and discusses some open
 questions. It emphasizes the relationship between pledgeable income,
 monitoring, and control rights using a unifying and simple framework. The
 paper then provides a first and preliminary analysis of the concept of the
 stakeholder society. It investigates whether the managerial incentives and
 the control structure described in the first part can be modified so as to
 promote the stakeholder society. It shows that the implementation of the
 stakeholder society strikes three rocks: dearth of pledgeable income,
 deadlocks in decision-making, and lack of clear mission for management.
 While it fares better than the stakeholder society on those three grounds,
 shareholder value generates biased decision-making; the paper analyzes the
 costs and benefits of various methods of protecting noncontrolling
 stakeholders: covenants, exit options, flat claims, enlarged fiduciary
 duty.

Abstract:
  This paper considers a class of statistics that can be written as the
 ratio of the sample variance of a filtered time series to the sample
 variance of the original series. Any such statistic is shown to be optimal
 under normality for testing a null of white noise against some class of
 serially dependent alternatives. A simple characterization of the
 alternative class is provided. The results are used to show that a
 variance ratio test for mean reversion is an optimal test and to
 illustrate the forms of mean reversion it is best at detecting.   Copyright 1992 by The Econometric Society.

Title:   The Random Utility Hypothesis and Inference in Demand Systems. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 815-29
Issue: 4
Volume: 57
Year: 1989
Month:  July 
Abstract:
  In this paper, the authors examine the consequences of adopting the
 random utility hypothesis as an approach for randomizing a system of
 demand equations. Random utility models are appealing since they allow the
 usual assumption of deterministic utility-maximizing behavior by each
 consumer to coexist with the apparent randomness across individuals that
 is exhibited by data. Their results show that the use of random utility
 models implies that the disturbances of the demand equations may not be
 homoskedastic, but must be functions of prices and/or income.	 Copyright 1989 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Testing for Stochastic Monotonicity 
Abstract:
				 We propose a test of the hypothesis of
 stochastic monotonicity. This hypothesis is of interest in many
 applications in economics. Our test is based on the supremum of a rescaled
 U-statistic. We show that its asymptotic distribution is Gumbel. The proof
 is difficult because the approximating Gaussian stochastic process
 contains both a stationary and a nonstationary part, and so we have to
 extend existing results that only apply to either one or the other case.
 We also propose a refinement to the asymptotic approximation that we show
 works much better in finite samples. We apply our test to the study of
 intergenerational income mobility.				 Copyright  2009 The Econometric Society.

Abstract:
  Properties of t ratios associated with the limited information maximum
 likelihood, two-stage least squares, and ordinary least squares estimators
 in a structural form estimation are studied. The existence of moments of
 these t ratios, including the limited information maximum likelihood form,
 is proved first. Second, Monte Carlo simulations are performed to find out
 real sizes of the t test and the likelihood ratio test. Third, asymptotic
 expansions of the distributions of t ratios are derived to find out
 deviations of real sizes from nominal sizes. The t ratios associated with
 the limited information maximum likelihood and two-stage least squares
 estimators are proved asymptotically as powerful as the likelihood ratio
 test.	 Copyright 1989 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Heteroskedasticity-Robust Standard Errors for Fixed Effects Panel Data Regression 
Abstract:
				 The conventional heteroskedasticity-robust
 (HR) variance matrix estimator for cross-sectional regression (with or
 without a degrees-of-freedom adjustment), applied to the fixed-effects
 estimator for panel data with serially uncorrelated errors, is
 inconsistent if the number of time periods T is fixed (and greater than 2)
 as the number of entities n increases. We provide a bias-adjusted HR
 estimator that is	nT-consistent under any sequences (n, T)
 in which n and/or T increase to infinity. This estimator can be extended to
 handle serial correlation of fixed order.			      Copyright The Econometric Society 2008.

Title:   Equilibrium Refinement for Infinite Normal-Form Games. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 1421-43
Issue: 6
Volume: 63
Year: 1995
Month:  November 
Abstract:
  The authors present three distinct approaches to perfect and proper
 equilibria for infinite normal form games. In the first two approaches,
 players 'tremble' in the infinite game playing full support approximate
 best responses to others' strategies. In the strong approach, a tremble
 assigns high probability to the set of pure best responses; in the weak
 approach, it assigns high probability to a neighborhood of this set. The
 third, limit-of-finite approach applies traditional refinements to
 sequences of successively larger finite games. Overall, the strong
 approach to equilibrium refinement most fully respects the structure of
 infinite games.   Copyright 1995 by The Econometric Society.

Month:  January 
Abstract:
  A transferable utility economy, in which each agent holds a resource that
 can be used in combination with the resources of other agents to generate
 value (according to the characteristics function V), is studied using a
 dynamic model of bargaining. The main theorem establishes that the payoffs
 associated with efficient equilibria converge to the agents' Shapley
 values as the time between periods of the dynamic game goes to zero. In
 addition, it is demonstrated that an efficient equilibrium exists and is
 unique when an additivity condition is satisfied.   Copyright 1989 by The Econometric Society.

Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 343-72
Issue: 2
Volume: 62
Year: 1994
Month:  March 
Abstract:
  The Bertrand-Edgeworth model describes competition among price setting
 sellers with production capacity constraints. The authors report on
 laboratory experiments that permit evaluation of different theories of
 Bertrand-Edgeworth competition: competitive pricing, Edgeworth cycles in
 prices, mixed strategy Nash equilibrium pricing, and tacit collusion. Each
 of the theories helps to explain some aspects of the data. However, none
 of these theories are completely consistent with the data. In relative
 terms, the Edgeworth cycle theory provides better predictions of key
 aspects of the data than the other theories. Coauthors are Stephen
 Rassenti, Stanley S. Reynolds, and Vernon L. Smith.   Copyright 1994 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Bayesian Inference for Hospital Quality in a Selection Model 
Abstract:
				 This paper develops new econometric
 methods to infer hospital quality in a model with discrete dependent
 variables and nonrandom selection. Mortality rates in patient discharge
 records are widely used to infer hospital quality. However, hospital
 admission is not random and some hospitals may attract patients with
 greater unobserved severity of illness than others. In this situation the
 assumption of random admission leads to spurious inference about hospital
 quality. This study controls for hospital selection using a model in which
 distance between the patient's residence and alternative hospitals are key
 exogenous variables. Bayesian inference in this model is feasible using a
 Markov chain Monte Carlo posterior simulator, and attaches posterior
 probabilities to quality comparisons between individual hospitals and
 groups of hospitals. The study uses data on 74,848 Medicare patients
 admitted to 114 hospitals in Los Angeles County from 1989 through 1992
 with a diagnosis of pneumonia. It finds the smallest and largest hospitals
 to be of the highest quality. There is strong evidence of dependence
 between the unobserved severity of illness and the assignment of patients
 to hospitals, whereby patients with a high unobserved severity of illness
 are disproportionately admitted to high quality hospitals. Consequently a
 conventional probit model leads to inferences about quality that are
 markedly different from those in this study's selection model. Copyright The Econometric Society 2003.

Journal: Econometrica

Issue: 6
Volume: 61
Year: 1993
Month:  November 
Abstract:
  A dynamic model with many sellers and buyers is constructed. Agents
 failing to trade may trade in the next period. An equilibrium is found
 where sellers hold identical auctions and buyers randomize over the
 sellers they visit. The distribution of buyer valuations is endogenous. An
 auction with efficient reserve is an optimal mechanism from each seller's
 point of view, in spite of the ability of any seller to alter the
 distribution of buyer types participating in the seller's mechanism by
 altering the mechanism.   Copyright 1993 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Band Spectral Regression with Trending Data 
Abstract:
 Band spectral regression with both deterministic and stochastic trends is
 considered. It is shown that trend removal by regression in the time
 domain prior to band spectral regression can lead to biased and
 inconsistent estimates in models with frequency dependent coefficients.
 Both semiparametric and nonparametric regression formulations are
 considered, the latter including general systems of two-sided distributed
 lags such as those arising in lead and lag regressions. The bias problem
 arises through omitted variables and is avoided by careful specification
 of the regression equation. Trend removal in the frequency domain is shown
 to be a convenient option in practice. An asymptotic theory is developed
 and the two cases of stationary data and cointegrated nonstationary data
 are compared. In the latter case, a levels and differences regression
 formulation is shown to be useful in estimating the frequency response
 function at nonzero as well as zero frequencies. Copyright The Econometric Society 2002.

Title: Do Irrelevant Commodities Matter? 
Abstract:
				 We study how to evaluate allocations
 independently of individual preferences over unavailable commodities. We
 prove impossibility results that suggest that such evaluations encounter
 serious difficulties. This is related to the well known problem of
 performing international comparisons of standard of living across
 countries with different consumption goods. We show how possibility
 results can be retrieved with restrictions on the domain of preferences,
 on the application of the independence axiom, or on the set of allocations
 to be ranked. Such restrictions appear more plausible when the objects of
 evaluation are allocations of composite commodities, characteristics, or
 human functionings rather than ordinary commodities. Copyright The Econometric Society 2007.

Title: If You're so Smart, why Aren't You Rich? Belief Selection in Complete and Incomplete Markets 
Abstract:
				 This paper provides an analysis of the
 asymptotic properties of Pareto optimal consumption allocations in a
 stochastic general equilibrium model with heterogeneous consumers. In
 particular, we investigate the market selection hypothesis that markets
 favor traders with more accurate beliefs. We show that in any
 Pareto-optimal allocation whether each consumer vanishes or survives is
 determined entirely by discount factors and beliefs. Whereas equilibrium
 allocations in economies with complete markets are Pareto optimal, our
 results characterize the limit behavior of these economies. We show that,
 all else equal, the market selects for consumers who use Bayesian learning
 with the truth in the support of their prior and selects among Bayesians
 according to the size of their parameter space. Finally, we show that in
 economies with incomplete markets, these conclusions may not hold. With
 incomplete markets, payoff functions can matter for long-run survival, and
 the market selection hypothesis fails. 			        Copyright The Econometric Society 2006.

Title:   Infinite Horizon Incomplete Markets. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 853-80
Issue: 4
Volume: 62
Year: 1994
Month:  July 
Abstract:
  This paper extends the general equilibrium model with incomplete markets
 to an open-ended future, thereby providing a natural setting for analyzing
 problems in macroeconomics. Two concepts of equilibrium are defined that
 prevent agents from entering into Ponzi schemes: the first is based on
 debt constraints and the second is based on a transversality condition
 that limits the rate of growth of debt. Under the assumption that agents
 are impatient (Mackey continuity of preferences) and have a degree of
 impatience that is bounded below, the two concepts of equilibrium are
 shown to coincide and lead to existence of equilibrium.   Copyright 1994 by The Econometric Society.

Title:   Semiparametric Estimation of Monotone and Concave Utility Functions for Polychotomous Choice Models. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 1315-27
Issue: 5
Volume: 59
Year: 1991
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  This paper introduces a semiparametric estimation method for
 Polychotomous Choice models. The method does not require a parametric
 structure for the systematic subutility of observable exogenous variables.
 The distribution of the random terms is assumed to be known up to a
 finite-dimensional parameter vector. In contrast, previous semiparametric
 methods of estimating discrete choice models have concentrated on relaxing
 parametric subutility parametrically specified. The systematic subutility
 is assumed to possess properties such as monotonicity and concavity that
 are typically assumed in microeconomic theory. The estimator for the
 systematic subutility and the parameter vector of the distribution is
 shown to be strongly consistent. A computational technique to calculate
 the estimators is developed.   Copyright 1991 by The Econometric Society.

Title: A Theory of Diversity 
Abstract:
 How can diversity be measured? What does it mean to value biodiversity?
 Can we assist Noah in constructing his preferences? To address these
 questions, we propose a multi-attribute approach under which the diversity
 of a set of species is the sum of the values of all attributes possessed
 by some species in the set. We develop the basic intuitions and
 requirements for a theory of diversity and show that the multi-attribute
 approach satisfies them in a flexible yet tractable manner.  A natural
 starting point is to think of the diversity of a set as an aggregate of
 the pairwise dissimilarities between its elements. The multi-attribute
 framework allows one to make this program formally precise. It is shown
 that the program can be realized if and only if the family of relevant
 attributes is well-ordered ("acyclic"). Moreover, there is a unique
 functional form aggregating dissimilarity into diversity, the length of a
 minimum spanning tree. Examples are taxonomic hierarchies and lines
 representing uni-dimensional qualities. In multi-dimensional settings,
 pairwise dissimilarity information among elements is insufficient to
 determine their diversity. By consequence, the qualitative and
 quantitative behavior of diversity differs fundamentally. Copyright The Econometric Society 2002.

Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 1433-50
Issue: 6
Volume: 55
Year: 1987
Month:  November 
Abstract:
  The authors investigate the effect of opening a forward or futures market
 on spot price or real exchange rate variab ility in a two-agent, two-good,
 two-state, general-equilibrium model. This is shown to depend upon such
 familiar parameters as substitutio n elasticities, marginal propensities
 to consume, and degress of risk aversion. The analysis highlights the
 importance of the income trans fer, which occurs as a result of capital
 gains and losses in the forw ard market. The authors find some presumption
 in favor of the view th at opening a forward market reduces spot price
 variability. The presu mption is strengthened the less risk averse are
 agents.   Copyright 1987 by The Econometric Society.

 inequalities and equalities. Applications of this framework include the
 analysis of game-theoretic models, revealed preference restrictions,
 regressions with missing and corrupted data, auction models, structural
 quantile regressions, and asset pricing models. Copyright The Econometric Society 2007.

Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 189-210
Issue: 1
Volume: 59
Year: 1991
Month:  January 
Abstract:
  A dynamic programming model of job exit behavior and retirement is
 constructed and estimated using the method of simulated moments. The model
 and estimation method allow for both unobserved individual effects and
 unobserved job-specific "match" effects. The model is estimated using two
 different assumptions about individual discount factors. First, a static
 model, with the discount factor equal to zero, is estimated. Then a
 dynamic model, with the discount factor equal to .95 is estimated. In both
 models, it is found that bad health, age, and lack of education increase
 the probability of retirement. The dynamic model performs better than the
 static model and has different implications for retirement behavior. The
 job-specific effects are an important source of unobserved heterogeneity.   Copyright 1991 by The Econometric Society.

Title:   Proper Posteriors from Improper Priors for an Unidentified Errors-in-Variables Model. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 1299-1316
Issue: 6
Volume: 57
Year: 1989
Month:  November 
Abstract:
  The problem considered is inference in a simple errors-in-variables model
 where consistent estimation is impossible without introducing additional
 exact prior information. The probabilistic prior information required for
 Bayesian analysis is found to be surprisingly light: despite the model's
 lack of identification, a proper posterior is guaranteed for any bounded
 prior density, including those representing improper priors. This result
 is illustrated with the improper uniform prior, which implies marginal
 posterior densities obtainable by integrating the likelihood function;
 surprisingly, the posterior mode for the regression slope is the usual
 least squares estimate.   Copyright 1989 by The Econometric Society.

  A global game is an incomplete information game where the actual payoff

 where each player makes a noisy observation of the selected game. For 2 x

 of dominated strategies in the global game forces the players to conform
 to J. C. Harsanyi and R. Selten's risk dominance criterion.   Copyright 1993 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Formal and Informal Risk Sharing in LDCs: Theory and Empirical Evidence 
Abstract:
				 We develop and estimate a model of dynamic
 interactions in which commitment is limited and contracts are incomplete
 to explain the patterns of income and consumption growth in village
 economies of less developed countries. Households can insure each other
 through both formal contracts and informal agreements, that is,
 self-enforcing agreements specifying voluntary transfers. This theoretical
 setting nests the case of complete markets and the case where only
 informal agreements are available. We derive a system of nonlinear
 equations for income and consumption growth. A key prediction of our model
 is that both variables are affected by lagged consumption as a consequence
 of the interplay of formal and informal contracting possibilities. In a
 semiparametric setting, we prove identification, derive testable
 restrictions, and estimate the model with the use of data from Pakistani
 villages. Empirical results are consistent with the economic arguments.
 Incentive constraints due to self-enforcement bind with positive
 probability and formal contracts are used to reduce this probability. Copyright Copyright  2008 by The Econometric Society.

Title:   Alternative Approximations to the Distributions of Instrumental Variable Estimators. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 657-81
Issue: 3
Volume: 62
Year: 1994
Month:  May 
Abstract:
  This paper considers the instrument variable and method-of-moments
 estimators, as generalizations of two-stage least squares and limited
 information maximum likelihood, of the coefficients of a single equation.
 Motivated by a simple principle, asymptotic distributions are derived
 based on a parameter sequence where both the number of instruments and the
 sample size increase. The approximations to the distributions provided by
 this sequence are more accurate than traditional ones. The instrument
 variable estimator appears to be inconsistent. The asymptotic covariance
 matrix of the method-of-moments estimator can be consistently estimated
 under the alternative parameter sequence. The resulting approximate
 confidence regions have exact levels very close to their nominal levels.   Copyright 1994 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Decision Theory Applied to a Linear Panel Data Model 
Abstract:
				 This paper applies some general concepts
 in decision theory to a linear panel data model. A simple version of the
 model is an autoregression with a separate intercept for each unit in the
 cross section, with errors that are independent and identically
 distributed with a normal distribution. There is a parameter of interest
 Gamma and a nuisance parameter &tau;, a N&times;K matrix, where N is the
 cross-section sample size. The focus is on dealing with the incidental
 parameters problem created by a potentially high-dimension nuisance
 parameter. We adopt a "fixed-effects" approach that seeks to protect
 against any sequence of incidental parameters. We transform tau to
 (delta, rho, omega), where delta is a J x K matrix of
 coefficients from the least-squares projection of tau on a N x J
 matrix x of strictly exogenous variables, rho is a K x K symmetric,
 positive semidefinite matrix obtained from the residual sums of squares
 and cross-products in the projection of tau on x, and omega is a (N -
 J) x K matrix whose columns are orthogonal and have unit length. The
 model is invariant under the actions of a group on the sample space and
 the parameter space, and we find a maximal invariant statistic. The
 distribution of the maximal invariant statistic does not depend upon
 omega. There is a unique invariant distribution for omega. We use this
 invariant distribution as a prior distribution to obtain an integrated
 likelihood function. It depends upon the observation only through the
 maximal invariant statistic. We use the maximal invariant statistic to
 construct a marginal likelihood function, so we can eliminate omega by
 integration with respect to the invariant prior distribution or by working
 with the marginal likelihood function. The two approaches coincide.	     Copyright  2009 The Econometric Society.

Title: Comment on: Threshold Autoregressions With a Unit Root 
Abstract:
				 In this paper we revisit the results in
 Caner and Hansen (2001), where the authors obtained novel limiting
 distributions of Wald type test statistics for testing for the presence of
 threshold nonlinearities in autoregressive models containing unit roots.
 Using the same framework, we obtain a new formulation of the limiting
 distribution of the Wald statistic for testing for threshold effects,
 correcting an expression that appeared in the main theorem presented by
 Caner and Hansen. Subsequently, we show that under a particular scenario
 that excludes stationary regressors such as lagged dependent variables and
 despite the presence of a unit root, this same limiting random variable
 takes a familiar form that is free of nuisance parameters and already
 tabulated in the literature, thus removing the need to use bootstrap based
 inferences. This is a novel and unusual occurrence in this literature on
 testing for the presence of nonlinear dynamics. Copyright  2008 The Econometric Society.

Title: Identification in Nonseparable Models 
Abstract:
				 Weak nonparametric restrictions are
 developed, sufficient to identify the values of derivatives of structural
 functions in which latent random variables are nonseparable. These
 derivatives can exhibit stochastic variation. In a microeconometric
 context this allows the impact of a policy intervention, as measured by
 the value of a structural derivative, to vary across people who are
 identical as measured by covariates. When the restrictions are satisfied
 quantiles of the distribution of a policy impact across people can be
 identified. The identification restrictions are local in the sense that
 they are specific to the values of the covariates and the specific
 quantiles of latent variables at which identification is sought. The
 conditions do not include the commonly required independence of latent
 variables and covariates. They include local versions of the classical
 rank and order conditions and local quantile insensitivity conditions.
 Values of structural derivatives are identified by functionals of quantile
 regression functions and can be estimated using the same functionals
 applied to estimated quantile regression functions. Copyright The Econometric Society 2003.

Title:   Error Correction and Long-Run Equilibrium in Continuous Time. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 967-80
Issue: 4
Volume: 59
Year: 1991
Month:  July 
Abstract:
  This paper deals with error correction models (ECM's) and cointegrated
 systems that are formulated in continuous time. Long-run equilibrium
 coefficients in the continuous system are always identified in the
 discrete time reduced form, so that there is no aliasing problem for these
 parameters. The long- run relationships are also preserved under quite
 general data filtering. Frequency domain procedures are outlined for
 estimation and inference. These methods are asymptotically optimal under
 Gaussian assumptions and they have the advantages of simplicity of
 computation and generality of specification, thereby avoiding some
 methodological problems of dynamic specification. In addition, they
 facilitate the treatment of data irregularities such as mixed stock and
 flow data and temporally aggregate partial equilibrium formulations.
 Models with restricted cointegrating matrices are also considered.   Copyright 1991 by The Econometric Society.

Abstract:
  A single, long-run player plays a simultaneous-move stage game against a
 sequence of opponents who only play once, but observe all previous play.
 If there is a positive prior probability that the long-run player will
 always play the pure strategy he would most like to commit himself to (his
 Stackleberg strategy), then his payoff in any Nash equilibrium exceeds a
 bound that converges to the Stackleberg payoff as his discount factor
 approaches one. When the stage game is not simultaneous move, this result
 must be modified to account for the possibility that distinct strategies
 of the long-run player are observationally equivalent.   Copyright 1989 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Spatial Price Competition: A Semiparametric Approach 
Abstract:
 We investigate the nature of price competition among firms that produce
 differentiated products and compete in markets that are limited in extent.
 We propose an instrumental variables series estimator for the matrix of
 cross price response coefficients, demonstrate that our estimator is
 consistent, and derive its asymptotic distribution. Our semiparametric
 approach allows us to discriminate among models of global competition, in
 which all products compete with all others, and local competition, in
 which products compete only with their neighbors. We apply our
 semiparametric estimator to data from U.S. wholesale gasoline markets and
 find that, in this market, competition is highly localized. Copyright The Econometric Society 2002.

Title:   Subgroup Consistent Poverty Indices. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 687-709
Issue: 3
Volume: 59
Year: 1991
Month:  May 
Abstract:
  It seems desirable that the overall level of poverty should fall whenever
 poverty decreases within some subgroup of the population and is unchanged
 outside that group. Yet this simple and attractive property, which we call
 "subgroup consistency," is violated by many of the poverty indices
 suggested in recent years. This paper characterizes the class of subgroup
 consistent poverty indices, and identifies the special features associated
 with this property.   Copyright 1991 by The Econometric Society.

Title:  Clubs and the Market
Journal: Econometrica
Abstract:
  This paper defines a general equilibrium model with exchange and club
  formation. Agents trade multiple private goods widely in the market, can
  belong to several clubs, and care about the characteristics of the other
  members of their clubs. The space of agents is a continuum, but clubs are
  finite. It is shown that (i) competitive equilibria exist, and (ii) the core
  coincides with the set of equilibrium states. The central subtlety is in
  modeling club memberships and expressing the notion that membership choices
  are consistent across the population.

Title: Naturally Occurring Preferences and Exogenous Laboratory Experiments: A Case Study of Risk Aversion 
Abstract:
				 Does individual behavior in a laboratory
 setting provide a reliable indicator of behavior in a naturally occurring
 setting? We consider this general methodological question in the context
 of eliciting risk attitudes. The controls that are typically employed in
 laboratory settings, such as the use of abstract lotteries, could lead
 subjects to employ behavioral rules that differ from the ones they employ
 in the field. Because it is field behavior that we are interested in
 understanding, those controls might be a confound in themselves if they
 result in differences in behavior. We find that the use of artificial
 monetary prizes provides a reliable measure of risk attitudes when the
 natural counterpart outcome has minimal uncertainty, but that it can
 provide an unreliable measure when the natural counterpart outcome has
 background risk. Behavior tended to be moderately risk averse when
 artificial monetary prizes were used or when there was minimal uncertainty
 in the natural nonmonetary outcome, but subjects drawn from the same
 population were much more risk averse when their attitudes were elicited
 using the natural nonmonetary outcome that had some background risk. These
 results are consistent with conventional expected utility theory for the
 effects of background risk on attitudes to risk. Copyright The Econometric Society 2007.

Title: Decision Theory Applied to an Instrumental Variables Model 
Abstract:
				 This paper applies some general concepts
 in decision theory to a simple instrumental variables model. There are two
 endogenous variables linked by a single structural equation; k of the
 exogenous variables are excluded from this structural equation and provide
 the instrumental variables (IV). The reduced-form distribution of the
 endogenous variables conditional on the exogenous variables corresponds to
 independent draws from a bivariate normal distribution with linear
 regression functions and a known covariance matrix. A canonical form of
 the model has parameter vector (rho, phi, omega), where phi is the
 parameter of interest and is normalized to be a point on the unit circle.
 The reduced-form coefficients on the instrumental variables are split into
 a scalar parameter rho and a parameter vector omega, which is
 normalized to be a point on the (k - 1)-dimensional unit sphere;
 rho measures the strength of the association between the endogenous
 variables and the instrumental variables, and omega is a measure of
 direction. A prior distribution is introduced for the IV model. The
 parameters phi, rho, and omega are treated as independent random
 variables. The distribution for phi is uniform on the unit circle; the
 distribution for omega is uniform on the unit sphere with dimension k-1.
 These choices arise from the solution of a minimax problem. The prior for
 rho is left general. It turns out that given any positive value for
 rho, the Bayes estimator of phi does not depend on rho; it equals the
 maximum-likelihood estimator. This Bayes estimator has constant risk;
 because it minimizes average risk with respect to a proper prior, it is
 minimax.				  Copyright The Econometric Society 2007.

Title: Informational Size and Incentive Compatibility 
Abstract:
 We examine a general equilibrium model with asymmetrically informed
 agents. The presence of asymmetric information generally presents a
 conflict between incentive compatibility and Pareto efficiency. We present
 a notion of informational size and show that the conflict between
 incentive compatibility and efficiency can be made arbitrarily small if
 agents are of sufficiently small informational size. Copyright The Econometric Society 2002.

Title:  Strategic Experimentation
Abstract: 
  This paper extends the classic two-armed bandit problem to a many-agent
  setting in which N players each face the same experimentation problem. The
  main change from the single-agent problem is that an agent can now learn from
  the current experimentation of other agents. Information is therefore a
  public good, and a free-rider problem in experimentation naturally arises.
  More interestingly, the prospect of future experimentation by others
  encourages agents to increase current experimentation, in order to bring
  forward the time at which the extra information generated by such
  experimentation becomes available. The paper provides an analysis of the set
  of stationary Markov equilibria in terms of the free-rider effect and the
  encouragement effect.

Month:  May 
Abstract:
  In this model, shareholders can use auditors' reports to contract with a
 privately-informed manager. Imperfect audit technology allows the auditor
 and the manager to collude. Auditors are useful when they have good
 information and the manager's liability is high. Expected maximum
 deterrence is not desirable and production is suboptimal, even with
 unbounded punishments. Raising the manager's punishment raises the bribe
 he may offer the auditor, which raises the cost of preventing collusion.
 The authors also distinguish internal auditors (costless but collusive)
 from external ones (costly but not collusive) and show that the optimal
 contract may specify random external audits.   Copyright 1993 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Information Acquisition and Efficient Mechanism Design 
Abstract:
 We consider a general mechanism design setting where each agent can
 acquire (covert) information before participating in the mechanism. The
 central question is whether a mechanism exists that provides the efficient
 incentives for information acquisition ex-ante and implements the
 efficient allocation conditional on the private information ex-post.  It
 is shown that in every private value environment the Vickrey-Clark-Groves
 mechanism guarantees both ex-ante as well as ex-post efficiency. In
 contrast, with common values, ex-ante and ex-post efficiency cannot be
 reconciled in general. Sufficient conditions in terms of sub- and
 supermodularity are provided when (all) ex-post efficient mechanisms lead
 to private under- or over-acquisition of information. Copyright The Econometric Society 2002.

Title: Bargaining, Reputation, and Equilibrium Selection in Repeated Games with Contracts 
Abstract:
				 Consider a two-person intertemporal
 bargaining problem in which players choose actions and offers each period,
 and collect payoffs (as a function of that period's actions) while
 bargaining proceeds. This can alternatively be viewed as an infinitely
 repeated game wherein players can offer one another enforceable contracts
 that govern play for the rest of the game. Theory is silent with regard to
 how the surplus is likely to be split, because a folk theorem applies.
 Perturbing such a game with a rich set of behavioral types for each player
 yields a specific asymptotic prediction for how the surplus will be
 divided, as the perturbation probabilities approach zero. Behavioral types
 may follow nonstationary strategies and respond to the opponent's play. In
 equilibrium, rational players initially choose a behavioral type to
 imitate and a war of attrition ensues. How much should a player try to get
 and how should she behave while waiting for the resolution of bargaining?
 In both respects she should build her strategy around the advice given by
 the "Nash bargaining with threats" (NBWT) theory developed for two-stage
 games. In any perfect Bayesian equilibrium, she can guarantee herself
 virtually her NBWT payoff by imitating a behavioral type with the
 following simple strategy: in every period, ask for (and accept nothing
 less than) that player's NBWT share and, while waiting for the other side
 to concede, take the action Nash recommends as a threat in his two-stage
 game. The results suggest that there are forces at work in some dynamic
 games that favor certain payoffs over all others. This is in stark
 contrast to the classic folk theorems, to the further folk theorems
 established for repeated games with two-sided reputational perturbations,
 and to the permissive results obtained in the literature on bargaining
 with payoffs as you go. Copyright The Econometric Society 2007.

Issue: 2
Volume: 59
Year: 1991

Abstract:
  This paper establishes the asymptotic normality of series estimators for
 nonparametric regression models. Gallant's Fourier flexible form
 estimators, trigonometric series estimators, and polynomial series
 estimators are prime examples of the estimators covered by the results.
 The results apply to a wide variety of estimates in the regression model
 under consideration, including derivatives and integrals of the regression
 function. The errors in the model may be homoskedastic or heteroskedastic.
  The paper also considers series estimators for additive interactive
 regression, semiparametric regression, and semiparametric index regression
 models, and shows them to be consistent and asymptotically normal.   Copyright 1991 by The Econometric Society.

Title:   Rationalizability and Correlated Equilibria. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 1391-1402
Issue: 6
Volume: 55
Year: 1987
Month:  November 
Abstract:
  The authors discuss the unity between the two standard approaches to
 noncooperative solution concepts for games. The decision-theoretic
 approach starts from the assumption that the rationality of the players is
 common knowledge. This leads to the notion of correlated
 rationalizability. It is shown that correlated rationalizability is e
 quivalent to a posteriori equilibrium-a refinement of subjective corr
 elated equilibrium. Hence a decision-theoretic justification for the
 equilibrium approach to game theory is provided. An analogous equival ence
 result is proved between independent rationalizability, which is the
 appropriate concept if each player believes that the others act
 independently, and conditionally independent a posteriori equilibrium.   Copyright 1987 by The Econometric Society.

Abstract:
  The authors study duopolistic competition in a homogeneous good through
 time under the assumption that its current desirability is an
 exponentially-weighted function of accumulated past consumption. This
 implies that the current price of the good does not decline by as much to
 accommodate any given level of current consumption. Our an alysis is
 conducted in terms of a differential game. It is found that the
 equilibrium price corresponding to the open-loop Nash equilibriu m
 strategies approaches the static Cournot equilibrium price while th e
 equilibrium price corresponding to the closed-loop Nash equilibrium
 strategies, which are subgame perfect, approaches a price below it.   Copyright 1987 by The Econometric Society.

Title:   Efficient and Competitive Rationing. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 1-40
Issue: 1
Volume: 57
Year: 1989
Month:  January 
Abstract:
  Priority service rations available supplies according to contracts that
 specify each customer's priority or rank order. If customers' preferences
 are stable, this alternative market form can achieve most of the
 efficiency gains attributed to spot markets, which in some industries are
 expensive to organize. Rationing by priorities is prominent in
 capital-intensive industries with nonstorable outputs, as well as in
 service-sector and make-to-order industries where service is queued or
 congested. This paper describes the role of priority service and suggests
 a basic model. The main topic is efficient implementation by public
 enterprises and by competitive firms.	 Copyright 1989 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Behavior in a Dynamic Decision Problem: An Analysis of Experimental Evidence Using a Bayesian Type Classification Algorithm 
Abstract:
				 Different people may use different
 strategies, or decision rules, when solving complex decision problems. We
 provide a new Bayesian procedure for drawing inferences about the nature
 and number of decision rules present in a population, and use it to
 analyze the behaviors of laboratory subjects confronted with a difficult
 dynamic stochastic decision problem. Subjects practiced before playing for
 money. Based on money round decisions, our procedure classifies subjects
 into three types, which we label "Near Rational,""Fatalist," and
 "Confused." There is clear evidence of continuity in subjects' behaviors
 between the practice and money rounds: types who performed best in
 practice also tended to perform best when playing for money. However, the
 agreement between practice and money play is far from perfect. The
 divergences appear to be well explained by a combination of type switching
 (due to learning and/or increased effort in money play) and errors in our
 probabilistic type assignments. Copyright The Econometric Society 2004.

Title: Testing for the Cointegrating Rank of a VAR Process with Level Shift at Unknown Time 
Abstract:
				 A systems cointegration rank test is
 proposed that is applicable for vector autoregressive (VAR) processes with
 a structural shift at unknown time. The structural shift is modeled as a
 simple shift in the level of the process. It is proposed to estimate the
 break date first on the basis of a full unrestricted VAR model. Two
 alternative estimators are considered and their asymptotic properties are
 derived. In the next step the deterministic part of the process including
 the shift size is estimated and the series are adjusted by subtracting the
 estimated deterministic part. A Johansen type test for the cointegrating
 rank is applied to the adjusted series. The test statistic is shown to
 have a well-known asymptotic null distribution that does not depend on the
 break date. The performance of the procedure in small samples is
 investigated by simulations. Copyright The Econometric Society 2004.

Title: A Genuine Rank-Dependent Generalization of the Von Neumann-Morgenstern Expected Utility Theorem 
Abstract:
 This paper uses "revealed probability trade-offs" to provide a natural
 foundation for probability weighting in the famous von Neumann and
 Morgenstern axiomatic set-up for expected utility. In particular, it shows
 that a rank-dependent preference functional is obtained in this set-up
 when the independence axiom is weakened to stochastic dominance and a
 probability trade-off consistency condition. In contrast with the existing
 axiomatizations of rank-dependent utility, the resulting axioms allow for
 complete flexibility regarding the outcome space. Consequently, a
 parameter-free test/elicitation of rank-dependent utility becomes
 possible. The probability-oriented approach of this paper also provides
 theoretical foundations for probabilistic attitudes towards risk. It is
 shown that the preference conditions that characterize the shape of the
 probability weighting function can be derived from simple probability
 trade-off conditions.	 Copyright The Econometric Society 2002.

Title: Testing Models of Low-Frequency Variability 
Abstract:
				 We develop a framework to assess how
 successfully standard time series models explain low-frequency variability
 of a data series. The low-frequency information is extracted by computing
 a finite number of weighted averages of the original data, where the
 weights are low-frequency trigonometric series. The properties of these
 weighted averages are then compared to the asymptotic implications of a
 number of common time series models. We apply the framework to twenty U.S.
 macroeconomic and financial time series using frequencies lower than the
 business cycle. Copyright  2008 The Econometric Society.

Issue: 6
Volume: 58
Year: 1990

Abstract:
  This paper considers the formulation, estimation, and evaluation of
 semiparametric multistates duration models with time-varying regressors
 and unobservables correlated over spells. The authors' models are applied
 to test a dynamic version of the neoclassical theory of fertility. Using
 Swedish data, they find that rising female wages over the lifecycle delay
 times to all conceptions, but barely affect childlessness. The authors
 estimate a model that predicts fertility attained at different ages as
 well as the aggregate time series of birth rates. Estimated cohort drift
 in wage and income parameters is consistent with the expansion of pronatal
 social programs over the sample period.   Copyright 1990 by The Econometric Society.

Title:   Generalized Ginis and Cooperative Bargaining Solutions. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 1161-78
Issue: 5
Volume: 62
Year: 1994
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  This paper introduces and characterizes a new class of solutions to
 cooperative bargaining problems that can be rationalized by generalized
 Gini orderings defined on the agents' utility gains. Generalized Ginis are
 orderings that can be represented by quasi-concave, nondecreasing
 functions that are linear in rank-ordered subspaces of Euclidean space. In
 the case of three or more agents, the authors' characterization of
 (multivalued) generalized Gini bargaining solutions uses a linear
 invariance requirement in addition to some standard conditions. In the
 two-person case, the generalized Gini bargaining solutions can be
 characterized with a weakening of linear invariance.   Copyright 1994 by The Econometric Society.

Title:   Common Persistence in Conditional Variances. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 167-86
Issue: 1
Volume: 61
Year: 1993
Month:  January 
Abstract:
  A common finding in many of the recent empirical studies with the ARCH
 class of models applied to high frequency financial data concerns the
 apparent persistence of shocks for forecast of the future conditional
 variances. It is likely that several different variables share this same
 implied long-run component, however. In that situation, the variables are
 defined to be copersistent in variance. Conditions for copersistence to
 occur in the linear multivariate GARCH model are presented. These
 conditions parallel the conditions for linear cointegration in the mean. A
 simple empirical example with foreign exchange rate data illustrates the
 ideas.   Copyright 1993 by The Econometric Society.

Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 1329-63
Issue: 5
Volume: 59
Year: 1991
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  The author considers frequency domain time series analysis, where
 smoothing in nonparametric spectrum estimation is data-dependent. Uniform
 convergence of spectrum estimates is established and applied to a
 semiparametric model, parameterized over possibly only a subset of the
 frequencies, in which disturbances have nonparametric autocorrelation.
 Optimal instruments depend on the disturbance spectrum and frequency
 response function, which is nonparametric in incomplete systems. The
 author justifies feasible, optimal parameter estimates. The degree of
 smoothing is allowed to depend on the data in a general way. The author
 proves consistency of a cross-validation method of automatic smoothing and
 applies it to a semiparametric model.	 Copyright 1991 by The Econometric Society.

 stationary rational expectations equilibria. The authors do not observe
 nonstationary rational expectations paths. Observed paths tend to converge
 close to, or somewhat below, the low inflation stationary state. The
 adaptive learning hypothesis is consistent with the data in selecting the
 low inflation stationary state rational expectations equilibrium as a
 long-run stationary equilibrium. Nevertheless, simple adaptive learning
 models do not capture the market uncertainty or the biases observed in the
 data.	 Copyright 1993 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Nonparametric Estimation of Nonadditive Random Functions 
Abstract:
				 We present estimators for nonparametric
 functions that are nonadditive in unobservable random terms. The
 distributions of the unobservable random terms are assumed to be unknown.
 We show that when a nonadditive, nonparametric function is strictly
 monotone in an unobservable random term, and it satisfies some other
 properties that may be implied by economic theory, such as homogeneity of
 degree one or separability, the function and the distribution of the
 unobservable random term are identified. We also present convenient
 normalizations, to use when the properties of the function, other than
 strict monotonicity in the unobservable random term, are unknown. The
 estimators for the nonparametric function and for the distribution of the
 unobservable random term are shown to be consistent and asymptotically
 normal. We extend the results to functions that depend on a multivariate
 random term. The results of a limited simulation study are presented. Copyright The Econometric Society 2003.

Title: Disclosures and Asset Returns 
Abstract:
 Public information in financial markets often arrives through the
 disclosures of interested parties who have a material interest in the
 reactions of the market to the new information. When the strategic
 interaction between the sender and the receiver is formalized as a
 disclosure game with verifiable reports, equilibrium prices can be given a
 simple characterization in terms of the concatenation of binomial pricing
 trees. There are a number of empirical implications. The theory predicts
 that the return variance following a poor disclosed outcome is higher than
 it would have been if the disclosed outcome were good. Also, when
 investors are risk averse, this leads to negative serial correlation of
 asset returns. Other points of contact with the empirical literature are
 discussed. Copyright The Econometric Society 2003.

Title:  Bayesian Representation of Stochastic Processes under Learning: de Finetti Revisited
Abstract:
  A probability distribution governing the evolution of a stochastic process
  has infinitely many Bayesian representations of the form mu = integral
  operator [subscript theta] mu[subscript theta] delta lambda (theta).  Among
  these, a natural representation is one whose components (mu[subscript
  theta]'s) are 'learnable' (one can approximate mu[subscript theta] by
  conditioning mu on observation of the process) and 'sufficient for
  prediction' (mu[subscript theta]'s predictions are not aided by conditioning
  on observation of the process). The authors show the existence and uniqueness
  of such a representation under a suitable asymptotic mixing condition on the
  process. This representation can be obtained by conditioning on the
  tail-field of the process, and any learnable representation that is
  sufficient for prediction is asymptotically like the tail-field
  representation. This result is related to the celebrated de Finetti theorem,
  but with exchangeability weakened to an asymptotic mixing condition, and with
  his conclusion of a decomposition into i.i.d. component distributions
  weakened to components that are learnable and sufficient for prediction.

Title: Selecting Cheap-Talk Equilibria 
Abstract:
				 There are typically multiple equilibrium
 outcomes in the Crawford-Sobel (CS) model of strategic information
 transmission. This paper identifies a simple condition on equilibrium
 payoffs, called NITS (no incentive to separate), that selects among CS
 equilibria. Under a commonly used regularity condition, only the
 equilibrium with the maximal number of induced actions satisfies NITS. We
 discuss various justifications for NITS, including perturbed cheap-talk
 games with nonstrategic players or costly lying. We also apply NITS to
 other models of cheap talk, illustrating its potential beyond the CS
 framework. Copyright The Econometric Society 2008.

Title: A Bias--Reduced Log--Periodogram Regression Estimator for the Long--Memory Parameter 
Abstract:
 In this paper, we propose a simple bias--reduced log--periodogram
 regression estimator, "&circ;d-sub-r", of the long--memory parameter, "d",
 that eliminates the first-- and higher--order biases of the Geweke and
 Porter--Hudak (1983) (GPH) estimator. The bias--reduced estimator is the
 same as the GPH estimator except that one includes frequencies to the
 power 2"k" for "k"&equals;1,&hellip;,"r", for some positive integer "r",
 as additional regressors in the pseudo--regression model that yields the
 GPH estimator. The reduction in bias is obtained using assumptions on the
 spectrum only in a neighborhood of the zero frequency.Following the work
 of Robinson (1995b) and Hurvich, Deo, and Brodsky (1998), we establish the
 asymptotic bias, variance, and mean--squared error (MSE) of
 "&circ;d-sub-r", determine the asymptotic MSE optimal choice of the number
 of frequencies, "m", to include in the regression, and establish the
 asymptotic normality of "&circ;d-sub-r". These results show that the bias
 of "&circ;d-sub-r" goes to zero at a faster rate than that of the GPH
 estimator when the normalized spectrum at zero is sufficiently smooth, but
 that its variance only is increased by a multiplicative constant.We show
 that the bias--reduced estimator "&circ;d-sub-r" attains the optimal rate
 of convergence for a class of spectral densities that includes those that
 are smooth of order "s"&ge;1 at zero when "r"&ge;("s" - 2)&sol;2 and "m"
 is chosen appropriately. For "s"&gt;2, the GPH estimator does not attain
 this rate. The proof uses results of Giraitis, Robinson, and Samarov
 (1997).We specify a data--dependent plug--in method for selecting the
 number of frequencies "m" to minimize asymptotic MSE for a given value of
 "r".Some Monte Carlo simulation results for stationary Gaussian ARFIMA (1,
 "d", 1) and (2, "d", 0) models show that the bias--reduced estimators
 perform well relative to the standard log--periodogram regression
 estimator. Copyright The Econometric Society 2003.

Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 1273-92
Issue: 6
Volume: 60
Year: 1992
Month:  November 
Abstract:
  The authors provide conditions on an exchange economy with asymmetric
 information that guarantee that when the economy is replicated
 sufficiently often, there will be an allocation that is incentive
 compatible, individually rational, and nearly efficient. The main theorem
 covers both the case in which aggregate uncertainty remains when the
 economy is replicated and the case in which replication eliminates
 aggregate uncertainty. In addition, the authors demonstrate how their
 theorem does or does not apply to standard asymmetric information problems
 such as the buyer's bid double auction problem, Akerlof's lemons problem,
 and insurance with asymmetric information.   Copyright 1992 by The Econometric Society.

Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 657-86
Issue: 3
Volume: 61
Year: 1993
Month:  May 
Abstract:
  This paper studies the role and implications of price advertising when
 shopping trips are costly to consumers. The authors present a model where
 consumers search sequentially and where stores advertise the price. Their
 model has a unique equilibrium exhibiting price dispersion. The model
 generates predictions about the shape of the price distribution and firms'
 advertising behavior. Also when the initial advertising costs are
 precisely zero, entry drives the equilibrium to the perfectly competitive
 outcome; while otherwise entry drives prices higher. Finally, when
 advertising costs shrink, prices become competitive; however, when search
 costs shrink, prices remain bounded above marginal production costs.   Copyright 1993 by The Econometric Society.

Title:   Testing and Characterizing Properties of Nonadditive Measures through Violations of the Sure-Thing Principle. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 1039-59
Issue: 4
Volume: 69
Year: 2001
Month:  July 
Abstract:
  In expected utility theory, risk attitudes are modeled entirely in terms
 of utility. In the rank-dependent theories, a new dimension is added:
 chance attitude, modeled in terms of nonadditive measures or nonlinear
 probability transformations that are independent of utility. Most
 empirical studies of chance attitude assume probabilities given and adopt
 parametric fitting for estimating the probability transformation. Only a
 few qualitative conditions have been proposed or tested as yet, usually
 quasi-concavity or quasi-convexity in the case of given probabilities.
 This paper presents a general method of studying qualitative properties of
 chance attitude such as optimism, pessimism, and the "inverse-S shape"
 pattern, both for risk and for uncertainty. These qualitative properties
 can be characterized by permitting appropriate, relatively simple,
 violations of the sure-thing principle. In particular, this paper solves a
 hitherto open problem: the preference axiomatization of convex
 ("pessimistic" or "uncertainty averse") nonadditive measures under
 uncertainty. The axioms of this paper preserve the central feature of
 rank-dependent theories, i.e. the separation of chance attitude and
 utility.

Volume: 63
Year: 1995
Month:  May 
Abstract:
  The authors consider a model where two agents, privately informed about
 their own characteristics, play a game on behalf of two uninformed
 principals. They analyze the existence of recommitment effects through
 public announcement of contracts in a model where agency contracts,
 designed ex-ante, can always be secretly renegotiated. The authors show
 that the existence of precommitment effects depends both on the strategic
 complementarity of the agents' actions and on the direct effect of the
 opponents' actions on each principal's welfare. The results are introduced
 through an example of Cournot and Bertrand competition between firms,
 viewed as vertical structures.   Copyright 1995 by The Econometric Society.

Abstract:
  This paper analyzes a class of alternating-offer bargaining games with
 one-sided incomplete information for the case of "no gap." If sequential
 equilibria are required to satisfy the additional restrictions of
 stationarity, monotonicity, pure strategies, and no free screening, the
 authors establish the silence theorem: when the time interval between
 successive periods is made sufficiently short, the informed party never
 makes any serious offers in the play of alternating-offer bargaining

Title: Efficient Semiparametric Estimation of Censored and Truncated Regressions via a Smoothed Self-Consistency Equation 
Abstract:
				 An asymptotically efficient
 likelihood-based semiparametric estimator is derived for the censored
 regression (tobit) model, based on a new approach for estimating the
 density function of the residuals in a partially observed regression.
 Smoothing the self-consistency equation for the nonparametric maximum
 likelihood estimator of the distribution of the residuals yields an
 integral equation, which in some cases can be solved explicitly. The
 resulting estimated density is smooth enough to be used in a practical
 implementation of the profile likelihood estimator, but is sufficiently
 close to the nonparametric maximum likelihood estimator to allow
 estimation of the semiparametric efficient score. The parameter estimates
 obtained by solving the estimated score equations are then asymptotically
 efficient. A summary of analogous results for truncated regression is also
 given. Copyright The Econometric Society 2004.

Month:  November 
Abstract:
  A general equilibrium model of markets for commodities and assets is
 considered. The author develops the notion of a price system that admits
 no arbitrage opportunity and demonstrates the fundamenta l role of this
 concept for the theory of the existence of a competiti ve equilibrium. A
 price system admits no arbitrage opportunity for a consumer if every
 bundle of desired commodities has a positive market value. The author
 proves that the existence of a price system that a dmits no arbitrage
 opportunity for all consumers is sufficient for th e existence of an
 equilibrium.   Copyright 1987 by The Econometric Society.

Title:  Reputation and Experimentation in Repeated Games with Two Long-Run Players
Abstract: The authors consider a repeated game between two long-run players, one
	of whom is relatively patient. Each player has a small amount of uncertainty
	about the other's strategy. Given a weak assumption about the support of this
	uncertainty, the more patient player obtains (in any Nash equilibrium)
	approximately the highest payoff consistent with the individual rationality
	of the other player, if the latter is patient enough. If the less patient
	player is relatively impatient, any Nash equilibrium gives the more patient
	player at least the Stackelberg payoff: this generalizes K. M. Schmidt's
	(1993) result, which applies only to games of conflicting interests.

Month:  May 
Abstract:
  An axiomatic model of preferences over lotteries is developed. It is
 shown that this model is consistent with the Allais paradox, includes
 expected utility theory as a special case, and is only one parameter ("
 beta") richer than the expected utility model. Allais paradox type
 behavior is identified with positive values of "beta." Preferences with
 positive "beta" are said to be disappointment averse. It is shown that
 risk aversion implies disappointment aversion and that the Arrow-Pratt
 measures of risk aversion can be generalized in a straight-forward manner
 to the current framework.   Copyright 1991 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Changes in the Distribution of Male and Female Wages Accounting for Employment Composition Using Bounds 
Abstract:
				 This paper examines changes in the
 distribution of wages using bounds to allow for the impact of nonrandom
 selection into work. We show that worst case bounds can be informative.
 However, because employment rates in the United Kingdom are often low,
 they are not informative about changes in educational or gender wage
 differentials. Thus we explore ways to tighten these bounds using
 restrictions motivated from economic theory. With these assumptions, we
 find convincing evidence of an increase in inequality within education
 groups, changes in educational differentials, and increases in the
 relative wages of women. Copyright The Econometric Society 2007.

Title: Interjurisdictional Sorting and Majority Rule: An Empirical Analysis 
Abstract:
 The goal of this paper is to provide a comprehensive empirical analysis of
 majority rule and Tiebout sorting within a system of local jurisdictions.
 The idea behind the estimation procedure is to investigate whether
 observed levels of public expenditures satisfy necessary conditions
 implied by majority rule in a general equilibrium model of residential
 choice. The estimator controls for observed and unobserved heterogeneity
 among households, observed and unobserved characteristics of communities,
 and the potential endogeneity of prices and expenditures, as well as the
 self-selection of households into communities of their choice. We estimate
 the structural parameters of the model using data from the Boston
 Metropolitan Area. The empirical findings reject myopic voting models.
 More sophisticated voting models based on utility-taking provide a
 potential explanation of the main empirical regularities. Copyright The Econometric Society.

Title:   Estimation of a Panel Data Sample Selection Model
Abstract: The author considers the problem of estimation in a panel data sample
	selection model, where both the selection and the regression equation of
	interest contain unobservable individual-specific effects. He proposes a
	two-step estimation procedure, which 'differences out' the sample selection
	effect and the unobservable individual effect from the equation of interest.
	In the first step, the unknown coefficients of the 'selection' equation are
	consistently estimated. The estimates are then used to estimate the
	regression equation of interest. The estimator proposed in this paper is
	shown to be consistent and asymptotically normal.  The proposed estimator is
	shown to be consistent and asymptotically normal. Its finite sample
	properties are investigated in a small Monte Carlo simulation.

Abstract:
  A method is presented for estimating nonlinear simultaneous equations and
 transformation models in the presence of disturbance distribution of
 unknown form. It asymptotically achieves the lower variance bound for
 instrumental variables estimates. The author avoids smoothed nonparametric
 estimation, his instruments averaging over the unsmoothed empirical
 distribution of preliminary residuals. He allows for stationary serial
 dependence. In various settings, estimates are proposed and large-sample
 inference rules justified, these being unaffected if the optimal
 instruments use only an arbitrarily small vanishing fraction of the
 residuals. The author investigates theoretically the effect of such
 computational savings on the goodness of the normal approximation.   Copyright 1991 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Identification and Inference in Nonlinear Difference-in-Differences Models 
Abstract:
				 This paper develops a generalization of
 the widely used difference-in-differences method for evaluating the
 effects of policy changes. We propose a model that allows the control and
 treatment groups to have different average benefits from the treatment.
 The assumptions of the proposed model are invariant to the scaling of the
 outcome. We provide conditions under which the model is nonparametrically
 identified and propose an estimator that can be applied using either
 repeated cross section or panel data. Our approach provides an estimate of
 the entire counterfactual distribution of outcomes that would have been
 experienced by the treatment group in the absence of the treatment and
 likewise for the untreated group in the presence of the treatment. Thus,
 it enables the evaluation of policy interventions according to criteria
 such as a mean-variance trade-off. We also propose methods for inference,
 showing that our estimator for the average treatment effect is root-N
 consistent and asymptotically normal. We consider extensions to allow for
 covariates, discrete dependent variables, and multiple groups and time
 periods.			       Copyright The Econometric Society 2006.

Title: Testing Parameters in GMM Without Assuming that They Are Identified 
Abstract:
				 We propose a generalized method of moments
 (GMM) Lagrange multiplier statistic, i.e., the K statistic, that uses a
 Jacobian estimator based on the continuous updating estimator that is
 asymptotically uncorrelated with the sample average of the moments. Its
 asymptotic &chi;-super-2 distribution therefore holds under a wider set of
 circumstances, like weak instruments, than the standard full rank case for
 the expected Jacobian under which the asymptotic &chi;-super-2
 distributions of the traditional statistics are valid. The behavior of the
 K statistic can be spurious around inflection points and maxima of the
 objective function. This inadequacy is overcome by combining the K
 statistic with a statistic that tests the validity of the moment equations
 and by an extension of Moreira's (2003) conditional likelihood ratio
 statistic toward GMM. We conduct a power comparison to test for the risk
 aversion parameter in a stochastic discount factor model and construct its
 confidence set for observed consumption growth and asset return series.     Copyright The Econometric Society 2005.

Title: Stationary Equilibria in Asset-Pricing Models with Incomplete Markets and Collateral 
Abstract:
				 We consider an infinite-horizon exchange
 economy with incomplete markets and collateral constraints. As in the
 two-period model of Geanakoplos and Zame (2002), households can default on
 their liabilities at any time, and financial securities are only traded if
 the promises associated with these securities are backed by collateral. We
 examine an economy with a single perishable consumption good, where the
 only collateral available consists of productive assets. In this model,
 competitive equilibria always exist and we show that, under the assumption
 that all exogenous variables follow a Markov chain, there also exist
 stationary equilibria. These equilibria can be characterized by a mapping
 from the exogenous shock and the current distribution of financial wealth
 to prices and portfolio choices. We develop an algorithm to approximate
 this mapping numerically and discuss ways to implement the algorithm in
 practice. A computational example demonstrates the performance of the
 algorithm and shows some quantitative features of equilibria in a model
 with collateral and default. Copyright The Econometric Society 2003.

Title: A General Formula for Valuing Defaultable Securities 
Abstract:
				 Previous research has shown that under a
 suitable no-jump condition, the price of a defaultable security is equal
 to its risk-neutral expected discounted cash flows if a modified discount
 rate is introduced to account for the possibility of default. Below, we
 generalize this result by demonstrating that one can always value
 defaultable claims using expected risk-adjusted discounting provided that
 the expectation is taken under a slightly modified probability measure.
 This new probability measure puts zero probability on paths where default
 occurs prior to the maturity, and is thus only absolutely continuous with
 respect to the risk-neutral probability measure. After establishing the
 general result and discussing its relation with the existing literature,
 we investigate several examples for which the no-jump condition fails.
 Each example illustrates the power of our general formula by providing
 simple analytic solutions for the prices of defaultable securities. Copyright The Econometric Society 2004.

Title: Bargaining without a Common Prior-An Immediate Agreement Theorem 
Abstract:
	 In sequential bargaining models without outside options, each
 player's bargaining power is ultimately determined by which player will
 make an offer and when. This paper analyzes a sequential bargaining model
 in which players may hold different beliefs about which player will make
 an offer and when. Excessive optimism about making offers in the future
 can cause delays in agreement. The main result states that, despite this,
 if players will remain sufficiently optimistic for a sufficiently long
 future, then in equilibrium they will agree immediately. This result is
 also extended to other canonical models of optimism. Copyright Econometric Society, 2002.

Month:  September 
Abstract:
  This paper studies pure exchange economies with infinite dimensional
 commodity spacces in the setting of Riesz dual systems. An Edgeworth
 equilibrium is an allocation that belongs to the core of every replication
 of the ec onomy. Under some mild conditions, it is shown that (1)
 Edgeworth equ ilibria exist, (2) an allocation is an Edgeworth equilibrium
 if and o nly if it is an approximate quasiequilibrium, and (3) if
 preferences are uniformly proper, then every Edgeworth equilibrium is a
 quasiequi librium. The obtained results specialize to most exchange
 economies t hat have appeared in the literature of general equilib rium
 theory.   Copyright 1987 by The Econometric Society.

Title:  Autoregressive Conditional Duration: A New Model for Irregularly Spaced Transaction Data
Abstract:  This paper proposes a new statistical model for the analysis of data
	which arrives at irregular intervals. The model treats the time between
	events as a stochastic process and proposes a new class of point processes
	with dependent arrival rates. The conditional intensity is developed and
	compared with other self-exciting processes.  The model is applied to the
	arrival times of financial transactions and therefore is a model of
	transaction volume, and also to the arrival of other events such as price
	changes. Models for the volatility of prices are estimated, and examined from
	a market microstructure point of view.

Title: Do Political Institutions Shape Economic Policy? 
Abstract:
 Do political institutions shape economic policy? I argue that this
 question should naturally appeal to economists. Moreover, the answer is in
 the affirmative, both in theory and in practice. In particular, recent
 theoretical work predicts systematic effects of electoral rules and
 political regimes on the size and composition of government spending.
 Results from ongoing empirical work indicate that such effects are indeed
 present in the data. Some empirical results are consistent with
 theoretical predictions: presidential regimes have smaller governments and
 countries with majoritarian elections have smaller welfare-state programs
 and less corruption. Other results present puzzles for future research:
 the adjustment to economic events appears highly institution-dependent, as
 does the timing and nature of the electoral cycle. Copyright The Econometric Society 2002.

Title: Commitment vs. Flexibility 
Abstract:
				 We study the optimal trade-off between
 commitment and flexibility in a consump- tion-savings model. Individuals
 expect to receive relevant information regarding tastes and thus they
 value the flexibility provided by larger choice sets. On the other hand,
 they also expect to suffer from temptation, with or without self-control,
 and thus they value the commitment afforded by smaller choice sets. The
 optimal commitment problem we study is to find the best subset of the
 individual's budget set. This problem leads to a principal-agent
 formulation. We find that imposing a minimum level of savings is always a
 feature of the solution. Necessary and sufficient conditions are derived
 for minimum-savings policies to completely characterize the solution. We
 also discuss other applications, such as the design of fiscal
 constitutions, the problem faced by a paternalist, and externalities. Copyright The Econometric Society 2006.

Title: Manipulability of Future-Independent Tests 
Abstract:
				 The difficulties in properly anticipating
 key economic variables may encourage decision makers to rely on experts'
 forecasts. Professional forecasters, however, may not be reliable and so
 their forecasts must be empirically tested. This may induce experts to
 forecast strategically in order to pass the test. A test can be ignorantly
 passed if a false expert, with no knowledge of the data-generating
 process, can pass the test. Many tests that are unlikely to reject correct
 forecasts can be ignorantly passed. Tests that cannot be ignorantly passed
 do exist, but these tests must make use of predictions contingent on data
 not yet observed at the time the forecasts are rejected. Such tests cannot
 be run if forecasters report only the probability of the next period's
 events on the basis of the actually observed data. This result shows that
 it is difficult to dismiss false, but strategic, experts who know how
 theories are tested. This result also shows an important role that can be
 played by predictions contingent on data not yet observed. Copyright  2008 The Econometric Society.

Title:   Cointegration and Dynamic Simultaneous Equations Model
Abstract: The author demonstrates that despite variables that are integrated, the
	fundamental issues on structural equation modeling raised by the Cowles
	Commission remain valid and standard estimation and testing procedures can
	still be applied. A basic framework linking the multiple time series model
	and the dynamic simultaneous equation model is provided and implications
	under the long-run cointegrating relations are discussed. Conditions for
	identifying both the short-run dynamics and long-run equilibrium conditions
	are given. Limiting properties of the least squares and simultaneous equation
	estimators under cointegration are derived. Implications for hypothesis
	testing are also discussed.

Title: Equilibria and Indivisibilities: Gross Substitutes and Complements 
Abstract:
				 This paper examines an exchange economy
 with heterogeneous indivisible objects that can be substitutable or
 complementary. We show that a competitive equilibrium exists in such
 economies, provided that all the objects can be partitioned into two
 groups, and from the viewpoint of each agent, objects in the same group
 are substitutes and objects across the two groups are complements. This
 condition generalizes the well-known Kelso-Crawford gross substitutes
 condition and is called gross substitutes and complements. We also provide
 practical and typical examples from which substitutes and complements are
 both jointly observed. Copyright The Econometric Society 2006.

Title:   Subsampling Intervals in Autoregressive Models with Linear Time Trend. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 1283-1314
Issue: 5
Volume: 69
Year: 2001
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  A new method is proposed for constructing confidence intervals in
 autoregressive models with linear time trend. Interest focuses on the sum
 of the autoregressive coefficients because this parameter provides a
 useful scalar measure of the long-run persistence properties of an
 economic time series. Since the type of the limiting distribution of the
 corresponding OLS estimator, as well as the rate of its convergence,
 depend in a discontinuous fashion upon whether the true parameter is less
 than one or equal to one (that is, trend-stationary case or unit root
 case), the construction of confidence intervals is notoriously difficult.
 The crux of our method is to recompute the OLS estimator on smaller blocks
 of the observed data, according to the general subsampling idea of Politis
 and Romano (1994), although some extensions of the standard theory are
 needed. The method is more general than previous approaches in that it
 works for arbitrary parameter values, but also because it allows the
 innovations to be a martingale difference sequence rather than i.i.d. Some
 simulation studies examine the finite sample performance.

Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 53-73
Issue: 1
Volume: 58
Year: 1990
Month:  January 
Abstract:
  The theory of precautionary saving is shown to be isomorphic to the
 Arrow-Pratt theory of risk aversion, making possible the application of a
 large body of knowledge about risk aversion to precautionary saving--and
 more generally, to the theory of optimal choice under risk. In particular,
 a measure of the strength of the precautionary saving motive analogous to
 the Arrow-Pratt measure of risk aversion is used to establish a number of
 new propositions about precautionary saving and to give a new
 interpretation of the Dreze-Modigliani substitution effect.   Copyright 1990 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Maximum Likelihood Estimation of Discretely Sampled Diffusions: A Closed-form Approximation Approach 
Abstract:
 When a continuous-time diffusion is observed only at discrete dates, in
 most cases the transition distribution and hence the likelihood function
 of the observations is not explicitly computable. Using Hermite
 polynomials, I construct an explicit sequence of closed-form functions and
 show that it converges to the true (but unknown) likelihood function. I
 document that the approximation is very accurate and prove that maximizing
 the sequence results in an estimator that converges to the true maximum
 likelihood estimator and shares its asymptotic properties. Monte Carlo
 evidence reveals that this method outperforms other approximation schemes
 in situations relevant for financial models. Copyright The Econometric Society 2002.

Title:   New Tools for Understanding Spurious Regressions
Abstract: Some new tools for analyzing spurious regressions are presented. The
	theory utilizes the general representation of a stochastic process in terms
	of an orthonormal system and provides an extension of the Weierstrass theorem
	to include the approximation of continuous functions and stochastic processes
	by Wiener processes. The theory is applied to two classic examples of
	spurious regressions:  regressions of stochastic trends on time polynomials
	and regressions among independent random walks. It is shown that such
	regressions reproduce in part and in whole the underlying orthonormal
	representations.

Volume: 62
Year: 1994
Month:  January 
Abstract:
  The author develops a practical extension of D. McFadden's method of
 simulated moments estimator for limited dependent variable models to the
 panel data case. The method is based on factorization of the method of
 simulated moments first order condition into transition probabilities,
 along with development of an accurate new method for simulating transition
 probabilities. Monte Carlo tests indicate that this method of simulated
 moments estimator performs quite well relative to quadrature-based maximum
 likelihood estimators. It allows estimation of complex panel data models
 involving random effects and ARMA errors in computational time similar to
 those necessary for estimation of random effects models via maximum
 likelihood quadrature.   Copyright 1994 by The Econometric Society.

Title: A Dynamic Equilibrium Model of International Portfolio Holdings 
Abstract:
 This paper develops a continuous-time equilibrium model of a two-country
 exchange economy with heterogeneous agents and nontraded goods. Nontraded
 goods play the role of state variables that shift the marginal utility of
 traded goods. This affects prices and generates dynamic hedging demands
 that explain the well documented home bias puzzle in international equity
 portfolios. When calibrated to both consumption and production data, the
 model is able to generate significative home bias in equity portfolios. A
 new methodology, based on Malliavin calculus, is presented to solve for
 the portfolio policies along the equilibrium path. This methodology allows
 one to reduce the determination of equilibrium portfolio holdings to the
 solution of a linear algebraic system, rather than a partial differential
 equation. Copyright The Econometric Society.

Title: Residual-Based Block Bootstrap for Unit Root Testing 
Abstract:
	 A nonparametric, residual-based block bootstrap procedure is
 proposed in the context of testing for integrated (unit root) time series.
 The resampling procedure is based on weak assumptions on the dependence
 structure of the stationary process driving the random walk and
 successfully generates unit root integrated pseudo-series retaining the
 important characteristics of the data. It is more general than previous
 bootstrap approaches to the unit root problem in that it allows for a very
 wide class of weakly dependent processes and it is not based on any
 parametric assumption on the process generating the data. As a consequence
 the procedure can accurately capture the distribution of many unit root
 test statistics proposed in the literature. Large sample theory is
 developed and the asymptotic validity of the block bootstrap-based unit
 root testing is shown via a bootstrap functional limit theorem.
 Applications to some particular test statistics of the unit root
 hypothesis, i.e., least squares and Dickey-Fuller type statistics are
 given. The power properties of our procedure are investigated and compared
 to those of alternative bootstrap approaches to carry out the unit root
 test. Some simulations examine the finite sample performance of our
 procedure. Copyright Econometric Society, 2002.

Title:  High Wage Workers and High Wage Firms
Abstract:
  Using a longitudinal sample of one million French workers and 500,000
  employing firms, the authors decompose real total annual compensation per
  worker into components:  observable employee characteristics, personal
  heterogeneity, firm heterogeneity, and residual. Unobserved personal
  heterogeneity is a very important source of wage variation.  Unobserved firm
  heterogeneity, while important, is not as important as person effects. 
  Enterprises that hire high-wage workers are more productive but not more
  profitable.  Enterprises that pay higher wages, controlling for person
  effects, are more productive and more profitable. Person effects explain
  about 90 percent of interindustry and firm-size wage differences while firm
  effects explain substantially less.

Volume: 63
Year: 1995
Month:  July 
Abstract:
  Models of life-cycle consumption are studied in which individuals react
 optimally to their own income process but have incomplete or no
 information on economywide variables. Since individual income is less
 persistent than aggregate income, consumers will react too little to
 aggregate income variation generating excess smoothness. Since aggregate
 information is slowly incorporated into consumption, aggregate consumption
 is correlated with lagged income. Model predictions using estimated income
 processes qualitatively correspond to empirical findings for aggregate
 consumption but differ in magnitude. Individual income processes are
 estimated from the Survey of Income and Program Participation, making
 various adjustments for measurement error.   Copyright 1995 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Multiple Referrals and Multidimensional Cheap Talk 
Abstract:
 In previous work on cheap talk, uncertainty has almost always been modeled
 using a single-dimensional state variable. In this paper we prove that the
 dimensionality of the uncertain variable has an important qualitative
 impact on results and yields interesting insights into the "mechanics" of
 information transmission. Contrary to the unidimensional case, if there is
 more than one sender, full revelation of information in all states of
 nature is generically possible, even when the conflict of interest is
 arbitrarily large. What really matters in transmission of information is
 the local behavior of senders' indifference curves at the ideal point of
 the receiver, not the proximity of players' ideal point. Copyright The Econometric Society 2002.

Title:  Explaining Investment Dynamics in U.S. Manufacturing: A Generalized (S,s) Approach
Abstract:
  In this paper, the authors derive a model of aggregate investment that builds
  from the lumpy microeconomic behavior of firms facing stochastic fixed
  adjustment costs. Instead of the standard sharp (S, s) bands, firms'
  adjustment policies take the form of a probability of adjustment (adjustment
  hazard) that responds smoothly to changes in firms' capacity gap.  The model
  has appealing aggregation properties, and yields nonlinear aggregate time
  series processes. The passivity of normal times is, occasionally, more than
  offset by the brisk response to large accumulated shocks. Using within and
  out-of-sample criteria, the authors find that the model performs
  substantially better than the standard linear models of investment for
  postwar sectoral U.S. manufacturing equipment and structures investment data.

Title:   A Heteroskedasticity Test Robust to Conditional Mean Misspecification. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 159-71
Issue: 1
Volume: 60
Year: 1992
Month:  January 
Abstract:
  This paper proposes a new test statistic to deter the presence of
 heteroskedasticity. The proposed test does not require a parametric
 specification of the mean regression function in the first stage
 regression. The regression function is estimated nonparametrically by the
 kernel estimation method. The nonparametric residual is estimated and used
 as a proxy for the random disturbance term. This nonparametric residual is
 robust to regression function misspecification. Asymptotic normality is
 established using extensions of classical U-statistic theorems. The test
 statistic is computed using the nonparametric quantities, but the
 resulting inference has a standard chi-square distribution.   Copyright 1992 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Higher-Order Improvements of a Computationally Attractive "k"-Step Bootstrap for Extremum Estimators 
Abstract:
 This paper establishes the higher-order equivalence of the "k"-step
 bootstrap, introduced recently by Davidson and MacKinnon (1999), and the
 standard bootstrap. The "k"-step bootstrap is a very attractive
 alternative computationally to the standard bootstrap for statistics based
 on nonlinear extremum estimators, such as generalized method of moment and
 maximum likelihood estimators. The paper also extends results of Hall and
 Horowitz (1996) to provide new results regarding the higher-order
 improvements of the standard bootstrap and the "k"-step bootstrap for
 extremum estimators (compared to procedures based on first-order
 asymptotics).	The results of the paper apply to Newton-Raphson (NR),
 default NR, line-search NR, and Gauss-Newton "k"-step bootstrap
 procedures. The results apply to the nonparametric iid bootstrap and
 nonoverlapping and overlapping block bootstraps. The results cover
 symmetric and equal-tailed two-sided "t" tests and confidence intervals,
 one-sided "t" tests and confidence intervals, Wald tests and confidence
 regions, and "J" tests of over-identifying restrictions. Copyright The Econometric Society 2002.

Title:   Discrete-Time Finite Horizon Appromixation of Infinite Horizon Optimization Problems with Steady-State Invariance. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 635-56
Issue: 3
Volume: 62
Year: 1994
Month:  May 
Abstract:
  The computation of large-scale nonlinear intertemporal optimization
 problems requires time aggregation. A procedure generally adopted is shown
 to introduce a dependency of the solution steady state to a specific
 choice of sequence of time intervals. The authors establish necessary and
 sufficient conditions to avoid this dependency. The result is a
 considerable improvement in the numerical accuracy of the time-aggregated
 approximation. The conditions apply to a broad class of models and prove
 useful in large-scale applied general-equilibrium modeling. This
 conclusion is highlighted by a comparison with a spectral-projection
 method using optimal orthogonal collocation as in K. L. Judd (1992).   Copyright 1994 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Estimating Long Memory in Volatility 
Abstract:
				 We consider semiparametric estimation of
 the memory parameter in a model that includes as special cases both
 long-memory stochastic volatility and fractionally integrated exponential
 GARCH (FIEGARCH) models. Under our general model the logarithms of the
 squared returns can be decomposed into the sum of a long-memory signal and
 a white noise. We consider periodogram-based estimators using a local
 Whittle criterion function. We allow the optional inclusion of an
 additional term to account for possible correlation between the signal and
 noise processes, as would occur in the FIEGARCH model. We also allow for
 potential nonstationarity in volatility by allowing the signal process to
 have a memory parameter d-super-*&ges;1&sol;2. We show that the local
 Whittle estimator is consistent for d-super-* is an element of (0,1). We
 also show that the local Whittle estimator is asymptotically normal for
 d-super-* is an element of (0,3/4) and essentially recovers the optimal
 semiparametric rate of convergence for this problem. In particular, if the
 spectral density of the short-memory component of the signal is
 sufficiently smooth, a convergence rate of n-super-2/5 - &delta; for
 d-super-* is an element of (0,3/4) can be attained, where n is the sample
 size and &delta;>0 is arbitrarily small. This represents a strong
 improvement over the performance of existing semiparametric estimators of
 persistence in volatility. We also prove that the standard Gaussian
 semiparametric estimator is asymptotically normal if d-super-*=0. This
 yields a test for long memory in volatility.				   Copyright The Econometric Society 2005.

Title:   Exactly Median-Unbiased Estimation of First Order Autoregressive/Unit Root Models. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 139-65
Issue: 1
Volume: 61
Year: 1993
Month:  January 
Abstract:
  First-order autoregressive/unit root models with independent identically
 distributed normal errors are considered, including those without an
 intercept, those with an intercept, and those with an intercept and time
 trend. The autoregressive parameter is allowed to lie in the interval (-1,
 1], which includes the unit root case. Exactly median-unbiased estimators
 and exact confidence intervals of the autoregressive parameter are
 introduced. Corresponding exactly median-unbiased estimators and exact
 confidence intervals are also provided for the impulse response function,
 the cumulative impulse response, and the half life of a unit shock. An
 unbiased model selection procedure is discussed. The introduced procedures
 are applied to several data series.   Copyright 1993 by The Econometric Society.

Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 19-41
Issue: 1
Volume: 55
Year: 1987
Month:  January 
Abstract:
  The authors specify and estimate a four-equation disequilibrium model of
 the consumption goods market in a centrally planned econo my. This work is
 based on previous papers of R. Portes and D. Winter_(1977) and W. Charemza
 and R. Quandt_(1982). The model contains a household demand equation , a
 planners' supply equation, a "min" condition and plan adjustment equation
 through which plan formation becomes endogenous. The paper uses a unique
 new data set of time series for plans for the major macroeconomic
 variables in Poland. The overall framework is applicable to any large
 organization which plans economic variables. Coauthors are Richard E.

Title:  Common Value Auctions with Insider Information
Journal: Econometrica
Abstract:
  Bidding is studied in first-price common value auctions where an insider is
  better informed than other bidders (outsiders). As in symmetric information
  structure (SIS) auctions, inexperienced outsiders suffer from a strong
  winner's curse. Super-experienced bidders, who have largely overcome the
  winner's curse, satisfy the comparative static predictions of the theory (i)
  An insider increases average seller's revenue compared to SIS auctions, (ii)
  insiders make substantially greater profits than outsiders, and (iii) more
  rivals cause insiders to bid higher. Changes in insiders' bids are consistent
  with directional learning theory (Selten and Buchta, 1994).

Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 91-118
Issue: 1
Volume: 56
Year: 1988
Month:  January 
Abstract:
  This paper examines household fertility and female labor supply over the
 life cycle. The authors investigate ho w maternal time and market inputs,
 and benefits children yield their parents, vary with their ages and
 influence female labor supply and c ontraceptive behavior. Their
 econometric framework combines a female labor-supply model and a
 contraceptive choice index function and allo ws conceptions not to be
 perfectly controllable. Using data from the Panel Study of Income
 Dynamics, they estimate these equations and tes t alternative
 specifications. The findings suggest that parents canno t perfectly
 control conceptions and variations in child care costs af fect the spacing
 of births.   Copyright 1988 by The Econometric Society.

Title:   Bootstrap Critical Values for Tests Based on Generalized-Method-of-Moments Estimators. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 891-916
Issue: 4
Volume: 64
Year: 1996
Month:  July 
Abstract:
  Tests based on generalized-method-of-moments estimators often have true
 levels that differ greatly from their nominal levels when asymptotic
 critical values are used. This paper gives conditions under which the
 bootstrap provides asymptotic refinements to the critical values of t
 tests and the test of overidentifying restrictions. Particular attention
 is given to the case of dependent data. It is shown that, with such data,
 the bootstrap must sample blocks of data and that the formulae for the
 bootstrap versions of the test statistics differ from the formulae that
 apply with the original data.	 Copyright 1996 by The Econometric Society.

Title:  An Information-Theoretic Alternative to Generalized Method of Moments Estimation
Abstract: While optimally weighted generalized method of moments (GAM) estimation
	has desirable large sample properties, its small sample performance is poor
	in some applications. The authors propose a computationally simple
	alternative, for weakly dependent data generating mechanisms, based on
	minimization of the Kullback-Leibler information criterion.  Conditions are
	derived under which the large sample properties of this estimator are similar
	to GAM, i.e., the estimator will be consistent and asymptotically normal,
	with the same asymptotic covariance matrix as GAM. In addition, the authors
	propose overidentifying and parametric restrictions tests as alternatives to
	analogous GAM procedures.

Title: Correcting the Errors: Volatility Forecast Evaluation Using High-Frequency Data and Realized Volatilities 
Abstract:
				 We develop general model-free adjustment
 procedures for the calculation of unbiased volatility loss functions based
 on practically feasible realized volatility benchmarks. The procedures,
 which exploit recent nonparametric asymptotic distributional results, are
 both easy-to-implement and highly accurate in empirically realistic
 situations. We also illustrate that properly accounting for the
 measurement errors in the volatility forecast evaluations reported in the
 existing literature can result in markedly higher estimates for the true
 degree of return volatility predictability. Copyright The Econometric Society 2005.

Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 877-908
Issue: 4
Volume: 56
Year: 1988

Abstract:
  This paper examines whether the negative assessment of the production
 smoothin g model of inventories in the existing literature is due to
 inadequat e treatment of cost shocks or seasonal fluctuations. The results
 of t he authors' empirical work provide a strong negative report on the pr
 oduction smoothing model, even when it includes cost shocks and seaso nal
 fluctuations. A striking piece of evidence is that in most indust ries the
 seasonal pattern in production is similar to the seasonal pa ttern in
 shipments, even after accounting for the seasonal movements in interest
 rates, input prices, and the weather.	 Copyright 1988 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Neoclassical Theory Versus Prospect Theory: Evidence from the Marketplace 
Abstract:
				 Several experimental studies have provided
 evidence that suggest indifference curves have a kink around the current
 endowment level. These results, which clearly contradict closely held
 economic doctrines, have led some influential commentators to call for an
 entirely new economic paradigm to displace conventional neoclassical
 theory-e.g., prospect theory, which invokes psychological effects. This
 paper pits neoclassical theory against prospect theory by investigating
 data drawn from more than 375 subjects actively participating in a
 well-functioning marketplace. The pattern of results suggests that
 prospect theory adequately organizes behavior among inexperienced
 consumers, but consumers with intense market experience behave largely in
 accordance with neoclassical predictions. Moreover, the data are
 consistent with the notion that consumers learn to overcome the endowment
 effect in situations beyond specific problems they have previously
 encountered. This "transference of behavior" across domains has important
 implications in both a positive and normative sense. Copyright The Econometric Society 2004.

Abstract:
  The generalized extreme value model was developed by D. McFadden for the
 case with discrete choice sets. The present paper extends this model to
 cases with both discrete and continuous choice sets and choice sets that
 are unobservable by the analyst. The author also proposes behavioral
 assumptions that justify random utility functions (processes) that have a
 max-stable structure, i.e., utility processes where the finite dimensional
 distributions are of the multivariate extreme value type. Finally, he
 derives nonparametrically testable implications for the choice
 probabilities in the continuous case.	 Copyright 1994 by The Econometric Society.

Title:   Approximate Power Functions for Some Robust Tests of Regression Coefficients. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 997-1019
Issue: 5
Volume: 56
Year: 1988
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  Edgeworth approximations are developed for the distribution functio ns of
 some statistics for testing a linear hypothesis on the coefficient s in a
 regression model with an unknown error covariance matrix. Adjust ments to
 the asymptotic critical values are found to insure that the tests have
 correct size to second order of approximation. The power loss due to the
 estimation of the error covariance matrix is calculated. Some examples
 involving heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation suggest that the null
 rejection probabilities of common robust regression tests are often
 considerably greater than their nominal level. Moreover, the cost of not
 knowing the error covariance matrix can be substantial.   Copyright 1988 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Discrete-Time Approximations of the Holmstrom-Milgrom Brownian-Motion Model of Intertemporal Incentive Provision 
Abstract:
 This paper studies the relation between discrete-time and continuous-time
 principal-agent models. We derive the continuous-time model as a limit of
 discrete-time models with ever shorter periods and show that optimal
 incentive schemes in the discrete-time models approximate the optimal
 incentive scheme in the continuous model, which is "linear in accounts".
 Under the additional assumption that the principal observes only
 cumulative total profits at the end and the agent can destroy profits
 unnoticed, an incentive scheme that is "linear in total profits" is shown
 to be approximately optimal in the discrete-time model when the length of
 the period is small. Copyright The Econometric Society 2002.

Title: Robust Predictions for Bilateral Contracting with Externalities 
Abstract:
	 The paper studies bilateral contracting between one principal and
 N agents when each agent's utility depends on the principal's unobservable
 contracts with other agents. We show that allowing deviations to menu
 contracts from which the principal chooses bounds equilibrium outcomes in
 a wide class of bilateral contracting games without imposing ad hoc
 restrictions on the agents' beliefs. This bound yields, for example,
 competitive convergence as N &rarr;&infin; in environments in which an
 appropriately-defined notion of competitive equilibrium exists. We also
 examine the additional restrictions arising in two common bilateral
 contracting games: the "offer game" in which the principal makes
 simultaneous offers to the agents, and the "bidding game" in which the
 agents make simultaneous offers to the principal. Copyright Econometric Society, 2002.

Title:   Stochastic Monotonicity and Stationary Distributions for Dynamic Economies. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 1387-406
Issue: 6
Volume: 60
Year: 1992
Month:  November 
Abstract:
  The existence and stability of invariant distributions for stochastically
 monotone processes is studied. The Knaster-Tarski fixed point theorem is
 applied to establish existence of fixed points of mappings on compact sets
 of measures that are increasing with respect to a stochastic ordering.
 Global convergence of a monotone Markov process to its unique invariant
 distribution is established.under an easily verified assumption. Topkis's
 theory of supermodular functions is applied to stochastic dynamic
 optimization, providing conditions under which optimal stationary
 decisions are monotone functions of the state and induce a monotone Markov
 process. Applications of these results to investment theory, stochastic
 growth and industry equilibrium dynamics are given.   Copyright 1992 by The Econometric Society.

Title: An Equilibrium Model of Health Insurance Provision and Wage Determination 
Abstract:
				 We investigate the effect of
 employer-provided health insurance on job mobility rates and economic
 welfare using a search, matching, and bargaining framework. In our model,
 health insurance coverage decisions are made in a cooperative manner that
 recognizes the productivity effects of health insurance as well as its
 nonpecuniary value to the employee. The resulting equilibrium is one in
 which not all employment matches are covered by health insurance, wages at
 jobs providing health insurance are larger (in a stochastic sense) than
 those at jobs without health insurance, and workers at jobs with health
 insurance are less likely to leave those jobs, even after conditioning on
 the wage rate. We estimate the model using the 1996 panel of the Survey of
 Income and Program Participation, and find that the employer-provided
 health insurance system does not lead to any serious inefficiencies in
 mobility decisions. Copyright The Econometric Society 2005.

Title:   Necessity of Transversality Conditions for Infinite Horizon Problems. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 995-1012
Issue: 4
Volume: 69
Year: 2001
Month:  July 
Abstract:
  This paper studies necessity of transversality conditions for the
 continuous time, reduced form model. By generalizing Benveniste and
 Scheinkman's (1982) "envelope" condition and Michel's (1990) version of
 the squeezing argument, we show a generalization of Michel's (1990,
 Theorem 1) necessity result that does not assume concavity. The
 generalization enables us to generalize Ekeland and Scheinkman's (1986)
 result as well as to establish a new result that does not require the
 objective functional to be finite. The new result implies that homogeneity
 of the return function alone is sufficient for the necessity of the most
 standard transversality condition. Our results are also applied to a
 nonstationary version of the one-sector growth model. It is shown that
 bubbles never arise in an equilibrium asset pricing model with a nonlinear
 constraint.

Title:   Asymptotic Filtering Theory for Univariate ARCH Models. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 1-41
Issue: 1
Volume: 62
Year: 1994
Month:  January 
Abstract:
  Researchers often employ ARCH models to estimate conditional variances
 and covariances. How successfully can misspecified ARCH models carry out
 this estimation? This paper employs continuous record asymptotics to
 approximate the distribution of the measurement error. This allows the
 authors to (1) compare the efficiency of various ARCH models, (2)
 characterize the impact of different kinds of misspecification on
 efficiency, and (3) characterize asymptotically optimal ARCH conditional
 variance estimates. They apply their results to derive optimal ARCH
 filters for three diffusion models, and to examine in detail the filtering
 properties of GARCH(1,1), AR(1) EGARCH, and the model of S. Taylor (1986)
 and G. W. Schwert (1989).   Copyright 1994 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Women as Policy Makers: Evidence from a Randomized Policy Experiment in India 
Abstract:
				 This paper uses political reservations for
 women in India to study the impact of women's leadership on policy
 decisions. Since the mid-1990's, one third of Village Council head
 positions in India have been randomly reserved for a woman: In these
 councils only women could be elected to the position of head. Village
 Councils are responsible for the provision of many local public goods in
 rural areas. Using a dataset we collected on 265 Village Councils in West
 Bengal and Rajasthan, we compare the type of public goods provided in
 reserved and unreserved Village Councils. We show that the reservation of
 a council seat affects the types of public goods provided. Specifically,
 leaders invest more in infrastructure that is directly relevant to the
 needs of their own genders. Copyright The Econometric Society 2004.

Title: Anticipating Regret: Why Fewer Options May Be Better 
Abstract:
				       We study preferences over menus
 which can be represented as if the agent selects an alternative from a
 menu and experiences regret if her choice is ex post inferior. Since
 regret arises from comparisons between the alternative selected and the
 other available alternatives, our axioms reflect the agent's desire to
 limit her options. We prove that our representation is essentially unique.
 We also introduce two measures of comparative regret attitudes and relate
 them to our representation. Finally, we explore the formal connection
 between the present work and the literature on temptation.	  Copyright The Econometric Society 2008.

Title: Uncertainty and Risk in Financial Markets 
Abstract:
				 This paper considers a general equilibrium
 model in which the distinction between uncertainty and risk is formalized
 by assuming agents have incomplete preferences over state-contingent
 consumption bundles, as in Bewley (1986). Without completeness, individual
 decision making depends on a set of probability distributions over the
 state space. A bundle is preferred to another if and only if it has larger
 expected utility for all probabilities in this set. When preferences are
 complete this set is a singleton, and the model reduces to standard
 expected utility. In this setting, we characterize Pareto optima and
 equilibria, and show that the presence of uncertainty generates robust
 indeterminacies in equilibrium prices and allocations for any
 specification of initial endowments. We derive comparative statics results
 linking the degree of uncertainty with changes in equilibria. Despite the
 presence of robust indeterminacies, we show that equilibrium prices and
 allocations vary continuously with underlying fundamentals. Equilibria in
 a standard risk economy are thus robust to adding small degrees of
 uncertainty. Finally, we give conditions under which some assets are not
 traded due to uncertainty aversion.				 Copyright The Econometric Society 2005.

Title: Shift Restrictions and Semiparametric Estimation in Ordered Response Models 
Abstract:
 We develop a &radic;"n"-consistent and asymptotically normal estimator of
 the parameters (regression coefficients and threshold points) of a
 semiparametric ordered response model under the assumption of independence
 of errors and regressors. The independence assumption implies shift
 restrictions allowing identification of threshold points up to location
 and scale. The estimator is useful in various applications, particularly
 in new product demand forecasting from survey data subject to systematic
 misreporting. We apply the estimator to assess exaggeration bias in survey
 data on demand for a new telecommunications service. Copyright The Econometric Society 2002.

Title:   No-Envy and Consistency in Economies with Indivisible Goods. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 1755-67
Issue: 6
Volume: 59
Year: 1991
Month:  November 
Abstract:
  The authors study fair allocation in economies with indivisible goods.
 They look for subsolutions of the no-envy solution satisfying the property
 of consistency which says that the desirability of an allocation for some
 economy is unaffected by the departure of some of the agents with their
 allotted bundles. The authors show that essentially there is no proper
 subsolution of the no-envy solution satisfying consistency. However, many
 subsolutions satisfy a bilateral version of the condition and many satisfy
 its converse. But again, there is essentially no proper subsolution
 satisfying bilateral consistency and converse consistency together.   Copyright 1991 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Sequential Equilibria in a Ramsey Tax Model 
Abstract:
 This paper presents a full characterization of the equilibrium value set
 of a Ramsey tax model. More generally, it develops a dynamic programming
 method for a class of policy games between the government and a continuum
 of households. By selectively incorporating Euler conditions into a
 strategic dynamic programming framework, we wed two technologies that are
 usually considered competing alternatives, resulting in a substantial
 simplification of the problem. Copyright The Econometric Society.

Title: Confidence Intervals for Partially Identified Parameters 
Abstract:
				 Recently a growing body of research has
 studied inference in settings where parameters of interest are partially
 identified. In many cases the parameter is real-valued and the
 identification region is an interval whose lower and upper bounds may be
 estimated from sample data. For this case confidence intervals (CIs) have
 been proposed that cover the entire identification region with fixed
 probability. Here, we introduce a conceptually different type of
 confidence interval. Rather than cover the entire identification region
 with fixed probability, we propose CIs that asymptotically cover the true
 value of the parameter with this probability. However, the exact coverage
 probabilities of the simplest version of our new CIs do not converge to
 their nominal values uniformly across different values for the width of
 the identification region. To avoid the problems associated with this, we
 modify the proposed CI to ensure that its exact coverage probabilities do
 converge uniformly to their nominal values. We motivate this modified CI
 through exact results for the Gaussian case. Copyright The Econometric Society 2004.

Title:   Equivalence of Games and Markets. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 1141-60
Issue: 5
Volume: 62
Year: 1994
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  The author proves an equivalence between large games with effective small
 groups of players and games generated by markets. Small groups are
 effective if all or almost all gains to collective activities can be
 achieved by groups bounded in size of membership. A market is an exchange
 economy where all participants have concave, quasi-linear payoff
 functions. The market approximating a game is socially homogeneous--all
 participants have the same monotonic nondecreasing, and 1-homogeneous
 payoff function. The author's results imply that any market (more
 generally, any economy with effective small groups) can be approximated by
 a socially homogeneous market.   Copyright 1994 by The Econometric Society.

Title:  Large Sample Properties of Posterior Densities, Bayesian Information Criterion and the Likelihood Principle in Nonstationary Time Series Models
Abstract: Asymptotic normality of posterior is a well understood result for
	dynamic as well as non-dynamic models based on sets of abstract conditions
	that are hard to verify especially for the case of nonstationarity. In this
	paper the authors provide a set of conditions by which they can relatively
	easily prove the asymptotic posterior normality under quite general
	situations of possible nonstationarity.  This result reinforces and
	generalizes the validity of inference based on the likelihood principle. On
	the other hand, the authors' conditions allow them to generalize Bayesian
	decision criterion to the case of possible nonstationarity. In addition, the
	authors have shown that consistency of the maximum likelihood estimator, not
	the asymptotic normality of the estimator, with some minor additional
	assumptions is sufficient for the asymptotic posterior normality.

Title:   Supply Function Equilibria in Oligopoly under Uncertainty. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 1243-77
Issue: 6
Volume: 57
Year: 1989
Month:  November 
Abstract:
  The authors model an oligopoly facing uncertain demand where each firm
 chooses as its strategy a "supply function" relating its quantity to its
 price. A supply function adapts better to an uncertain environment than
 either a fixed price or a fixed quantity; it could be committed to through
 the choice of organizational structure and employee decision rules. The
 authors give conditions for existence and for uniqueness of a Nash
 equilibrium in supply functions under uncertainty. They compare the
 equilibrium with the Cournot and Bertrand equilibria as they vary the
 demand and cost curves, the number of firms, and the form of uncertainty.   Copyright 1989 by The Econometric Society.

Title:  Social Distance and Social Decisions
Abstract: A model of social distance is presented that is useful for
	understanding social decisions. An example is constructed of class stability.
	Agents who are initially close interact strongly while those who are socially
	distant have little interaction. In this example, inherited social position,
	which may be interpreted as social class, plays a dominant role. The
	relevance of this model to social decisions, such as the choice of
	educational attainment and childbearing, is discussed in the context of
	specific ethnographic examples. Class position may play a dominant role in
	these decisions.

Abstract:
  This paper characterizes all utility derived demand systmes having Engel

 This class encompasses virtually all utility derived demand systems that
 have been estimated in the past using ag gregate data with explicit
 treatment of the problem of aggregation ac ross individuals. It includes
 extensions of the PIGLOG and PIGL class es that have similar properties to
 these classes, but allow for more general Engel curve shapes. This paper
 extends W. M. Gorman's study o f these forms primarily by characterizing
 systems of rank two. The ap plication of the characterized systems to
 problems of nesting, separa bility, flexibility, Engel curve analysis,
 estimation, and aggregatio n are briefly discussed.   Copyright 1987 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Panel Binary Variables and Sufficiency: Generalizing Conditional Logit 
Abstract:
				 This paper extends the conditional logit
 approach (Rasch, Andersen, Chamberlain) used in panel data models of
 binary variables with correlated fixed effects and strictly exogenous
 regressors. In a two-period two-state model, necessary and sufficient
 conditions on the joint distribution function of the individual-and-period
 specific shocks are given such that the sum of individual binary variables
 across time is a sufficient statistic for the individual effect. By
 extending a result of Chamberlain, it is shown that root-n consistent
 regular estimators can be constructed in panel binary models if and only
 if the property of sufficiency holds. In applied work, the estimation
 method amounts to quasi-differencing the binary variables as if they were
 continuous variables and transforming a panel data model into a
 cross-section model. Semiparametric approaches can then be readily
 applied.				    Copyright The Econometric Society 2004.

Title:   The Effect of Sample Selection and Initial Conditions in Duration Models: Evidence from Experimental Data on Training. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 175-205
Issue: 1
Volume: 64
Year: 1996

Abstract:
  The authors investigate the separate effects of a training program on the
 duration of participants' subsequent employment and unemployment spells.
 This program randomly assigned volunteers to treatment and control groups.
 However, the treatments and controls experiencing subsequent employment
 and unemployment spells are not generally comparable subsets of the
 initial groups. Standard practice in duration models ignores this issue,
 leading to a sample selection problem and misleading estimates of the
 training effects. The authors propose an estimator that addresses this
 problem and find that the program studied, the National Supported Work
 Demonstration, raised trainees' employment rates solely by lengthening
 their employment durations.   Copyright 1996 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Deterministic Approximation of Stochastic Evolution in Games 
Abstract:
	 This paper provides deterministic approximation results for
 stochastic processes that arise when finite populations recurrently play
 finite games. The processes are Markov chains, and the approximation is
 defined in continuous time as a system of ordinary differential equations
 of the type studied in evolutionary game theory. We establish precise
 connections between the long-run behavior of the discrete stochastic
 process, for large populations, and its deterministic flow approximation.
 In particular, we provide probabilistic bounds on exit times from and
 visitation rates to neighborhoods of attractors to the deterministic flow.
 We sharpen these results in the special case of ergodic processes. Copyright Econometric Society, 2002.

Title:  A Conditional Kolmogorov Test
Abstract: This paper introduces a conditional Kolmogorov test of model
	specification for parametric models with covariates (regressors). The test is
	an extension of the Kolmogorov test of goodness-of-fit for distribution
	functions. The test is shown to have power against 1/[square root of n] local
	alternatives and all fixed alternatives to the null hypothesis. A parametric
	bootstrap procedure is used to obtain critical values for the test.

Title:   Estimating the Value of an In-Kind Transfer: The Case of Food Stamps. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 385-409
Issue: 2
Volume: 57
Year: 1989
Month:  March 
Abstract:
  The value of one in-kind transfer, food stamps, is estimated by
 evaluating the experience of an actual conversion from stamps to cash in
 Puerto Rico in 1982. The evidence indicates that the cashout of the stamps
 had no detectable influence on food expenditures. The explanation partly
 lies in the distribution of expenditures, for the stamps were
 inframarginal for most recipients. However, some evidence indicates that
 trafficking in stamps was widespread as well, including indirect evidence
 from estimation of the piecewise-linear constraint model.   Copyright 1989 by The Econometric Society.

Title:   The Learning Curve, Market Dominance, and Predatory Pricing. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 1115-40
Issue: 5
Volume: 62
Year: 1994
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  Strategic implications of the learning curve hypothesis are analyzed in
 the context of a price-setting, differentiated duopoly selling to a
 sequence of heterogeneous buyers with uncertain demands. A unique Markov
 perfect equilibrium is characterized and sufficient conditions are
 provided for market dominance to be self-reinforcing. Increasing market
 dominance implies that learning is privately disadvantageous. Finally,
 introducing avoidable fixed costs and possible exit into the model yields
 a new theory of predatory pricing based on the learning curve hypothesis.   Copyright 1994 by The Econometric Society.

Title: On Modes of Economic Governance 
Abstract:
 I consider transactions involving asymmetric prisoners' dilemmas between
 pairs of players randomly selected from two large populations. Games are
 played repeatedly, but information about cheating is not adequate to
 sustain cooperation, and there is no official legal system of contract
 enforcement. I examine how profit--maximizing private intermediation can
 supply the information and enforcement. I obtain conditions under which
 private governance can improve upon no governance, and examine why it
 fails to achieve social optimality. Copyright The Econometric Society 2003.

Title: Bargaining with Interdependent Values 
Abstract:
				 A seller and a buyer bargain over the
 terms of trade for an object. The seller receives a perfect signal that
 determines the value of the object to both players, whereas the buyer
 remains uninformed. We analyze the infinite-horizon bargaining game in
 which the buyer makes all the offers. When the static incentive
 constraints permit first-best efficiency, then under some regularity
 conditions the outcome of the sequential bargaining game becomes
 arbitrarily efficient as bargaining frictions vanish. When the static
 incentive constraints preclude first-best efficiency, the limiting
 bargaining outcome is not second-best efficient and may even perform worse
 than the outcome from the one-period bargaining game. With frequent buyer
 offers, the outcome is then characterized by recurring bursts of high
 probability of agreement, followed by long periods of delay in which the
 probability of agreement is negligible. Copyright The Econometric Society 2006.

Title: Efficient Use of Information and Social Value of Information 
Abstract:
				 This paper analyzes equilibrium and
 welfare for a tractable class of economies (games) that have
 externalities, strategic complementarity or substitutability, and
 heterogeneous information. First, we characterize the equilibrium use of
 information: complementarity heightens the sensitivity of equilibrium
 actions to public information, raising aggregate volatility, whereas
 substitutability heightens the sensitivity to private information, raising
 cross-sectional dispersion. Next, we define and characterize an efficiency
 benchmark designed to address whether the equilibrium use of information
 is optimal from a social perspective; the efficient use of information
 reflects the social value of aligning choices across agents. Finally, we
 examine the comparative statics of equilibrium welfare with respect to the
 information structure; the social value of information is best understood
 by classifying economies according to the inefficiency, if any, in the
 equilibrium use of information. We conclude with a few applications,
 including production externalities, beauty contests, business cycles, and
 large Cournot and Bertrand games.				 Copyright The Econometric Society 2007.

Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 69-94
Issue: 1
Volume: 55
Year: 1987
Month:  January 
Abstract:
  When a decision rule is implemented using a Bayesian incentive compatible
 mechanism in which the messages are publically obser vable, the players'
 information is augmented by their observation of each others' strategies.
 In this paper the authors study the set of Bayesian implementable decision
 rules which have the further property that the information c onveyed in
 the process of thier implementation does not invalidate the optimality of
 the players' strategies. Such rules are called posterior implementable.
 The authors concentrate on a two-person problem with two possible
 decisions and, for this problem, they obtain a complete characterization
 of the set of posterior implementable decision rules.	 Copyright 1987 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Estimating the Effects of a Time-Limited Earnings Subsidy for Welfare-Leavers 
Abstract:
				 In the Self Sufficiency Project (SSP)
 welfare demonstration, members of a randomly assigned treatment group
 could receive a subsidy for full-time work. The subsidy was available for
 3 years, but only to people who began working full time within 12 months
 of random assignment. A simple optimizing model suggests that the
 eligibility rules created an "establishment" incentive to find a job and
 leave welfare within a year of random assignment, and an "entitlement"
 incentive to choose work over welfare once eligibility was established.
 Building on this insight, we develop an econometric model of welfare
 participation that allows us to separate the two effects and estimate the
 impact of the earnings subsidy on welfare entry and exit rates among those
 who achieved eligibility. The combination of the two incentives explains
 the time profile of the experimental impacts, which peaked 15 months after
 random assignment and faded relatively quickly. Our findings suggest that
 about half of the peak impact of SSP was attributable to the establishment
 incentive. Despite the extra work effort generated by SSP, the program had
 no lasting impact on wages and little or no long-run effect on welfare
 participation. Copyright The Econometric Society 2005.

Title: On the Generic (Im)Possibility of Full Surplus Extraction in Mechanism Design 
Abstract:
				 A number of studies, most notably Crémer
 and McLean (1985, 1988), have shown that in generic type spaces that admit
 a common prior and are of a fixed finite size, an uninformed seller can
 design mechanisms that extract all the surplus from privately informed
 bidders. We show that this result hinges on the nonconvexity of such a
 family of priors. When the ambient family of priors is convex, generic
 priors do not allow for full surplus extraction provided that for at least
 one prior in this family, players' beliefs about other players' types do
 not pin down the players' own preferences. In particular, full surplus
 extraction is generically impossible in finite type spaces with a common
 prior. Similarly, generic priors on the universal type space do not allow
 for full surplus extraction.				   Copyright The Econometric Society 2006.

Title: A Fractional Dickey-Fuller Test for Unit Roots 
Abstract:
 This paper presents a new test for fractionally integrated ("FI")
 processes. In particular, we propose a testing procedure in the time
 domain that extends the well-known Dickey-Fuller approach, originally
 designed for the "I"(1) versus "I"(0) case, to the more general setup of
 "FI"("d"-sub-0) versus "FI"("d"-sub-1), with "d"-sub-1&lt;"d"-sub-0. When
 "d"-sub-0=1, the proposed test statistics are based on the OLS estimator,
 or its "t"-ratio, of the coefficient on &Delta;-super-"d"-sub-1"y"-sub-"t"
 - 1 in a regression of &Delta;"y-sub-t" on
 &Delta;-super-"d"-sub-1"y"-sub-"t" - 1 and, possibly, some lags of
 &Delta;"y-sub-t". When "d"-sub-1 is not taken to be known a priori, a
 pre-estimation of "d"-sub-1 is needed to implement the test. We show that
 the choice of any "T"-super-1&sol;2-consistent estimator of "d"-sub-1 is
 an element of [0 ,1) suffices to make the test feasible, while achieving
 asymptotic normality. Monte-Carlo simulations support the analytical
 results derived in the paper and show that proposed tests fare very well,
 both in terms of power and size, when compared with others available in
 the literature. The paper ends with two empirical applications. Copyright The Econometric Society 2002.

Title:   Multistage Situations. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 1415-37
Issue: 6
Volume: 64
Year: 1996
Month:  November 
Abstract:
  The authors introduce and analyze 'multistage situations,' which
 generalize 'multistage games' (which, in turn, generalize 'repeated
 games'). One reason for this generalization is to avoid the perhaps
 unrealistic constraints--inherent to noncooperative games--that the set of
 strategy tuples must be a Cartesian product of the strategy sets of the
 players. Another reason is that, in most economic and social activities
 (e.g., in sequential bargaining without a rigid protocol), the 'rules of
 the game' are rather amorphous; the procedures are rarely pinned down.
 Such social environments can, however, be represented as multistage
 situations and be effectively analyzed through the theory of social
 situations.   Copyright 1996 by The Econometric Society.

Title:  Efficiency and Equilibrium with Dynamic Increasing Aggregate Returns Due to Demand Complementarities 
Journal: Econometrica
Abstract:
  When do dynamic nonconvexities at the disaggregate level translate into
  dynamic nonconvexities at the aggregate level? The authors address this
  question in a framework where the production of differentiated intermediate
  inputs is subject to dynamic nonconvexities and show that the answer depends
  on the degree of Hicks-Allen complementarity between differentiated inputs.
  In the simplest case, there are dynamic nonconvexities at the aggregate level
  if and only if differentiated inputs are Hicks-Allen complements. The authors
  also compare dynamic equilibrium and optimal allocations in the presence of
  aggregate dynamic nonconvexities due to Hicks-Allen complementarities between
  differentiated inputs.

Pages: 595-609
Issue: 3
Volume: 59
Year: 1991
Month:  May 
Abstract:
  The main result of this paper characterizes voting by committees. There
 are n voters and K objects. Voters must choose a subset of K. Voting by
 committees is defined by one monotone family of winning coalitions for
 each object; an object is chosen if it is supported by one of its winning
 coalitions. This is proven to be the class of all voting schemes
 satisfying voter sovereignty and nonmanipulability on the domain of
 separable preferences. The result is analogous to the characterization of
 Clarke-Groves schemes in that it exhibits the class of all nonmanipulable
 schemes on an important domain.  Copyright 1991 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Nonparametric Engel Curves and Revealed Preference 
Abstract:
 This paper applies revealed preference theory to the nonparametric
 statistical analysis of consumer demand. Knowledge of expansion paths is
 shown to improve the power of nonparametric tests of revealed preference.
 The tightest bounds on indifference surfaces and welfare measures are
 derived using an algorithm for which revealed preference conditions are
 shown to guarantee convergence. Nonparametric Engel curves are used to
 estimate expansion paths and provide a stochastic structure within which
 to examine the consistency of household level data and revealed preference
 theory. An application is made to a long time series of repeated
 cross--sections from the Family Expenditure Survey for Britain. The
 consistency of these data with revealed preference theory is examined. For
 periods of consistency with revealed preference, tight bounds are placed
 on true cost of living indices. Copyright The Econometric Society 2003.

Title: The Time Consistency of Optimal Monetary and Fiscal Policies 
Abstract:
				 We show that optimal monetary and fiscal
 policies are time consistent for a class of economies often used in
 applied work, economies appealing because they are consistent with the
 growth facts. We establish our results in two steps. We first show that
 for this class of economies, the Friedman rule of setting nominal interest
 rates to zero is optimal under commitment. We then show that optimal
 policies are time consistent if the Friedman rule is optimal. For our
 benchmark economy in which the time consistency problem is most severe,
 the converse also holds: if optimal policies are time consistent, then the
 Friedman rule is optimal. Copyright The Econometric Society 2004.

Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 1313-39
Issue: 6
Volume: 61
Year: 1993
Month:  November 
Abstract:
  This paper presents a game of strategic bargaining under deadlines whose
 equilibrium conforms to anecdotal and experimental information about
 real-life bargaining sessions. The model operates in continuous time and
 incorporates possible strategic delay and imperfect player control over
 the timing of offers (modeled by means of an exogenous random delay). In
 the unique symmetric Markov-perfect equilibrium, players adopt strategic
 delay early in the game, make and reject offers later on, and usually
 reach agreements late in the game, though they miss the deadline with
 positive probability. The expected division of the surplus is close to an
 even split.   Copyright 1993 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Lower Risk Bounds and Properties of Confidence Sets for Ill-Posed Estimation Problems with Applications to Spectral Density and Persistence Estimation, Unit Roots, and Estimation of Long Memory Parameters 
Abstract:
 Important estimation problems in econometrics like estimating the value of
 a spectral density at frequency zero, which appears in the econometrics
 literature in the guises of heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation
 consistent variance estimation and long run variance estimation, are shown
 to be "ill-posed" estimation problems. A prototypical result obtained in
 the paper is that the minimax risk for estimating the value of the
 spectral density at frequency zero is infinite regardless of sample size,
 and that confidence sets are close to being uninformative. In this result
 the maximum risk is over commonly used specifications for the set of
 feasible data generating processes. The consequences for inference on unit
 roots and cointegration are discussed. Similar results for persistence
 estimation and estimation of the long memory parameter are given. All
 these results are obtained as special cases of a more general theory
 developed for abstract estimation problems, which readily also allows for
 the treatment of other ill-posed estimation problems such as, e.g.,
 nonparametric regression or density estimation. Copyright The Econometric Society 2002.

Title:   A More Robust Definition of Subjective Probability. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 745-80
Issue: 4
Volume: 60
Year: 1992
Month:  July 
Abstract:
  The goal of choice-theoretic derivations of subjective probability is to
 separate a decisionmaker's underlying beliefs (subjective probabilities of
 events) from their preferences (attitudes toward risk). Classical
 derivations have all relied upon some form of the Marschak-Samuelson
 "Independence Axiom" or the Savage "Sure-Thing Principle," which imply
 that preferences over lotteries conform to the expected utility
 hypothesis. This paper presents a choice-theoretic derivation of
 subjective probability in a Savage-type setting of purely subjective
 uncertainty, which neither assumes nor implies that the decisionmaker's
 preferences over lotteries necessarily conform to the expected utility
 hypothesis.   Copyright 1992 by The Econometric Society.

Title:   Transactions/List Pricing. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 621-36
Issue: 3
Volume: 58
Year: 1990
Month:  May 
Abstract:
  Suppose that a representative downstream firm must buy
 relationship-specific capital before trading with an upstream monopolist.
 Under reasonable conditions, the monopolist would precommit to price to
 induce greater investment. If the monopolist were privately informed of
 its unit costs after the downstream firms invested, then the optimal
 contract would specify a maximum (" list") price which might be discounted
 (to "transactions" prices) if costs were low: a mode of pricing prevalent
 in interfirm trade. These results may explain why G. J. Stigler and J. K.
 Kindahl's medium-term price series tracked wholesale price indices
 whenever the latter were nondecreasing, but otherwise fell significantly
 faster.   Copyright 1990 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Measuring the Dynamic Efficiency Costs of Regulators&apos; Preferences: Municipal Water Utilities in the Arid West 
Abstract:
 Evidence suggests that municipal water utility administrators in the
 western US price water significantly below its marginal cost and, in so
 doing, inefficiently exploit aquifer stocks and induce social surplus
 losses. This paper empirically identifies the objective function of those
 managers, measures the deadweight losses resulting from their
 price-discounting decisions, and recovers the efficient water pricing
 policy function from counterfactual experiments. In doing so, the
 estimation uses a "continuous-but-constrained- control" version of a
 nested fixed-point algorithm in order to measure the important
 intertemporal consequences of groundwater pricing decisions. Copyright The Econometric Society 2002.

Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 329-55
Issue: 2
Volume: 55
Year: 1987
Month:  March 
Abstract:
  This paper describes a continuous time model of an economy with finitely
 many infinitely-lived consumers and a finite number of capital goods. Two
 objectives are achieved. First, recursive (nonadditive) utility
 functionals are formulated and analyzed. Second, these preference
 functionals are applied to analyze the nature of efficient allocations in
 a dynamic economy. Two classes of global turnpike propositions are proven
 which provide the basis for a model of the long-run distribution of
 wealth. These propositions also provide new perspective regarding existing
 stability literature based on additive utilities.   Copyright 1987 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Level-k Auctions: Can a Nonequilibrium Model of Strategic Thinking Explain the Winner's Curse and Overbidding in Private-Value Auctions?  				 
Abstract:
				 This paper proposes a structural
 nonequilibrium model of initial responses to incomplete-information games
 based on "level-k" thinking, which describes behavior in many experiments
 with complete-information games. We derive the model's implications in
 first- and second-price auctions with general information structures,
 compare them to equilibrium and Eyster and Rabin's (2005) "cursed
 equilibrium," and evaluate the model's potential to explain nonequilibrium
 bidding in auction experiments. The level-k model generalizes many
 insights from equilibrium auction theory. It allows a unified explanation
 of the winner's curse in common-value auctions and overbidding in those
 independent-private-value auctions without the uniform value distributions
 used in most experiments.				   Copyright The Econometric Society 2007.

Title: The Time Series and Cross-Section Asymptotics of Dynamic Panel Data Estimators 
Abstract:
				 In this paper we derive the asymptotic
 properties of within groups (WG), GMM, and LIML estimators for an
 autoregressive model with random effects when both T and N tend to
 infinity. GMM and LIML are consistent and asymptotically equivalent to the
 WG estimator. When T/N&rarr; 0 the fixed T results for GMM and LIML remain
 valid, but WG, although consistent, has an asymptotic bias in its
 asymptotic distribution. When T/N tends to a positive constant, the WG,
 GMM, and LIML estimators exhibit negative asymptotic biases of order 1/T,
 1/N, and 1/(2N - T), respectively. In addition, the crude GMM estimator
 that neglects the autocorrelation in first differenced errors is
 inconsistent as T/N&rarr;c>0, despite being consistent for fixed T.
 Finally, we discuss the properties of a random effects pseudo MLE with
 unrestricted initial conditions when both T and N tend to infinity.	     Copyright The Econometric Society 2003.

Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 1187-1209
Issue: 5
Volume: 55
Year: 1987

Abstract:
  Existence is obtained under a growth condition on paths that are
 asymptotic to turnpikes whose growth rate equals or exceeds that of the
 discount rate. Finite horizon approximates, that are computationally
 tractable, are used t o obtain solutions that yield lower and upper bounds
 for the optimal value. The technique used is that of epi-convergence. The
 lower bound estimates come from smoothing out of the tails of the
 trajectories, and the upper bound estimates from trajectories that are
 tail station ary.   Copyright 1987 by The Econometric Society.

Title: A Partial Folk Theorem for Games with Unknown Payoff Distributions 
Abstract:
				 Repeated games with unknown payoff
 distributions are analogous to a single decision maker's "multi-armed
 bandit" problem. Each state of the world corresponds to a different payoff
 matrix of a stage game. When monitoring is perfect, information about the
 state is public, and players are sufficiently patient, the following
 result holds: For any function that maps each state to a payoff vector
 that is feasible and individually rational in that state, there is a
 sequential equilibrium in which players experiment to learn the realized
 state and achieve a payoff close to the one specified for that state. Copyright The Econometric Society 2005.

Title:   Bayesian Implementation. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 461-77
Issue: 2
Volume: 59
Year: 1991
Month:  March 
Abstract:
  The decentralization of decision-making is analyzed when agents may have
 information that is incomplete and possibly exclusive. Theorems provide
 conditions under which there exists a mechanism whose Bayesian equilibria
 coincide with a desired collection of social choice functions. The first
 theorem characterizes Bayesian implementation in economic environments
 with three or more individuals. The second theorem extends the analysis to
 noneconomic environments. An example exhibits differences between Bayesian
 implementation and Nash implementation.   Copyright 1991 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Adaptive Heuristics 
Abstract:
				 We exhibit a large class of simple rules
 of behavior, which we call adaptive heuristics, and show that they
 generate rational behavior in the long run. These adaptive heuristics are
 based on natural regret measures, and may be viewed as a bridge between
 rational and behavioral viewpoints. Taken together, the results presented
 here establish a solid connection between the dynamic approach of adaptive
 heuristics and the static approach of correlated equilibria.		     Copyright The Econometric Society 2005.

Title:   Equilibrium Selection in Signaling Games. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 647-61
Issue: 3
Volume: 55
Year: 1987
Month:  May 
Abstract:
  The authors introduce a new solution concept, divine equilibrium, which
 refines the set of sequential equilibria in signaling games by requiring
 that off-the-equilibrium-path beliefs satisfy an additional restriction.
 This restriction rules out implausible sequential equilibria in examples.
 Divine equilibria exist because a sequential equilibrium that fails to be
 divine cannot be in a stable component. The authors demonstrate through
 examples that the stable component of signaling games is typically smaller
 than the set of divine equilibria and present a characterization of the
 set of stable outcomes in generic signaling games.   Copyright 1987 by The Econometric Society.

Title:   A Unique Informationally Efficient and Decentralized Mechanism with Fair Outcomes. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 1147-72
Issue: 5
Volume: 61
Year: 1993
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  It is shown that any informationally decentralized mechanism that
 realizes fair allocations over the class of classical pure exchange
 environments has a message space of dimension no smaller than the number
 of agents times the number of commodities. Since the equal income
 Walrasian mechanism, in which all agents take prices parametrically and
 maximize utility subject to the average income constraint, realizes fair
 outcomes over the class of classical pure exchange environments and has a
 message space of that dimension, it is informationally efficient. Further,
 it is shown that it is the unique informationally efficient mechanism
 realizing fair allocations.   Copyright 1993 by The Econometric Society.

Title:   Adaptive Dynamics in Coordination Games. 
Journal: Econometrica

Issue: 1
Volume: 63
Year: 1995
Month:  January 
Abstract:
  A model of the process by which players learn to play repeated
 coordination games is proposed with the goal of understanding the results
 of recent experiments. In those experiments, the dynamics of subjects'
 strategy choices and the resulting patterns of discrimination among
 equilibria varied systematically with the rule for determining payoffs and
 the size of the interacting groups in ways that are not adequately
 explained by available methods of analysis. The model suggests a possible
 explanation by showing how the dispersion of subjects' beliefs interacts
 with the learning process to determine the probability distribution of its
 dynamics and limiting outcome.   Copyright 1995 by The Econometric Society.

Title:  Aggregation and Optimization with State-Dependent Pricing
Abstract: The literature on the aggregation of (S,s) policies has generally
	ignored the impact of aggregates on individual decisions.  In the case of
	pricing, the feedback effects are clear. Not only do pricing strategies
	determine the evolution of the price level, the evolution of the price level
	influences pricing strategies. The authors provide a consistent treatment of
	aggregation and optimization and study three issues in the pricing
	literature: the relationship between strategic complementarity and the real
	effects of money; the relationship between the variance of money and the
	correlation between money and output; and the relationship between the cost
	and size of price adjustment.

Title:  Estimating Labor Supply Responses Using Tax Reforms
Abstract: The 1980s tax reforms and the changing dispersion of wages offer one of
	the best opportunities yet to estimate labor supply effects.  Nevertheless,
	changing sample composition, aggregate shocks, the changing composition of
	the tax paying population, and discontinuities in the tax system create
	serious identification and estimation problems. The authors develop grouping
	estimators that address these issues.  Their results reveal positive and
	moderately sized wage elasticities. The authors also find negative income
	effects for women with children.

Title:   Regression with Nonstationary Volatility. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 1113-32
Issue: 5
Volume: 63
Year: 1995
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  A new asymptotic theory of regression is introduced for possibly
 nonstationary time series. The regressors are assumed to be generated by a
 linear process with martingale difference innovations. The conditional
 variances of these martingale differences are specified as autoregressive
 stochastic volatility processes with autoregressive roots that are local
 to unity. The author finds conditions under which the least squares
 estimates are consistent and asymptotically normal. A simple adaptive
 estimator is proposed which achieves the same asymptotic distribution as
 the generalized least squares estimator without requiring parameter
 assumptions for the stochastic volatility process.   Copyright 1995 by The Econometric Society.

Title:   Federal Fiscal Constitutions: Risk Sharing and Moral Hazard. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 623-46
Issue: 3
Volume: 64
Year: 1996
Month:  May 
Abstract:
  The authors study collective choice of fiscal policy in 'federations.'
 Local policy redistributes across individuals and affects the probability
 of local shocks. Federal policy shares international risk but may induce
 local governments to enact policies that increase local risk. The
 resulting trade-off between risk-sharing and moral hazard is different
 under alternative fiscal constitutions because the constitutions create
 different incentives for policymakers and voters and give rise to
 different political equilibria. The authors specifically contrast
 vertically ordered systems, like the European Community, with horizontally
 ordered systems, like the United States. Under appropriate institutions,
 centralization of functions and power can mitigate the moral hazard
 problem.   Copyright 1996 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Financial Intermediaries and Markets 
Abstract:
				 A complex financial system comprises both
 financial markets and financial intermediaries. We distinguish financial
 intermediaries according to whether they issue complete contingent
 contracts or incomplete contracts. Intermediaries such as banks that issue
 incomplete contracts, e.g., demand deposits, are subject to runs, but this
 does not imply a market failure. A sophisticated financial system-a system
 with complete markets for aggregate risk and limited market
 participation-is incentive-efficient, if the intermediaries issue complete
 contingent contracts, or else constrained-efficient, if they issue
 incomplete contracts. We argue that there may be a role for regulating
 liquidity provision in an economy in which markets for aggregate risks are
 incomplete. Copyright The Econometric Society 2004.

Title:   Volatility and Links between National Stock Markets. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 901-33
Issue: 4
Volume: 62
Year: 1994
Month:  July 
Abstract:
  The authors attempt to account for the covariances between stock markets
 and to assess their integration. They estimate a factor model for sixteen
 national stock market returns whose volatility is induced by changing
 volatility in the factors. Unanticipated returns depend on innovations in
 economic variables and 'unobservable' factors. Assets risk premia are
 linear combinations of the factors risk premia. The authors find that
 idiosyncratic risk is priced and the 'price of risk' is different across
 stock markets. Besides, only a small proportion of their covariances can
 be accounted for by 'observable' economic variables. Correlation changes
 are driven primarily by movements in 'unobservables.'	 Copyright 1994 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Implementation with Near-Complete Information 
Abstract:
	 Many refinements of Nash equilibrium yield solution
 correspondences that do not have closed graph in the space of payoffs or
 information. This has significance for implementation theory, especially
 under complete information. If a planner is concerned that all equilibria
 of his mechanism yield a desired outcome, and entertains the possibility
 that players may have even the slightest uncertainty about payoffs, then
 the planner should insist on a solution concept with closed graph. We show
 that this requirement entails substantial restrictions on the set of
 implementable social choice rules. In particular, when preferences are
 strict (or more generally, hedonic), while almost any social choice
 function can be implemented in undominated Nash equilibrium, only
 monotonic social choice functions can be implemented in the closure of the
 undominated Nash correspondence. Copyright Econometric Society, 2002.

Title:   Serial Cost Sharing. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 1009-37
Issue: 5
Volume: 60
Year: 1992
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  The authors consider the problem of cost sharing in the case of a fixed
 group of agents sharing a one input, one output technology with decreasing
 returns. They introduce and analyze the serial cost sharing method. Among
 agents endowed with convex and monotonic preferences, serial cost sharing
 is dominance solvable and its unique Nash equilibrium is also robust to
 coalitional deviations. The authors show that no other smooth cost sharing
 mechanism yields a unique Nash equilibrium at all preference profiles.   Copyright 1992 by The Econometric Society.

Abstract:
  This paper introduces an ARCH model (exponential ARCH) that (1) allows
 correlation between returns and volatility innovations (an important
 feature of stock market volatility changes), (2) eliminates the need for
 inequality constraints on parameters, and (3) allows for a straightforward
 interpretation of the "persistence" of shocks to volatility. In the above
 respects, it is an improvement over the widely-used GARCH model. The model
 is applied to study volatility changes and the risk premium on the CRSP

Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 113-44
Issue: 1
Volume: 58

Abstract:
  This paper considers estimation and hypothesis testing in linear time

 roots. The motivating example is a vector autoregression with some unit
 roots in the companion matrix, which might include polynomials in time as
 regressors. Parameters that can be written as coefficients on mean zero,
 nonintegrated regressors have jointly normal asymptotic distribution,
 converging at the rate of T(superscript "one-half") In general, the other
 coefficients (including the coefficient on polynomials in time), and
 associated t and F test statistics, have nonstandard asymptotic
 distributions.   Copyright 1990 by The Econometric Society.

Abstract:
  The authors consider the allocation of goods in exchange economies with a
 finite number of agents who may have private information about their
 preferences. They characterize the set of allocation rules that are
 compatible with individual incentives or, in other words, the set of
 strategy-proof social choice functions. Social choice functions that are
 strategy-proof are those that can be obtained from trading according to a
 finite number of prespecified proportions. The number of proportions that
 can be accommodated is proportional to the number of agents. Such rules
 are necessarily inefficient even in the limit as the economy grows.   Copyright 1995 by The Econometric Society.

Issue: 4
Volume: 55
Year: 1987
Month:  July 
Abstract:
  In an economy with one public and one private good,
 egalitarian-equivalent cost sharing consists of finding the highest public
 good level, x*, such that consuming x* for free yields a feasible utility
 distribution. The corresponding feasible allocation (typically unique),
 called egalitarian-equivalent, is in the core of the economy. Conversely,
 any cost sharing method satisfying Pareto optimality, cost monotonicity
 (nobody suffers a utility loss if the production technology improves upon,
 ceteris paribus), and individual rationality (no single-agent coalition
 objects) or no private transfers (no agent receives a positive amount of
 private good), must select an egalitarian-equivalent allocation in every
 economy.   Copyright 1987 by The Econometric Society.

Journal: Econometrica

Issue: 2
Volume: 55
Year: 1987
Month:  March 
Abstract:
  A generalization of the multinomial logit (MNL) model is developed for
 cases where discrete alternatives are ordered, by allowing stochastic
 correlation among alternatives in close proximity. The model belongs to
 the Generalized Extreme Value class and is therefore consistent with
 random utility maximization. An extension can handle cases where
 observations have been selected from a truncated choice set. A two-stage
 procedure using MNL computer software provides a specification test for
 MNL against the proposed model. Two empirical applications are briefly
 described.   Copyright 1987 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Envelope Theorems for Arbitrary Choice Sets 
Abstract:
 The standard envelope theorems apply to choice sets with convex and
 topological structure, providing sufficient conditions for the value
 function to be differentiable in a parameter and characterizing its
 derivative. This paper studies optimization with arbitrary choice sets and
 shows that the traditional envelope formula holds at any differentiability
 point of the value function. We also provide conditions for the value
 function to be, variously, absolutely continuous, left- and
 right-differentiable, or fully differentiable. These results are applied
 to mechanism design, convex programming, continuous optimization problems,
 saddle-point problems, problems with parameterized constraints, and
 optimal stopping problems. Copyright The Econometric Society 2002.

Title: Projection-Based Statistical Inference in Linear Structural Models with Possibly Weak Instruments 
Abstract:
				 It is well known that standard asymptotic
 theory is not applicable or is very unreliable in models with
 identification problems or weak instruments. One possible way out consists
 of using a variant of the Anderson-Rubin ((1949), AR) procedure. The
 latter allows one to build exact tests and confidence sets only for the
 full vector of the coefficients of the endogenous explanatory variables in
 a structural equation, but not for individual coefficients. This problem
 may in principle be overcome by using projection methods (Dufour (1997),
 Dufour and Jasiak (2001)). At first sight, however, this technique
 requires the application of costly numerical algorithms. In this paper, we
 give a general necessary and sufficient condition that allows one to check
 whether an AR-type confidence set is bounded. Furthermore, we provide an
 analytic solution to the problem of building projection-based confidence
 sets from AR-type confidence sets. The latter involves the geometric
 properties of "quadrics" and can be viewed as an extension of usual
 confidence intervals and ellipsoids. Only least squares techniques are
 needed to build the confidence intervals. Copyright The Econometric Society 2005.

Title:   Nonlinear Hypotheses, Inequality Restrictions, and Non-nested Hypotheses: Exact Simultaneous Tests in Linear Regressions. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 335-55
Issue: 2
Volume: 57
Year: 1989
Month:  March 
Abstract:
  In the classical linear model, comparison of two arbitrary hypotheses on
 the regression coefficients is considered. Problems involving nonlinear
 hypotheses, inequality restrictions, or non-nested hypotheses are
 included. Exact bounds on the null distribution of likelihood ratio
 statistics are derived (based on the central Fisher distribution). As a
 special case, a bounds test similar to the Durbin-Watson test is proposed.
 Multiple testing problems are studied: the bounds obtained for a single
 pair of hypotheses are shown to enjoy a simultaneity property that allows
 combination of any number of tests. This result extends to nonlinear
 hypotheses a well-known result given by H. Scheffe for linear hypotheses.
 A method of building bounds-induced tests is suggested.   Copyright 1989 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Structural Equations, Treatment Effects, and Econometric Policy Evaluation  					 
Abstract:
				 This paper uses the marginal treatment
 effect (MTE) to unify the nonparametric literature on treatment effects
 with the econometric literature on structural estimation using a
 nonparametric analog of a policy invariant parameter; to generate a
 variety of treatment effects from a common semiparametric functional form;
 to organize the literature on alternative estimators; and to explore what
 policy questions commonly used estimators in the treatment effect
 literature answer. A fundamental asymmetry intrinsic to the method of
 instrumental variables (IV) is noted. Recent advances in IV estimation
 allow for heterogeneity in responses but not in choices, and the method
 breaks down when both choice and response equations are heterogeneous in a
 general way. Copyright The Econometric Society 2005.

Title: The Optimality of a Simple Market Mechanism 
Abstract:
 Strategic behavior in a finite market can cause inefficiency in the
 allocation, and market mechanisms differ in how successfully they limit
 this inefficiency. A method for ranking algorithms in computer science is
 adapted here to rank market mechanisms according to how quickly
 inefficiency diminishes as the size of the market increases. It is shown
 that trade at a single market-clearing price in the "k"-double auction is
 "worst-case asymptotic optimal" among all plausible mechanisms: evaluating
 mechanisms in their least favorable trading environments for each possible
 size of the market, the "k"-double auction is shown to force the
 worst-case inefficiency to zero at the fastest possible rate. Copyright The Econometric Society 2002.

Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 1331-48
Issue: 6
Volume: 55
Year: 1987
Month:  November 
Abstract:
  Sequential equilibria comprise consistent beliefs and a sequentially ra
 tional strategy profile. Consistent beliefs are limits of Bayes ratio nal
 beliefs for sequences of strategies that approach the equilibrium
 strategy. Beliefs are structurally consistent if they are rationaliz ed by
 some single conjecture concerning opponents' strategies. Consis tent
 beliefs are not necessarily structurally consistent, notwithstan ding a
 claim by Kreps and Robert Wilson (1982). Moreover, the spirit of
 structural consistency conflicts with that of sequential rationali ty. One
 avoids these difficulties by weakening structural consistency to allow
 convex combinations of opponents' strategies, but this intr oduces
 correlation into the strategies that justify out-of-equilibriu m beliefs.   Copyright 1987 by The Econometric Society.

Month:  September 
Abstract:
  This paper utilizes asymptotic expansions of the Edgeworth type to
 investigate alternative forms of the Wald test of nonlinear restricti ons.
 Some formulae for the asymptotic expansion of the distribution of the Wald
 statistic are provided for a general case that should include most
 econometric applications. When specialized to the simple cases that have
 been studied recently in the literature, these formulae are found to
 explain rather well the discrepancies in sampling behavior that have been
 observed by other authors. It is further shown how the corrections
 delivered by Edgeworth expansions m ay be used to find transformations of
 the restrictions that accelerate covergence to the asymptotic
 distribution.	 Copyright 1988 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Bootstrap Unit Root Tests 
Abstract:
				 We consider the bootstrap unit root tests
 based on finite order autoregressive integrated models driven by iid
 innovations, with or without deterministic time trends. A general
 methodology is developed to approximate asymptotic distributions for the
 models driven by integrated time series, and used to obtain asymptotic
 expansions for the Dickey-Fuller unit root tests. The second-order terms
 in their expansions are of stochastic orders O(p)</sub>(n-super- - 1/4)
 and O(p)</sub>(n-super- - 1/2), and involve functionals of Brownian
 motions and normal random variates. The asymptotic expansions for the
 bootstrap tests are also derived and compared with those of the
 Dickey-Fuller tests. We show in particular that the bootstrap offers
 asymptotic refinements for the Dickey-Fuller tests, i.e., it corrects
 their second-order errors. More precisely, it is shown that the critical
 values obtained by the bootstrap resampling are correct up to the
 second-order terms, and the errors in rejection probabilities are of order
 o(n-super- - 1/2) if the tests are based upon the bootstrap critical
 values. Through simulations, we investigate how effective is the bootstrap
 correction in small samples.				       Copyright The Econometric Society 2003.

Month:  March 
Abstract:
  A stochastic differential formulation of recursive utility is given
 sufficient conditions for existence, uniqueness, time consistency,
 monotonicity, continuity, risk aversion, concavity, and other properties. 
 In the setting of Brownian information, recursive and intertemporal
 expected utility functions are observationally distinguishable. However,
 one cannot distinguish between a number of non-expected-utility theories
 of one-shot choice under uncertainty after they are suitably integrated
 into an intertemporal framework. In a "smooth" Markov setting, the
 stochastic differential utility model produces a generalization of the
 Hamilton-Bellman-Jacobi characterization of optimality. A companion paper
 explores the implications for asset prices.   Copyright 1992 by The Econometric Society.

  It seems inconsistent to model boundedly rational action choice by
 assuming that the agent chooses the optimal decision procedure. This
 criticism is not avoided by assuming that he chooses the optimal procedure
 to choose a procedure to . . . to choose an action. The author shows that,
 properly interpreted, this regress, continued transfinitely, generates a
 model representing the agent's perception of all his options, including
 every way to refine his perceptions. In this model, the agent surely must
 choose the perceived best option. Hence, it is not inconsistent to model
 limited rationality by assuming that the agent uses the "optimal" decision
 procedure.   Copyright 1991 by The Econometric Society.

Title: The Complexity of Forecast Testing 
Abstract:
				 Consider a weather forecaster predicting a
 probability of rain for the next day. We consider tests that, given a
 finite sequence of forecast predictions and outcomes, will either pass or
 fail the forecaster. Sandroni showed that any test which passes a
 forecaster who knows the distribution of nature can also be
 probabilistically passed by a forecaster with no knowledge of future
 events. We look at the computational complexity of such forecasters and
 exhibit a linear-time test and distribution of nature such that any
 forecaster without knowledge of the future who can fool the test must be
 able to solve computationally difficult problems. Thus, unlike Sandroni's
 work, a computationally efficient forecaster cannot always fool this test
 independently of nature. Copyright  2009 The Econometric Society.

Title: Bounds on Parameters in Panel Dynamic Discrete Choice Models 
Abstract:
				 Identification of dynamic nonlinear panel
 data models is an important and delicate problem in econometrics. In this
 paper we provide insights that shed light on the identification of
 parameters of some commonly used models. Using these insights, we are able
 to show through simple calculations that point identification often fails
 in these models. On the other hand, these calculations also suggest that
 the model restricts the parameter to lie in a region that is very small in
 many cases, and the failure of point identification may, therefore, be of
 little practical importance in those cases. Although the emphasis is on
 identification, our techniques are constructive in that they can easily
 form the basis for consistent estimates of the identified sets. Copyright The Econometric Society 2006.

Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 307-33
Issue: 2
Volume: 57
Year: 1989
Month:  March 
Abstract:
  Using the Kullback-Leibler information criterion to measure the closeness
 of a model to the truth, the author proposes new likelihood-ratio-based
 statistics for testing the null hypothesis that the competing models are
 as close to the true data generating process against the alternative
 hypothesis that one model is closer. The tests are directional and are
 derived for the cases where the competing models are non-nested,
 overlapping, or nested and whether both, one, or neither is misspecified.
 As a prerequisite, the author fully characterizes the asymptotic
 distribution of the likelihood ratio statistic under the most general
 conditions.   Copyright 1989 by The Econometric Society.

Title:   Some Exact Distribution Theory for Maximum Likelihood Estimators of Cointegrating Coefficients in Error Correction Models. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 73-93
Issue: 1
Volume: 62
Year: 1994
Month:  January 
Abstract:
  The author derives some exact finite sample disbibutions and
 characterizes the tail behavior of maximum likelihood estimators of the
 cointegrating coefficients in error correction models. The reduced rank
 regression estimator has a distribution with Cauchy-like tails and no
 finite moments of integer order. The maximum likelihood estimator of the
 coefficients in a particular triangular system representation has matrix
 t-distribution tails with finite integer moments to order T - n + r, where
 T is the sample size, n is the total number of variables, and r is the
 dimension of cointegration space. This helps explain some recent
 simulation studies where extreme outliers occur more frequently for the
 reduced rank regression estimator than for alternative asymptotically
 efficient procedures based on triangular representation.   Copyright 1994 by The Econometric Society.

Title: A Game-Theoretic View of the Fiscal Theory of the Price Level 
Abstract:
 The goal of this paper is to probe the validity of the fiscal theory of
 the price level by modelling explicitly the market structure in which
 households and the government make their decisions. I describe the economy
 as a game, and I am thus able to state precisely the consequences of
 actions that are out of the equilibrium path. I show that there exist
 government strategies that lead to a version of the fiscal theory, in
 which the price level is determined by fiscal variables alone. These
 strategies are however more complex than the simple budgetary rules
 usually associated with the fiscal theory, and the government budget
 constraint cannot be merely viewed as an equilibrium condition. Copyright The Econometric Society 2002.

Title:   Incomplete Contracts: Where Do We Stand?
Abstract:
  This paper takes stock of the advances and directions for research on the
  incomplete contracting front. It first illustrates some of the main ideas of
  the incomplete contract literature through an example. It then offers
  methodological insights on the standard approach to modeling incomplete
  contracts; in particular it discusses a tension between two assumptions made
  in the literature, namely rationality and the existence of transaction costs.
  Last, it argues that, contrary to what is commonly argued, the complete
  contract methodology need not be unable to account for standard institutions
  such as authority and ownership; and it concludes with a discussion of the
  research agenda.

Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 1067-84
Issue: 5
Volume: 64
Year: 1996
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  This paper develops procedures for inference about the moments of smooth
 functions of out-of-sample predictions and prediction errors when there is
 a long time series of predictions and realizations. The aim is to provide
 tools for analysis of predictive accuracy and efficiency and, more
 generally, of predictive ability. The paper allows for nonnested and
 nonlinear models as well as for possible dependence of predictions and
 prediction errors on estimated regression parameters. Simulations indicate
 that the procedures can work well in samples of size typically available.   Copyright 1996 by The Econometric Society.

Title:   Rational Expectations and the Aggregation of Diverse Information in Laboratory Security Markets. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 1085-1118
Issue: 5
Volume: 56
Year: 1988
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  The study explores the information aggregation properties of experimental
 markets. A fully-revealing rational expectations equilibrium exists in the
 competitive model of each of the markets studied. For markets with a
 single compound security in which traders have identical preferences, the
 rational expectations equilibrium mod el works well. However, if traders
 are allowed to have different preferences in the single security case, the
 observed information aggregation is minimal and rational expectations are
 not attained. If the single security is transformed to a complete set of
 Arrow-Debreu , state-contingent claims, the rational expectations model
 works well even when preferences differ.   Copyright 1988 by The Econometric Society.

Title:   Labor Force Dynamics of Older Men. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 117-56
Issue: 1
Volume: 62
Year: 1994
Month:  January 
Abstract:
  This paper analyzes movements of older men among labor force states using
 quarterly observations from the Retirement History Survey. These data
 indicate that the incidence of labor force movements at older ages has
 been underestimated previously. The quarterly data reveal a much sharper
 spike in the exit rate at exact age 65 than is found in annual or biannual
 data. Estimates of a model of labor force transitions indicate that social
 security benefits have strong effects on transition rates but that changes
 in social security benefits over time have not contributed much to the
 trend toward earlier labor force exit.   Copyright 1994 by The Econometric Society.

Title:   The Relation between Firm Growth and Q with Multiple Capital Goods: Theory and Evidence from Panel Data on Japanese Firms. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 731-53
Issue: 3
Volume: 59
Year: 1991
Month:  May 
Abstract:
  The authors derive, from a model of investment with multiple capital
 goods, a one-to-one relation between the growth rate of the capital
 aggregate and the stock-market-based Q. The authors estimate the growth-Q
 relation using a panel of Japanese manufacturing firms taking into account
 the endogeneity of Q. For early years of their sample, cash flow has
 significant explanatory power over and above Q. The estimated Q
 coefficient implies that the adjustment cost is less than a half of gross
 profits net of the adjustment costs.   Copyright 1991 by The Econometric Society.

Title: A Conditional Likelihood Ratio Test for Structural Models 
Abstract:
				 This paper develops a general method for
 constructing exactly similar tests based on the conditional distribution
 of nonpivotal statistics in a simultaneous equations model with normal
 errors and known reduced-form covariance matrix. These tests are shown to
 be similar under weak-instrument asymptotics when the reduced-form
 covariance matrix is estimated and the errors are non-normal. The
 conditional test based on the likelihood ratio statistic is particularly
 simple and has good power properties. Like the score test, it is optimal
 under the usual local-to-null asymptotics, but it has better power when
 identification is weak. Copyright The Econometric Society 2003.

Title:   Robust HPD Regions in Bayesian Regression Models. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 1581-89
Issue: 6
Volume: 59
Year: 1991
Month:  November 
Abstract:
  A Bayesian analysis of the linear regression model with only parts of the
 prior distribution specified or a robust Bayesian analysis lead to sets of
 posterior distributions. E. E.  Leamer (1978) describes the region of
 posterior means for conjugate priors and varying prior covariance
 matrices. As an extension to Bayesian confidence sets (HPD regions) the
 authors introduce the concept of HiFi (high fiduciary) regions. The Hifi
 region is a union of HPD regions and is a tool for describing the
 dependence of the posterior distribution on the prior covariance. The
 authors assume that the prior covariance matrix varies in an interval of
 matrices.   Copyright 1991 by The Econometric Society.

Title:   Sunspot Fluctuations around a Steady State: The Case of Multidimensional, One-Step Forward Looking Economic Models. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 1097-126
Issue: 5
Volume: 60
Year: 1992
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  The paper investigates the existence of stationary sunspot equilibria
 (SSE) in the vicinity of a steady state in a general, one-step forward
 looking economic model of dimension n. It is shown that, whenever the
 steady state is indeterminate, for the associated deterministic
 dynamics--i.e., there exists a continuum of perfect foresight paths
 converging to the steady state--then there exists a continuum of SSE of
 finite order in any neighborhood of the steady state. The proof relies
 upon bifurcation theory; it provides a characterization of the random
 processes for which SSE may appear and a description of the location of
 the support of the SSE close to the bifurcation. The results apply in
 particular to linear models.   Copyright 1992 by The Econometric Society.

Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 929-50
Issue: 4
Volume: 58
Year: 1990
Month:  July 
Abstract:
  The authors analyze a continuous time model with a Walrasian labor market
 and a random search retail market with prices set on a take-it or leave-it
 basis. The equilibrium distribution of money holdings is the asymptotic
 steady state of this stochastic process. There is a unique uniform price
 steady state equilibrium. The faster the search process the higher the
 absolute price, wage, and real wage. The instantaneous effect of an equal
 per capita infusion of money is to raise the price, wage, real wage, and
 transactions rate. The immediate post-infusion price and wage can
 overshoot their new asymptotic values.   Copyright 1990 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Jackknife and Analytical Bias Reduction for Nonlinear Panel Models 
Abstract:
				 Fixed effects estimators of panel models
 can be severely biased because of the well-known incidental parameters
 problem. We show that this bias can be reduced by using a panel jackknife
 or an analytical bias correction motivated by large T. We give bias
 corrections for averages over the fixed effects, as well as model
 parameters. We find large bias reductions from using these approaches in
 examples. We consider asymptotics where T grows with n, as an
 approximation to the properties of the estimators in econometric
 applications. We show that if T grows at the same rate as n, the fixed
 effects estimator is asymptotically biased, so that asymptotic confidence
 intervals are incorrect, but that they are correct for the panel
 jackknife. We show T growing faster than n-super-1/3 suffices for
 correctness of the analytic correction, a property we also conjecture for
 the jackknife. 			    Copyright The Econometric Society 2004.

Issue: 3
Volume: 58
Year: 1990
Month:  May 
Abstract:
  Alternating price competition between firms selling differentiated
 products to nonhomogeneous consumers can yield two different types of
 equilibria. One, which we call "disciplined," arises when products are
 close substitutes. Another, which we call "spontaneous," emerges when
 products are more differentiated. In disciplined equilibria, an implicit
 threat to cut price further, in response to an initial price cut, supports
 quite collusive outcomes, which become less collusive as product
 differentiation increases. In spontaneous equilibria, no such threat is
 needed. Consumers in the smaller market tend to pay a higher price, as do
 consumers served by the more efficient firm.   Copyright 1990 by The Econometric Society.

Title:   Signalling with Many Signals. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 663-74
Issue: 3
Volume: 55
Year: 1987
Month:  May 
Abstract:
  This paper examines a market with asymmetric information where there are
 many signals available and where both the costs of signaling and the
 product value may depend on many privately known characteristics. Under a
 weak condition on the relationship between the marginal cost of increasing
 the signals and the product value, a separating set exists whereby the
 value of every seller's product is inferred from the seller's optimal
 choice of signals. The separating set constructed is Pareto dominant and
 corresponds to recently proposed equilibrium notions in signaling and
 screening models.   Copyright 1987 by The Econometric Society.

Title: The Consumer Gains from Direct Broadcast Satellites and the Competition with Cable TV 
Abstract:
				 This paper examines direct broadcast
 satellites (DBS) as a competitor to cable. We first estimate a structural
 consumer level demand system for satellite, basic cable, premium cable and
 local antenna using micro data on almost				   
    <formula format="inline">						   
 <simplemath>30 							
 <roman>,</roman>000						
 </simplemath>					 </formula> households in
 317 markets, including extensive controls for unobserved product quality
 and allowing the distribution of unobserved tastes to follow a fully
 flexible multivariate normal distribution. The estimated elasticity of
 expanded basic is about					   <formula
 format="inline">					       
 <simplemath>-1 							
 <roman>.</roman>5						
 </simplemath>					 </formula>, with the
 demand for premium cable and DBS more elastic. The results identify strong
 correlations in the taste for different products not captured in
 conventional logit models. Estimates of the supply response of cable
 suggest that without DBS entry cable prices would be about 15 percent
 higher and cable quality would fall. We find a welfare gain of between
 $127 and $190 per year (aggregate $2.5 billion) for satellite buyers, and
 about $50 (aggregate $3 billion) for cable subscribers.		     Copyright The Econometric Society 2004.

Title: On the Limits of Communication in Multidimensional Cheap Talk: A Comment 
Abstract:
				 We analyze a cheap talk game, à la
 Crawford and Sobel, in a multidimensional state and policy space. A
 feature of the multidimensional state space is that communication on one
 dimension often reveals information on others. We show how this feature
 imposes bounds on communication. Copyright The Econometric Society 2007.

Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 911-22
Issue: 4
Volume: 55
Year: 1987
Month:  July 
Abstract:
  A partly analytical, partly computational approach is used to study mixed
 strategy equilibria of Hotelling's model of sp atial competition in which
 each of two firms chooses a location in a line segment and a price. There
 is a unique (up to symmetry) subgame perfect equilibrium in which the
 locations choices are pure. In it, t he locations are close to the
 quartiles of the market, and the suppor t of the equilibrium mixed-price
 strategy of each firm is the union o f two short intervals. There is also
 a subgame perfect equilibrium in which the firms randomize over locations.    Copyright 1987 by The Econometric Society.

Title:   Strategic Considerations in Invention and Innovation; The Case of Natural Resources Revisited. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 841-49
Issue: 4
Volume: 56
Year: 1988
Month:  July 
Abstract:
  If a resource importing country can commit to the future development of a
 backstop tec hnology, such a development program can be used strategically
 to affe ct the pricing policy of a resource supplier. Previous studies
 have r evealed the interesting possibility that by delaying development of
 t he substitute, the importing country could benefit from a favorable p
 roduction response on the part of the exporting country. This paper d
 emonstrates that this effect can indeed occur, but the set of paramet ers
 for which it does occur is smaller than previously realized. The intuition
 behind this effect is further developed.   Copyright 1988 by The Econometric Society.

Journal: Econometrica

Year: 1993
Month:  January 
Abstract:
  Several types of rationing and queue mechanisms are compared in a
 framework of general equilibrium type models under gross substitutability
 and normality assumptions about consumers' Walrasian demand. During
 transition from rationing and queues to a market system, a group of low
 income people loses. The transition involves larger losses for this group
 if black markets prevail under rationing or queues, while a group of high
 income consumers gains. Some other comparative statics results are
 developed for a queue model with black markets.   Copyright 1993 by The Econometric Society.

Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 937-69
Issue: 4
Volume: 57
Year: 1989
Month:  July 
Abstract:
  This paper develops a class of recursive, but not necessarily expected
 utility, preferences over intertemporal consumption lotteries. An
 important feature of these general preferences is that they permit risk
 attitudes to be disentangled from the degree of intertemporal
 substitutability. Moreover, in an infinite horizon, representative-agent
 context, these preference specifications lead to a model of asset returns
 in which appropriate versions of both the atemporal CAPM and the
 intertemporal consumption CAPM are nested as special cases. In the
 authors' general model, systematic risk of an asset is determined by
 covariance with both the return to the market portfolio and consumption
 growth.   Copyright 1989 by The Econometric Society.

Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 877-88

Volume: 60
Year: 1992
Month:  July 
Abstract:
  Suppose two agents play a game, each using a computable algorithm to
 decide what to do, these algorithms being common knowledge. The author
 shows that it is possible to act rationally provided he limits his
 attention to a natural subset of solvable games and to opponents who use
 rational algorithms; the outcome is a Nash equilibrium. Going further, the
 author shows that rationality is possible on many domains of games and
 opposing algorithms but each domain requires a particular solution
 algorithm; no one algorithm is rational on all possible domains.   Copyright 1992 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Estimation of Average Treatment Effects with Misclassification 
Abstract:
				 This paper considers identification and
 estimation of the effect of a mismeasured binary regressor in a
 nonparametric or semiparametric regression, or the conditional average
 effect of a binary treatment or policy on some outcome where treatment may
 be misclassified. Failure to account for misclassification is shown to
 result in attenuation bias in the estimated treatment effect. An
 identifying assumption that overcomes this bias is the existence of an
 instrument for the binary regressor that is conditionally independent of
 the treatment effect. A discrete instrument suffices for nonparametric
 identification. Copyright The Econometric Society 2007.

Title:   Asymptotic Properties of Least Squares Estimators of Cointegrating Vectors. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 1035-56
Issue: 5
Volume: 55
Year: 1987
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  Time series variables that stochastically trend together form a
 cointegrated system. OLS and NLS estimators of the parameters of a
 cointegrating vector are shown to converge in probability to the true
 parameter value at the rate T11d for any positive d. These estim mators
 can be written asymptotically in terms of relatively simple nonnormal
 random matrices which do not depend on the parameters of th e system.
 These asymptotic representations form the basis for simple and fast Monte
 Carlo calculations of the limiting distributions of th ese estimators.
 Asymptotic distributions thus computed are tabulated for several
 cointegrated processes.   Copyright 1987 by The Econometric Society.

Title: The Affiliation Effect in First-Price Auctions 
Abstract:
				 We study the monotonicity of the
 equilibrium bid with respect to the number of bidders n in affiliated
 private-value models of first-price sealed-bid auctions and prove the
 existence of a large class of such models in which the equilibrium bid
 function is not increasing in n. We moreover decompose the effect of a
 change in n on the bid level into a competition effect and an affiliation
 effect. The latter suggests to the winner of the auction that competition
 is less intense than she had thought before the auction. Since the
 affiliation effect can occur in both private- and common-value models, a
 negative relationship between the bid level and n does not allow one to
 distinguish between the two models and is also not necessarily (only) due
 to bidders taking account of the winner's curse.			     Copyright The Econometric Society 2005.

Title:   Nonlinear Regressions with Integrated Time Series. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 117-61
Issue: 1
Volume: 69
Year: 2001
Month:  January 
Abstract:
  An asymptotic theory is developed for nonlinear regression with
 integrated processes. The models allow for nonlinear effects from unit
 root time series and therefore deal with the case of parametric nonlinear
 cointegration. The theory covers integrable and asymptotically homogeneous
 functions. Sufficient conditions for weak consistency are given and a
 limit distribution theory is provided. The rates of convergence depend on
 the properties of the nonlinear regression function, and are shown to be
 as slow as n[superscript 1/4] for integrable functions, and to be
 generally polynomial in n[superscript 1/2] for homogeneous functions. For
 regressions with integrable functions, the limiting distribution theory is
 mixed normal with mixing variates that depend on the sojourn time of the
 limiting Brownian motion of the integrated process.

Title: Money in Search Equilibrium, in Competitive Equilibrium, and in Competitive Search Equilibrium 
Abstract:
				 We compare three market structures for
 monetary economies: bargaining (search equilibrium); price taking
 (competitive equilibrium); and price posting (competitive search
 equilibrium). We also extend work on the microfoundations of money by
 allowing a general matching technology and entry. We study how equilibrium
 and the effects of policy depend on market structure. Under bargaining,
 trade and entry are both inefficient, and inflation implies first-order
 welfare losses. Under price taking, the Friedman rule solves the first
 inefficiency but not the second, and inflation may actually improve
 welfare. Under posting, the Friedman rule yields the first best, and
 inflation implies second-order welfare losses. Copyright The Econometric Society 2005.

Title: Twicing Kernels and a Small Bias Property of Semiparametric Estimators 
Abstract:
				 The purpose of this note is to show how
 semiparametric estimators with a small bias property can be constructed.
 The small bias property (SBP) of a semiparametric estimator is that its
 bias converges to zero faster than the pointwise and integrated bias of
 the nonparametric estimator on which it is based. We show that
 semiparametric estimators based on twicing kernels have the SBP. We also
 show that semiparametric estimators where nonparametric kernel estimation
 does not affect the asymptotic variance have the SBP. In addition we
 discuss an interpretation of series and sieve estimators as idempotent
 transformations of the empirical distribution that helps explain the known
 result that they lead to the SBP. In Monte Carlo experiments we find that
 estimators with the SBP have mean-square error that is smaller and less
 sensitive to bandwidth than those that do not have the SBP. Copyright The Econometric Society 2004.

Title: Measuring Expectations 
Abstract:
				 To predict choice behavior, the standard
 practice of economists has been to infer decision processes from data on
 observed choices. When decision makers act with partial information,
 economists typically assume that persons form probabilistic expectations
 for unknown quantities and maximize expected utility. Observed choices may
 be consistent with many alternative specifications of preferences and
 expectations, so researchers commonly assume particular sorts of
 expectations. It would be better to measure expectations in the form
 called for by modern economic theory; that is, subjective probabilities.
 Data on expectations can be used to relax or validate assumptions about
 expectations. Since the early 1990's, economists have increasingly
 undertaken to elicit from survey respondents probabilistic expectations of
 significant personal events. This article discusses the history underlying
 the new literature, describes some of what has been learned thus far, and
 looks ahead towards making further progress. Copyright The Econometric Society 2004.

Title:   Aggregation and Linearity in the Provision of Intertemporal Incentives. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 303-28
Issue: 2
Volume: 55
Year: 1987
Month:  March 
Abstract:
  The authors develop two themes in the theory of incentive schemes. First,
 one need not always use all of the information available in an optimal
 incentive contract. Accounting information, which aggregates performance
 over time, is sufficient for optimal compensation schemes in certain
 classes of environments. Second, optimal rules in a rich environment must
 work well in a range of circumstances and cannot, therefore, be
 complicated functions of the observed outcome. The authors illustrate
 these ideas in a particular model where the agent has a rich space of
 controls, showing that the unique optimal compensation scheme is a linear
 function of profits.   Copyright 1987 by The Econometric Society.

Title:   Bayesian Inference in Econometric Models Using Monte Carlo Integration. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 1317-39
Issue: 6
Volume: 57
Year: 1989
Month:  November 
Abstract:
  Methods for the systematic application of Monte Carlo integration with
 importance sampling to Bayesian inference are developed. Conditions under
 which the numerical approximation converges almost surely to the true
 value with the number of Monte Carlo replications, and its numerical
 accuracy may be assessed reliably, are given. Importance sampling
 densities are derived from multivariate normal or student approximations
 to the posterior density. These densities are modified by automatic
 rescaling along each axis. The concept of relative numerical efficiency is
 introduced to evaluate the adequacy of a chosen importance sampling
 density. Applications in two illustrative models are presented.   Copyright 1989 by The Econometric Society.

Title:   On the Definition of the Strategic Stability of Equilibria. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 1365-90
Issue: 6
Volume: 58
Year: 1990
Month:  November 
Abstract:
  A new definition of strategic stability is shown to satisfy all of the
 requirements given by Elon Kohlberg and Jean-Francois Mertens (1986).	The
 definition follows the general form of the original definition of Kohlberg
 and Mertens, but, rather than working with perturbations of the payoffs or
 strategy space, works directly with perturbations to the best reply
 correspondence. With the appropriate topology on this space of
 perturbations, the resulting definition does satisfy all of the
 requirements given by Kohlberg and Mertens. It is shown that one does not
 have much freedom in the topology one uses.   Copyright 1990 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Optimal Inference in Regression Models with Nearly Integrated Regressors 
Abstract:
				 This paper considers the problem of
 conducting inference on the regression coefficient in a bivariate
 regression model with a highly persistent regressor. Gaussian asymptotic
 power envelopes are obtained for a class of testing procedures that
 satisfy a conditionality restriction. In addition, the paper proposes
 testing procedures that attain these power envelopes whether or not the
 innovations of the regression model are normally distributed. Copyright The Econometric Society 2006.

Title:   Evolutionary Games in Economics. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 637-66
Issue: 3
Volume: 59
Year: 1991
Month:  May 
Abstract:
  Evolutionary games are introduced as models for repeated anonymous
 strategic interaction: actions (or behaviors) which are more "fit," given
 the current distribution of behaviors, tend over time to displace less fit
 behaviors. Cone fields characterize the continuous-time processes
 compatible with a given fitness (or payoff) function. For large classes of
 dynamics, it is shown that all stable steady states are Nash equilibria
 and that all Nash equilibria are steady states. The biologists'
 evolutionarily stable strategy condition is shown to be less closely
 related to the dynamic equilibria. Economic examples and a literature
 survey are also provided.   Copyright 1991 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Efficient Wald Tests for Fractional Unit Roots 
Abstract:
				 In this article we introduce efficient
 Wald tests for testing the null hypothesis of the unit root against the
 alternative of the fractional unit root. In a local alternative framework,
 the proposed tests are locally asymptotically equivalent to the optimal
 Robinson Lagrange multiplier tests. Our results contrast with the tests
 for fractional unit roots, introduced by Dolado, Gonzalo, and Mayoral,
 which are inefficient. In the presence of short range serial correlation,
 we propose a simple and efficient two-step test that avoids the estimation
 of a nonlinear regression model. In addition, the first-order asymptotic
 properties of the proposed tests are not affected by the preestimation of
 short or long memory parameters. Copyright The Econometric Society 2007.

Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 891-951
Issue: 4
Volume: 63
Year: 1995
Month:  July 
Abstract:
  This paper develops and estimates a model of the U.S. automobile
 industry. On the demand side, a discrete choice model is adopted, which is
 estimated using micro data from the Consumer Expenditure Survey. The
 estimation results are used in conjunction with population weights to
 derive aggregate demand. On the supply side, the automobile industry is
 modeled as an oligopoly with product differentiation. Equilibrium is
 characterized by the first-order conditions of the profit-maximizing
 firms. The estimation results are used in counterfactual simulations to
 investigate two trade policy issues: the effects of the voluntary export
 restraint, and exchange rate pass-through.   Copyright 1995 by The Econometric Society.

 covariance matrices are considered. In the nondiagonal case, the analogue
 of the simple errors-in-variable interval of estimates is an ellipsoid
 with diagonal equal to the line segment connecting t he direct least
 squares with a two-stage least-squares estimate. For the diagonal case,
 the set of estimates under some conditions must li e within the convex
 hull of 2k points.   Copyright 1987 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Optimal Auction with Resale 
Abstract:
 This paper investigates the design of seller-optimal auctions when winning
 bidders can attempt to resell the good. In that case, the optimal
 allocation characterized by Myerson (1981) cannot be achieved without
 resale. I find a sufficient and necessary condition for sincere bidding
 given the possibility of resale. In two-bidder cases, I prove that the
 Myerson allocation can be achieved under standard conditions supplemented
 with two assumptions. With three or more bidders, achieving the Myerson
 allocation is more difficult. I prove that it can be implemented in
 special cases. In those cases, the Myerson allocation is generated through
 a sequence of resale auctions, each optimally chosen by a reseller. Copyright The Econometric Society 2002.

Title: Using Asset Prices to Measure the Persistence of the Marginal Utility of Wealth 
Abstract:
				 We derive a lower bound for the volatility
 of the permanent component of investors' marginal utility of wealth or,
 more generally, asset pricing kernels. The bound is based on return
 properties of long-term zero-coupon bonds, risk-free bonds, and other
 risky securities. We find the permanent component of the pricing kernel to
 be very volatile; its volatility is about at least as large as the
 volatility of the stochastic discount factor. A related measure for the
 transitory component suggest it to be considerably less important. We also
 show that, for many cases where the pricing kernel is a function of
 consumption, innovations to consumption need to have permanent effects. Copyright The Econometric Society 2005.

Title:   Sufficient Conditions for Inessentiality. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 613-27
Issue: 3
Volume: 61
Year: 1993
Month:  May 
Abstract:
  Three theorems state conditions sufficient for the inessentiality of
 equilibrium in a pure exchange, sequence economy. The agents have uncommon
 priors, state-contingent utility functions, and asymmetric information in
 every trading period, and they trade different sets of event-contingent
 claims in different periods. The theorems provide alternative
 interpretations of the concept of market completeness, reveal two
 fundamentally different ways to obtain inessentiality, and shed light on
 the conditions permitting speculation and the role of price-contingent
 trading. None of the theorems requires ex ante Pareto optimality or the
 absence of arbitrage opportunities.   Copyright 1993 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Cursed Equilibrium 
Abstract:
				 There is evidence that people do not fully
 take into account how other people's actions depend on these other
 people's information. This paper defines and applies a new equilibrium
 concept in games with private information, cursed equilibrium, which
 assumes that each player correctly predicts the distribution of other
 players' actions, but underestimates the degree to which these actions are
 correlated with other players' information. We apply the concept to
 common-values auctions, where cursed equilibrium captures the widely
 observed phenomenon of the winner's curse, and to bilateral trade, where
 cursedness predicts trade in adverse-selections settings for which
 conventional analysis predicts no trade. We also apply cursed equilibrium
 to voting and signalling models. We test a single-parameter variant of our
 model that embeds Bayesian Nash equilibrium as a special case and find
 that parameter values that correspond to cursedness fit a broad range of
 experimental datasets better than the parameter value that corresponds to
 Bayesian Nash equilibrium.				   Copyright The Econometric Society 2005.

Title: Adaptive Local Polynomial Whittle Estimation of Long-range Dependence 
Abstract:
				 The local Whittle (or Gaussian
 semiparametric) estimator of long range dependence, proposed by Künsch
 (1987) and analyzed by Robinson (1995a), has a relatively slow rate of
 convergence and a finite sample bias that can be large. In this paper, we
 generalize the local Whittle estimator to circumvent these problems.
 Instead of approximating the short-run component of the spectrum,	   
				  <formula format="inline">		   
			       <simplemath>&phiv;(&lambda;)</simplemath>   
				    </formula>, by a constant in a
 shrinking neighborhood of frequency zero, we approximate its logarithm by
 a polynomial. This leads to a "local polynomial Whittle" (LPW) estimator.
 We specify a data-dependent adaptive procedure that adjusts the degree of
 the polynomial to the smoothness of					   
 <formula format="inline">						
 <simplemath>&phiv;(&lambda;)</simplemath>				   
      </formula> at zero and selects the bandwidth. The resulting "adaptive
 LPW" estimator is shown to achieve the optimal rate of convergence, which
 depends on the smoothness of					 <formula
 format="inline">					       
 <simplemath>&phiv;(&lambda;)</simplemath>				   
      </formula> at zero, up to a logarithmic factor.			     Copyright The Econometric Society 2004.

Title: Optimal Two-Sided Invariant Similar Tests for Instrumental Variables Regression 
Abstract:
				 This paper considers tests of the
 parameter on an endogenous variable in an instrumental variables
 regression model. The focus is on determining tests that have some optimal
 power properties. We start by considering a model with normally
 distributed errors and known error covariance matrix. We consider tests
 that are similar and satisfy a natural rotational invariance condition. We
 determine a two-sided power envelope for invariant similar tests. This
 allows us to assess and compare the power properties of tests such as the
 conditional likelihood ratio (CLR), the Lagrange multiplier, and the
 Anderson-Rubin tests. We find that the CLR test is quite close to being
 uniformly most powerful invariant among a class of two-sided tests. Copyright The Econometric Society 2006.

Title: On the Global Convergence of Stochastic Fictitious Play 
Abstract:
 We establish global convergence results for stochastic fictitious play for
 four classes of games: games with an interior ESS, zero sum games,
 potential games, and supermodular games. We do so by appealing to
 techniques from stochastic approximation theory, which relate the limit
 behavior of a stochastic process to the limit behavior of a differential
 equation defined by the expected motion of the process. The key result in
 our analysis of supermodular games is that the relevant differential
 equation defines a strongly monotone dynamical system. Our analyses of the
 other cases combine Lyapunov function arguments with a discrete choice
 theory result: that the choice probabilities generated by any additive
 random utility model can be derived from a deterministic model based on
 payoff perturbations that depend nonlinearly on the vector of choice
 probabilities. Copyright The Econometric Society 2002.

Journal: Econometrica

Issue: 4
Volume: 62

Month:  July 
Abstract:
  A noncooperative implementation of the core is provided for games with
 transferable utility. The implementation obtained here is meant to reflect
 the standard motivation for the core as closely as possible. In the model
 proposed, time is continuous. This idealized treatment of time is most
 amenable for capturing an essential feature of the core--there is always
 time to reject a noncore proposal before it is consumated.   Copyright 1994 by The Econometric Society.

Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 123-38
Issue: 1
Volume: 59
Year: 1991
Month:  January 
Abstract:
  Examples of well-behaved sequences of economies, without monotonic
 preferences, are constructed. These economies have core allocations that
 cannot be decentralized by prices, even in a weak sense. Relaxing the
 monotonicity assumption results in core allocations that are not uniformly
 integrable, breaking the connection between the continuum and the large
 finite model. If, in addition, preferences are nonconvex, even uniformly
 bounded core allocations may fail to converge in a well sense. Sufficient
 conditions to restore convergence are provided.   Copyright 1991 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Finite Mixture Distributions, Sequential Likelihood and the EM Algorithm 
Abstract:
	 A popular way to account for unobserved heterogeneity is to assume
 that the data are drawn from a finite mixture distribution. A barrier to
 using finite mixture models is that parameters that could previously be
 estimated in stages must now be estimated jointly: using mixture
 distributions destroys any additive separability of the log-likelihood
 function. We show, however, that an extension of the EM algorithm
 reintroduces additive separability, thus allowing one to estimate
 parameters sequentially during each maximization step. In establishing
 this result, we develop a broad class of estimators for mixture models.
 Returning to the likelihood problem, we show that, relative to full
 information maximum likelihood, our sequential estimator can generate
 large computational savings with little loss of efficiency. Copyright Econometric Society, 2002.

Title: Uncertainty and Learning in Pharmaceutical Demand 
Abstract:
				 Exploiting a rich panel data set on
 anti-ulcer drug prescriptions, we measure the effects of uncertainty and
 learning in the demand for pharmaceutical drugs. We estimate a dynamic
 matching model of demand under uncertainty in which patients learn from
 prescription experience about the effectiveness of alternative drugs.
 Unlike previous models, we allow drugs to have distinct symptomatic and
 curative effects, and endogenize treatment length by allowing drug choices
 to affect patients' underlying probability of recovery. We find that
 drugs' rankings along these dimensions differ, with high symptomatic
 effects for drugs with the highest market shares and high curative effects
 for drugs with the greatest medical efficacy. Our results also indicate
 that while there is substantial heterogeneity in drug efficacy across
 patients, learning enables patients and their doctors to dramatically
 reduce the costs of uncertainty in pharmaceutical markets. Copyright The Econometric Society 2005.

Title:   Subjective Probability and Expected Utility without Additivity. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 571-87
Issue: 3
Volume: 57
Year: 1989
Month:  May 
Abstract:
  An act maps states of nature to outcomes: deterministic outcomes, as well
 as random outcomes, are included. Two acts f and g are comonotonic, by
 definition, if it never happens that f(s) > f(t) and g(t) > g(s) for some
 states of nature s and t. An axiom of comonotonic independence is
 introduced here. It weakens the von Neumann-Morgenstern axiom of
 independence as follows: If f > g and if f, g and h are comonotonic then
 $f + (1 - $)h > $g + (1 - $)h. If a nondegenerate, continuous, and
 monotonic (state independent) weak order over acts satisfies comonotonic
 independence, then it induces a unique non-(necessarily-) additive
 probability and a von Neumann-Morgenstern utility. Furthermore, one can
 compute the expected utility of an act with respect to the nonadditive
 probability, using the Choquet integral. This extension of the expected
 utility theory covers situations, such as the Ellsberg paradox, which are
 inconsistent with additive expected utility. The concept of uncertainty
 aversion and interpretation of comonotonic independence in the context of
 social welfare functions are included.   Copyright 1989 by The Econometric Society.

Title:   Invariance, Nonlinear Models, and Asymptotic Tests. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 1601-15
Issue: 6
Volume: 59
Year: 1991
Month:  November 
Abstract:
  The invariance properties of several asymptotic tests are studied:
 invariance to hypothesis representation, reparameterization, and
 rescaling. Noninvariant tests include Wald tests, variants of LM tests,
 and Neyman's C(" alpha") tests. For all these tests, simply changing
 measurement units can lead to vastly different results, e.g. in models
 with Box-Cox transformations. Various consistent estimators of the
 information matrix produce tests with different invariance properties.
 Sufficient conditions are established under which a generalized C("
 alpha") test becomes invariant to hypothesis reformulations,
 reparameterizations, and rescaling. In many practical cases, invariant C("
 alpha") tests are much cheaper to compute than other invariant tests
 (e.g., LR tests).   Copyright 1991 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Characterization of Revenue Equivalence 
Abstract:
				 The property of an allocation rule to be
 implementable in dominant strategies by a unique payment scheme is called
 revenue equivalence. We give a characterization of revenue equivalence
 based on a graph theoretic interpretation of the incentive compatibility
 constraints. The characterization holds for any (possibly infinite)
 outcome space and many of the known results are immediate consequences.
 Moreover, revenue equivalence can be identified in cases where existing
 theorems are silent.				   Copyright  2009 The Econometric Society.

Title:   Asymmetric Least Squares Estimation and Testing. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 819-47
Issue: 4
Volume: 55
Year: 1987
Month:  July 
Abstract:
  This paper considers estimation and testing using location measures for
 regression m odels that are based on an asymmetric least-squares criterion
 functio n. These estimators have properties that are analogous to
 regression quantiles, but are easier to calculate, as are the
 corresponding test statistics. Asymmetric least-squares tests of
 homoskedasticity and s ymmetry compare quite favorably with other tests of
 these hypotheses in terms of asymptotic relative efficiency. Consequently,
 asymmetric least-squares estimation provides a convenient and relatively
 efficie nt method of characterizing the conditional distributi on of a
 dependent variable given some regressors.   Copyright 1987 by The Econometric Society.

Title:  Exact Inference Methods for First-Order Autoregressive Distributed Lag Models
Abstract: Exact tests and confidence sets are obtained for general
	transformations of the coefficients in linear first-order autoregressive
	models with exogenous variables and i.i.d. disturbances. The tests proposed
	have known level and are either similar (constant rejection probability under
	all processes consistent with the null hypothesis) or use bounds which are
	free of nuisance parameters. Correspondingly, the confidence sets are either
	similar with known size or conservative. These exact methods are
	asymptotically valid under weak regularity conditions. Their usefulness is
	illustrated by power comparisons and by applications to a dynamic trend model
	of money velocity and a model of money demand.

Title: Market Entry Costs, Producer Heterogeneity, and Export Dynamics 
Abstract:
				 As the exchange rate, foreign demand, and
 production costs evolve, domestic producers are continually faced with two
 choices: whether to be an exporter and, if so, how much to export. We
 develop a dynamic structural model of export supply that characterizes
 these two decisions. The model embodies plant-level heterogeneity in
 export profits, uncertainty about the determinants of future profits, and
 market entry costs for new exporters. Using a Bayesian Monte Carlo Markov
 chain estimator, we fit this model to plant-level panel data on three
 Colombian manufacturing industries. We obtain profit function and sunk
 entry cost coefficients, and use them to simulate export responses to
 shifts in the exchange-rate process and several types of export subsidies.
 In each case, the aggregate export response depends on entry costs,
 expectations about the exchange rate process, prior exporting experience,
 and producer heterogeneity. Export revenue subsidies are far more
 effective at stimulating exports than policies that subsidize entry costs. Copyright The Econometric Society 2007.

Abstract:
  This paper investigates stability properties of evolutionary selection
 dynamics in normal-form games. The analysis is focused on deterministic
 dynamics in continuous time and on asymptotic stability of sets of
 population states, more precisely of faces of the mixed-strategy space.
 The main result is a characterization of those faces that are
 asymptotically stable in all dynamics from a certain class, and the
 authors show that every such face contains an essential component of the
 set of Nash equilibria and, hence, a strategically stable set in the sense
 of E. Kohlberg and J. F. Mertens (1986).   Copyright 1995 by The Econometric Society.

Title: LAG Length Selection and the Construction of Unit Root Tests with Good Size and Power 
Abstract:
 It is widely known that when there are errors with a moving-average root
 close to  - 1, a high order augmented autoregression is necessary for unit
 root tests to have good size, but that information criteria such as the
 "AIC" and the "BIC" tend to select a truncation lag ("k") that is very
 small. We consider a class of Modified Information Criteria ("MIC") with a
 penalty factor that is sample dependent. It takes into account the fact
 that the bias in the sum of the autoregressive coefficients is highly
 dependent on "k" and adapts to the type of deterministic components
 present. We use a local asymptotic framework in which the moving-average
 root is local to  - 1 to document how the "MIC" performs better in
 selecting appropriate values of "k". In Monte-Carlo experiments, the "MIC"
 is found to yield huge size improvements to the "DF-super-GLS" and the
 feasible point optimal "P-sub-T" test developed in Elliott, Rothenberg,
 and Stock (1996). We also extend the "M" tests developed in Perron and Ng
 (1996) to allow for "GLS" detrending of the data. The "MIC" along with
 "GLS" detrended data yield a set of tests with desirable size and power
 properties. Copyright The Econometric Society.

Title: GMM, GEL, Serial Correlation, and Asymptotic Bias 
Abstract:
				 For stationary time series models with
 serial correlation, we consider generalized method of moments (GMM)
 estimators that use heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation consistent
 (HAC) positive definite weight matrices and generalized empirical
 likelihood (GEL) estimators based on smoothed moment conditions. Following
 the analysis of Newey and Smith (2004) for independent observations, we
 derive second order asymptotic biases of these estimators. The inspection
 of bias expressions reveals that the use of smoothed GEL, in contrast to
 GMM, removes the bias component associated with the correlation between
 the moment function and its derivative, while the bias component
 associated with third moments depends on the employed kernel function. We
 also analyze the case of no serial correlation, and find that the
 seemingly unnecessary smoothing and HAC estimation can reduce the bias for
 some of the estimators. Copyright The Econometric Society 2005.

Title:  Estimating the Labor Market Impact of Voluntary Military Service Using Social Security Data on Military Applicants
Abstract: Effects of military service on veterans' earnings are estimated using
	Social Security administrative records to fit models with heterogeneous
	potential outcomes. The first estimation strategy uses matching and
	regression to compare applicants who enlisted with applicants who did not
	enlist. The second uses instrumental variables generated by an error in
	military entrance exams.  The empirical results suggest that military service
	led to higher employment rates for veterans. But in spite of this employment
	gain, voluntary military service led to only a modest increase in the
	civilian earnings of nonwhite veterans while actually reducing the civilian
	earnings of white veterans.

Journal: Econometrica

Volume: 56
Year: 1988
Month:  January 
Abstract:
  A standard efficient markets model states that a stock price equals the
 expected present discounted valu e of its dividends, with a constant
 discount rate. This is shown to i mply that the variance of the innovation
 in the stock price is smalle r than that of a stock-price forecast made
 from a subset of the marke t's information set. The implication follows
 even if prices and divid ends require differencing to induce stationarity.
 The relation betwee n the variances appears not to hold for some annual
 U.S. stock-market data. The rejection of the model is both quantitatively
 and statisti cally significant.   Copyright 1988 by The Econometric Society.

Title:   Moral Hazard and Verifiability: The Effects of Renegotiation in Agency. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 1735-53
Issue: 6
Volume: 59
Year: 1991
Month:  November 
Abstract:
  The authors examine the effects of renegotiation in an agency
 relationship. They show how renegotiation affects (1) the set of actions
 the principal can induce the agent to take and (2) the cost of
 implementing a given action. The authors show that, when the principal
 receives an unverifiable signal of the agent's action, renegotiation can
 improve welfare. This result stands in contrast to earlier findings that
 renegotiation lowers welfare when the principal receives no signal about
 the agent's action prior to renegotiation.   Copyright 1991 by The Econometric Society.

Title: GMM with Many Moment Conditions 
Abstract:
				 This paper provides a first order
 asymptotic theory for generalized method of moments (GMM) estimators when
 the number of moment conditions is allowed to increase with the sample
 size and the moment conditions may be weak. Examples in which these
 asymptotics are relevant include instrumental variable (IV) estimation
 with many (possibly weak or uninformed) instruments and some panel data
 models that cover moderate time spans and have correspondingly large
 numbers of instruments. Under certain regularity conditions, the GMM
 estimators are shown to converge in probability but not necessarily to the
 true parameter, and conditions for consistent GMM estimation are given. A
 general framework for the GMM limit distribution theory is developed based
 on epiconvergence methods. Some illustrations are provided, including
 consistent GMM estimation of a panel model with time varying individual
 effects, consistent limited information maximum likelihood estimation as a
 continuously updated GMM estimator, and consistent IV structural
 estimation using large numbers of weak or irrelevant instruments. Some
 simulations are reported. Copyright The Econometric Society 2006.

Title: Putting Behavioral Economics to Work: Testing for Gift Exchange in Labor Markets Using Field Experiments 
Abstract:
				 Recent discoveries in behavioral economics
 have led scholars to question the underpinnings of neoclassical economics.
 We use insights gained from one of the most influential lines of
 behavioral research-gift exchange-in an attempt to maximize worker effort
 in two quite distinct tasks: data entry for a university library and
 door-to-door fundraising for a research center. In support of the received
 literature, our field evidence suggests that worker effort in the first
 few hours on the job is considerably higher in the "gift" treatment than
 in the "nongift" treatment. After the initial few hours, however, no
 difference in outcomes is observed, and overall the gift treatment yielded
 inferior aggregate outcomes for the employer: with the same budget we
 would have logged more data for our library and raised more money for our
 research center by using the market-clearing wage rather than by trying to
 induce greater effort with a gift of higher wages. Copyright The Econometric Society 2006.

Abstract:
  This paper questions the interpretation of the Nash bargaining solution.
 A new definition is suggested. Revisions of Nash axioms characterize the
 solution. The definition makes possible its extension to
 non-expected-utility preferences. It also reveals the logic behind the

 the use of money is motivated by a cash-in-advance constraint, applied to
 purchases of a subset of consumption goods. The system is subject to both

Title: Teachers, Schools, and Academic Achievement 
Abstract:
				 This paper disentangles the impact of
 schools and teachers in influencing achievement with special attention
 given to the potential problems of omitted or mismeasured variables and of
 student and school selection. Unique matched panel data from the UTD Texas
 Schools Project permit the identification of teacher quality based on
 student performance along with the impact of specific, measured components
 of teachers and schools. Semiparametric lower bound estimates of the
 variance in teacher quality based entirely on within-school heterogeneity
 indicate that teachers have powerful effects on reading and mathematics
 achievement, though little of the variation in teacher quality is
 explained by observable characteristics such as education or experience.
 The results suggest that the effects of a costly ten student reduction in
 class size are smaller than the benefit of moving one standard deviation
 up the teacher quality distribution, highlighting the importance of
 teacher effectiveness in the determination of school quality. Copyright The Econometric Society 2005.

Title: Inference on Regressions with Interval Data on a Regressor or Outcome 
Abstract:
 This paper examines inference on regressions when interval data are
 available on one variable, the other variables being measured precisely.
 Let a population be characterized by a distribution "P"("y", "x", "v",
 "v"-sub-0, "v"-sub-1), where "y" is an element of "R"-super-1, "x" is an
 element of "R-super-k", and the real variables ("v", "v"-sub-0, "v"-sub-1)
 satisfy "v"-sub-0&le;"v"&le;"v"-sub-1. Let a random sample be drawn from
 "P" and the realizations of ("y", "x", "v"-sub-0, "v"-sub-1) be observed,
 but not those of "v". The problem of interest may be to infer "E"("y"|"x",
 "v") or "E"("v"|"x"). This analysis maintains Interval (I), Monotonicity
 (M), and Mean Independence (MI) assumptions: (I)
 "P"("v"-sub-0&le;"v"&le;"v"-sub-1)&equals;1; (M) "E"("y"|"x", "v") is
 monotone in "v"; (MI) "E"("y"|"x", "v", "v"-sub-0,
 "v"-sub-1)&equals;"E"("y"|"x", "v"). No restrictions are imposed on the
 distribution of the unobserved values of "v" within the observed intervals
 ["v"-sub-0, "v"-sub-1]. It is found that the IMMI Assumptions alone imply
 simple nonparametric bounds on "E"("y"|"x", "v") and "E"("v"|"x"). These
 assumptions invoked when "y" is binary and combined with a semiparametric
 binary regression model yield an identification region for the parameters
 that may be estimated consistently by a "modified maximum score (MMS)"
 method. The IMMI assumptions combined with a parametric model for
 "E"("y"|"x", "v") or "E"("v"|"x") yield an identification region that may
 be estimated consistently by a "modified minimum-distance (MMD)" method.
 Monte Carlo methods are used to characterize the finite-sample performance
 of these estimators. Empirical case studies are performed using interval
 wealth data in the Health and Retirement Study and interval income data in
 the Current Population Survey. Copyright The Econometric Society 2002.

Abstract:
  In models of asymmetric information, possession of private information
 leads to rents for the possessors. This induces mechanism designers to
 distort away from efficiency. The authors show that this is an artifact of
 the presumption that information is independently distributed. Rent
 extraction in a large class of mechanism design games is analyzed, and a
 necessary and sufficient condition for arbitrarily small rents to private
 information is provided. Additionally, the two-person bargaining game is
 shown to have an efficient solution under first-order stochastic dominance
 and a hazard rate condition. Similar conditions allow full rent extraction
 in Milgrom-Weber auctions.   Copyright 1992 by The Econometric Society.

Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 1127-50
Issue: 5
Volume: 60
Year: 1992
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  A dynamic stochastic model for a competitive industry is developed in
 which entry, exit, and the growth of firms' output and employment is
 determined. The paper extends long-run industry equilibrium theory to
 account for entry, exit, and heterogeneity in the size and growth rate of
 firms. Conditions under which there is entry and exit in the long run are
 developed. Cross sectional implications and distributions of profits and
 value of firms are derived. Comparative statics on the equilibrium size
 distribution and turnover rates are analyzed.	 Copyright 1992 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Efficient Semiparametric Estimation of Quantile Treatment Effects 
Abstract:
				 This paper develops estimators for
 quantile treatment effects under the identifying restriction that
 selection to treatment is based on observable characteristics.
 Identification is achieved without requiring computation of the
 conditional quantiles of the potential outcomes. Instead, the
 identification results for the marginal quantiles lead to an estimation
 procedure for the quantile treatment effect parameters that has two steps:
 nonparametric estimation of the propensity score and computation of the
 difference between the solutions of two separate minimization problems.
 Root-N consistency, asymptotic normality, and achievement of the
 semiparametric efficiency bound are shown for that estimator. A consistent
 estimation procedure for the variance is also presented. Finally, the
 method developed here is applied to evaluation of a job training program
 and to a Monte Carlo exercise. Results from the empirical application
 indicate that the method works relatively well even for a data set with
 limited overlap between treated and controls in the support of covariates.
 The Monte Carlo study shows that, for a relatively small sample size, the
 method produces estimates with good precision and low bias, especially for
 middle quantiles.				    Copyright The Econometric Society 2007.

Title:  Learning in High Stakes Ultimatum Games: An Experiment in the Slovak Republic
Abstract: In an ultimatum game experiment, financial incentives were varied by a
	factor of twenty-five. Consistent with prior results, changes in stakes had
	only a small effect on play for inexperienced players. However, rejections
	were less frequent the higher the stakes and proposals in the high stakes
	declined slowly as proposers gained experience. The lower rejection frequency
	when stakes were higher can be explained by the added power of multiple
	observations per subject in this experiment. A model of learning suggests
	that the lower rejection frequency is the reason proposers in higher stakes
	learn to make lower offers.

Title: Contract, Mechanism Design, and Technological Detail 
Abstract:
				 This paper develops a theoretical
 framework for studying contract and enforcement in settings with
 nondurable trading opportunities and complete but unverifiable
 information. The framework explicitly accounts for the parties' individual
 trade actions. The sets of implementable state-contingent payoffs, under
 various assumptions about renegotiation opportunities, are characterized
 and compared. The results indicate the benefit of modeling trade actions
 as individual, rather than as public, and they highlight the usefulness of
 a structured game-theoretic framework for applied research. Copyright The Econometric Society 2007.

Title:  Growing Through Cycles
Abstract: 
  An endogenous growth model is developed, where the balanced growth path is
  unstable and the economy achieves sustainable growth through cycles,
  perpetually moving back and forth between two phases. One phase is
  characterized by higher investment, no innovation, and a competitive market
  structure, as in the neoclassical model. The other phase is characterized by
  lower investment, high innovation, and a more monopolistic market structure,
  as in the neo-Schumpetarian model. Both investment and innovation are
  essential in sustaining growth indefinitely and yet only one of them appears
  to play a dominant role in each phase.

Journal: Econometrica

Issue: 2

Year: 1987
Month:  March 
Abstract:
  The problem of the existence of a competitive equilibrium in models with
 hidden knowledge and self-knowledge has been discussed previously by M.
 Rothschild and J. E. Stiglitz_(1976), C. A. Wilson_(1977), and J. G.
 Riley_(1979). Recent analyses of such models by I. Cho and D. Kreps_(1986)
 and Riley argue for a particular outcome - the Pareto-dominant separating,
 zero-profit one. The authors prove the existence of such an outcome under
 very general conditions and, generalizing the reactive equilibrium concept
 introduced by Riley, they prove this outcome is the unique reactive
 equilibrium.   Copyright 1987 by The Econometric Society.

Volume: 63
Year: 1995

Abstract:
  A statistical model of dynamic intrafamily investment behavior
 incorporating endowment heterogeneity is estimated to evaluate alternative
 estimation procedures that have exploited family and kinship data. These
 procedures, which place alternative restrictions on the endowment
 structure and on behavior, include generalized least squares,
 fixed-effects based on the children of sisters and siblings, and
 instrumental variables. The framework is applied to data on birth
 outcomes, with focus on the effects of teen-age childbearing net of other
 maternal behavior. The empirical results imply that the least restrictive
 statistical formulation, consistent with dynamic behavior and
 heterogeneity among siblings, fits the data best.   Copyright 1995 by The Econometric Society.

Title: What Happens When Wal-Mart Comes to Town: An Empirical Analysis of the Discount Retailing Industry 
Abstract:
				 In the past few decades multistore
 retailers, especially those with 100 or more stores, have experienced
 substantial growth. At the same time, there is widely reported public
 outcry over the impact of these chain stores on other retailers and local
 communities. This paper develops an empirical model to assess the impact
 of chain stores on other discount retailers and to quantify the size of
 the scale economies within a chain. The model has two key features. First,
 it allows for flexible competition patterns among all players. Second, for
 chains, it incorporates the scale economies that arise from operating
 multiple stores in nearby regions. In doing so, the model relaxes the
 commonly used assumption that entry in different markets is independent.
 The lattice theory is exploited to solve this complicated entry game among
 chains and other discount retailers in a large number of markets. It is
 found that the negative impact of Kmart's presence on Wal-Mart's profit
 was much stronger in 1988 than in 1997, while the opposite is true for the
 effect of Wal-Mart's presence on Kmart's profit. Having a chain store in a
 market makes roughly 50% of the discount stores unprofitable. Wal-Mart's
 expansion from the late 1980s to the late 1990s explains about 40-50% of
 the net change in the number of small discount stores and 30-40% for all
 other discount stores. Scale economies were important for Wal-Mart, but
 less so for Kmart, and the magnitude did not grow proportionately with the
 chains' sizes. Copyright  2008 The Econometric Society.

Title: Empirical Limits for Time Series Econometric Models 
Abstract:
 This paper characterizes empirically achievable limits for time series
 econometric modeling and forecasting. The approach involves the concept of
 minimal information loss in time series regression and the paper shows how
 to derive bounds that delimit the proximity of empirical measures to the
 true probability measure (the DGP) in models that are of econometric
 interest. The approach utilizes joint probability measures over the
 combined space of parameters and observables and the results apply for
 models with stationary, integrated, and cointegrated data. A theorem due
 to Rissanen is extended so that it applies directly to probabilities about
 the relative likelihood (rather than averages), a new way of proving
 results of the Rissanen type is demonstrated, and the Rissanen theory is
 extended to nonstationary time series with unit roots, near unit roots,
 and cointegration of unknown order. The corresponding bound for the
 minimal information loss in empirical work is shown not to be a constant,
 in general, but to be proportional to the logarithm of the determinant of
 the (possibility stochastic) Fisher--information matrix. In fact, the
 bound that determines proximity to the DGP is generally path dependent,
 and it depends specifically on the type as well as the number of
 regressors. For practical purposes, the proximity bound has the asymptotic
 form ("K"&sol;2)log "n", where "K" is a new dimensionality factor that
 depends on the nature of the data as well as the number of parameters in
 the model. When 'good' model selection principles are employed in modeling
 time series data, we are able to show that our proximity bound quantifies
 empirical limits even in situations where the models may be incorrectly
 specified.One of the main implications of the new result is that time
 trends are more costly than stochastic trends, which are more costly in
 turn than stationary regressors in achieving proximity to the true
 density. Thus, in a very real sense and quantifiable manner, the DGP is
 more elusive when there is nonstationarity in the data. The implications
 for prediction are explored and a second proximity theorem is given, which
 provides a bound that measures how close feasible predictors can come to
 the optimal predictor. Again, the bound has the asymptotic form
 ("K"&sol;2)log "n", showing that forecasting trends is fundamentally more
 difficult than forecasting stationary time series, even when the correct
 form of the model for the trends is known. Copyright The Econometric Society 2003.

Title:  Rationalizing Policy Functions by Dynamic Optimization
Abstract:
  The authors derive necessary and sufficient conditions for a pair of
  functions to be the optimal policy function and the optimal value function of
  a dynamic maximization problem with convex constraints and concave objective
  functional. It is shown that every Lipschitz continuous function can be the
  solution of such a problem. If the maintained assumptions include free
  disposal and monotonicity, then the authors obtain a complete
  characterization of all optimal policy and optimal value functions. This is
  the case, e.g., in the standard aggregative optimal growth model.

Title: Beauty Is a Beast, Frog Is a Prince: Assortative Matching with Nontransferabilities 
Abstract:
				 We present sufficient conditions for
 monotone matching in environments where utility is not fully transferable
 between partners. These conditions involve not only complementarity in
 types of the total payoff to a match, as in the transferable utility case,
 but also monotonicity in type of the degree of transferability between
 partners. We apply our conditions to study some models of risk sharing and
 incentive problems, deriving new results for predicted matching patterns
 in those contexts. Copyright The Econometric Society 2007.

Month:  May 
Abstract:
  This paper is concerned with the amount of communication that must be
 provided to implement a performance standard by a mechanism whose
 stationary messages have the Nash property. In p articular, the authors
 study implementation of Walrasian allocations in exchange environments.
 They show that the smallest message space t hat implements Walrasian
 allo-cations is one of dimension, roughly, n E (. 1 1)& ./(n 1 1), where .
 is the number of commodities and n the number of agents. The authors
 exhibit an implementing mechanism whos e message space has that dimension.    Copyright 1988 by The Econometric Society.

Abstract:
  The college admissions problem is perhaps the simplest model of

 authors show that the set of stable outcomes (which is equal to the core
 defined by weak domination) has some surprising properties not found in
 models of one-to-one matching. These properties may help to explain the
 success that this kind of model has had in explaining empirical
 observations.	 Copyright 1989 by The Econometric Society.

Journal: Econometrica

Issue: 6

Year: 1988
Month:  November 
Abstract:
  This paper extends the Pearson chi-square testing method to nondynam ic
 parametric econometric models, in particular, to models with covar iates.
 The paper establishes the asymptotic distribution of the test statistic
 when the test statistic is based on data-dependent random cells of a
 general form and on an arbitrary asymptotically normal estimator. These
 results a re attained by extending recent probabilistic results for the
 weak convergence of empirical processes indexed by sets. The chi-square
 test that is introduced can be used to test goodness-of-fit of a
 parametric model, as well as to test particular aspects of the parametric
 model that are of interest.   Copyright 1988 by The Econometric Society.

Abstract:
  Finite complexity strategies suffice for approximating all subgame
 perfect equ ilibrium payoffs of repeated games. Generically, at such
 equilibria, no player's complexity exceeds the product of his opponents'
 complexi ties. Also, no player's memory exceeds the maximal memory of his
 oppo nents. The complexity of a strategy is defined here to equal the numb
 er of distinct strategies it induces in the various subgames. It equa ls
 the size (number of states) of the smallest automaton describing i t and
 also the number of states of the smallest information system ne eded for
 the implementation of the strategy.   Copyright 1988 by The Econometric Society.

Volume: 59
Year: 1991
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  A dynamic monopolist produces at constant unit cost. Each period a new
 cohort of consumers enters the market. Each entering cohort is identical.
 Consumers within a cohort have different tastes. The paper shows that if
 players are sufficiently patient, any positive average profit less than
 the maximum feasible level can be attained in a subgame-perfect
 equilibrium; in stationary subgame-perfect equilibria, the seller cannot
 make sales at prices sufficiently greater than the lowest
 willingness-to-pay when period length goes to zero; and the seller attains
 the maximum commitment profit by charging the same (static monopoly) price
 in every period.   Copyright 1991 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Inference on the Quantile Regression Process 
Abstract:
 Tests based on the quantile regression process can be formulated like the
 classical Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Cramer-von-Mises tests of goodness-of-fit
 employing the theory of Bessel processes as in Kiefer (1959). However, it
 is frequently desirable to formulate hypotheses involving unknown nuisance
 parameters, thereby jeopardizing the distribution free character of these
 tests. We characterize this situation as "the Durbin problem" since it was
 posed in Durbin (1973), for parametric empirical processes.  In this paper
 we consider an approach to the Durbin problem involving a martingale
 transformation of the parametric empirical process suggested by Khmaladze
 (1981) and show that it can be adapted to a wide variety of inference
 problems involving the quantile regression process. In particular, we
 suggest new tests of the location shift and location-scale shift models
 that underlie much of classical econometric inference.  The methods are
 illustrated with a reanalysis of data on unemployment durations from the
 Pennsylvania Reemployment Bonus Experiments. The Pennsylvania experiments,
 conducted in 1988-89, were designed to test the efficacy of cash bonuses
 paid for early reemployment in shortening the duration of insured
 unemployment spells. Copyright The Econometric Society 2002.

Title:   Conditioning and Aggregation of Preferences
Abstract: This paper develops a general framework for modeling choice under
	uncertainty that extends subjective expected utility to include
	nonseparabilities, state-dependence, and the effect of subjective or ill
	defined consequences.  This is accomplished by not including consequences
	among the formal primitives.  Instead, the effect of consequences is modeled
	indirectly, through conditional preferences over acts. The main results
	concern the aggregation of conditional utilities to form an unconditional
	utility, including the case of additive aggregation.  Applications, obtained
	by further specifying the structure of acts and conditional preferences,
	include disappointment, regret, and the subjective value of information.

 substantial inefficiency. This paper shows that the size of this
 inefficiency depends on the degree of investment reversibility. In a
 dynamic model of financing and investment, the paper provides an upper
 bound for the inefficiency produced by debt financing. The upper bound is
 decreasing in the degree of investment reversibility and is zero when
 investment is perfectly reversible.	 Copyright The Econometric Society 2008.

Title: Speculation in Standard Auctions with Resale 
Abstract:
				 In standard auctions resale creates a role
 for a speculator-a bidder who is commonly known to have no use value for
 the good on sale. We study this issue in environments with symmetric
 independent private-value bidders. For second-price and English auctions
 the efficient value-bidding equilibrium coexists with a continuum of
 inefficient equilibria in which the speculator wins the auction and makes
 positive profits. First-price and Dutch auctions have an essentially
 unique equilibrium, and whether or not the speculator wins the auction and
 distorts the final allocation depends on the number of bidders, the value
 distribution, and the discount factor. Speculators do not make profits in
 first-price or Dutch auctions. Copyright The Econometric Society 2006.

Title:   Full Extraction of the Surplus in Bayesian and Dominant Strategy Auctions. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 1247-57
Issue: 6
Volume: 56
Year: 1988
Month:  November 
Abstract:
  The authors consider auctions for a single indivisible object when
 bidders have information about each other that is unavailable to the
 seller. They show that the seller can use this information to his own
 benefit, and they characterize th e environments in which a well-chosen
 auction gives him the same expected payoff as that obtainable were he able
 to see the object und er full information. This hinges on the possibility
 of constructing lotteries with the correct properties. The authors study
 the problem for auctions where the bidders have dominant strategies and
 those where the relevant equilibrium concept is Bayesian-Nash.   Copyright 1988 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Comparative Testing of Experts 
Abstract:
				 We show that a simple "reputation-style"
 test can always identify which of two experts is informed about the true
 distribution. The test presumes no prior knowledge of the true
 distribution, achieves any desired degree of precision in some fixed
 finite time, and does not use "counterfactual" predictions. Our analysis
 capitalizes on a result of Fudenberg and Levine (1992) on the rate of
 convergence of supermartingales. Copyright Copyright  2008 by The Econometric Society.

Title:   Fiscal Policy with Impure Intergenerational Altruism. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 1687-1711
Issue: 6
Volume: 59
Year: 1991
Month:  November 
Abstract:
  Recent work demonstrates that dynastic assumptions guarantee the
 irrelevance of redistributional policies, distortionary taxes, and
 prices--the neutrality of fiscal policy (Ricardian equivalence) is only
 the "tip of the iceberg." This paper investigates the possibility of
 reinstating approximate Ricardian equivalence by introducing a small
 amount of friction in intergenerational links. If Ricardian equivalence
 depends upon significantly shorter chains of links than do these stronger
 neutrality results, then friction may dissipate the effects that generate
 strong neutrality, without significantly affecting the Ricardian result.
 However, models with friction have other untenable implications and, thus,
 the theoretical case for Ricardian equivalence remains tenuous.   Copyright 1991 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Existence of Equilibrium in Single and Double Private Value Auctions  					 
Abstract:
				 We show existence of equilibria in
 distributional strategies for a wide class of private value auctions,
 including the first general existence result for double auctions. The set
 of equilibria is invariant to the tie-breaking rule. The model
 incorporates multiple unit demands, all standard pricing rules, reserve
 prices, entry costs, and stochastic demand and supply. Valuations can be
 correlated and asymmetrically distributed. For double auctions, we show
 further that at least one equilibrium involves a positive volume of trade.
 The existence proof establishes new connections among existence techniques
 for discontinuous Bayesian games. Copyright The Econometric Society 2005.

Title: Existence and Uniqueness of Maximal Reductions Under Iterated Strict Dominance 
Abstract:
 Iterated elimination of strictly dominated strategies is an order
 dependent procedure. It can also generate spurious Nash equilibria, fail
 to converge in countable steps, or converge to empty strategy sets. If
 best replies are well-defined, then spurious Nash equilibria cannot
 appear; if strategy spaces are compact and payoff functions are
 uppersemicontinuous in own strategies, then order does not matter; if
 strategy sets are compact and payoff functions are continuous in all
 strategies, then a unique and nonempty maximal reduction exists. These
 positive results extend neither to the better-reply secure games for which
 Reny has established the existence of a Nash equilibrium, nor to games in
 which (under iterated eliminations) any dominated strategy has an
 undominated dominator. Copyright The Econometric Society 2002.

Title: Admission, Tuition, and Financial Aid Policies in the Market for Higher Education 
Abstract:
				 We present an equilibrium model of the
 market for higher education. Our model simultaneously predicts student
 selection into institutions of higher education, financial aid,
 educational expenditures, and educational outcomes. We show that the model
 gives rise to a strict hierarchy of colleges that differ by the
 educational quality provided to the students. We also develop a new
 estimation procedure that exploits the observed variation in prices within
 colleges. Identification is based on variation in endowments and
 technology. It does not rely on observed variation in potentially
 endogenous characteristics of colleges such as peer quality measures and
 expenditures. We estimate the structural parameters using data collected
 by the National Center for Education Statistics and aggregate data from
 Peterson's and the National Science Foundation. Copyright The Econometric Society 2006.

Title:  On the Dual Stability of a von Neumann Facet and the Inefficacy of Temporary Fiscal Policy
Abstract: This study establishes two main results in a dynamic general
	equilibrium model. The first is to demonstrate the dual Liapounov stability
	of a von Neumann facet without the restrictive assumptions on the structure
	of underlying technologies adopted commonly in the optimal growth literature.
	The second is to demonstrate that a temporary change in fiscal policy has
	almost no effect on present and future consumption. While such a result has
	been discussed in the context of permanent income hypothesis, in this study
	it is proved in the dynamic general equilibrium framework under a set of
	basic assumptions of general equilibrium theory.

Title:   Status, the Distribution of Wealth, Private and Social Attitudes to Risk. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 837-57
Issue: 4
Volume: 60
Year: 1992
Month:  July 
Abstract:
  This paper supposes an individual cares about his/her own wealth not only
 directly but also via the relative standing that this wealth induces. The
 implications for risk-taking are investigated in particular. Such a model
 provides a natural explanation of the "concave-convex-concave" utility
 described by M.  Friedman and L. Savage (1948). However, there are a
 number of key differences between the present model and any model based on
 own wealth alone. For example, an equilibrium wealth distribution here may
 have a middle class. Further, the status interaction involves an
 externality and an equilibrium wealth distribution may be Pareto
 inefficient.   Copyright 1992 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Simple Efficient Contracts in Complex Environments 
Abstract:
				 This paper studies a general model of
 holdup in a setting encompassing the models of Segal (1999) and Che and
 Hausch (1999) among others. It is shown that if renegotiation is modeled
 as an infinite-horizon noncooperative bargaining game, then, with a simple
 initial contract, an efficient equilibrium will generally exist. The
 contract is robust in the sense that it does not depend on fine details of
 the model. The contract gives authority to one party to set the terms of
 trade and gives the other party a nonexpiring option to trade at these
 terms. The difference from standard results arises because the initial
 contract ensures that the renegotiation game has multiple equilibria; the
 multiplicity of continuation equilibria can be used to enforce efficient
 investment. Copyright Copyright  2008 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Best Nonparametric Bounds on Demand Responses 
Abstract:
				 This paper uses revealed preference
 inequalities to provide the tightest possible (best) nonparametric bounds
 on predicted consumer responses to price changes using consumer-level data
 over a finite set of relative price changes. These responses are allowed
 to vary nonparametrically across the income distribution. This is achieved
 by combining the theory of revealed preference with the semiparametric
 estimation of consumer expansion paths (Engel curves). We label these
 expansion path based bounds on demand responses as E-bounds. Deviations
 from revealed preference restrictions are measured by preference
 perturbations which are shown to usefully characterize taste change and to
 provide a stochastic environment within which violations of revealed
 preference inequalities can be assessed.			       Copyright  2008 The Econometric Society.

Title:   Asymptotic Normality, When Regressors Have a Unit Root. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 1397-1417
Issue: 6
Volume: 56
Year: 1988
Month:  November 
Abstract:
  Under fairly general conditions, ordinary least squares and linear
 instrumental variables estimators are asymptotically normal when a
 regression equation has nonstationary right hand side variables. Standard
 formulas may be used to calculate a consistent estimate of the asymptotic
 variance-covariance matrix of the estimated parameter vector, even if the
 disturbances are conditionally heteroskedastic and autocorrelated. So
 inference may proceed in the usual way. The key requirements are that the
 nonstationary variables share a common unit root and that the
 unconditional mean of their first differences is nonzero.   Copyright 1988 by The Econometric Society.

Title:   A Two-Sector Overlapping-Generations Model: A Global Characterization of the Dynamical System. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 1351-86
Issue: 6
Volume: 60
Year: 1992
Month:  November 
Abstract:
  This paper develops a two-sector overlapping-generations model. It
 characterizes the dynamical system globally and establishes sufficient
 conditions for the existence of a globally unique perfect-foresight
 equilibrium. It provides, therefore, a useful framework for global dynamic
 analysis of phenomena whose modeling requires a multidimensional commodity
 space. The analysis demonstrates that gross substitutability in
 consumption is not sufficient for the determinacy of equilibrium in this
 production economy. However, if in addition the investment good is capital
 intensive and second period consumption of two-period-lived individuals is
 a normal good, then the perfect-foresight equilibrium is globally unique.   Copyright 1992 by The Econometric Society.

Title:   Meteor Showers or Heat Waves? Heteroskedastic Intra-daily Volatility in the Foreign Exchange Market. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 525-42
Issue: 3
Volume: 58
Year: 1990
Month:  May 
Abstract:
  This paper seeks to explain the causes of volatility clustering in
 exchange rates. Careful examination of intra-daily exchange rates provides
 a test of two hypotheses--heat waves and meteor showers. The heat wave
 hypothesis is that the volatility in one market is predicted only by the
 past of that market. The meteor shower hypothesis is that intra-daily
 volatility spills over from one market to the next. Using the GARCH model
 to specify the heteroskedasticity across intra-daily market segments, we
 find that the empirical evidence is generally against the null hypothesis
 of the heat wave. Using a volatility type of vector autoregression we
 examine the impact of news in one market on the time path of per-hour
 volatility in other markets.   Copyright 1990 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Identification of Marginal Effects in Nonseparable Models Without Monotonicity 
Abstract:
				 Nonseparable models do not impose any type
 of additivity between the unobserved part and the observable regressors,
 and are therefore ideal for many economic applications. To identify these
 models using the entire joint distribution of the data as summarized in
 regression quantiles, monotonicity in unobservables has frequently been
 assumed. This paper establishes that in the absence of monotonicity, the
 quantiles identify local average structural derivatives of nonseparable
 models. Copyright The Econometric Society 2007.

Title: An Experimental Study of Belief Learning Using Elicited Beliefs 
Abstract:
 This paper investigates belief learning. Unlike other investigators who
 have been forced to use observable proxies to approximate unobserved
 beliefs, we have, using a belief elicitation procedure (proper scoring
 rule), elicited subject beliefs directly. As a result we were able to
 perform a more direct test of the proposition that people behave in a
 manner consistent with belief learning. What we find is interesting. First
 to the extent that subjects tend to "belief learn," the beliefs they use
 are the stated beliefs we elicit from them and not the "empirical beliefs"
 posited by fictitious play or Cournot models. Second, we present evidence
 that the stated beliefs of our subjects differ dramatically, both
 quantitatively and qualitatively, from the type of empirical or historical
 beliefs usually used as proxies for them. Third, our belief elicitation
 procedures allow us to examine how far we can be led astray when we are
 forced to infer the value of parameters using observable proxies for
 variables previously thought to be unobservable. By transforming a
 heretofore unobservable into an observable, we can see directly how
 parameter estimates change when this new information is introduced. Again,
 we demonstrate that such differences can be dramatic. Finally, our belief
 learning model using stated beliefs outperforms both a reinforcement and
 EWA model when all three models are estimated using our data. Copyright The Econometric Society 2002.

Title:  High Breakdown Point Conditional Dispersion Estimation with Application to S&P 500 Daily Returns Volatility 
Abstract: The authors show that quasimaximum likelihood (QML) estimators for
	conditional dispersion models can be severely affected by a small number of
	outliers such as market crashes and rallies, and they propose new estimation
	strategies (the two-stage Hampel estimators and two-stage S-estimators)
	resistant to the effects of outliers and study the properties of these
	estimators. They apply their methods to estimate models of the conditional
	volatility of the daily returns of the S&P 500 Cash Index series. In contrast
	to QML estimators, the authors' proposed method resists outliers, revealing
	an informative new picture of volatility dynamics during 'typical' daily
	market activity.

Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 273-302
Issue: 2
Volume: 61
Year: 1993
Month:  March 
Abstract:
  There is a tension between a belief in the strategic relevance of
 information sets and subgames and a belief in the sufficiency of the
 reduced normal form. The authors identify a prope rty of extensive form
 information sets and subgames termed strategic independence. Strategic
 independence is captured by the reduced norm al form and can be used to
 define normal form information sets and subgames. The authors prove a
 close relationship between these norma l form structures and their
 extensive form namesakes. They then motiva te and implement solution
 concepts corresponding to subgame perfection, sequential equilibrium, and
 forward induction entirely in the reduce d normal form.   Copyright 1993 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Bounds in Competing Risks Models and the War on Cancer 
Abstract:
				 In 1971, President Nixon declared war on
 cancer. Thirty years later, many declared this war a failure: the
 age-adjusted mortality rate from cancer in 2000 was essentially the same
 as in the early 1970s. Meanwhile the age-adjusted mortality rate from
 cardiovascular disease fell dramatically. Since the causes that underlie
 cancer and cardiovascular disease are likely dependent, the decline in
 mortality rates from cardiovascular disease may partially explain the lack
 of progress in cancer mortality. Because competing risks models (used to
 model mortality from multiple causes) are fundamentally unidentified, it
 is difficult to estimate cancer trends. We derive bounds for aspects of
 the underlying distributions without assuming that the underlying risks
 are independent. We then estimate changes in cancer and cardiovascular
 mortality since 1970. The bounds for the change in duration until death
 for either cause are fairly tight and suggest much larger improvements in
 cancer than previously estimated. Copyright The Econometric Society 2006.

Title:   Nash Implementation Using Undominated Strategies. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 479-501
Issue: 2
Volume: 59
Year: 1991
Month:  March 
Abstract:
  The authors study the problem of implementing social choice
 correspondences via Nash equilibrium in which no one uses a weakly
 dominated strategy. The main result is that if there are at least three
 agents in society, then any correspondence that satisfies no veto power is
 implementable unless some agents are completely indifferent over all
 possible outcomes. Many common welfare criteria, such as the Pareto
 correspondence, and several familiar voting rules satisfy the authors'
 conditions. This possibility result stands in sharp contrast to the more
 restrictive findings with implementation in either Nash equilibrium or
 subgame perfect equilibrium   Copyright 1991 by The Econometric Society.

Title:   Engel Curves Leading to the Weak Axiom in the Aggregate. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 515-31
Issue: 3
Volume: 55
Year: 1987
Month:  May 
Abstract:
  For every range of admissible incomes, the authors characterize the class
 of Engel curves with the property that if an economy has, first, a price
 independent distribution of income and, second, preferences which are
 identical across consumers and generate Engel curves in the class, then
 the corresponding aggregate demand function satisfies the Weak Axiom of
 Revealed Preference. This class is defined by two simple conditions. The
 no-torsion condition says that, in the relevant range of income, the Engel
 curve is contained in a plane through the origin. The uniform-curvature
 condition says that, in addition, the Engel curve is either convex or
 concave to the origin.   Copyright 1987 by The Econometric Society.

Abstract:
  The authors analyze the Shapley value allocation of an economy with

 coalitions of agents share their private information? How can one measure
 the information advantage or superiority of an agent? Is each agent's
 private information verifiable by other members of a coalition? Do
 coalitions of agents pool their private information? Do agents have an
 incentive to report their true private information? Do value allocations
 exist in an economy with differential information? The authors provide
 answers to each of these questions.   Copyright 1994 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Determining the Number of Factors in Approximate Factor Models 
Abstract:
 In this paper we develop some econometric theory for factor models of
 large dimensions. The focus is the determination of the number of factors
 ("r"), which is an unresolved issue in the rapidly growing literature on
 multifactor models. We first establish the convergence rate for the factor
 estimates that will allow for consistent estimation of "r". We then
 propose some panel criteria and show that the number of factors can be
 consistently estimated using the criteria. The theory is developed under
 the framework of large cross-sections ("N") and large time dimensions
 ("T"). No restriction is imposed on the relation between "N" and "T".
 Simulations show that the proposed criteria have good finite sample
 properties in many configurations of the panel data encountered in
 practice. Copyright The Econometric Society 2001.

Title: Testing a Parametric Model Against a Nonparametric Alternative with Identification Through Instrumental Variables 
Abstract:
				 This paper is concerned with inference
 about a function g that is identified by a conditional moment restriction
 involving instrumental variables. The paper presents a test of the
 hypothesis that g belongs to a finite-dimensional parametric family
 against a nonparametric alternative. The test does not require
 nonparametric estimation of g and is not subject to the ill-posed inverse
 problem of nonparametric instrumental variables estimation. Under mild
 conditions, the test is consistent against any alternative model. In large
 samples, its power is arbitrarily close to 1 uniformly over a class of
 alternatives whose distance from the null hypothesis is O(n-super- -
 1&sol;2), where n is the sample size. In Monte Carlo simulations, the
 finite-sample power of the new test exceeds that of existing tests.	     Copyright The Econometric Society 2006.

Title: Impartiality, Priority, and Solidarity in the Theory of Justice 
Abstract:
				 The ethic of priority is a compromise
 between the extremely compensatory ethic of outcome equality and the
 needs-blind ethic of resource equality. We propose an axiom of priority
 and characterize resource-allocation rules that are impartial,
 prioritarian, and solidaristic. They comprise a class of rules that
 equalize across individuals some index of outcome and resources.
 Consequently, we provide an ethical rationalization for the many
 applications in which such indices have been used (e.g., the human
 development index, the index of primary goods, etc.). Copyright The Econometric Society 2006.

Title:   Long-Term Debt and Optimal Policy in the Fiscal Theory of the Price Level. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 69-116
Issue: 1
Volume: 69
Year: 2001
Month:  January 
Abstract:
  The fiscal theory says that the price level is determined by the ratio of
 nominal debt to the present value of real primary surpluses. The maturity
 structure of the debt matters in this theory. For example, it determines
 whether news of future deficits implies current inflation or future
 inflation, and the long-term debt allows the government to offset surplus
 shocks by ex-post devaluation. In the optimal policy, the government uses
 fiscal operations to smooth cyclical fiscal shocks. Since policy movements
 react to events rather than cause them, the optimal policy produces time
 series that are similar to U.S. time series.

Title:   The Relative Importance of Permanent and Transitory Components: Identification and Some Theoretical Bounds. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 107-18
Issue: 1
Volume: 60
Year: 1992
Month:  January 
Abstract:
  Much macroeconometric discussion has recently emphasized the economic
 significance of the size of the permanent component in GNP. Consequently,
 a large literature has developed that tries to estimate this
 magnitude--measured, essentially, as the spectral density of increments in
 GNP at frequency zero. This paper shows that, unless the permanent
 component is a random walk, this attention has been misplaced: in general,
 that quantity does not identify the magnitude of the permanent component.
 Further, by developing bounds on reasonable measures of this magnitude,
 this paper shows that a random walk specification is biased toward
 establishing the permanent component as important.   Copyright 1992 by The Econometric Society.

Title:  Efficiency and Voluntary Implementation in Markets with Repeated Pairwise Bargaining
Abstract: The authors examine a bargaining setting where heterogeneous buyers and
	sellers are repeatedly matched and time is costly. They characterize
	efficiency and then, using an implementation approach, study the allocations
	that can result in equilibrium when the matched buyers and sellers bargain
	through some extensive game form. The authors are particularly concerned with
	the impact of making trade voluntary: buyers and sellers have the option of
	being rematched in the market. Finally, they compare and contrast the
	efficient allocations with those that could ever arise as the equilibria of
	some voluntary negotiation procedure.

Title:   Controlling a Stochastic Process with Unknown Parameters. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 1045-64
Issue: 5
Volume: 56
Year: 1988
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  The problem of controlling a stochastic process, with unknown parameters
 over an infinite horizon, with discounting is considered. Agents express
 beliefs about unknown parameters in terms of distributions. Under general
 conditions, the sequence of beliefs converges to a limit distribution. The
 limit distribution may or may not be concentrated at the true parameter
 value. In some cases, complete learning is optimal; in others, the optimal
 strategy does not imply complete learning. The paper concludes with
 examination of some special cases and a discussion of a procedure for
 generating examples in which incomplete learning is optimal.   Copyright 1988 by The Econometric Society.

Title:   An Adaptive, Rate-Optimal Test of a Parametric Mean-Regression Model against a Nonparametric Alternative. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 599-631
Issue: 3
Volume: 69
Year: 2001
Month:  May 
Abstract:
  We develop a new test of a parametric model of a conditional mean
 function against a nonparametric alternative. The test adapts to the
 unknown smoothness of the alternative model and is uniformly consistent
 against alternatives whose distance from the parametric model converges to
 zero at the fastest possible rate. This rate is slower than n[superscript
 -1/2]. Some existing tests have nontrivial power against restricted
 classes of alternatives whose distance from the parametric model decreases
 at the rate n[superscript -1/2]. There are, however, sequences of
 alternatives against which these tests are inconsistent and ours is
 consistent. As a consequence, there are alternative models for which the
 finite-sample power of our test greatly exceeds that of existing tests.
 This conclusion is illustrated by the results of some Monte Carlo
 experiments.

Title:   Comments on the Interpretation of Game Theory. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 909-24
Issue: 4
Volume: 59
Year: 1991
Month:  July 
Abstract:
  The paper is a discussion of the interpretation of game theory. The first
 half of the paper deals with the notion of "strategy". The paper endorses
 the view that equilibrium strategy describes a player's plan of action, as
 well as those considerations which support the optimality of his plan
 rather than being merely described as a "plan of action". In the second
 half of the paper it is argued that a good model in game theory has to be
 realistic in the sense that it provides a model for the perception of real
 life social phenomena. It should incorporate a description of the relevant
 factors involved, as perceived by the decision makers.   Copyright 1991 by The Econometric Society.

Month:  March 
Abstract:
  The authors consider a k-player sequential bargaining model in which the
 size of the cake and the order in which players move follow a general
 Markov process. For games in which one agent makes an offer in each period
 and agreement must be unanimous, the authors provide characterizations of
 the sets of subgame perfect and stationary subgame perfect payoffs. With
 these characterizations, they investigate the uniqueness and efficiency of
 the equilibrium outcomes, the conditions under which agreement is delayed,
 and the advantage to proposing.   Copyright 1995 by The Econometric Society.

Issue: 4
Volume: 69
Year: 2001
Month:  July 
Abstract:
  We show that, in repeated common interest games without discounting,
 strong "perturbation implies efficiency" results require that the
 perturbations must include strategies that are "draconian" in the sense
 that they are prepared to punish to the maximum extent possible. Moreover,
 there is a draconian strategy whose presence in the perturbations
 guarantees that any equilibrium is efficient. We also argue that the
 results of Anderlini and Sabourian (1995) using perturbation strategies
 that are cooperative (and hence nondraconian) are not due to computability
 per se but to the further restrictions they impose on allowable beliefs.

Title: A Dynamic Theory of Holdup 
Abstract:
				 The holdup problem arises when parties
 negotiate to divide the surplus generated by their relationship specific
 investments. We study this problem in a dynamic model of bargaining and
 investment which, unlike the stylized static model, allows the parties to
 continue to invest until they agree on the terms of trade. The investment
 dynamics overturns the conventional wisdom dramatically. First, the holdup
 problem need not entail underinvestment when the parties are sufficiently
 patient. Second, inefficiencies can arise unambiguously in some cases, but
 they are not caused by the sharing of surplus per se but rather by a
 failure of an individual rationality constraint. Copyright The Econometric Society 2004.

Title: Directed Matching and Monetary Exchange 
Abstract:
	 We develop a model of monetary exchange where, as in the random
 matching literature, agents trade bilaterally and not through centralized
 markets. Rather than assuming they match exogenously and at random,
 however, we determine who meets whom as part of the equilibrium. We show
 how to formalize this process of directed matching in dynamic models with
 double coincidence problems, and present several examples and applications
 that illustrate how the approach can be used in monetary theory. Some of
 our results are similar to those in the random matching literature; others
 differ significantly. Copyright Econometric Society, 2002.

Title: On the Bootstrap of the Maximum Score Estimator 
Abstract:
				 This paper shows that the bootstrap does
 not consistently estimate the asymptotic distribution of the maximum score
 estimator. The theory developed also applies to other estimators within a
 cube-root convergence class. For some single-parameter estimators in this
 class, the results suggest a simple method for inference based upon the
 bootstrap. Copyright The Econometric Society 2005.

Title:   Asset Pricing and Optimal Portfolio Choice in the Presence of Illiquid Durable Consumption Goods. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 25-51
Issue: 1
Volume: 58
Year: 1990
Month:  January 
Abstract:
  The authors analyze a model of optimal consumption and portfolio
 selection in which consumption services are generated by holding a durable
 good. The durable good is illiquid in that a transaction cost must be paid
 when the good is sold. It is shown that optimal consumption is not a
 smooth function of wealth; it is optimal for the consumer to wait until a
 large change in wealth occurs before adjusting his consumption. Hence, the
 consumption based capital asset pricing model fails to hold. Nevertheless,
 the standard, one factor, market portfolio based capital asset pricing
 model does hold in this environment.   Copyright 1990 by The Econometric Society.

Title:   Asset Prices in an Exchange Economy with Habit Formation. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 1633-57
Issue: 6
Volume: 59
Year: 1991
Month:  November 
Abstract:
  This paper analyzes asset prices in a representative agent exchange
 economy with habit-forming preferences. For a general class of utility
 indices and endowment processes, the authors characterize the optimal
 demand for consumption and derive explicit solutions for the interest rate
 and asset risk premia. They show that consumption smoothness may obtain
 even when the interest rate is stochastic. The consumption capital asset
 pricing model may not hold when the endowment process has stochastic
 coefficients; asset risk premia are larger under mild assumptions. The
 interest rate depends on the growth in the standard of living. Malliavin
 calculus is employed in the analysis.	 Copyright 1991 by The Econometric Society.

Journal: Econometrica

Abstract:
  A number of generalizations of the expected utility preference functional
 are estimated using experimentally generated data involving 100 pairwise
 choice questions repeated on two separate occasions. Likelihood ratio
 tests are conducted to investigate the statistical superiority of the
 various generalizations and the Akaike information criterion is used to
 distinguish between them. The economic superiority of the various
 generalizations is also explored and the paper concludes that, for many
 subjects, the superiority of several of the generalizations is not
 established.   Copyright 1994 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Threshold Autoregression with a Unit Root 
Abstract:
 This paper develops an asymptotic theory of inference for an unrestricted
 two-regime threshold autoregressive (TAR) model with an autoregressive
 unit root. We find that the asymptotic null distribution of Wald tests for
 a threshold are nonstandard and different from the stationary case, and
 suggest basing inference on a bootstrap approximation. We also study the
 asymptotic null distributions of tests for an autoregressive unit root,
 and find that they are nonstandard and dependent on the presence of a
 threshold effect. We propose both asymptotic and bootstrap-based tests.
 These tests and distribution theory allow for the joint consideration of
 nonlinearity (thresholds) and nonstationary (unit roots). Our limit theory
 is based on a new set of tools that combine unit root asymptotics with
 empirical process methods. We work with a particular two-parameter
 empirical process that converges weakly to a two-parameter Brownian
 motion. Our limit distributions involve stochastic integrals with respect
 to this two-parameter process. This theory is entirely new and may find
 applications in other contexts. We illustrate the methods with an
 application to the U.S. monthly unemployment rate. We find strong evidence
 of a threshold effect. The point estimates suggest that the threshold
 effect is in the short-run dynamics, rather than in the dominate root.
 While the conventional ADF test for a unit root is insignificant, our TAR
 unit root tests are arguably significant. The evidence is quite strong
 that the unemployment rate is not a unit root process, and there is
 considerable evidence that the series is a stationary TAR process. Copyright The Econometric Society.

Title:   Semiparametric Latent Variable Model Estimation with Endogenous or Mismeasured Regressors
Abstract:  A simple root n consistent, asymptotically normal semiparametric
	estimator of the coefficient vector beta in the latent variable specification
	y = L (beta'x + e) is constructed. The distribution of e is unknown and may
	be correlated with x or be conditionally heteroscedastic, e.g., x can contain
	measurement error. The function L can also be unknown. The identification
	assumption is that e is uncorrelated with instruments u and that the
	conditional distribution of e given x and u does not depend on one of the
	regressors, which has some special properties. Extensions to more general
	latent variable specifications are provided.

Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 527-60
Issue: 3
Volume: 64
Year: 1996
Month:  May 
Abstract:
  The author proposes a nonparametric estimation procedure for
 continuous-time stochastic models. Because prices of derivative securities
 depend crucially on the form of the instantaneous volatility of the
 underlying process, he leaves the volatility function unrestricted and
 estimates it nonparametrically. Only discrete data are used but the
 estimation procedure still does not rely on replacing the continuous-time
 model by some discrete approximation. Instead, the drift and volatility
 functions are forced to match the densities of the process. The author
 estimates the stochastic differential equation followed by the short-term
 interest rate and computes nonparametric prices for bonds and bond
 options.   Copyright 1996 by The Econometric Society.

Title:   Testing for Common Roots. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 171-85
Issue: 1
Volume: 57
Year: 1989
Month:  January 
Abstract:
  In this paper, the authors propose a simple procedure for testing the
 existence of common roots in lag polynomials. They first show, by using a
 generalized Bezout property, that this hypothesis can be put under a
 "mixed" form that is linear with respect to the auxiliary parameters and
 with respect to the initial parameters. It follows that the test
 procedures can be implemented only by using regressions packages.   Copyright 1989 by The Econometric Society.

Abstract:
 In this paper we estimate a bargaining model of government formation in
 parliamentary democracies. We use the estimated structural model to
 conduct constitutional experiments aimed at evaluating the impact of
 institutional features of the political environment on the duration of the
 government formation process, the type of coalitions that form, and their
 relative stability. Copyright The Econometric Society 2003.

Title: Accuracy of Simulations for Stochastic Dynamic Models 
Abstract:
				 This paper is concerned with accuracy
 properties of simulations of approximate solutions for stochastic dynamic
 models. Our analysis rests upon a continuity property of invariant
 distributions and a generalized law of large numbers. We then show that
 the statistics generated by any sufficiently good numerical approximation
 are arbitrarily close to the set of expected values of the model's
 invariant distributions. Also, under a contractivity condition on the
 dynamics, we establish error bounds. These results are of further interest
 for the comparative study of stationary solutions and the estimation of
 structural dynamic models. Copyright The Econometric Society 2005.

Title: A Structure Theorem for Rationalizability with Application to Robust Predictions of Refinements 
Abstract:
				 Rationalizability is a central solution
 concept of game theory. Economic models often have many rationalizable
 outcomes, motivating economists to use refinements of rationalizability,
 including equilibrium refinements. In this paper we try to achieve a
 general understanding of when this multiplicity occurs and how one should
 deal with it. Assuming that the set of possible payoff functions and
 belief structures is sufficiently rich, we establish a revealing structure
 of the correspondence of beliefs to sets of rationalizable outcomes. We
 show that, for any rationalizable action a of any type, we can perturb the
 beliefs of the type in such a way that a is uniquely rationalizable for
 the new type. This unique outcome will be robust to further small changes.
 When multiplicity occurs, then we are in a "knife-edge" case, where the
 unique rationalizable outcome changes, sandwiched between open sets of
 types where each of the rationalizable actions is uniquely rationalizable.
 As an immediate application of this result, we characterize, for any
 refinement of rationalizability, the predictions that are robust to small
 misspecifications of interim beliefs. These are only those predictions
 that are true for all rationalizable strategies, that is, the predictions
 that could have been made without the refinement.			     Copyright The Econometric Society 2007.

Title:   Nonspeculative Bubbles in Experimental Asset Markets: Lack of Common Knowledge of Rationality vs. Actual Irrationality. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 831-59
Issue: 4
Volume: 69
Year: 2001
Month:  July 
Abstract:
  We report the results of an experiment designed to study the role of
 speculation in the formation of bubbles and crashes in laboratory asset
 markets. In a setting in which speculation is not possible, bubbles and
 crashes are observed. The results suggest that the departures from
 fundamental values are not caused by the lack of common knowledge of
 rationality leading to speculation, but rather by behavior that itself
 exhibits elements of irrationality. Much of the trading activity that
 accompanies bubble formation, in markets where speculation is possible, is
 due to the fact that there is no other activity available for participants
 in the experiment.

Title: Fairness and Contract Design 
Abstract:
				 We show experimentally that fairness
 concerns may have a decisive impact on the actual and optimal choice of
 contracts in a moral hazard context. Bonus contracts that offer a
 voluntary and unenforceable bonus for satisfactory performance provide
 powerful incentives and are superior to explicit incentive contracts when
 there are some fair-minded players, but trust contracts that pay a
 generous wage up front are less efficient than incentive contracts. The
 principals understand this and predominantly choose the bonus contracts.
 These results are consistent with recently developed theories of fairness,
 which offer important new insights into the interaction of contract
 choices, fairness, and incentives. Copyright The Econometric Society 2007.

Title:   Monotone Treatment Response
Abstract: This paper investigates what may be learned about treatment response
	when it is assumed that response functions are monotone, semimonotone, or
	concave-monotone. Nothing is assumed about the process of treatment selection
	and cross-individual restrictions on response are not imposed. The idea is to
	determine, for every member of the population, the response functions that
	pass through the realized (treatment, outcome) pair and that are consistent
	with the assumption imposed. These findings are then aggregated to determine
	what can be learned about the population distribution of response. The
	analysis is applied to the econometrics of demand and production.

Issue: 6
Volume: 58
Year: 1990

Abstract:
  The authors modify the standard principal-agent model with oral hazard by
 allowing the contract to be renegotiated after the agent's choice of
 action and before the observation of the action's consequences. In
 equilibrium, the agent randomizes over effort levels. The optimal contract
 gives the agent a menu of compensation schemes: safe ones intended for
 low-effort workers and risky ones for those whose effort is high. The
 optimal contract may give the agent a positive rent, in contrast to the
 case without renegotiation.   Copyright 1990 by The Econometric Society.

Issue: 2
Volume: 55
Year: 1987
Month:  March 
Abstract:
  The relationship between cointegration and error correction models, first
 suggested by Granger, is here extended and used to develop estimation
 procedures, tests, and empirical examples. A vector of time series is said
 to be cointegrated with cointegrating vector a if each element is
 stationary only after differencing while linear combinations a8xt are
 themselves stationary. A representation theorem connects the moving
 average , autoregressive, and error correction representations for
 cointegrated systems. A simple but asymptotically efficient two-step
 estimator is proposed and applied. Tests for cointegration are suggested
 and examined by Monte Carlo simulation. A series of examples are
 presented.   Copyright 1987 by The Econometric Society.

Title:   A Concept of Egalitarianism under Participation Constraints. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 615-35
Issue: 3
Volume: 57
Year: 1989
Month:  May 
Abstract:
  A concept of an egalitarian solution is developed within the framework of
 cooperative game theory. The solution is designed to capture the interplay
 between social values (in this case, egalitarianism) and individual
 behavior. Both the final outcomes possible coalitional deviations are
 constrained by these social norms. The authors' main result: despite using
 a partial order (the Lorenz criterion) to compare allocations, their
 solution concept yields at most one allocation for each game. The concept
 is illustrated by a detailed study of convex games, and by a number of
 examples and applications.   Copyright 1989 by The Econometric Society.

Issue: 5
Volume: 62
Year: 1994
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  The authors study repeated games in which players observe a public
 outcome that imperfectly signals the actions played. They provide
 conditions guaranteeing that any feasible, individually rational payoff
 vector of the stage game can arise as a perfect equilibrium of the
 repeated game with sufficiently little discounting. The central condition
 requires that there exist action profiles with the property that, for any
 two players, no two deviations--one by either player--give rise to the
 same probability distribution over public outcomes. The results apply to
 principal-agent, partnership, oligopoly, and mechanism-design models, and
 to one-shot games with transferable utilities.   Copyright 1994 by The Econometric Society.

Title:   The Dynamics of Incentive Contracts. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 1153-75
Issue: 5
Volume: 56
Year: 1988
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  This paper studies a two-period principal/agent relationship run by
 short-term contracts. The principal updates the incentive scheme aft er
 observing the agent's first-period performance. The agent has superio r
 information about his ability. The principal offers a first-period
 incentive scheme and observes some measure of the agent's first-perio d
 performance (cost or profit), which depends on the agent's ability an d
 (unobservable) first-period effort. The central theme is that the ratchet
 effect leads to much pooling. For any first-period incentive scheme, there
 exists no separating equilibrium. The paper gives necessary and sufficient
 conditions for the existence of partition equilibria and looks at the
 effect of cost uncertainty.   Copyright 1988 by The Econometric Society.

Abstract:
  In this paper, the feasibility of estimating a Nash labor market
 equilibrium model using only information on workers is demonstrated. The
 equilibrium model, adapted from Albrecht and Axell (1984), is based on
 workers who are homogenous in terms of market productivity and
 heterogeneous in terms of nonmarket productivity, and on firms that are
 heterogeneous in terms of productive efficiency. The equilibrium model is
 contrasted with an unrestricted version of the model in terms of its fit
 to the data.   Copyright 1990 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Experimental Analysis of Neighborhood Effects 
Abstract:
				 Families, primarily female-headed minority
 households with children, living in high-poverty public housing projects
 in five U.S. cities were offered housing vouchers by lottery in the Moving
 to Opportunity program. Four to seven years after random assignment,
 families offered vouchers lived in safer neighborhoods that had lower
 poverty rates than those of the control group not offered vouchers. We
 find no significant overall effects of this intervention on adult economic
 self-sufficiency or physical health. Mental health benefits of the voucher
 offers for adults and for female youth were substantial. Beneficial
 effects for female youth on education, risky behavior, and physical health
 were offset by adverse effects for male youth. For outcomes that exhibit
 significant treatment effects, we find, using variation in treatment
 intensity across voucher types and cities, that the relationship between
 neighborhood poverty rate and outcomes is approximately linear. Copyright The Econometric Society 2007.

Title: On Forward Induction 
Abstract:
				 A player's pure strategy is called
 relevant for an outcome of a game in extensive form with perfect recall if
 there exists a weakly sequential equilibrium with that outcome for which
 the strategy is an optimal reply at every information set it does not
 exclude. The outcome satisfies forward induction if it results from a
 weakly sequential equilibrium in which players' beliefs assign positive
 probability only to relevant strategies at each information set reached by
 a profile of relevant strategies. We prove that if there are two players
 and payoffs are generic, then an outcome satisfies forward induction if
 every game with the same reduced normal form after eliminating redundant
 pure strategies has a sequential equilibrium with an equivalent outcome.
 Thus in this case forward induction is implied by decision-theoretic
 criteria. Copyright  2009 The Econometric Society.

Title:   Estimating the Return to Schooling: Progress on Some Persistent Econometric Problems. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 1127-60
Issue: 5
Volume: 69
Year: 2001
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  This paper reviews a set of recent studies that have attempted to measure
 the causal effect of education on labor market earnings by using
 institutional features of the supply side of the education system as
 exogenous determinants of schooling outcomes. A simple theoretical model
 that highlights the role of comparative advantage in the optimal schooling
 decision is presented and used to motivate an extended discussion of
 econometric issues, including the properties of ordinary least squares and
 instrumental variables estimators. A review of studies that have used
 compulsory schooling laws, differences in the accessibility of schools,
 and similar features as instrumental variables for completed education,
 reveals that the resulting estimates of the return to schooling are
 typically as big or bigger than the corresponding ordinary least squares
 estimates. One interpretation of this finding is that marginal returns to
 education among the low-education subgroups typically affected by
 supply-side innovations tend to be relatively high, reflecting their high
 marginal costs of schooling, rather than low ability that limits their
 return to education.

Title:   Tail Behavior of Regression Estimators and Their Breakdown Points. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 1195-1214
Issue: 5
Volume: 58
Year: 1990
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  A measure of finite sample estimator performance based on the probability
 of large deviations is introduced. The tail performance of the least
 squares estimator is studied in detail, and the authors find that it
 achieves good tail performance under strictly Gaussian conditions, but
 performance is extremely poor in the case of heavy-tailed error
 distributions. Turning to the tail behavior of various robust estimators,
 they focus on tail performance under heavy (algebraic) tail errors.
 Perhaps most significantly, it is shown that the authors' finite-sample
 measure of tail performance is, for heavy tailed error distributions,
 essentially the same as the finite sample concept of breakdown point
 introduced by D. L. Donoho and P. J. Huber (1983). Coauthors are Jana
 Jureckova, Roger Koenker, and Stephen Portnoy.   Copyright 1990 by The Econometric Society.

Month:  March 
Abstract:
  This paper uses the Panel Study of Income Dynamics to test whether
 risk-sharing is complete between or within American families. The tests
 accommodate wide variety in the configuration and availability of family
 data. The test results reject inter- as well as intra-family full
 risk-sharing even assuming that leisure is endogenous or that leisure and
 consumption are nonseparable.	 Copyright 1996 by The Econometric Society.

Title:   On the Normalization of Structural Equations: Properties of Direct Estimators. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 1181-94
Issue: 5
Volume: 58
Year: 1990
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  In a single structural equation, only the direction of the vector of
 coefficients of the endogenous variables is determined. Estimators for
 that direction can be defined directly, but are also induced by classical
 estimators that embody the traditional normalization rule. Exact
 distribution results show that the properties of estimators that depend on
 the usual normalization rule--which gives special emphasis to a particular
 direction--are distorted by that dependence, while those of the direct
 estimators are not. Thus, the traditional normalization rule may serve to
 define the parameters of interest, but should not be embodied in the
 estimation procedure.	 Copyright 1990 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Revealed Altruism  			  					  				 
Abstract:
				 This paper develops a nonparametric theory
 of preferences over one's own and others' monetary payoffs. We introduce
 "more altruistic than" (MAT), a partial ordering over such preferences,
 and interpret it with known parametric models. We also introduce and
 illustrate "more generous than" (MGT), a partial ordering over opportunity
 sets. Several recent studies focus on two-player extensive form games of
 complete information in which the first mover (FM) chooses a more or less
 generous opportunity set for the second mover (SM). Here reciprocity can
 be formalized as the assertion that an MGT choice by the FM will elicit
 MAT preferences in the SM. A further assertion is that the effect on
 preferences is stronger for acts of commission by FM than for acts of
 omission. We state and prove propositions on the observable consequences
 of these assertions. Finally, empirical support for the propositions is
 found in existing data from investment and dictator games, the carrot and
 stick game, and the Stackelberg duopoly game and in new data from
 Stackelberg mini-games. Copyright The Econometric Society 2008.

Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 651-66
Issue: 3
Volume: 60
Year: 1992
Month:  May 
Abstract:
  The authors analyze the evolution of duopolists' prices and market shares
 in an infinite-period market with consumer switching costs in which in
 every period new consumers arrive and a fraction of old consumers leaves.
 They show prices (and profits) are higher than without switching costs and
 that this result does not depend importantly on their specific
 assumptions. The authors show switching costs make the market more
 attractive to a new entrant, even though an entrant must overcome the
 disadvantage that a large fraction of the market is already committed to
 the incumbent's product. They also examine the effects of market growth.   Copyright 1992 by The Econometric Society.

Issue: 2
Volume: 64
Year: 1996

Abstract:
  This paper examines the effect of cash transfers and food stamp benefits
 on welfare participation and the labor supply of husbands and wives in
 two-parent families. The estimates are used to determine the magnitude of
 the work disincentive effects of the Aid to Families with Dependent
 Children Unemployed Parent (AFDC-UP) program, and to simulate the effects
 of changes in AFDC-UP benefit and eligibility rules on family labor supply
 and welfare participation. The results suggest that labor supply and
 welfare participation among two-parent families are highly responsive to
 changes in the benefit structure under the AFDC-UP program.   Copyright 1996 by The Econometric Society.

Title: The Mirrlees Approach to Mechanism Design with Renegotiation (with Applications to Hold-up and Risk Sharing) 
Abstract:
 The paper studies the implementation problem, first analyzed by Maskin and
 Moore (1999), in which two agents observe an unverifiable state of nature
 and may renegotiate inefficient outcomes following play of the mechanism.
 We develop a first-order approach to characterizing the set of
 implementable utility mappings in this problem, paralleling Mirrlees's
 (1971) first-order analysis of standard mechanism design problems. We use
 this characterization to study optimal contracting in hold-up and
 risk-sharing models. In particular, we examine when the contracting
 parties can optimally restrict attention to simple contracts, such as
 noncontingent contracts and option contracts (where only one agent sends a
 message). Copyright The Econometric Society 2002.

Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 265-306
Issue: 2
Volume: 69
Year: 2001
Month:  March 
Abstract:
  This paper suggests a behavioral definition of (subjective) ambiguity in
 an abstract setting where objects of choice are Savage-style acts. Then
 axioms are described that deliver probabilistic sophistication of
 preference on the set of unambiguous acts. In particular, both the domain
 and the values of the decision-maker's probability measure are derived
 from preference. It is argued that the noted result also provides a
 decision-theoretic foundation for the Knightian distinction between risk
 and ambiguity.

Title: Pivotal Statistics for Testing Structural Parameters in Instrumental Variables Regression 
Abstract:
 We propose a novel statistic for conducting joint tests on all the
 structural parameters in instrumental variables regression. The statistic
 is straightforward to compute and equals a quadratic form of the score of
 the concentrated log-likelihood. It therefore attains its minimal value
 equal to zero at the maximum likelihood estimator. The statistic has a
 &chi;-super-2 limiting distribution with a degrees of freedom parameter
 equal to the number of structural parameters. The limiting distribution
 does not depend on nuisance parameters. The statistic overcomes the
 deficiencies of the Anderson-Rubin statistic, whose limiting distribution
 has a degrees of freedom parameter equal to the number of instruments, and
 the likelihood based, Wald, likelihood ratio, and Lagrange multiplier
 statistics, whose limiting distributions depend on nuisance parameters.
 Size and power comparisons reveal that the statistic is a (asymptotic)
 size-corrected likelihood ratio statistic. We apply the statistic to the
 Angrist-Krueger (1991) data and find similar results as in Staiger and
 Stock (1997). Copyright The Econometric Society 2002.

Title:   Convergence to Efficiency in a Simple Market with Incomplete Information. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 1041-63
Issue: 5
Volume: 62
Year: 1994
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  A model with m buyers and m sellers is considered in which price is set
 to equate revealed demand and supply. In a Bayesian Nash equilibrium, each
 trader acts not as a price-taker but instead misrepresents his true
 demand/supply to influence price in his favor. This causes inefficiency.
 The authors show that, in any equilibrium, the amount by which a trader
 misreports is O(1/m) and the corresponding inefficiency is
 O(1/m[squared]). The indeterminacy and the inefficiency that is caused by
 the traders' bargaining behavior in small markets, thus, rapidly vanishes
 as the market increases in size.   Copyright 1994 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Robustly Collusion-Proof Implementation 
Abstract:
				 A contract with multiple agents may be
 susceptible to collusion. We show that agents' collusion imposes no cost
 in a large class of circumstances with risk neutral agents, including both
 uncorrelated and correlated types. In those circumstances, any payoff the
 principal can attain in the absence of collusion, including the
 second-best level, can be attained in the presence of collusion in a way
 robust to many aspects of collusion behavior. The collusion-proof
 implementation generalizes to a setting in which only a subset of agents
 may collude, provided that noncollusive agents' incentives can be
 protected via an ex post incentive compatible and ex post individually
 rational mechanism. Our collusion-proof implementation also sheds light on
 the extent to which hierarchical delegation of contracts can optimally
 respond to collusion. Copyright The Econometric Society 2006.

Abstract:
 In a differential information economy with quasi-linear utilities,
 monetary transfers facilitate the fulfillment of incentive compatibility
 constraints: the associated ex ante core is generically nonempty. However,
 we exhibit a well-behaved exchange economy in which this core is empty,
 even if goods are allocated through random mechanisms. Copyright The Econometric Society 2002.

Title: Efficient Estimation of Average Treatment Effects Using the Estimated Propensity Score 
Abstract:
				 We are interested in estimating the
 average effect of a binary treatment on a scalar outcome. If assignment to
 the treatment is exogenous or unconfounded, that is, independent of the
 potential outcomes given covariates, biases associated with simple
 treatment-control average comparisons can be removed by adjusting for
 differences in the covariates. Rosenbaum and Rubin (1983) show that
 adjusting solely for differences between treated and control units in the
 propensity score removes all biases associated with differences in
 covariates. Although adjusting for differences in the propensity score
 removes all the bias, this can come at the expense of efficiency, as shown
 by Hahn (1998), Heckman, Ichimura, and Todd (1998), and Robins, Mark, and
 Newey (1992). We show that weighting by the inverse of a nonparametric
 estimate of the propensity score, rather than the true propensity score,
 leads to an efficient estimate of the average treatment effect. We provide
 intuition for this result by showing that this estimator can be
 interpreted as an empirical likelihood estimator that efficiently
 incorporates the information about the propensity score. Copyright The Econometric Society 2003.

Title: Instrumental Variables Estimates of the Effect of Subsidized Training on the Quantiles of Trainee Earnings 
Abstract:
 This paper reports estimates of the effects of JTPA training programs on
 the distribution of earnings. The estimation uses a new instrumental
 variable (IV) method that measures program impacts on quantiles. The
 quantile treatment effects (QTE) estimator reduces to quantile regression
 when selection for treatment is exogenously determined. QTE can be
 computed as the solution to a convex linear programming problem, although
 this requires first-step estimation of a nuisance function. We develop
 distribution theory for the case where the first step is estimated
 nonparametrically. For women, the empirical results show that the JTPA
 program had the largest proportional impact at low quantiles. Perhaps
 surprisingly, however, JTPA training raised the quantiles of earnings for
 men only in the upper half of the trainee earnings distribution. Copyright The Econometric Society 2002.

Title: Multilateral Contracting with Externalities 
Abstract:
				 This paper proposes a model for
 multilateral contracting, where contracts are written and renegotiated
 over time, and where contracts may impose externalities on other agents.
 Equilibria always exist and the equilibrium value function is linear and
 monotonically increasing on the contracts. If the grand coalition, or
 contracting among all agents, is inefficient, we show that bargaining
 delays arise in positive-externality games and equilibrium inefficiency
 may remain bounded away from zero even as bargaining frictions converge to
 zero. Otherwise, if the grand coalition is efficient, there are no
 bargaining delays, convergence to the grand coalition occurs in a finite
 number of contracting rounds, and the outcome becomes efficient as players
 become more patient. Copyright The Econometric Society 2005.

Title:  Ironing, Sweeping, and Multidimensional Screening
Abstract: The authors provide existence proofs and characterization results for
	the multidimensional version of the multiproduct monopolist problem of M.
	Mussa and S, Rosen (1978). These results a are also directly applicable to
	the multidimensional nonlinear pricing problems studied by R. Wilson (1993)
	and M. Armstrong (1996). The authors establish that bunching is robust in
	these multidimensional screening problems, even with very regular
	distributions of types. They consequently design a new technique, the
	sweeping procedure, for dealing with bunching in multidimensional contexts.
	This technique extends the ironing procedure of Mussa and Rosen to several
	dimensions.

Title: End-of-Sample Instability Tests 
Abstract:
				 This paper considers tests for structural
 instability of short duration, such as at the end of the sample. The key
 feature of the testing problem is that the number, m, of observations in
 the period of potential change is relatively small-possibly as small as
 one. The well-known F test of Chow (1960) for this problem only applies in
 a linear regression model with normally distributed iid errors and
 strictly exogenous regressors, even when the total number of observations,
 n&plus;m, is large.				     Copyright The Econometric Society 2003.

Title: Dynamic Matching, Two-Sided Incomplete Information, and Participation Costs: Existence and Convergence to Perfect Competition 
Abstract:
				 Consider a decentralized, dynamic market
 with an infinite horizon and participation costs in which both buyers and
 sellers have private information concerning their values for the
 indivisible traded good. Time is discrete, each period has length &delta;,
 and, each unit of time, continuums of new buyers and sellers consider
 entry. Traders whose expected utility is negative choose not to enter.
 Within a period each buyer is matched anonymously with a seller and each
 seller is matched with zero, one, or more buyers. Every seller runs a
 first price auction with a reservation price and, if trade occurs, both
 the seller and the winning buyer exit the market with their realized
 utility. Traders who fail to trade continue in the market to be rematched.
 We characterize the steady-state equilibria that are perfect Bayesian. We
 show that, as &delta; converges to zero, equilibrium prices at which
 trades occur converge to the Walrasian price and the realized allocations
 converge to the competitive allocation. We also show the existence of
 equilibria for &delta; sufficiently small, provided the discount rate is
 small relative to the participation costs. Copyright The Econometric Society 2007.

Title:   Consistent Model Specification Tests: Omitted Variables and Semiparametric Functional Forms. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 865-90
Issue: 4
Volume: 64
Year: 1996
Month:  July 
Abstract:
  By using nonparametric kernel estimation method and a central limit
 theorem for degenerate U-statistics of order higher than two, the authors
 develop several consistent model specification tests in the context of a
 nonparametric regression model. These include tests for omitted variables,
 tests for a partially linear model, and tests for a semiparametric single
 index model. The asymptotic normality of the test statistics are
 established under the respective null hypotheses and consistent estimators
 of the asymptotic variances are provided.   Copyright 1996 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Semiparametric Power Envelopes for Tests of the Unit Root Hypothesis 
Abstract:
				 This paper derives asymptotic power
 envelopes for tests of the unit root hypothesis in a zero-mean AR(1)
 model. The power envelopes are derived using the limits of experiments
 approach and are semiparametric in the sense that the underlying error
 distribution is treated as an unknown infinite-dimensional nuisance
 parameter. Adaptation is shown to be possible when the error distribution
 is known to be symmetric and to be impossible when the error distribution
 is unrestricted. In the latter case, two conceptually distinct approaches
 to nuisance parameter elimination are employed in the derivation of the
 semiparametric power bounds. One of these bounds, derived under an
 invariance restriction, is shown by example to be sharp, while the other,
 derived under a similarity restriction, is conjectured not to be globally
 attainable. Copyright  2008 The Econometric Society.

Title: Repeated Games with Private Monitoring: Two Players 
Abstract:
				 We investigate two-player infinitely
 repeated games where the discount factor is less than but close to unity.
 Monitoring is private and players cannot communicate. We require no
 condition concerning the accuracy of players' monitoring technology. We
 show the folk theorem for the prisoners' dilemma with conditional
 independence. We also investigate more general games where players'
 private signals are correlated only through an unobservable macro shock.
 We show that efficiency is sustainable for generic private signal
 structures when the size of the set of private signals is sufficiently
 large. Finally, we show that cartel collusion is sustainable in
 price-setting duopoly. Copyright The Econometric Society 2004.

Abstract:
  The authors study the strategic equilibria of a negotiation game where

 externalities. The unique equilibrium of long, finitely repeated generic

 several stages before the deadline--or, in spite of the random element in
 the game, a well-defined buyer exists that obtains the object with
 probability close to one.   Copyright 1995 by The Econometric Society.

Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 851-76
Issue: 4
Volume: 56
Year: 1988
Month:  July 
Abstract:
  Consider a homogeneous product market where firms have private
 information about an uncertain demand parameter and compete in quan
 tities. The author examines the convergence properties of Bayesian-Co
 urnot equilibria as the economy is replicated and concludes that larg e
 Cournot (or almost competitive) markets do not aggregate informatio n
 efficiently except possibly when the production technology exhibits
 constant returns to scale. A competitive market is nevertheless cons
 trained efficient when taking as given the decentralized private info
 rmation structure of the economy. The results are shown to be robust to
 the consideration of endogenous information acquisition and to the
 addition of extra rounds of competition.   Copyright 1988 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Financial Market Globalization, Symmetry-Breaking, and Endogenous Inequality of Nations 
Abstract:
				 This paper investigates the effects of
 financial market globalization on the inequality of nations. The world
 economy consists of inherently identical countries, which differ only in
 their levels of capital stock. Each country is represented by the standard
 overlapping generations model, modified only to incorporate credit market
 imperfection. An integration of financial markets affects the set of
 stable steady states, as it changes the balance between the equalizing
 force of the diminishing returns technology and the unequalizing force of
 the wealth-dependent borrowing constraint. The model is tractable enough
 to allow for a complete characterization of the stable steady states. Copyright The Econometric Society 2004.

Pages: 1275-1304
Issue: 6
Volume: 55
Year: 1987

Abstract:
  In affiliated private value auctions, each bidder has perfect information
 regarding own value for the object at auction, but higher values of the
 item for one bid der make higher values for rivals more likely. The
 authors report on a series of experiments examining the following
 predictions: (1) in a first-price auction, public information about rivals
 valuations incr eases expected revenue, (2) an English auction institution
 increases expected revenue, (2) an English auction institution increases
 expect ed revenue compared to a first-price auction, and (3) a
 second-price auction is isomorphic to an English auction institution.
 Predictive a dequacy of several ad hoc bidding models are compared with
 Nash equil ibrium predictions.   Copyright 1987 by The Econometric Society.

Month:  March 
Abstract:
  The authors demonstrate existence of a perfect foresight equilibrium
 under borrowing constraints in a one-sector model with infinitely-lived
 heterogeneous agents. The class of admissible preferences includes, but is
 not limited to, recursive preferences. Existence is proven using a
 t$2Ctonnement argument under appropriate conditions on preferences and
 technology. A new measure of discounting, the norm of marginal impatience,
 is used to determine which technologies are admissible. Depending on the
 norm of marginal impatience, the admissible technology may either allow

Title:   Root- N-Consistent Semiparametric Regression. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 931-54
Issue: 4
Volume: 56
Year: 1988
Month:  July 
Abstract:
  One type of semiparametric regression is b8X A u(Z), where b and u(Z) are
 an unknown slope coefficient vector and function. Estimates of b based on
 incorrect parametrization of u are generally inconsist ent, whereas
 consistent nonparametric estimates converge slowly. An e stimate, bC, is
 constructed by inserting nonpar-ametric regression es timates in the
 nonlinear orthogonal projection on Z. Under regularity conditions bC is
 shown to be N1/2-consistent for b and asymptoticall y normal, and a
 consistent estimate of its limiting covariance matrix is given. The author
 discusses the identification problem and bC's e fficiency. Extensions to
 other econometric models are described.   Copyright 1988 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Tests for Unit Roots and the Initial Condition 
Abstract:
				 The paper analyzes the impact of the
 initial condition on the problem of testing for unit roots. To this end,
 we derive a family of optimal tests that maximize a weighted average power
 criterion with respect to the initial condition. We then investigate the
 relationship of this optimal family to popular tests. We find that many
 unit root tests are closely related to specific members of the optimal
 family, but the corresponding members employ very different weightings for
 the initial condition. The popular Dickey-Fuller tests, for instance, put
 a large weight on extreme deviations of the initial observation from the
 deterministic component, whereas other popular tests put more weight on
 moderate deviations. Since the power of unit root tests varies
 dramatically with the initial condition, this paper explains the results
 of comparative power studies of unit root tests. The results allow a much
 deeper understanding of the merits of particular tests in specific
 circumstances, and a guide to choosing which statistics to use in
 practice. Copyright The Econometric Society 2003.

Journal: Econometrica

Volume: 69
Year: 2001
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  We study efficient, Bayes--Nash incentive compatible mechanisms in a
 social choice setting that allows for informational and allocative
 externalities. We show that such mechanisms exist only if a congruence
 condition relating private and social rates of information substitution is
 satisfied. If signals are multi-dimensional, the congruence condition is
 determined by an integrability constraint, and it can hold only in
 nongeneric cases where values are private or a certain symmetry assumption
 holds. If signals are one-dimensional, the congruence condition reduces to
 a monotonicity constraint and it can be generically satisfied. We apply
 the results to the study of multi-object auctions, and we discuss why such
 auctions cannot be reduced to one-dimensional models without loss of
 generality.

Title: Signaling and Election Motivations in a Voting Model with Common Values and Responsive Candidates 
Abstract:
				 In this paper we focus on strategic voting
 behavior when both an election and a signaling motivation affect voters'
 behavior. We analyze a model of elections with two candidates competing on
 a one-dimensional policy space. Voters are privately and imperfectly
 informed about a common shock affecting the electorate's preferences.
 Candidates are assumed to choose policy in response to information gleaned
 from election results and according to exogenous factors that may lead to
 polarization in candidates' policy choices. We analyze a subset of
 symmetric equilibria in which strategies are symmetric to candidates'
 names and private signals (CSS equilibria). We show that signaling and
 election motivations pull voters to vote in different directions. We
 provide conditions that show the relation between the amount of
 information aggregated in the election and the motivation that influences
 voting behavior the most. Finally, we show that when candidates are
 responsive and polarized, all CSS equilibria are inefficient in the limit. Copyright The Econometric Society 2003.

Volume: 56

Abstract:
  The authors provide game theoretic foundations for the classic kinke d
 demand curve and Edgeworth cycle. In their alternating-move model, there
 are multiple Markov perfect equilibria of both the kinked deman d curve
 and Edgeworth cycle variety. In any Markov perfect equilibria , profit is
 bounded away from the Bertrand equilibria level. A kinked demand curve at
 the monopoly price is the unique symmetric "renegot iation proof"
 equilibrium when there is little discounting. The auth ors then endogenize
 the timing by allowing firms to move at any time. They find that firms end
 up alternating, thus vindicating the fixed timing assumption of the
 simpler model.   Copyright 1988 by The Econometric Society.

Abstract:
  This paper uses cross-sectional and longitudinal data to examine
 differences in pay for equally-skilled workers in different ind ustries.
 The major finding is that there is substantial dispersion in wages across
 industries, even after allowing for measured and unmeas ured labor
 quality, working conditions, fringe benefits, transitory d emand shocks,
 the threat of union-ization, union bargaining power, fi rm size, and other
 factors. In addition, evidence is presented demons trating that turnover
 has a negative relationship with industry wage differentials. These
 findings suggest that workers in high-wage indus tries receive
 noncompetitive rents.	 Copyright 1988 by The Econometric Society.

Title: The Effects of Random and Discrete Sampling when Estimating Continuous--Time Diffusions 
Abstract:
 High--frequency financial data are not only discretely sampled in time but
 the time separating successive observations is often random. We analyze
 the consequences of this dual feature of the data when estimating a
 continuous--time model. In particular, we measure the additional effects
 of the randomness of the sampling intervals over and beyond those due to
 the discreteness of the data. We also examine the effect of simply
 ignoring the sampling randomness. We find that in many situations the
 randomness of the sampling has a larger impact than the discreteness of
 the data. Copyright The Econometric Society 2003.

Title: Polarization: Concepts, Measurement, Estimation 
Abstract:
				 We develop the measurement theory of
 polarization for the case in which income distributions can be described
 using density functions. The main theorem uniquely characterizes a class
 of polarization measures that fits into what we call the
 "identity-alienation" framework, and simultanously satisfies a set of
 axioms. Second, we provide sample estimators of population polarization
 indices that can be used to compare polarization across time or entities.
 Distribution-free statistical inference results are also used in order to
 ensure that the orderings of polarization across entities are not simply
 due to sampling noise. An illustration of the use of these tools using
 data from 21 countries shows that polarization and inequality orderings
 can often differ in practice. Copyright The Econometric Society 2004.

Title: Strategic Experimentation with Exponential Bandits 
Abstract:
				 We analyze a game of strategic
 experimentation with two-armed bandits whose risky arm might yield payoffs
 after exponentially distributed random times. Free-riding causes an
 inefficiently low level of experimentation in any equilibrium where the
 players use stationary Markovian strategies with beliefs as the state
 variable. We construct the unique symmetric Markovian equilibrium of the
 game, followed by various asymmetric ones. There is no equilibrium where
 all players use simple cut-off strategies. Equilibria where players switch
 finitely often between experimenting and free-riding all yield a similar
 pattern of information acquisition, greater efficiency being achieved when
 the players share the burden of experimentation more equitably. When
 players switch roles infinitely often, they can acquire an approximately
 efficient amount of information, but still at an inefficient rate. In
 terms of aggregate payoffs, all these asymmetric equilibria dominate the
 symmetric one wherever the latter prescribes simultaneous use of both
 arms. Copyright The Econometric Society 2005.

Title:   An Asymptotic Theory of Bayesian Inference for Time Series. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 381-412
Issue: 2
Volume: 64
Year: 1996
Month:  March 
Abstract:
  A limiting representation of the Bayesian data density is obtained and
 shown to be the same general exponential form for a wide class of
 likelihoods and prior distributions. An embedding theorem is given which
 shows how to embed the exponential density in a continuous time process.
 From the embedding, the authors obtain a large sample approximation to the
 model of the data that corresponds to the exponential density. This has
 the form of discrete observations drawn from a nonlinear stochastic
 differential equation driven by Brownian motion. No assumptions concerning
 stationarity or rates of convergence are required in the asymptotics. Some
 implications for statistical testing are explored.   Copyright 1996 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Beliefs in Repeated Games 
Abstract:
				 Consider a two-player discounted
 infinitely repeated game. A player's belief is a probability distribution
 over the opponent's repeated game strategies. This paper shows that, for a
 large class of repeated games, there are no beliefs that satisfy three
 properties: learnability, a diversity of belief condition called CSP, and
 consistency. Loosely, if players learn to forecast the path of play
 whenever each plays a strategy that the other anticipates (in the sense of
 being in the support of that player's belief) and if the sets of
 anticipated strategies are sufficiently rich, then neither anticipates any
 of his opponent's best responses. This generalizes results in Nachbar
 (1997).				  Copyright The Econometric Society 2005.

Title:   Standard Risk Aversion. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 589-611
Issue: 3
Volume: 61
Year: 1993
Month:  May 
Abstract:
  This paper introduces the concept of standard risk aversion. A von
 Neumann-Morgenstern utility function has standard risk aversion if every
 risk that has a negative interaction with a small reduction in wealth also
 has a negative interaction with any undesirable, independent risk. It is
 shown that, given monotonicity and concavity, the combination of
 decreasing absolute risk aversion and decreasing absolute prudence is
 necessary and sufficient for standard risk aversion. Standard risk
 aversion is shown to imply not only Pratt and Zeckhauser's 'proper risk
 aversion' (an undesirable risk always remaining undesirable in the
 presence of an independent undesirable risk), but also that being forced
 to face an undesirable risk reduces the optimal investment in a risky
 security with an independent return.   Copyright 1993 by The Econometric Society.

Title:   Individual Risk and Mutual Insurance. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 333-41
Issue: 2
Volume: 64
Year: 1996
Month:  March 
Abstract:
  This paper examines how, in the presence of individual risk, economic
 efficiency can be achieved without an unrealistically large number of
 contingent markets. The authors show that consistency of beliefs and
 optimality of allocation can be guaranteed with an appropriate array of
 Arrow securities to spread collective risk and Malinvaud mutual insurance
 policies to pool individual risk. If there are N households (consisting of
 H types), each facing the possibility of being in S individual states
 together with T collective states, then ensuring Pareto optimality
 requires only H(S - 1)T independent mutual insurance policies plus T pure
 Arrow securities.   Copyright 1996 by The Econometric Society.

Month:  September 
Abstract:
  This paper explores the robustness of the essential economic conclusions
 of the Roy model of self-selection and income inequality to relaxation of
 its normality assumptions. A log concave version of the model reproduces
 most of the main results. Log convex cases offer counterexamples. The
 authors show that in a Roy economy, random assignment is inegalitarian and
 Pareto inefficient. They consider nonparametric identifiability of latent
 skill distributions with cross-section and panel data. The authors'
 analysis proves nonparametric identifiability for the closely related
 competing risks model.   Copyright 1990 by The Econometric Society.

Title:   Intertemporal Nonseparability or Borrowing Restrictions? A Disaggregate Analysis Using a U.S. Consumption Panel. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 1151-81
Issue: 5
Volume: 64
Year: 1996
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  The authors propose a method to test for liquidity constraints that
 relies on using the within period marginal rate of substitution condition
 as a benchmark to evaluate the intertemporal Euler equation. If spot
 markets for nondurable goods exist but financial markets are imperfect,
 the comparison of first-order conditions involving the relevant spot and
 intertemporal prices can be used to detect the imperfection. The authors
 apply their methodology to a large sample of U.S. households, allowing for
 a general nonseparable preference structure. Their estimates do not
 indicate the presence of liquidity constraints, with the possible
 exception of young households.   Copyright 1996 by The Econometric Society.

Title:  Inference on Structural Parameters in Instrumental Variables Regression with Weak Instruments
Abstract: The authors consider the problem of making asymptotically valid
	inference on structural parameters in instrumental variables regression with
	weak instruments. Using local-to-zero asymptotics, they derive the asymptotic
	distributions of likelihood ratio (LR) and Lagrange multiplier (LM) type
	statistics for testing simple hypotheses on structural parameters based on
	maximum likelihood and generalized methods of moments estimation methods. In
	contrast to the nonstandard limiting behavior of Wald statistics, the
	limiting distributions of certain LR and LM statistics are bounded by a
	chi-square distribution with degrees of freedom given by the number of
	instruments.

Title: Information and Efficiency in Tender Offers 
Abstract:
				 We analyze tender offers where privately
 informed shareholders are uncertain about the raider's ability to improve
 firm value. The raider suffers a "lemons problem" in that, for any price
 offered, only shareholders who are relatively pessimistic about the value
 of the firm tender their shares. Consequently, the raider finds it too
 costly to induce shareholders to tender when their information is
 positive. In the limit as the number of shareholders gets arbitrarily
 large, when private benefits are relatively low, the tender offer is
 unsuccessful if the takeover has the potential to create value. The
 takeover market is therefore inefficient. In contrast, when private
 benefits of control are high, the tender offer allocates the firm to any
 value-increasing raider, but may also allow inefficient takeovers to
 occur. Unlike the case where all information is symmetric, shareholders
 cannot always extract the entire surplus from the acquisition. Copyright  2008 The Econometric Society.

Title: Imperfect Monitoring and Impermanent Reputations 
Abstract:
				 We study the long-run sustainability of
 reputations in games with imperfect public monitoring. It is impossible to
 maintain a permanent reputation for playing a strategy that does not play
 an equilibrium of the game without uncertainty about types. Thus, a player
 cannot indefinitely sustain a reputation for noncredible behavior in the
 presence of imperfect monitoring.				 Copyright The Econometric Society 2004.

Abstract:
  The authors estimate the effect of training on the probability of em

 aining Act program. Their analysis uses Social Security earnings data from
 1970 to 1979 for trainees and a comparison group. In addition t o simple
 pre- versus post-training comparisons of employment probabil ities for
 trainees and controls, the authors present logistic regress ion models
 with fixed and random effects for individual heterogeneity . They conclude
 that program participation increased the probability of employment by 2 to
 5 percentage points, with larger effects for cl assroom versus
 nonclassroom programs.   Copyright 1988 by The Econometric Society.

Title:  A Three-Step Method for Choosing the Number of Bootstrap Repetitions
Abstract:   This paper considers the problem of choosing the number of
 bootstrap repetitions B for bootstrap standard errors, confidence
 intervals, confidence regions, hypothesis tests, p-values, and bias
 correction.  For each of these problems, the paper provides a
 three-step method for choosing B to achieve a desired level of
 accuracy. Accuracy is measured by the percentage deviation of the
 bootstrap standard error estimate, confidence interval length,
 test's critical value, test's p-value, or bias-corrected estimate
 based on B bootstrap simulations from the corresponding ideal
 bootstrap quantities for which B = infinity. The results apply to
 parametric, semiparametric, and nonparametric models with
 independent or dependent data.

Title:  Nonparametric Estimation of Triangular Simultaneous Equations Models	
Journal: Econometrica
Abstract:
  This paper presents a simple two-step nonparametric estimator for a
  triangular simultaneous equation model. The authors use series approximations
  that exploit the additive structure of the model. The first step comprises
  the nonparametric estimation of the reduced form and the corresponding
  residuals. The second step is the estimation of the primary equation via
  nonparametric regression with the reduced form residuals included as a
  regressor. The authors derive consistency and asymptotic normality results
  for their estimator, including optimal convergence rates. An empirical
  example, on the relationship between the hourly wage rate and hours worked,
  illustrates the utility of the authors' approach.

Abstract:
  A structural consumption model incorporating endogenous liquidity
 constraints is fit to a cross section of 798 U.S. families. Liquidity
 constrained families are estimated to constitute 19.4 percent of the
 population sampled, a group that accounts for 16.7 percent of consumption
 in the population sampled. In-sample simulations of the model suggest that
 a temporary tax has three to four times more impact on aggregate
 consumption than it would if liquidity constraints were not in effect.   Copyright 1987 by The Econometric Society.

Title:   Credit-Worthiness Tests and Interbank Competition. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 429-52
Issue: 2
Volume: 58
Year: 1990
Month:  March 
Abstract:
  This paper analyzes a competitive credit market where banks use imperfect
 and independent tests to assess the ability of a potential creditor to
 repay credit. The banks compete by announcing interest rates at which they
 will provide credit to those applicants who pass the banks' tests. The
 proportion of applicants who pass the test of at least one bank increases
 with the number of banks providing credit, so the average
 credit-worthiness decreases. It is then shown that in a situation where
 all banks charge the same interest rate, a bank always has the incentive
 to undercut in order to improve the average credit-worthiness of its own
 clientele. This feature represents the major difference from the
 situations in standard Bertrand and Bertrand-Edgeworth models.   Copyright 1990 by The Econometric Society.

Title: The Bootstrap and the Edgeworth Correction for Semiparametric Averaged Derivatives  					 
Abstract:
				 In a number of semiparametric models,
 smoothing seems necessary in order to obtain estimates of the parametric
 component which are asymptotically normal and converge at parametric rate.
 However, smoothing can inflate the error in the normal approximation, so
 that refined approximations are of interest, especially in sample sizes
 that are not enormous. We show that a bootstrap distribution achieves a
 valid Edgeworth correction in the case of density-weighted averaged
 derivative estimates of semiparametric index models. Approaches to bias
 reduction are discussed. We also develop a higher-order expansion to show
 that the bootstrap achieves a further reduction in size distortion in the
 case of two-sided testing. The finite-sample performance of the methods is
 investigated by means of Monte Carlo simulations from a Tobit model. Copyright The Econometric Society 2005.

Title: On the Failure of the Bootstrap for Matching Estimators 
Abstract:
				 Matching estimators are widely used in
 empirical economics for the evaluation of programs or treatments.
 Researchers using matching methods often apply the bootstrap to calculate
 the standard errors. However, no formal justification has been provided
 for the use of the bootstrap in this setting. In this article, we show
 that the standard bootstrap is, in general, not valid for matching
 estimators, even in the simple case with a single continuous covariate
 where the estimator is root-N consistent and asymptotically normally
 distributed with zero asymptotic bias. Valid inferential methods in this
 setting are the analytic asymptotic variance estimator of Abadie and
 Imbens (2006a) as well as certain modifications of the standard bootstrap,
 like the subsampling methods in Politis and Romano (1994).		     Copyright  2008 The Econometric Society.

Title: Semi-Nonparametric IV Estimation of Shape-Invariant Engel Curves 
Abstract:
				 This paper studies a shape-invariant Engel
 curve system with endogenous total expenditure, in which the
 shape-invariant specification involves a common shift parameter for each
 demographic group in a pooled system of nonparametric Engel curves. We
 focus on the identification and estimation of both the nonparametric
 shapes of the Engel curves and the parametric specification of the
 demographic scaling parameters. The identification condition relates to
 the bounded completeness and the estimation procedure applies the sieve
 minimum distance estimation of conditional moment restrictions, allowing
 for endogeneity. We establish a new root mean squared convergence rate for
 the nonparametric instrumental variable regression when the endogenous
 regressor could have unbounded support. Root-n asymptotic normality and
 semiparametric efficiency of the parametric components are also given
 under a set of "low-level" sufficient conditions. Our empirical
 application using the U.K. Family Expenditure Survey shows the importance
 of adjusting for endogeneity in terms of both the nonparametric curvatures
 and the demographic parameters of systems of Engel curves.		     Copyright The Econometric Society 2007.

Title:   Why Are Certain Properties of Binary Relations Relatively More Common in Natural Language? 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 343-55
Issue: 2
Volume: 64
Year: 1996
Month:  March 
Abstract:
  The aim of this paper is to explain the fact that certain properties of
 binary relations are frequently observed in natural language while others
 do not appear at all. Three features of binary relation are studied: (1)
 The ability to use the relation to indicate nameless elements. (2) The
 accuracy with which the vocabulary spanned by the relation can be used to
 approximate the actual terms to which a user of the language wishes to
 refer. (3) The ease with which the relation can be described by means of
 examples. It is argued that linear orderings are optimal according to the
 first criteria while asymmetric relations are optimal according to second.
 From among complete and asymmetric relations (tournaments) those which are
 transitive are optimal according to the third criterion.   Copyright 1996 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Consumption Over the Life Cycle 
Abstract:
 This paper estimates a structural model of optimal life-cycle consumption
 expenditures in the presence of realistic labor income uncertainty. We
 employ synthetic cohort techniques and Consumer Expenditure Survey data to
 construct average age-profiles of consumption and income over the working
 lives of typical households across different education and occupation
 groups. The model fits the profiles quite well. In addition to providing
 reasonable estimates of the discount rate and risk aversion, we find that
 consumer behavior changes strikingly over the life cycle. Young consumers
 behave as buffer-stock agents. Around age 40, the typical household starts
 accumulating liquid assets for retirement and its behavior mimics more
 closely that of a certainty equivalent consumer. Our methodology provides
 a natural decomposition of saving and wealth into its precautionary and
 life-cycle components. Copyright The Econometric Society 2002.

Title:   Characterizing Selection Bias Using Experimental Data	
Abstract: Semiparametric methods are developed to estimate the bias that arises
	from using nonexperimental comparison groups to evaluate social programs and
	to test the identifying assumptions that justify matching, selection models
	and the method of difference in differences. Using data from an experiment on
	a prototypical social program and data from nonexperimental comparison
	groups, the authors reject the assumptions justifying matching and their
	extensions of it.  The evidence supports the selection bias model and the
	assumptions that justify a semiparametric version of the method of
	difference-in-differences. The authors extend their analysis to consider
	applications of the methods to ordinary observational data. Journal: Econometrica

Title:   An Algorithmic Theory of the Choice of Techniques. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 839-59
Issue: 4
Volume: 58
Year: 1990
Month:  July 
Abstract:
  The author builds a theory of the choice of techniques in joint
 production, at a given profit rate, considering a market algorithm.
 Partial results are extended by means of an abstract notion of technology,
 where techniques meet demand and satisfy local properties. Global results
 on the existence, uniqueness, and convergence towards an equilibrium
 technique are obtained. The author, thus, characterizes cases where a
 square technique is reached, which provides an answer to an old debate,
 initiated by W. S. Jevons, between classical and neoclassical economists.
 But the framework allows for a more general interpretation in terms of
 two-level planning procedures.   Copyright 1990 by The Econometric Society.

Abstract:
				 We present a general method for computing
 the set of supergame equilibria in infinitely repeated games with perfect
 monitoring and public randomization. We present a three-stage algorithm
 that constructs a convex set containing the set of equilibrium values,
 constructs another convex set contained in the set of equilibrium values,
 and produces strategies that support them. We explore the properties of
 this algorithm by applying it to familiar games. Copyright The Econometric Society 2003.

Title:   An Intertemporal General Equilibrium Asset Pricing Model: The Case of Diffusion Information. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 117-42
Issue: 1
Volume: 55
Year: 1987
Month:  January 
Abstract:
  This paper provides sufficient conditions for the equilibrium price
 system and a vector of exogenously specified state variable processes to
 form a diffusion process in a pure exchange economy. The conditions
 involve smoothness of agents' utility functions and certain nice
 properties of the aggregate endowment process and the dividend processes
 of traded assets. In place of the dynamic programming, a martingale
 representation technique is utilized to characterize equilibrium portfolio
 policies. This technique is useful even when there does not exist a finite
 dimensional Markov structure in the economy and thus the Markovian
 stochastic dynamic programming is not applicable. A gents are shown to
 hold certain hedging mutual funds and the riskless asset. In contrast to
 earlier results, the market portfolio does not have a special role in
 hedging, since the markets are dynamically complete. When there exists a
 finite dimensional Markov system in the economy, the dimension of the
 hedging demand identified through the Markovian dynamic programming may be
 much larger than that identified by the martingale method.   Copyright 1987 by The Econometric Society.

Month:  November 
Abstract:
  In a Bayesian model of learning, the more an agent uses a technology, the
 better he learns its parameters. This expertise is a form of human
 capital. Switching to a new technology temporarily reduces expertise: the
 bigger the leap, the bigger the loss. This may prevent the agent from
 climbing the technological ladder too fast. Someone skilled may want to
 stick to his technology and experience no growth in the long run. But
 someone less skilled may want to switch technologies over and over again
 and, therefore, enjoy long-run growth in output. Thus, the model can give
 rise to overtaking.   Copyright 1996 by The Econometric Society.

Abstract:
  Consider an economy with one public enterprise that is subject to a
 budgetary constraint and charges prices according to the first-order
 necessary conditions suggested by M. Boiteux (1956) or F. P.  Ramsey
 (1927). The authors state conditions sufficient to ensure that the
 resulting allocation is second best. The proof builds on arguments used to
 demonstrate the Pareto efficiency of marginal cost pricing under
 appropriate assumptions.   Copyright 1991 by The Econometric Society.

Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 411-32
Issue: 2
Volume: 56
Year: 1988
Month:  March 
Abstract:
  This paper analyzes aspects of optimal fiscal policy for economies with
 capital ac cumulation and finitely-lived, heterogeneous agents. For a
 particular utilitarian social welfare function, the problem faced by a
 central planner can be broken down into two subproblems: a standard
 problem o f optimally allocating aggregate consumption over time and a
 problem of distributing aggregate consumption optimally at each moment
 among those alive. If it can use a sufficiently rich set of lump-sum taxes
 and transfers, the government can replicate the command optimum as a
 market equilibrium outcome. No issue of government debt is needed to
 achieve this decentralization.   Copyright 1988 by The Econometric Society.

Title:  Asymptotic Theory of Integrated Conditional Moment Tests
Abstract: In this article, the authors show that a generalized version of H. J.
	Bierens' integrated conditional moment (ICM) test of functional form has
	nontrivial root-n local power, where n is the sample size, and that for a
	class of large local alternatives the consistent ICM test is more powerful
	than the parametric t test in a neighborhood of the parametric alternative
	involved. Moreover, they show that, under the assumption of normal errors,
	the ICM test is asymptotically admissible. Furthermore, since the null
	distribution of the ICM test is case dependent, the authors derive
	case-independent upperbounds of the critical values.

Title: Is There a Curse of Dimensionality for Contraction Fixed Points in the Worst Case? 
Abstract:
   This paper analyzes the complexity of the "contraction fixed point
 problem": compute an epsilon-approximation to the fixed point
 "V"*Gamma("V"*) of a contraction mapping Gamma that maps a Banach space
 "B-sub-d" of continuous functions of "d" variables into itself. We focus
 on "quasi linear contractions" where Gamma is a nonlinear functional of a
 finite number of conditional expectation operators. This class includes
 contractive Fredholm integral equations that arise in asset pricing
 applications and the contractive Bellman equation from dynamic
 programming. In the absence of further restrictions on the domain of
 Gamma, the quasi linear fixed point problem is subject to the curse of
 dimensionality, i.e., in the worst case the minimal number of function
 evaluations and arithmetic operations required to compute an
 epsilon-approximation to a fixed point "V"* is an element of "B-sub-d"
 increases exponentially in "d". We show that the curse of dimensionality
 disappears if the domain of Gamma has additional special structure. We
 identify a particular type of special structure for which the problem is
 "strongly tractable" even in the worst case, i.e., the number of function
 evaluations and arithmetic operations needed to compute an
 epsilon-approximation of "V"* is bounded by "C"epsilon-super- - "p" where
 "C" and "p" are constants independent of "d". We present examples of
 economic problems that have this type of special structure including a
 class of rational expectations asset pricing problems for which the
 optimal exponent "p"1 is nearly achieved.   Copyright The Econometric Society 2002.

Title: Estimation of Nonlinear Models with Measurement Error 
Abstract:
				 This paper presents a solution to an
 important econometric problem, namely the root n consistent estimation of
 nonlinear models with measurement errors in the explanatory variables,
 when one repeated observation of each mismeasured regressor is available.
 While a root n consistent estimator has been derived for polynomial
 specifications (see Hausman, Ichimura, Newey, and Powell (1991)), such an
 estimator for general nonlinear specifications has so far not been
 available. Using the additional information provided by the repeated
 observation, the suggested estimator separates the measurement error from
 the "true" value of the regressors thanks to a useful property of the
 Fourier transform: The Fourier transform converts the integral equations
 that relate the distribution of the unobserved "true" variables to the
 observed variables measured with error into algebraic equations. The
 solution to these equations yields enough information to identify
 arbitrary moments of the "true," unobserved variables. The value of these
 moments can then be used to construct any estimator that can be written in
 terms of moments, including traditional linear and nonlinear least squares
 estimators, or general extremum estimators. The proposed estimator is
 shown to admit a representation in terms of an influence function, thus
 establishing its root n consistency and asymptotic normality. Monte Carlo
 evidence and an application to Engel curve estimation illustrate the
 usefulness of this new approach.			        Copyright Econometric Society 2004.

Title:   Household Composition, Labor Markets, and Labor Demand: Testing for Separation in Agricultural Household Models. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 287-322
Issue: 2
Volume: 60
Year: 1992
Month:  March 
Abstract:
  This paper tests the separation of farm labor supply and labor demand
 decisions, using the observation that household composition is an
 important determinant of farm labor use with nonseparation. After
 assessing the conditions under which the test has power against several
 alternatives, an empirical model is developed to test the proposition that
 farm employment is independent of family composition. The model is
 estimated on a data set from rural Java. The null hypothesis that farm
 labor allocation decisions are independent of household structure is not
 rejected. The results are robust to different specifications of the labor
 demand function.   Copyright 1992 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Dynamic Monetary Equilibrium in a Random Matching Economy 
Abstract:
 This article concerns an infinite horizon economy where trade must occur
 pairwise, using a double auction mechanism, and where fiat money overcomes
 lack of double coincidence of wants. Traders are anonymous and lack market
 power. Goods are divisible and perishable, and are consumed at every date.
 Preferences are defined by utility-stream overtaking. Money is divisible
 and not subject to inventory constraints. The evolution of individual and
 economywide money holdings distributions is characterized. There is a
 welfare-ordered continuum of single price equilibria, reflecting
 indeterminacy of the price level rather than of relative prices. Copyright The Econometric Society 2002.

Abstract:
  The authors introduce a class of alternating-move, infinite-horizon
 models of duopoly. The timing captures the presence of short-run
 commitment s. They apply this framework to a natural monopoly in which
 costs are so large that at most one firm can make a profit. The firms
 install short-run capacity. In the unique symmetric Markov perfect
 equilibriu m, only one firm is active and practices the quantity analogue
 of lim it pricing. For commitments of brief duration, the market is almost
 c ontestable. The authors conclude with a discussion of more general mo
 dels where the alternating timing is derived rather than imposed.   Copyright 1988 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Dummy Endogenous Variables in Weakly Separable Models 
Abstract:
				 In this paper, we consider the
 nonparametric identification and estimation of the average effect of a
 dummy endogenous regressor in models where the regressors are weakly but
 not additively separable from the error term. The model is not required to
 be strictly increasing in the error term, and the class of models
 considered includes limited dependent variable models such as discrete
 choice models. Conditions are established conditions under which it is
 possible to identify the average effect of the dummy endogenous regressor
 in a weakly separable model without relying on parametric functional form
 or distributional assumptions and without the use of large support
 conditions. Copyright The Econometric Society 2007.

Title:   Consistent Moment Selection Procedures for Generalized Method of Moments Estimation	
Journal: Econometrica
Abstract:
  This paper considers a generalized method of moments (GMM) estimation problem
  in which one has a vector of moment conditions, some of which are correct and
  some incorrect. The paper introduces several procedures for consistently
  selecting the correct moment conditions.  Application of the results of the
  paper to instrumental variables estimation problems yields consistent
  procedures for selecting instrumental variables.  The paper specifies moment
  selection criteria that are GMM analogues of the widely used BIC and AIC
  model selection criteria. (The latter is not consistent.) The paper also
  considers downward and upward testing procedures.

Title: Reciprocal Upper Semicontinuity and Better Reply Secure Games: A Comment 
Abstract:
				 A convex, compact, and possibly

 introduce a very weak notion of continuity that can be used to establish
 that a game is better reply secure and we show that this notion of
 continuity is satisfied by a large class of games. Copyright The Econometric Society 2006.

Title: Complexity and Competition 
Abstract:
				 Extensive-form market games typically have
 a large number of noncompetitive equilibria. In this paper, we argue that
 the complexity of noncompetitive behavior provides a justification for
 competitive equilibrium in the sense that if rational agents have an
 aversion to complexity (at the margin), then maximizing behavior will
 result in simple behavioral rules and hence in a competitive outcome. For
 this purpose, we use a class of extensive-form dynamic matching and
 bargaining games with a finite number of agents. In particular, we
 consider markets with heterogeneous buyers and sellers and deterministic,
 exogenous, sequential matching rules, although the results can be extended
 to other matching processes. If the complexity costs of implementing
 strategies enter players' preferences lexicographically with the standard
 payoff, then every equilibrium strategy profile induces a competitive
 outcome. Copyright The Econometric Society 2005.

Title:   Term Structures of Credit Spreads with Incomplete Accounting Information. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 633-64
Issue: 3
Volume: 69
Year: 2001
Month:  May 
Abstract:
  We study the implications of imperfect information for term structures of
 credit spreads on corporate bonds. We suppose that bond investors cannot
 observe the issuer's assets directly, and receive instead only periodic
 and imperfect accounting reports. For a setting in which the assets of the
 firm are a geometric Brownian motion until informed equityholders
 optimally liquidate, we derive the conditional distribution of the assets,
 given accounting data and survivorship. Contrary to the
 perfect-information case, there exists a default-arrival intensity
 process. That intensity is calculated in terms of the conditional
 distribution of assets. Credit yield spreads are characterized in terms of
 accounting information. Generalizations are provided.

Pages: 681-717
Issue: 3
Volume: 63
Year: 1995
Month:  May 
Abstract:
  Using a simulated method of moments approach, the author evaluates a
 representative consumer asset pricing model in which the consumer is
 assumed to have time nonseparable preferences of several forms. Examining
 the model's implications for several moments  of asset returns, he finds
 evidence for the local substitution of consumption with habit formation
 occurring over longer periods of time. The interaction between these two
 effects is important. The author also shows that, when accounting for
 sampling error, a model with local substitution and long-run habit
 persistence is consistent with the Hansen and Jagannathan (1991) bounds.   Copyright 1995 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Uncertainty about Uncertainty and Delay in Bargaining 
Abstract:
				 We study a one-sided offers bargaining
 game in which the buyer has private information about the value of the
 object and the seller has private information about his beliefs about the
 buyer's valuation. We show that this uncertainty about uncertainties
 dramatically changes the set of outcomes. In particular, second order
 beliefs can lead to a delay in reaching agreement even when the seller
 makes frequent offers. We show that not all types of second order beliefs
 lead to a delay. When the buyer assigns positive probability to the seller
 knowing the buyer's value, then delay not only can occur, but it must
 occur for a class of equilibria. However, in all other cases delay will
 never occur.				     Copyright The Econometric Society 2005.

Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 981-1001
Issue: 4
Volume: 63
Year: 1995
Month:  July 
Abstract:
  This study demonstrates the possibility of ergodically chaotic optimal
 accumulation in the case in which future utilities are discounted
 arbitrarily weakly. For this purpose, the authors use a two-sector model
 with Leontief production functions and construct a condition under which
 the optimal transition function is unimodal and expansive. They
 demonstrate that the set of parameter values satisfying that condition is
 nonempty no matter how weakly the future utilities are discounted.   Copyright 1995 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Instrumental Variable Estimation of Nonlinear Errors-in-Variables Models 
Abstract:
				 This paper establishes that instruments
 enable the identification of nonparametric regression models in the
 presence of measurement error by providing a closed form solution for the
 regression function in terms of Fourier transforms of conditional
 expectations of observable variables. For parametrically specified
 regression functions, we propose a root n consistent and asymptotically
 normal estimator that takes the familiar form of a generalized method of
 moments estimator with a plugged-in nonparametric kernel density estimate.
 Both the identification and the estimation methodologies rely on Fourier
 analysis and on the theory of generalized functions. The finite-sample
 properties of the estimator are investigated through Monte Carlo
 simulations.				  Copyright The Econometric Society 2007.

Title:   Trimmed LAD and Least Squares Estimation of Truncated and Censored Regression Models with Fixed Effects. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 533-65
Issue: 3
Volume: 60
Year: 1992
Month:  May 
Abstract:
  This paper considers estimation of truncated.and censored regression
 models with fixed effects. Up until now, no estimator has been shown to be
 consistent as the cross-section dimension increases with the time
 dimension fixed. Trimmed least absolute deviations and trimmed least
 squares estimators are proposed for the case where the panel is of length
 two, and it is proven that they are consistent and asymptotically normal.
 It is not necessary to maintain parametric assumptions on the error terms
 to obtain this result. A small scale Monte Carlo study demonstrates that
 these estimators can perform well in small samples.   Copyright 1992 by The Econometric Society.

Abstract:

 there are infinitely many consumers and some commodities are bads, that
 is, cause disutility to consumers. We give an example of such an economy
 for which there is no competitive equilibrium or its variants (quasi- or
 pseudo-equilibrium), and an example of the failure of the so-called
 uniform integrability condition of equilibrium allocations of increasingly
 populous finite economies. Copyright The Econometric Society 2005.

Title:   Identification and Robustness with Contaminated and Corrupted Data. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 281-302
Issue: 2
Volume: 63
Year: 1995
Month:  March 
Abstract:
  Robust estimation aims at developing point estimators that are not highly
 sensitive to errors in data. However, the population parameters of
 interest are not identified under the assumptions of robust estimation, so
 the rationale for point estimation is not apparent. This paper shows that,
 under error models used in robust estimation, unidentified population
 parameters can often be bounded. The bounds provide information that is
 not available in robust estimation. For example, it is possible to bound
 the population mean under contaminated sampling. It is argued that
 estimating the bounds is more natural than attempting point estimation of
 unidentified parameters.   Copyright 1995 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Equilibrium in Continuous-Time Financial Markets: Endogenously Dynamically Complete Markets 
Abstract:
				 We prove existence of equilibrium in a
 continuous-time securities market in which the securities are potentially
 dynamically complete: the number of securities is at least one more than
 the number of independent sources of uncertainty. We prove that dynamic
 completeness of the candidate equilibrium price process follows from mild
 exogenous assumptions on the economic primitives of the model. Our result
 is universal, rather than generic: dynamic completeness of the candidate
 equilibrium price process and existence of equilibrium follow from the way
 information is revealed in a Brownian filtration, and from a mild
 exogenous nondegeneracy condition on the terminal security dividends. The
 nondegeneracy condition, which requires that finding one point at which a
 determinant of a Jacobian matrix of dividends is nonzero, is very easy to
 check. We find that the equilibrium prices, consumptions, and trading
 strategies are well-behaved functions of the stochastic process describing
 the evolution of information. We prove that equilibria of discrete
 approximations converge to equilibria of the continuous-time economy. Copyright Copyright  2008 by The Econometric Society.

Abstract:
  The properties of optimal mechanisms in environments where sellers are
 privately informed about quality are analyzed. A methodology is provided
 for deriving conditions that are necessary and sufficient to determine
 when two simple trading environments maximize either social or private
 surplus. The commonly used auction mechanism is frequently inefficient in
 procurement environments. Often, the optimal mechanism is simply to order
 potential suppliers and to tender take-it-or-leave-it offers to each
 sequentially. The environments in which either mechanism is optimal are
 completely characterized.   Copyright 1995 by The Econometric Society.

Title:   Stability and Collective Rationality. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 935-61
Issue: 4
Volume: 55
Year: 1987
Month:  July 
Abstract:
  A collective choice problem involves a set of agents and a set of feasi
 ble utility vectors. Many solutions to the collective choice problem
 (e.g., the Nash solution) are collectively rational, i.e., consistent with
 the maximization of some ordering of utility space. In this pap er, a
 stability condition due to J. C. Harsanyi is used to obtain the following
 integrability result: any solution satisfying Pareto optim ality,
 continuity, and bilateral stability can be represented by an a dditively
 separable Bergson-Samuelson social welfare function.   Copyright 1987 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Ordinally Bayesian Incentive Compatible Voting Rules 
Abstract:
				 We study strategic voting after weakening
 the notion of strategy-proofness to Ordinal Bayesian Incentive
 Compatibility (OBIC). Under OBIC, truth-telling is required to maximize
 the expected utility of every voter, expected utility being computed with
 respect to the voter's prior beliefs and under the assumption that
 everybody else is also telling the truth. We show that for a special type
 of priors, i.e., the uniform priors, there exists a large class of social
 choice functions that are OBIC. However, for priors that are generic in
 the set of independent beliefs, a social choice function is OBIC only if
 it is dictatorial. This result underlines the robustness of the
 Gibbard-Satterthwaite Theorem. 			       Copyright The Econometric Society 2004.

Title:   Strategy-Proof and Symmetric Social Choice Functions for Public Good Economies
Abstract: For economies with one private good and one public good, the author discusses
  social choice functions satisfying the following requirements:
  strategy-proofness--representing true preferences is a dominant strategy;
  symmetry--two agents having the same preference pay equal cost
  shares--anonymity--when agents' preferences are switched, so are their
  consumption bundles; and individual rationality--allocations making agents
  worse off than their initial situations are never obtained. Theorem 1
  characterizes strategy-proof, budget-balancing, and symmetric social choice
  functions under convex public good technology. Theorems 2 and 3 characterize
  such functions without the convexity assumption, but employ anonymity and
  individual rationality requirements respectively.

Title: Consistent Tests for Stochastic Dominance 
Abstract:
 Methods are proposed for testing stochastic dominance of any
 pre--specified order, with primary interest in the distributions of
 income. We consider consistent tests, that are similar to
 Kolmogorov--Smirnov tests, of the complete set of restrictions that relate
 to the various forms of stochastic dominance. For such tests, in the case
 of tests for stochastic dominance beyond first order, we propose and
 justify a variety of approaches to inference based on simulation and the
 bootstrap. We compare these approaches to one another and to alternative
 approaches based on multiple comparisons in the context of a Monte Carlo
 experiment and an empirical example. Copyright The Econometric Society 2003.

Title: Who's Who in Networks. Wanted: The Key Player 
Abstract:
				 Finite population noncooperative games
 with linear-quadratic utilities, where each player decides how much action
 she exerts, can be interpreted as a network game with local payoff
 complementarities, together with a globally uniform payoff
 substitutability component and an own-concavity effect. For these games,
 the Nash equilibrium action of each player is proportional to her Bonacich
 centrality in the network of local complementarities, thus establishing a
 bridge with the sociology literature on social networks. This
 Bonacich-Nash linkage implies that aggregate equilibrium increases with
 network size and density. We then analyze a policy that consists of
 targeting the key player, that is, the player who, once removed, leads to
 the optimal change in aggregate activity. We provide a geometric
 characterization of the key player identified with an intercentrality
 measure, which takes into account both a player's centrality and her
 contribution to the centrality of the others.				    Copyright The Econometric Society 2006.

Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 787-815
Issue: 3
Volume: 59
Year: 1991
Month:  May 
Abstract:
  Conventional chi(superscript "2") approximations to the distribution of
 the information matrix test are shown to be inaccurate in models and with
 sample sizes commonly encountered. Interpreting a version of the
 information matrix test as an efficient score test leads to an alternative
 Edgeworth type approximation. This is calculated for the normal regression
 model and shown to be an improvement. Generally, the quality of the
 approximations is sensitive to the covariate design. However, the authors
 are able to provide design-independent, second-order size corrections for
 the widely used information matrix tests which detect nonnormal skewness
 and kurtosis in regression models.   Copyright 1991 by The Econometric Society.

Title:   Expectations Formation and Stability of Large Socioeconomic Systems 
Abstract: This paper attempts to identify some of the basic reasons why adaptive
	learning may or may not lead to stability and convergence to self-fulfilling
	expectations. It is shown that, if agents are somewhat uncertain about the
	local stability of the system, the learning dynamics is locally divergent. On
	the other hand, if agents are fairly sure of the local stability of the
	system, one may indeed get local stability. This 'uncertainty principle' does
	show up in a wide variety of contexts.

Title:   Self-Confirming Equilibrium. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 523-45
Issue: 3
Volume: 61
Year: 1993
Month:  May 
Abstract:
  In a self-confining equilibrium, each player's strategy is a best
 response to his beliefs about the play of his opponents and each player's
 beliefs are correct along the equilibrium path of play. Thus, if a
 self-confirming equilibrium occurs repeatedly, no player ever observes
 play that contradicts his beliefs, even though beliefs about play at
 off-path information sets need not be correct. The authors characterize
 the ways in which self-confirming equilibria and Nash equilibria can
 differ and provide conditions under which self-confirming equilibria
 correspond to standard solution concepts.   Copyright 1993 by The Econometric Society.

Volume: 60
Year: 1992
Month:  November 
Abstract:
  This paper reports the results of a systematic experimental comparison of
 the effect of alternative arbitration systems on dispute rates. The three
 main findings indicate that (1) dispute rates are inversely related to the
 monetary costs of disputes; (2) the dispute rate in a final-offer
 arbitration system is at least as high as the dispute rate in a comparable
 conventional arbitration system; and (3) dispute rates are inversely
 related to the uncertainty costs of disputes, indicating that some
 bargainers behave as if they were risk averse. Coauthors are Janet Currie,
 Henry S. Farber, and Matthew Spiegel.	 Copyright 1992 by The Econometric Society.

Title:   Quadrature-Based Methods for Obtaining Approximate Solutions to Nonlinear Asset Pricing Models. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 371-96
Issue: 2
Volume: 59
Year: 1991
Month:  March 
Abstract:
  This paper develops a discrete state space solution method for a class of
 nonlinear rational expectations models. The method works by using
 numerical quadrature rules to approximate the integral operators that
 arise in stochastic intertemporal models. It is particularly useful for
 approximating asset pricing models and has potential applications in other
 problems as well. An empirical application uses the method to study the
 relationship between the risk premium and the conditional variability of
 the equity returns under ARCH endowment processes.   Copyright 1991 by The Econometric Society.

Title:  Repeated Games with Differential Time Preferences
Abstract: 
  This paper provides a folk theorem for two-player repeated games in which
  players have different discount factors. In such games, players can mutually
  benefit from trading payoffs across time. Hence, the set of feasible repeated
  game payoffs is typically larger than the convex hull of the underlying
  stage-game payoffs. However, many trade plans that guarantee individually
  rational payoffs are not sustainable by an equilibrium, no matter how patient
  the players are. Therefore, the set of equilibrium payoffs might not approach
  the set of all feasible and individually rational repeated game payoffs.

Title: Ellsberg Revisited: An Experimental Study 
Abstract:
				 An extension to Ellsberg's experiment
 demonstrates that attitudes to ambiguity and compound objective lotteries
 are tightly associated. The sample is decomposed into three main groups:
 subjective expected utility subjects, who reduce compound objective
 lotteries and are ambiguity neutral, and two groups that exhibit different
 forms of association between preferences over compound lotteries and
 ambiguity, corresponding to alternative theoretical models that account
 for ambiguity averse or seeking behavior. Copyright The Econometric Society 2007.

Title:   Cooperation in Repeated Games when the Number of Stages is Not Commonly Known
Abstract:  An exponentially small departure from the common knowledge assumption on the
  number T of repetitions of the prisoners' dilemma already enables
  cooperation. More generally, with such a departure, any feasible individually
  rational outcome of any one-shot game can be approximated by an equilibrium
  of a finitely repeated version of that game. The departure from common
  knowledge is small in the following sense:(1) the players know T with
  precision +/-K; (2) with probability 1 - epsilon, the players know T
  precisely; moreover, this knowledge is mutual of order epsilon T; and (3) the
  deviation of T from its finite expectation is exponentially small.

Title:  Information Theoretic Approaches to Inference in Moment Condition Models
Abstract: This paper develops a variant of one-step efficient GMM based on the
	KLIC rather than empirical likelihood. As in other one-step methods, the
	authors  introduce M (the number of moments) auxiliary 'tilting' parameters
	which are used to construct a reweighting of the data so that the reweighted
	sample obeys all the moment conditions at the parameter estimates. Parameter
	and overidentification tests can be recast in terms of these tilting
	parameters; such tests are often startlingly more effective than their
	conventional counterparts. These performance differences cannot be completely
	explained by the leading terms of the statistics' asymptotic expansions.

Title:   Managerial Task Assignment and Promotions. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 449-66
Issue: 2
Volume: 56
Year: 1988
Month:  March 
Abstract:
  A two-period model of managerial task assignment is developed, where the
 current employer has the advantage of observing the actual performanc e of
 the manager, while outside employers can observe only the assign ments.
 Optimal contracts are rigid, but the market value of managers is below
 actual productivity and they are promoted less than is effic ient. The
 author introduces the idea of managers explo iting their information to
 separate themselves out in the market plac e. As a consequence, the model
 has the appealing property of small ab ility-based wage differentials
 within a task, as well as large ones b etween tasks.   Copyright 1988 by The Econometric Society.

Title:   A Continuous Time Approximation to the Unstable First-Order Autoregressive Process: The Case without an Intercept. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 211-36
Issue: 1
Volume: 59
Year: 1991
Month:  January 
Abstract:
  We consider a first-order autoregression with i.i.d. errors and a fixed
 initial condition. The asymptotic distribution of the normalized
 least-squares estimator as the sampling interval converges to zero is
 shown to be the same as the exact distribution of the continuous-time
 estimator in an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. This asymptotic distribution
 permits explicit consideration of the effect of the initial condition. The
 appropriate moment-generating function is derived and used to tabulate the
 limiting distribution and probability density functions, the moments and
 some power functions. The adequacy of this asymptotic approximation is
 found to be excellent for values of the autoregressive parameter near one
 and any fixed initial condition.   Copyright 1991 by The Econometric Society.

Title:   The Effects of Male and Female Labor Supply on Commodity Demands. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 925-51
Issue: 4
Volume: 59
Year: 1991
Month:  July 
Abstract:
  The authors examine the effects of male and female labor supply on
 household demands and present a simple and robust test for the
 separability of demands from labor supply. Using data on individual
 households from six years of the U.K. Family Expenditure Survey, they
 estimate a demand system for seven goods that includes hours and
 participation dummies as conditioning variables. Allowance is made for the
 possible endogeneity of theses conditioning labor-supply variables. The
 authors find that separability is rejected. Furthermore, they present
 evidence that ignoring labor supply leads to bias in the parameter
 estimates.   Copyright 1991 by The Econometric Society.

Title:   Simple Estimation of a Duration Model with Unobserved Heterogeneity. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 453-73
Issue: 2
Volume: 58
Year: 1990
Month:  March 
Abstract:
  This paper presents a simple estimator of the shape parameter in a
 Weibull duration model with unobserved heterogeneity. The estimator is
 consistent and asymptotically normal under mild conditions, and a
 consistent estimator of the asymptotic variance is available.	A Monte
 Carlo study indicates that the asymptotic distribution of the estimator
 provides a good approximation to the finite sample distribution. The
 estimation strategy can be extended to a model with regressors and to a
 log-logistic model with unobserved heterogeneity. The advantages of the
 estimator are that it is easy to calculate and that its asymptotic
 distribution can be derived.   Copyright 1990 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Computational Complexity and Communication: Coordination in Two-Player Games 
Abstract:
 The main contribution of this paper is the development and application of
 cryptographic techniques to the design of strategic communication
 mechanisms. One of the main assumptions in cryptography is the limitation
 of the computational power available to agents. We introduce the concept
 of limited computational complexity, and by borrowing results from
 cryptography, we construct a communication protocol to establish that
 every correlated equilibrium of a two-person game with rational payoffs
 can be achieved by means of computationally restricted unmediated
 communication. This result provides an example in game theory where
 limitations of computational abilities of players are helpful in solving
 implementation problems. More specifically, it is possible to construct
 mechanisms with the property that profitable deviations are too
 complicated to compute. Copyright The Econometric Society 2002.

Title:   A Simple Estimator of Cointegrating Vectors in Higher Order Integrated Systems. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 783-820
Issue: 4
Volume: 61
Year: 1993
Month:  July 
Abstract:
  Efficient estimators of cointegrating vectors are presented for systems
 involving deterministic components and variables of differing, higher
 orders of integration. The estimators are computed using GLS or OLS, and
 Wald statistics constructed from these estimators have asymptotic x
 [superscript] 2 distributions. These and previously proposed estimators of
 cointegrating vectors are used to study long-run U.S. money (M1) demand.
 M1 demand is found to be stable over 1900-1989; the 95 percent confidence
 intervals for the income elasticity and interest rate semielasticity are
 (0.88, 1.06) and (-0.13, -0.08), respectively. Estimates based on the
 postwar data alone, however, are unstable, with variances which indicate
 substantial sampling uncertainty.   Copyright 1993 by The Econometric Society.

Title:   Incomplete Contracts and Renegotiation. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 755-85
Issue: 4
Volume: 56
Year: 1988
Month:  July 
Abstract:
  When drawing up a contract, it is often impracticable to specify all the
 relevant contingencies, and so contracts are typically incomplete. This
 paper considers the extent to which these gaps migh t be filled by
 building into the contract a mechanism for revising th e terms of trade.
 One conclusion is that because the par-ties can res cind the original
 contract and ne-gotiate a new one, severe limitatio ns are placed on the
 form the revisions can take. The authors charact erize the optimal
 revision mechanism both when the contract is used t o encourage
 relationship-specific investments and when it is used for risk sharing.   Copyright 1988 by The Econometric Society.

Title:   Robustness Properties of Inequality Measures. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 77-101
Issue: 1
Volume: 64
Year: 1996
Month:  January 
Abstract:
  Inequality measures are often used to summarize information about
 empirical income distributions. However the resulting picture of the
 distribution and of changes in the distribution can be severely distorted
 if the data are contaminated. The nature of this distortion will in
 general depend upon the underlying properties of the inequality measure.
 This issue is investigated theoretically using a technique based on the
 influence function, and the magnitude of the effect is illustrated using a
 simulation. Both direct nonparametric estimation from the sample, and
 indirect estimation using a parametric model are considered; in the latter
 case the application of a robust estimation procedure is demonstrated. The
 results are applied to two micro-data examples.   Copyright 1996 by The Econometric Society.

Title:   Asymptotic Properties of Weighted M-Estimators for Variable Probability Samples
Journal: Econometrica
Abstract:
  I provide a systematic treatment of the asymptotic properties of weighted
  M-estimators under variable probability stratified sampling.  The
  characterization of the sampling scheme and representation of the objective
  function allow for a straightforward analysis. Simple, consistent asymptotic
  variance matrix estimators are proposed. When stratification is based on
  exogenous variables, I show that the unweighted M-estimator is more efficient
  than the weighted estimator under a generalized conditional information
  matrix equality. When population frequencies are known, a more efficient
  weighting is possible. I also show how the results carry over to multinomial
  sampling.

Title: Assortative Matching with Explicit Search Costs 
Abstract:
				 In this paper, I analyze a decentralized
 search and matching economy with transferable utility composed of
 heterogeneous agents. I explore whether Becker's assortative matching
 result generalizes to an economy where agents engage in costly search. In
 an economy with explicit additive search costs, complementarities in joint
 production (supermodularity of the joint production function) lead to
 assortative matching. This is in contrast to previous literature, which
 had shown that in a search economy with discounting, assortative matching
 may fail even when the joint production function is supermodular. Copyright The Econometric Society 2006.

Title:  Voting Behavior and Information Aggregation in Elections with Private Information
Abstract: The authors analyze two-candidate elections in which voters are
	uncertain about the realization of a state variable that affects the utility
	of all voters. They assume each voter has noisy private information about the
	state variable. The authors show that, in equilibrium, almost all voters
	ignore their private signal when voting. Nevertheless, elections fully
	aggregate information in the sense that the chosen candidate would not change
	if all private information were common knowledge.

Title: Measuring Inequity Aversion in a Heterogeneous Population Using Experimental Decisions and Subjective Probabilities 
Abstract:
				 We combine choice data in the ultimatum
 game with the expectations of proposers elicited by subjective probability
 questions to estimate a structural model of decision making under
 uncertainty. The model, estimated using a large representative sample of
 subjects from the Dutch population, allows both nonlinear preferences for
 equity and expectations to vary across socioeconomic groups. Our results
 indicate that inequity aversion to one's own disadvantage is an increasing
 and concave function of the payoff difference. We also find considerable
 heterogeneity in the population. Young and highly educated subjects have
 lower aversion for inequity than other groups. Moreover, the model that
 uses subjective data on expectations generates much better in- and
 out-of-sample predictions than a model which assumes that players have
 rational expectations. Copyright Copyright  2008 by The Econometric Society.

Title:   Asset Demands without the Independence Axiom. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 163-69
Issue: 1
Volume: 57
Year: 1989
Month:  January 
Abstract:
  An important application of the theory of choice under uncertainty is to
 asset markets, and an important property in these markets is a preference
 for portfolio diversification. If an investor is an expected utility
 maximizer, then he is risk averse if, and only if, he exhibits a
 preference for diversification. This paper examines the relationship
 between risk aversion and portfolio diversification when preferences over
 probability distributions of wealth do not have an expected utility
 representation. Although risk aversion is not sufficient to guarantee a
 preference for portfolio diversification, it is necessary. Quasiconcavity
 of the preference functional (over probability distributions of wealth),
 together with risk aversion, does imply a preference for portfolio
 diversification.   Copyright 1989 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Higher Order Properties of Gmm and Generalized Empirical Likelihood Estimators 
Abstract:
				 In an effort to improve the small sample
 properties of generalized method of moments (GMM) estimators, a number of
 alternative estimators have been suggested. These include empirical
 likelihood (EL), continuous updating, and exponential tilting estimators.
 We show that these estimators share a common structure, being members of a
 class of generalized empirical likelihood (GEL) estimators. We use this
 structure to compare their higher order asymptotic properties. We find
 that GEL has no asymptotic bias due to correlation of the moment functions
 with their Jacobian, eliminating an important source of bias for GMM in
 models with endogeneity. We also find that EL has no asymptotic bias from
 estimating the optimal weight matrix, eliminating a further important
 source of bias for GMM in panel data models. We give bias corrected GMM
 and GEL estimators. We also show that bias corrected EL inherits the
 higher order property of maximum likelihood, that it is higher order
 asymptotically efficient relative to the other bias corrected estimators. Copyright Econometric Society 2004.

 density-weighted average derivative can be estimated by certain linear
 instrumental variables coefficients. The estimators, based on sample
 analogies of the product moment representation of the average derivative,
 are constructed using nonparametric kernel estimators of the density of
 the regressors. Consistent estimators of the asymptotic
 variance-covariance matrices of the estimators are given, and a limited
 Monte Carlo simulation is used to study the practical performance of the
 procedures.   Copyright 1989 by The Econometric Society.

Journal: Econometrica

Issue: 3
Volume: 55
Year: 1987
Month:  May 
Abstract:
  The purpose of this paper is to investigate testable implications of
 equilibrium asset pricing models. The authors derive a general
 representation for asset prices that displays the role of conditioning
 information. This representation is then used to examine restrictions
 implied by asset pricing models on the unconditional moments of asset
 payoffs and prices. In particular, they analyze the effect of information
 omission on the mean-variance frontier of one- period returns on
 portfolios of securities. Also, the authors deduce an information
 extension of equilibrium pricing functions that is useful in deriving
 restrictions on the unconditional moments of payoffs and prices.   Copyright 1987 by The Econometric Society.

Issue: 5
Volume: 61
Year: 1993
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  This paper reports estimates of the primitive parameters of a stochastic
 control model describing the labor decisions of West African small
 farmers. Maximum likelihood estimates are computed although optimal labor
 decision rules cannot be derived analytically. Vuong's non-nested model
 specification test shows that this method yields estimates superior to
 those derived by assuming that farmers solve a deterministic control
 problem. Low levels of labor effort are shown to be a consequence of low
 labor productivity in archaic rain-fed agriculture and of farmers'
 awareness that, in the absence of a labor market, overly ambitious
 production plans lead to seasonal manpower shortages.	 Copyright 1993 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Precautionary Bidding in Auctions 
Abstract:
				 We analyze bidding behavior in auctions
 when risk-averse buyers bid for a good whose value is risky. We show that
 when the risk in the valuations increases, DARA bidders will reduce their
 bids by more than the appropriate increase in the risk premium. Ceteris
 paribus, buyers will be better off bidding for a more risky object in
 first price, second price, and English auctions with affiliated common
 (interdependent) values. This "precautionary bidding" effect arises
 because the expected marginal utility of income increases with risk, so
 buyers are reluctant to bid so highly. We also show that precautionary
 bidding behavior can make DARA bidders prefer bidding in a common values
 setting to bidding in a private values one when risk-neutral or CARA
 bidders would be indifferent. Thus the potential for a "winner's curse"
 can be a blessing for rational DARA bidders.				     Copyright Econometric Society 2004.

Title:   A Stopping Rule for the Computation of Generalized Method of Moments Estimators
Abstract: To obtain consistency and asymptotic normality, a generalized method of
	moments (GAM) estimator typically is defined to be an approximate global
	minimizer of a GAM criterion function. To compute such an estimator, however,
	can be problematic because of the difficulty of global optimization. To
	alleviate this problem, the author proposes a stopping-rule (SR) procedure
	for computing GAM estimators. The SR procedure eliminates the need for global
	search with high probability. And, it provides an explicit SR for problems of
	stability that may arise with local optimization problems.

Title: Solving Asset Pricing Models when the Price-Dividend Function Is Analytic 
Abstract:
				 We present a new method for solving asset
 pricing models, which yields an analytic price-dividend function of one
 state variable. To illustrate our method we give a detailed analysis of
 Abel's asset pricing model. A function is analytic in an open interval if
 it can be represented as a convergent power series near every point of
 that interval. In addition to allowing us to solve for the exact
 equilibrium price-dividend function, the analyticity property also lets us
 assess the accuracy of any numerical solution procedure used in the asset
 pricing literature. Copyright The Econometric Society 2005.

Journal: Econometrica

Issue: 4
Volume: 61
Year: 1993
Month:  July 
Abstract:
  The authors derive low frequency, say weekly, models implied by high
 frequency, say daily, ARMA models with symmetric GARCH errors. They show
 that low frequency models exhibit conditional heteroskedasticity of the
 GARCH form as well. The parameters in the conditional variance equation of
 the low frequency model depend upon mean, variance, and kurtosis
 parameters of the corresponding high frequency model. Moreover, strongly
 consistent estimators of the parameters in the high frequency model can be
 derived from low frequency data. The common assumption in applications
 that rescaled innovations are independent is disputable, since it depends
 upon the available data frequency.   Copyright 1993 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Package Auctions and Exchanges 
Abstract:
				 We report recent advances concerning the
 package allocation problem, in which traders seek to buy or sell
 combinations of goods. The problems are most difficult when some goods are
 not substitutes. In that case, competitive equilibrium typically fail to
 exist but the core is non-empty and comprises the competitive solutions.
 Also in that case, the Vickrey auction fails to select core allocations
 and yield revenues that are less than competitive. The Ausubel-Milgrom
 auction generally selects core allocations and, when goods are
 substitutes, prescribes the Vickrey allocation. We also evaluate the
 problems and promise of mechanisms for the package exchange problem. Copyright The Econometric Society 2007.

Title: Identification and Estimation of Regression Models with Misclassification 
Abstract:
				 This paper studies the problem of
 identification and estimation in nonparametric regression models with a
 misclassified binary regressor where the measurement error may be
 correlated with the regressors. We show that the regression function is
 nonparametrically identified in the presence of an additional random
 variable that is correlated with the unobserved true underlying variable
 but unrelated to the measurement error. Identification for semiparametric
 and parametric regression functions follows straightforwardly from the
 basic identification result. We propose a kernel estimator based on the
 identification strategy, derive its large sample properties, and discuss
 alternative estimation procedures. We also propose a test for
 misclassification in the model based on an exclusion restriction that is
 straightforward to implement. Copyright The Econometric Society 2006.

Title: Political Economy of Mechanisms 
Abstract:
				 We study the provision of dynamic
 incentives to self-interested politicians who control the allocation of
 resources in the context of the standard neoclassical growth model.
 Citizens discipline politicians using elections. We show that the need to
 provide incentives to the politician in power creates political economy
 distortions in the structure of production, which resemble aggregate tax
 distortions. We provide conditions under which the political economy
 distortions persist or disappear in the long run. If the politicians are
 as patient as the citizens, the best subgame perfect equilibrium leads to
 an asymptotic allocation where the aggregate distortions arising from
 political economy disappear. In contrast, when politicians are less
 patient than the citizens, political economy distortions remain
 asymptotically and lead to positive aggregate labor and capital taxes. Copyright Copyright  2008 by The Econometric Society.

Title:   Optimal Tests for Parameter Instability in the Generalized Method of Moments Framework. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 1085-1107
Issue: 5
Volume: 64
Year: 1996
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  This paper presents optimal tests for parameter instability in the
 generalized method of moments (GMM) framework. The new tests include tests
 that are optimal for both one-sided and two-sided alternatives. One of the
 optimal tests for two-sided alternatives is the GMM generalization of the
 test presented in Andrews and Ploberger (1994) for the likelihood
 framework. The new tests include a class of optimal tests that direct the
 test's power to specific locations in the sample. One of these optimal
 tests has the attractive feature of a normal distribution under the null
 hypothesis.   Copyright 1996 by The Econometric Society.

Title: The Error in Rejection Probability of Simple Autocorrelation Robust Tests 
Abstract:
				 A new class of autocorrelation robust test
 statistics is introduced. The class of tests generalizes the Kiefer,
 Vogelsang, and Bunzel (2000) test in a manner analogous to Anderson and
 Darling's (1952) generalization of the Cramér-von Mises goodness of fit
 test. In a Gaussian location model, the error in rejection probability of
 the new tests is found to be O(T-super--1logT), where T denotes the sample
 size.				     Copyright The Econometric Society 2004.

Title: The Folk Theorem for Games with Private Almost-Perfect Monitoring 
Abstract:
				 We prove the folk theorem for discounted
 repeated games under private, almost-perfect monitoring. Our result covers
 all finite, n-player games that satisfy the usual full-dimensionality
 condition. Mixed strategies are allowed in determining the individually
 rational payoffs. We assume no cheap-talk communication between players
 and no public randomization device.			        Copyright The Econometric Society 2006.

Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 391-407
Issue: 2
Volume: 55
Year: 1987
Month:  March 
Abstract:
  The expectati on of the excess holding yield on a long bond is postulated
 to depend upon its conditional variance. Engle's ARCH model is extended to
 allow the conditional variance to be a determinant of the mean and is
 called ARCH-M. Estimation and infer ence procedures are proposed, and the
 model is applied to three interest rate data sets. In most cases the ARCH
 process and the time varying risk premium are highly significant. A
 collection of LM diagnostic tests reveals the robustness of the model to
 various specification changes such as alternative volatility or ARCH
 measures, regime changes, and interest rate formulations. The model
 explains and interprets the recent econometric failures of the
 expectations hypothesis of the term structure.   Copyright 1987 by The Econometric Society.

Title:   The Inverse Optimal Problem: A Dynamic Programming Approach. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 147-72
Issue: 1
Volume: 56
Year: 1988
Month:  January 
Abstract:
  This paper solves the stochastic inverse optimal problem. Dynamic
 programming is used to transform the origina l problem into a differential
 equation. A solution exists for any pro duction function with a finite
 slope at the origin provided the savin gs function, starting from the
 origin, is steep initially and flat ev entually. Three consumption
 functions-linear, Keynes-ian, and Cantabr igian-are also studied with a
 Cobb-Douglas production technology. A w ell-known result in discrete time
 models-that a logarithmic utility f unction and a Cobb-Douglas production

Abstract:
  An allocation for an exchange economy with smooth preferences is shown to
 be Walrasian if there is a set of net trades that is closed under
 addition, contains the negations of net trades that would improve any
 agent's final bundle, and is such that each agent's final bundle is weakly
 preferred to the sum of the initial endowment and any allowed net trade.
 These conditions characterize the sets of net trades available in
 equilibria of market games in which randomly paired agents bargain
 repeatedly and imply that steady state equilibria are Walrasian.   Copyright 1991 by The Econometric Society.

Title: The Law of Demand and Risk Aversion 
Abstract:
 This note proposes a necessary and sufficient condition on a utility
 function to guarantee that it generates a demand function satisfying the
 law of demand. This condition can be interpreted in terms of an agent's
 attitude towards lotteries in commodity space. As an application, we show
 that when an agent has an expected utility function, her demand for
 securities satisfies the law of demand if her coefficient of relative risk
 aversion does not vary by more than 4. Copyright The Econometric Society 2003.

Title:  An Alternative Estimator for the Censored Quantile Regression Model	
Abstract:  This paper introduces an alternative estimator for the linear censored
	quantile regression model. The estimator also applies to cases where the
	censoring point is unknown.  Since the objective function is globally convex
	and the estimator is a solution to a linear programming problem, a global
	minimizer is obtained in a finite number of simplex iterations. The estimator
	has a square root of n-convergence rate and is asymptotically normal. A Monte
	Carlo study performed shows that the suggested estimator has very desirable
	small sample properties.

Title: An IV Model of Quantile Treatment Effects 
Abstract:
				 The ability of quantile regression models
 to characterize the heterogeneous impact of variables on different points
 of an outcome distribution makes them appealing in many economic
 applications. However, in observational studies, the variables of interest
 (e.g., education, prices) are often endogenous, making conventional
 quantile regression inconsistent and hence inappropriate for recovering
 the causal effects of these variables on the quantiles of economic
 outcomes. In order to address this problem, we develop a model of quantile
 treatment effects (QTE) in the presence of endogeneity and obtain
 conditions for identification of the QTE without functional form
 assumptions. The principal feature of the model is the imposition of
 conditions that restrict the evolution of ranks across treatment states.
 This feature allows us to overcome the endogeneity problem and recover the
 true QTE through the use of instrumental variables. The proposed model can
 also be equivalently viewed as a structural simultaneous equation model
 with nonadditive errors, where QTE can be interpreted as the structural
 quantile effects (SQE). Copyright The Econometric Society 2005.

Volume: 63
Year: 1995
Month:  January 
Abstract:
  This paper elucidates on the logic behind recent papers which show that a
 unique equilibrium is selected in the presence of higher order
 uncertainty, i.e., when players lack common knowledge. We introduce two
 new concepts: stochastic potential of the information system and
 p-dominance of Nash-equilibria of the game, and show that a
 Nash-equilibrium is uniquely selected whenever its p-dominance is below
 the stochastic potential. This criterion applies to many-action games, not
 merely 2 by 2 games. It also applies to games without dominant strategies,
 where the set of equilibria is shown to be smaller and simpler than might
 be initially conjectured. Finally, the new concepts help understand the
 circumstances under which the set of equilibria varies with the amount of
 common knowledge among players.   Copyright 1995 by The Econometric Society.

Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 335-60
Issue: 2
Volume: 56
Year: 1988
Month:  March 
Abstract:
  In this paper, the authors examine whether nonseparable preference
 structures ar e important in characterizing life-cycle labor supply. Using
 longitud inal data on prime-age males from the Panel Study of Income
 Dynamics, they estimate a model of life-cycle leisure and consumption
 under un certainty in which intertemporal preferences are allowed to be
 nonsep arable in leisure. The model tests several alternative
 specifications considered in the literature. They investigate the
 robustness of the ir findings to certain forms of population heterogeneity
 and types of model misspecification. Across alternative specifications,
 the autho rs find that the standard assumption of intertemporally
 separable pre ferences for leisure is not consistent with the data.   Copyright 1988 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Least Squares Model Averaging 
Abstract:
				 This paper considers the problem of
 selection of weights for averaging across least squares estimates obtained
 from a set of models. Existing model average methods are based on
 exponential Akaike information criterion (AIC) and Bayesian information
 criterion (BIC) weights. In distinction, this paper proposes selecting the
 weights by minimizing a Mallows criterion, the latter an estimate of the
 average squared error from the model average fit. We show that our new
 Mallows model average (MMA) estimator is asymptotically optimal in the
 sense of achieving the lowest possible squared error in a class of
 discrete model average estimators. In a simulation experiment we show that
 the MMA estimator compares favorably with those based on AIC and BIC
 weights. The proof of the main result is an application of the work of Li
 (1987). Copyright The Econometric Society 2007.

Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 1255-77
Issue: 6
Volume: 58
Year: 1990
Month:  November 
Abstract:
  The authors study a rich class of noncooperative games that includes
 models of oligopoly competition, macroeconomic coordination failures, arms
 races, bank runs, technology adoption and diffusion, R&D competition,
 pretrial bargaining, coordination in teams, and many others. For all these
 games, the sets of pure strategy Nash equilibria, correlated equilibria,
 and rationalizable strategies have identical bounds. Also, for a class of
 models of dynamic adaptive choice behavior that encompasses both
 best-response dynamics and Bayesian learning, the players' choices lie
 eventually within the same bounds. These bounds are shown to vary
 monotonically with certain exogenous parameters.   Copyright 1990 by The Econometric Society.

Title: The Collective Model of Household Consumption: A Nonparametric Characterization 
Abstract:
				 We provide a nonparametric
 characterization of a general collective model for household consumption,
 which includes externalities and public consumption. Next, we establish
 testable necessary and sufficient conditions for data consistency with
 collective rationality that only include observed price and quantity
 information. These conditions have a similar structure as the generalized
 axiom of revealed preference for the unitary model, which is convenient
 from a testing point of view. In addition, we derive the minimum number of
 goods and observations that enable the rejection of collectively rational
 household behavior. Copyright The Econometric Society 2007.

Title:   Noncooperative Bargaining and Spatial Competition. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 97-113
Issue: 1
Volume: 57
Year: 1989
Month:  January 
Abstract:
  The article develops a bargaining model of spatial competition. Sellers
 compete by choosing locations in a market region. Consumers face a cost to
 moving from one place to another. The price of the good is determined as
 the perfect equilibrium of a bargaining game between seller and buyer. In
 this game, the buyer has the outside option to move to another seller and
 so the prices at all stores are interdependent. Existence of a
 location-price equilibrium is established. The outcome approaches the
 perfectly-competitive one if the consumer's cost of traveling becomes
 negligible or if the number of sellers tends to infinity.   Copyright 1989 by The Econometric Society.

Title: The Limits of ex post Implementation 
Abstract:
				 The sensitivity of Bayesian implementation
 to agents' beliefs about others suggests the use of more robust notions of
 implementation such as ex post implementation, which requires that each
 agent's strategy be optimal for every possible realization of the types of
 other agents. We show that the only deterministic social choice functions
 that are ex post implementable in generic mechanism design frameworks with
 multidimensional signals, interdependent valuations, and transferable
 utilities are constant functions. In other words, deterministic ex post
 implementation requires that the same alternative must be chosen
 irrespective of agents' signals. The proof shows that ex post
 implementability of a nontrivial deterministic social choice function
 implies that certain rates of information substitution coincide for all
 agents. This condition amounts to a system of differential equations that
 are not satisfied by generic valuation functions. Copyright The Econometric Society 2006.

Title:   The Law of Demand when Income Is Price Dependent
Abstract: This paper establishes a set of conditions for the uniqueness and
	stability of the equilibrium price in exchange and production economies.
	Building on the earlier work of J. M. Grandmont and W. Hildenbrand, it shows
	that increasing heterogeneity in preferences (in some well-defined sense)
	causes aggregate Engel curves to become increasingly linear. So sufficient
	dispersion, together with the assumption that preferences and endowments are
	independently distributed, leads to the aggregate excess demand function
	satisfying the law of demand. Uniqueness and stability of the equilibrium
	price follows.

Title:   Implicit Alternatives and the Local Power of Test Statistics. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 1305-29
Issue: 6
Volume: 55
Year: 1987
Month:  November 
Abstract:
  The local power of test statistics is analyzed by considering sequences
 of data-generating processes (DGPs) that approach the null hypothesis
 without necessarily satisfying the alternative. The three classical test
 statistics-LR, Wald, and LM-are shown to tend asymptot ically to the same
 random variable under all such sequences. The powe r of these statistics
 depends on the null, the alternative, and the sequence of DGPs in a
 geometrically intuitive way. This implies that, for any statistic that is
 asymptotically chi-squared under the null, there exists an "implicit
 alternative hypothesis" against which that statistic will have highest
 power.   Copyright 1987 by The Econometric Society.

Title: A New Specification Test for the Validity of Instrumental Variables 
Abstract:
 We develop a new specification test for IV estimators adopting a
 particular second order approximation of Bekker. The new specification
 test compares the difference of the forward (conventional) 2SLS estimator
 of the coefficient of the right-hand side endogenous variable with the
 reverse 2SLS estimator of the same unknown parameter when the
 normalization is changed. Under the null hypothesis that conventional
 first order asymptotics provide a reliable guide to inference, the two
 estimates should be very similar. Our test sees whether the resulting
 difference in the two estimates satisfies the results of second order
 asymptotic theory. Essentially the same idea is applied to develop another
 new specification test using second-order unbiased estimators of the type
 first proposed by Nagar. If the forward and reverse Nagar-type estimators
 are not significantly different we recommend estimation by LIML, which we
 demonstrate is the optimal linear combination of the Nagar-type estimators
 (to second order). We also demonstrate the high degree of similarity for
 "k"-class estimators between the approach of Bekker and the Edgeworth
 expansion approach of Rothenberg. An empirical example and Monte Carlo
 evidence demonstrate the operation of the new specification test. Copyright The Econometric Society 2002.

Title: Asymptotic Properties for a Class of Partially Identified Models 
Abstract:
				 We propose inference procedures for
 partially identified population features for which the population
 identification region can be written as a transformation of the Aumann
 expectation of a properly defined set valued random variable (SVRV). An
 SVRV is a mapping that associates a set (rather than a real number) with
 each element of the sample space. Examples of population features in this
 class include interval-identified scalar parameters, best linear
 predictors with interval outcome data, and parameters of semiparametric
 binary models with interval regressor data. We extend the analogy
 principle to SVRVs and show that the sample analog estimator of the
 population identification region is given by a transformation of a
 Minkowski average of SVRVs. Using the results of the mathematics
 literature on SVRVs, we show that this estimator converges in probability
 to the population identification region with respect to the Hausdorff
 distance. We then show that the Hausdorff distance and the directed
 Hausdorff distance between the population identification region and the
 estimator, when properly normalized by

 converge in distribution to functions of a Gaussian process whose
 covariance kernel depends on parameters of the population identification
 region. We provide consistent bootstrap procedures to approximate these
 limiting distributions. Using similar arguments as those applied for
 vector valued random variables, we develop a methodology to test
 assumptions about the true identification region and its subsets. We show
 that these results can be used to construct a confidence collection and a
 directed confidence collection. Those are (respectively) collection of
 sets that, when specified as a null hypothesis for the true value (a
 subset of values) of the population identification region, cannot be
 rejected by our tests. 			        Copyright Copyright  2008 by The Econometric Society.

Title:   Optimal Consumption and Portfolio Rules with Durability and Local Substitution. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 85-121
Issue: 1
Volume: 61
Year: 1993
Month:  January 
Abstract:
  A model of optimal consumption and portfolio choice that captures the
 notions of local substitution and irreversible purchases of durable goods
 is studied. Necessary and sufficient conditions for a consumption and
 portfolio policy to be optimal are provided. A closed-form solution of the
 optimal consumption and portfolio policy is given. The optimal consumption
 policy consists of a possible initial "gulp" of consumption, or a period
 of no consumption, followed.by a process of accumulated consumption with
 singular sample paths. The equilibrium risk premium in a representative
 investor economy with a single physical production technology is computed.    Copyright 1993 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Estimation of Continuous-Time Markov Processes Sampled at Random Time Intervals 
Abstract:
				 We introduce a family of
 generalized-method-of-moments estimators of the parameters of a
 continuous-time Markov process observed at random time intervals. The
 results include strong consistency, asymptotic normality, and a
 characterization of standard errors. Sampling is at an arrival intensity
 that is allowed to depend on the underlying Markov process and on the
 parameter vector to be estimated. We focus on financial applications,
 including tick-based sampling, allowing for jump diffusions,
 regime-switching diffusions, and reflected diffusions. Copyright The Econometric Society 2004.

Title:   Mortality Risk and Bequests. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 779-813
Issue: 4
Volume: 57
Year: 1989
Month:  July 
Abstract:
  A lifetime utility model, in which the date of death is uncertain and in
 which bequests give utility, is analyzed and estimated. The parameter
 estimates imply that most bequests are accidental, the result of mortality
 risk, and that the shape of the desired consumption path is sensitive to
 variations in mortality rates. On average, the elderly in the sample
 dissave, which is consistent with a life-cycle model in which utility does
 not depend on bequests.   Copyright 1989 by The Econometric Society.

Title:   Stochastic Algorithms, Symmetric Markov Perfect Equilibrium, and the 'Curse' of Dimensionality. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 1261-81
Issue: 5
Volume: 69
Year: 2001
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  This paper introduces a stochastic algorithm for computing symmetric
 Markov perfect equilibria. The algorithm computes equilibrium policy and
 value functions, and generates a transition kernel for the (stochastic)
 evolution of the state of the system. It has two features that together
 imply that it need not be subject to the curse of dimensionality. First,
 the integral that determines continuation values is never calculated;
 rather it is approximated by a simple average of returns from past
 outcomes of the algorithm, an approximation whose computational burden is
 not tied to the dimension of the state space. Second, iterations of the
 algorithm update value and policy functions at a single (rather than at
 all possible) points in the state space. Random draws from a distribution
 set by the updated policies determine the location of the next iteration's
 updates. This selection only repeatedly hits the recurrent class of
 points, a subset whose cardinality is not directly tied to that of the
 state space. Numerical results for industrial organization problems show
 that our algorithm can increase speed and decrease memory requirements by
 several orders of magnitude.

Title:  Aggregation and Market Demand: An Exterior Differential Calculus Viewpoint
Abstract:
  We analyze under which conditions a given vector field can be disaggregated
  as a linear combination of gradients. This problem is typical of aggregation
  theory, as illustrated by the literature on the characterization of aggregate
  market demand and excess demand. We argue that exterior differential calculus
  provides very useful tools to address these problems. In particular, we show,
  using these techniques, that any analytic mapping in [open letter
  R][superscript n] satisfying Walras Law can be locally decomposed as the sum
  of n individual, utility-maximizing market demand functions. In addition, we
  show that the result holds for arbitrary (price-dependent) income
  distributions, and that the decomposition can be chosen such that it varies
  continuously with the mapping. Finally, when income distribution can be
  freely chosen, then decomposition requires only n/2 agents.

Title: A Small Sample Correction for the Test of Cointegrating Rank in the Vector Autoregressive Model 
Abstract:
 With the cointegration formulation of economic long-run relations the test
 for cointegrating rank has become a useful econometric tool. The limit
 distribution of the test is often a poor approximation to the finite
 sample distribution and it is therefore relevant to derive an
 approximation to the expectation of the likelihood ratio test for
 cointegration in the vector autoregressive model in order to improve the
 finite sample properties. The correction factor depends on moments of
 functions of the random walk, which are tabulated by simulation, and
 functions of the parameters, which are estimated. From this approximation
 we propose a correction factor with the purpose of improving the small
 sample performance of the test. The correction is found explicitly in a
 number of simple models and its usefulness is illustrated by some
 simulation experiments. Copyright The Econometric Society 2002.

  With the same normalization as that for standard parametric statistics,

Abstract:
  The theory applying to dynamic programming has furnished a useful set of
 techniques for the analysis of many types of sequential models. This
 theory, however, has not yielded heretofore much information about the
 differentiability properties of optimal solutions. This aspect is of
 particular interest as regards the qualitative analysis of optimal paths,
 where differentiable methods are often called into play. This paper shows
 roughly that if the objective is twice continuously differentiable and
 strongly concave, then any interior optimal path is continuously
 differentiable with respect to the initial state.   Copyright 1991 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Empirical Likelihood-Based Inference in Conditional Moment Restriction Models 
Abstract:
				 This paper proposes an asymptotically
 efficient method for estimating models with conditional moment
 restrictions. Our estimator generalizes the maximum empirical likelihood
 estimator (MELE) of Qin and Lawless (1994). Using a kernel smoothing
 method, we efficiently incorporate the information implied by the
 conditional moment restrictions into our empirical likelihood-based
 procedure. This yields a one-step estimator which avoids estimating
 optimal instruments. Our likelihood ratio-type statistic for parametric
 restrictions does not require the estimation of variance, and achieves
 asymptotic pivotalness implicitly. The estimation and testing procedures
 we propose are normalization invariant. Simulation results suggest that
 our new estimator works remarkably well in finite samples. Copyright The Econometric Society 2004.

Title:  Mortgage Terminations, Heterogeneity and the Exercise of Mortgage Options  
Abstract:   Option theory predicts that mortgage prepayment or default will be
 exercised by homeowners if the call or put option is sufficiently
 "in the money." This analysis: tests the extent to which the option
 approach explains default and prepayment behavior; evaluates the
 importance of modeling both options simultaneously; and models the
 unobserved heterogeneity of mortgage holders. The paper presents a
 unified model of the competing risks of mortgage termination,
 considering the hazards as dependent competing risks, estimated
 jointly. It also accounts for the unobserved heterogeneity among
 borrowers, and estimates the unobserved heterogeneity simultaneously
 with the prepayment and default functions.

Title:  On the Role of the Propensity Score in Efficient Semiparametric Estimation of Average Treatment Effects
Abstract: The role of propensity score in the efficient estimation of the average
	treatment effects is examined. If the treatment is ignorable given some
	observed characteristics, it is shown that the propensity score is ancillary
	for estimation of the average treatment effects but not for estimation of
	average treatment effects on the treated.  Efficient semiparametric
	estimators take the form of relevant sample averages of the data completed by
	the nonparametric imputation method.  Projection on the propensity score is
	not necessary for efficient semiparametric estimation of the average
	treatment effects on the treated even if the propensity score is known.

Abstract:
  This paper demonstrates that an optimizing model of a monetary economy
 can produce perfect foresight equilibria in which the price level
 fluctuates forever. Cyclically or chaotically fluctuating equilibria are
 more likely to exist when the rate of money supply growth is high.
 Furthermore, the set of equilibrium prices may have a complicated
 topological structure, which poses a more serious problem concerning the
 validity of comparative statics method than any sort of indeterminacy
 previously discussed in the literature.   Copyright 1991 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Modeling and Forecasting Realized Volatility 
Abstract:
 We provide a framework for integration of high--frequency intraday data
 into the measurement, modeling, and forecasting of daily and lower
 frequency return volatilities and return distributions. Building on the
 theory of continuous--time arbitrage--free price processes and the theory
 of quadratic variation, we develop formal links between realized
 volatility and the conditional covariance matrix. Next, using continuously
 recorded observations for the Deutschemark&sol;Dollar and Yen&sol;Dollar
 spot exchange rates, we find that forecasts from a simple long--memory
 Gaussian vector autoregression for the logarithmic daily realized
 volatilities perform admirably. Moreover, the vector autoregressive
 volatility forecast, coupled with a parametric lognormal--normal mixture
 distribution produces well--calibrated density forecasts of future
 returns, and correspondingly accurate quantile predictions. Our results
 hold promise for practical modeling and forecasting of the large
 covariance matrices relevant in asset pricing, asset allocation, and
 financial risk management applications. Copyright The Econometric Society 2003.

Title:   A Divisible Search Model of Fiat Money
Abstract: This paper extends the Kiyotaki-Wright model of fiat money to allow for
	divisible money and goods. By severing the artificial link in the
	Kiyotaki-Wright model between the money supply and the number of money
	holders, the author shows that money is neutral but not superneutral. Money
	growth changes the composition of agents in the market and can increase
	agents' probability of having a successful match. This trading opportunity
	effect of money growth can dominate its conventional negative effect on real
	money balances and so can imply a positive optimal money growth rate.

Abstract:
  This paper compares the equilibrium behavior and outcomes in a model of
 two-party competition for legislative seats under two different
 assumptions about the parties' goals: (1) parties maximize the expected
 number of seats won, and (2) parties maximize the probability of winning a
 majority of the seats. The two goals may lead to qualitatively different
 behavior, and studying the differences yields insights into the
 relationship between the goals, and the role of asymmetries between the
 parties.   Copyright 1989 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Intersectoral Labor Mobility and the Growth of the Service Sector 
Abstract:
				 One of the most striking changes in the
 U.S. economy over the past 50 years has been the growth in the service
 sector. Between 1950 and 2000, service-sector employment grew from 57 to
 75 percent of total employment. However, over this time, the real hourly
 wage in the service sector grew only slightly faster than in the goods
 sector. In this paper, we assess whether or not the essential constancy of
 the relative wage implies that individuals face small costs of switching
 sectors, and we quantify the relative importance of labor supply and
 demand factors in the growth of the service sector. We specify and
 estimate a two-sector labor market equilibrium model that allows us to
 address these empirical issues in a unified framework. Our estimates imply
 that there are large mobility costs: output in both sectors would have
 been double their current levels if these mobility costs had been zero. In
 addition, we find that demand-side factors, that is, technological change
 and movements in product and capital prices, were responsible for the
 growth of the service sector. Copyright The Econometric Society 2006.

Title:  Experience-weighted Attraction Learning in Normal Form Games
Abstract:
  In 'experience-weighted attraction' (EWA) learning, strategies have
  attractions which reflect initial predispositions, are updated based on
  payoff experience, and determine choice probabilities according to some rule
  (e.g., logit). EWA includes reinforcement learning and weighted fictitious
  play (belief learning) as special cases, and hybridizes their key elements.
  Using three sets of experimental data, the authors show that reinforcement
  and belief learning are generally rejected in favor of EWA. EWA is able to
  combine the best features of these approaches, allowing attractions to begin
  and grow flexibly as choice reinforcement does but reinforcing unchosen
  strategies substantially as belief-based models implicitly do.

Title:  Latent Separability: Grouping Goods without Weak Separability
Abstract:   This paper develops a new concept of separability with overlapping
 groups. This is shown to provide a useful empirical and theoretical
 framework for investigating the grouping of goods and prices. It is
 a generalisation of weak separability in which goods are allowed to
 enter more than one group and where the composition of groups is
 identified by the choice of group specific exclusive goods. For the
 Almost Ideal and Translog demand models and their generalisations,
 we provide a method for choosing the number of separable groups. A
 detailed method for exploring the composition of the separable
 groups is also presented.

Title:   Labor Market Institutions and the Distribution of Wages, 1973-1992: A Semiparametric Approach. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 1001-44
Issue: 5
Volume: 64
Year: 1996
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  This paper provides evidence that the decline in the real value of the
 minimum wage and in the rate of unionization account for a significant
 share of the increase in wage inequality in the United States between 1979
 and 1988. The role of the minimum wage is particularly important for
 women, while deunionization has the largest impact on men. The authors
 develop a semiparametric procedure that applies kernel density methods to
 appropriately weighted samples. The procedure provides a visually clear
 representation of where in the density of wages institutional and labor
 market forces exert the greatest impact.   Copyright 1996 by The Econometric Society.

Title:   Learning, Local Interaction, and Coordination. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 1047-71
Issue: 5
Volume: 61
Year: 1993
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  This paper discusses the dynamic implications of learning in a large
 population coordination game, focusing on the structure of the matching
 process that describes how players meet. As in M. Kandori, G. Mailath, and
 R. Rob (1992), experimentation and myopia create 'evolutionary' forces
 that lead players to coordinate on the risk dominant equilibrium. To
 describe play with finite time horizons, it is necessary to consider the
 rates at which the dynamic systems converge. In large populations with
 uniform matching, play is determined largely by historical factors. When
 players interact with small sets of neighbors, evolutionary forces may
 determine the outcome.   Copyright 1993 by The Econometric Society.

Title:   The Democratic Political Economy of Progressive Income Taxation
Abstract: Why do both left and right political parties typically propose progressive
  income taxation schemes in political competition? Analysis of this problem
  has been hindered by the two-dimensionality space of admissible tax policies:
  Nash equilibria in pure strategies of the usual political game generically
  fail to exist. A new equilibrium concept, based on the fact of factional
  conflict within parties, is introduced. Each party has incomplete preference
  orders on the strategy space, formed as the intersection of the complete
  preference orders of its factions. Nash equilibria of the two-party game, so
  construed, do exist and, in such equilibria, both parties propose progressive
  income taxation.

Title:   Fully Modified Least Squares and Vector Autoregression. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 1023-78
Issue: 5
Volume: 63
Year: 1995
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  This paper provides a general framework which makes it possible to study
 the asymptotic behavior of FM regression in models with I(1) and I(0)
 regressors, models with unit roots, and models with only stationary
 regressors. This framework enables us to consider the use of FM regression
 in the context of vector autoregressions with some unit roots and some
 cointegrating relations. The resulting FM-VAR regressions are shown to
 produce optimal estimates of the cointegration space without prior
 knowledge of the number of unit roots in the system, without pretesting to
 determine the dimension of the cointegration space and without the use of
 restricted regression techniques like reduced rank regression. The paper
 also develops an asymptotic theory for inference. It is shown that
 conventional chi-squared critical values can be used to construct valid
 (but conservative) asymptotic tests in quite general FM time series
 regression.   Copyright 1995 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Random Expected Utility 
Abstract:
				 We develop and analyze a model of random
 choice and random expected utility. A decision problem is a finite set of
 lotteries that describe the feasible choices. A random choice rule
 associates with each decision problem a probability measure over choices.
 A random utility function is a probability measure over von
 Neumann-Morgenstern utility functions. We show that a random choice rule
 maximizes some random utility function if and only if it is mixture
 continuous, monotone (the probability that a lottery is chosen does not
 increase when other lotteries are added to the decision problem), extreme
 (lotteries that are not extreme points of the decision problem are chosen
 with probability 0), and linear (satisfies the independence axiom).	     Copyright The Econometric Society 2006.

 interesting sufficient conditions under w hich it is possible to predict
 the pattern of international trade in securities, goods, and factor
 content on the basis of cross-country d ifferences in factor endowments.
 It is shown that, under these circum stances, some well-known empirical
 tests have to be modified.   Copyright 1988 by The Econometric Society.

Title:   Nonuniform Bertrand Competition. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 1293-1330
Issue: 6
Volume: 60
Year: 1992
Month:  November 
Abstract:
  The feasibility of Bertrand undercutting with nonuniform prices is
 established and properties are derived for Bertrand equilibrium in
 nonuniform price strategies. With free entry, equilibrium entails
 zero-profit minimum average cost production. If there is more than one
 producing firm, all prices collapse to a minimum average cost uniform
 price. An existence condition is compared to conditions from uniform price
 theory. Without free entry equilibrium, prices may not collapse to a
 uniform price. Positive profit may occur but all firms earn equal profit
 and incur equal marginal cost, while consumers pay average outlay no
 greater than marginal cost.   Copyright 1992 by The Econometric Society.

Title:   Maximization and the Act of Choice
Abstract: The act of choosing can have particular relevance in maximizing
	behavior for at least two distinct reasons:  (1) process significance
	(preferences may be sensitive to the choice process, including the identity
	of the chooser) and (2) decisional inescapability (choices may have to be
	made whether or not the judgmental process has been completed). The general
	approach of maximizing behavior can--appropriately formulated--accommodate
	both concerns, but the regularities of choice behavior assumed in standard
	models of rational choice will need significant modification. These
	differences have considerable relevance in studies of economic, social, and
	political behavior.

Abstract:
  The well-known CUSUM test for structural change is investigated whe n
 there are lagged dependent variables among the regressors in a linear
 model. The authors show that both a modified CUSUM test, suggested b y J.
 M. Dufour (1982), and the straightforward CUSUM test retain their
 asymptotic significance levels in dynamic models, and find that the power
 depends crucially on the angle between the mean regressor and the
 structural shift.   Copyright 1988 by The Econometric Society.

Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 353-85
Issue: 2
Volume: 61
Year: 1993
Month:  March 
Abstract:
  This paper specifies and empirically analyzes a continuous-time,
 linear-quadratic, representative consumer model wit h time-nonseparable
 preferences of several forms. Within this framewor k, the author shows how
 time aggregation and time nonseparabilities in preferences over
 consumption streams can interact. The behavior of b oth seasonally
 adjusted and unadjusted consumption data is consistent wi th
 time-nonseparable preferences if consumption goods are durable and i f
 individuals develop habit over the flow of services from the good. T he
 data do not support a version of the model that ignores time
 nonseparabilities in preferences and focuses solely upon time aggregation.    Copyright 1993 by The Econometric Society.

Title: A PANIC Attack on Unit Roots and Cointegration 
Abstract:
				 This paper develops a new methodology that
 makes use of the factor structure of large dimensional panels to
 understand the nature of nonstationarity in the data. We refer to it as
 PANIC-Panel Analysis of Nonstationarity in Idiosyncratic and Common
 components. PANIC can detect whether the nonstationarity in a series is
 pervasive, or variable-specific, or both. It can determine the number of
 independent stochastic trends driving the common factors. PANIC also
 permits valid pooling of individual statistics and thus panel tests can be
 constructed. A distinctive feature of PANIC is that it tests the
 unobserved components of the data instead of the observed series. The key
 to PANIC is consistent estimation of the space spanned by the unobserved
 common factors and the idiosyncratic errors without knowing a priori
 whether these are stationary or integrated processes. We provide a
 rigorous theory for estimation and inference and show that the tests have
 good finite sample properties. Copyright The Econometric Society 2004.

Title: Identification of Treatment Effects Using Control Functions in Models With Continuous, Endogenous Treatment and Heterogeneous Effects 
Abstract:
				 We use the control function approach to
 identify the average treatment effect and the effect of treatment on the
 treated in models with a continuous endogenous regressor whose impact is
 heterogeneous. We assume a stochastic polynomial restriction on the form
 of the heterogeneity, but unlike alternative nonparametric control
 function approaches, our approach does not require large support
 assumptions. Copyright  2008 The Econometric Society.

Title:   An Analysis of Substitution Bias in Measuring Inflation, 1959-85. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 909-30
Issue: 4
Volume: 56
Year: 1988
Month:  July 
Abstract:
  The authors analyze the substitution bias in Laspeyres-type price
 indexes, using 101 c ommodities. They construct the tightest theoretical
 bounds on the cos t-of-living index using nonparametric methods and also
 construct supe rlative price indexes. Using nonparametric methods, the
 authors find homothetic preferences are consistent with the data.
 Sensitivity test s indicate that this result is not vacuous. Under this
 hypothesis, th e bias is between 0.22 and 0.14 percent per year.
 Superlative indexes imply a bias of about 0.18 percent. This estimate is
 somewhat larger than found in earlier studies. Commodity aggregation is
 found to be a major contributor to measured substitution bias.   Copyright 1988 by The Econometric Society.

Journal: Econometrica

Issue: 1
Volume: 57
Year: 1989
Month:  January 
Abstract:
  This paper studies the problem of implementation of allocation rules in
 economic environments when agents are incompletely informed about the
 environment. The concept of equilibrium used is that of Bayesian Nash
 equilibrium. The authors show that a condition called Bayesian
 monotonicity is necessary for implementation, as is an incentive
 compatibility condition. They also show that, when there are at least
 three agents, Bayesian monotonicity and a slightly stronger incentive
 compatibility condition are jointly sufficient for implementation. They
 present several examples to illustrate the result.   Copyright 1989 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Econometric Analysis of Realized Covariation: High Frequency Based Covariance, Regression, and Correlation in Financial Economics 
Abstract:
				 This paper analyses multivariate high
 frequency financial data using realized covariation. We provide a new
 asymptotic distribution theory for standard methods such as regression,
 correlation analysis, and covariance. It will be based on a fixed interval
 of time (e.g., a day or week), allowing the number of high frequency
 returns during this period to go to infinity. Our analysis allows us to
 study how high frequency correlations, regressions, and covariances change
 through time. In particular we provide confidence intervals for each of
 these quantities. Copyright The Econometric Society 2004.

Title: Bootstrap Algorithms for Testing and Determining the Cointegration Rank in VAR Models  					-super-1  					  				 
Abstract:
				 In this paper a bootstrap algorithm for a
 reduced rank vector autoregressive model with a restricted linear trend
 and independent, identically distributed errors is analyzed. For testing
 the cointegration rank, the asymptotic distribution under the hypothesis
 is the same as for the usual likelihood ratio test, so that the bootstrap
 is consistent. It is furthermore shown that a bootstrap procedure for
 determining the rank is asymptotically consistent in the sense that the
 probability of choosing the rank smaller than the true one converges to
 zero. Copyright The Econometric Society 2006.

Title:  Price Formation in Single Call Markets
Abstract: This paper reports a laboratory experiment that examines price
	formation in the single call market. The experiment design is intended to
	enhance the predictive power of the Bayesian Nash equilibrium (BNE) theory
	for this trading institution.  The data support several qualitative
	implications of the BNE, especially when subjects compete against Nash
	'robot' opponents, but subjects' behavior is not as responsive to changes in
	the pricing rule as the BNE predictions. Offers tend to reveal more of the
	underlying values and costs than predicted, particularly when subjects are
	experienced.  A simple learning model accounts for several of the deviations
	from BNE.

Title: Search, Obfuscation, and Price Elasticities on the Internet 
Abstract:
				 We examine the competition between a group
 of Internet retailers who operate in an environment where a price search
 engine plays a dominant role. We show that for some products in this
 environment, the easy price search makes demand tremendously
 price-sensitive. Retailers, though, engage in obfuscation-practices that
 frustrate consumer search or make it less damaging to firms-resulting in
 much less price sensitivity on some other products. We discuss several
 models of obfuscation and examine its effects on demand and markups
 empirically. Copyright  2009 The Econometric Society.

Title:   Continuous Record Asymptotics for Rolling Sample Variance Estimators. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 139-74
Issue: 1
Volume: 64
Year: 1996
Month:  January 
Abstract:
  It is widely known that conditional covariances of asset returns change
 over time. Researchers doing empirical work have adopted many strategies
 for accommodating conditional heteroskedasticity. One popular strategy is
 performing rolling regressions in which only data from, say, the preceding
 five year period is used to estimate the conditional covariance of returns
 at a given date. The authors develop continuous record asymptotic
 approximations for the measurement error in conditional variances when
 using these methods. They derive asymptotically optimal window lengths for
 the standard rolling regressions and optimal weights for weighted rolling
 regressions. The S&P 500 is used as an empirical example.   Copyright 1996 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Nonparametric Instrumental Variables Estimation of a Quantile Regression Model 
Abstract:
				 We consider nonparametric estimation of a
 regression function that is identified by requiring a specified quantile
 of the regression "error" conditional on an instrumental variable to be
 zero. The resulting estimating equation is a nonlinear integral equation
 of the first kind, which generates an ill-posed inverse problem. The
 integral operator and distribution of the instrumental variable are
 unknown and must be estimated nonparametrically. We show that the
 estimator is mean-square consistent, derive its rate of convergence in
 probability, and give conditions under which this rate is optimal in a
 minimax sense. The results of Monte Carlo experiments show that the
 estimator behaves well in finite samples. Copyright The Econometric Society 2007.

Title:   Learning How to Cooperate: Optimal Play in Repeated Coordination Games. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 571-95
Issue: 3
Volume: 58
Year: 1990
Month:  May 
Abstract:
  This paper proposes a characterization of optimal strategies for playing
 certain repeated coordination games whose players have identical
 preferences. Players' optimal coordination strategies reflect their
 uncertainty about how their partners will respond to multiple-equilibrium
 problems; this uncertainty constrains the statistical relationships
 between their strategy choices players can bring about. The authors show
 that optimality is nevertheless consistent with subgame-perfect
 equilibrium. Examples are analyzed in which players use precedents as
 focal points to achieve and maintain coordination, and in which they play
 dominated strategies with positive probability in early stages in the hope
 of generating a useful precedent.   Copyright 1990 by The Econometric Society.

Title:   Potential, Value, and Consistency. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 589-614
Issue: 3
Volume: 57
Year: 1989
Month:  May 
Abstract:
  Let P be a real-valued function defined on the space of cooperative games
 with transferable utility, satisfying the following condition: In every
 game, the marginal contributions of all players (according to P) are
 efficient (i.e., add up to the worth of the grand coalition). It is proved
 that there exists just one such function P--called the potential--and
 moreover that the resulting payoff vector coincides with the Shapley
 value. The potential approach yields other characterizations for the
 value; in particular, in terms of a new internal consistency property.
 Further results deal with weighted values and with the nontransferable
 utility case.	 Copyright 1989 by The Econometric Society.

Journal: Econometrica

Issue: 5
Volume: 58
Year: 1990
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  This paper describes a new approach to normative economics, combining the
 theory of social choice with econometric modeling of aggregate consumer
 behavior. The author first derives a system of aggregate demand functions
 by exact aggregation over individual demand functions. He then constructs
 measures of individual welfare from systems of individual demand
 functions. Finally, the author incorporates these measures into a social
 welfare function, introducing ethical assumptions based on horizontal and
 vertical equity. To illustrate the application of this approach, he
 considers the U.S. standard of living and its cost over the period
 1947-85.   Copyright 1990 by The Econometric Society.

Title:   Nonmanipulable Cores. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 1057-74
Issue: 5
Volume: 55
Year: 1987
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  An effectivity function describes the blocking power of coalitions on
 subsets of alternatives. Given a preference profile, if any coalition
 blocks an alternative whenever it can, using its own power and making all
 of its members better off, only alternatives in the core can be reached.
 In this paper, the author studies the incen tives of the coalitions to use
 this power truthfully, i.e., to not ma nipulate. Some wellknown cores,
 among them the core of an exchange ec onomy, are manipulable. The author
 gives sufficient conditions on an effectivity function that assures its
 core is nonmanipulable.   Copyright 1987 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Estimation of Semiparametric Models when the Criterion Function Is Not Smooth 
Abstract:
				 We provide easy to verify sufficient
 conditions for the consistency and asymptotic normality of a class of
 semiparametric optimization estimators where the criterion function does
 not obey standard smoothness conditions and simultaneously depends on some
 nonparametric estimators that can themselves depend on the parameters to
 be estimated. Our results extend existing theories such as those of Pakes
 and Pollard (1989), Andrews (1994a), and Newey (1994). We also show that
 bootstrap provides asymptotically correct confidence regions for the
 finite dimensional parameters. We apply our results to two examples: a
 'hit rate' and a partially linear median regression with some endogenous
 regressors. Copyright The Econometric Society 2003.

Title: Representing Preferences with a Unique Subjective State Space: A Corrigendum  					-super-1  					  				 
Abstract:
				 Dekel, Lipman and Rustichini (2001)
 (henceforth DLR) axiomatically characterized three representations of
 preferences that allow for a desire for flexibility and/or commitment. In
 one of these representations (ordinal expected utility), the independence
 axiom is stated in a weaker form than is necessary to obtain the
 representation; in another (additive expected utility), the continuity
 axiom is too weak. In this erratum we provide examples showing that the
 axioms used by DLR are not sufficient, and provide stronger versions of
 these axioms that, together with the other axioms used by DLR, are
 necessary and sufficient for these two representations. Copyright The Econometric Society 2007.

Title:   Time Series Regression with a Unit Root. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 277-301
Issue: 2
Volume: 55
Year: 1987
Month:  March 
Abstract:
  This paper studies the random walk in a general time series setting that
 allows for weakly dependent and heterogeneously distributed innovations.
 It is shown that simple least squares regression consistently estimates a
 unit root under very general conditions in spite of the presence of
 autocorrelated errors. The limiting distribution of the standardized
 estimator and the associated regression t statistic are found using
 functional central limit theory. New tests of the random walk hypothesis
 are developed which permit a wide class of dependent and heterogeneous
 innovation sequences. A new limiting distribution theory is constructed
 based on the concept of continuous data recording. This theory, together
 with an asymptotic expansion that is developed in the paper for the unit
 root case, explain many of the interesting experimental results recently
 reported in Evans and Savin (1981, 1984).   Copyright 1987 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Asymptotic Distribution Theory for Nonparametric Entropy Measures of Serial Dependence 
Abstract:
				 Entropy is a classical statistical concept
 with appealing properties. Establishing asymptotic distribution theory for
 smoothed nonparametric entropy measures of dependence has so far proved
 challenging. In this paper, we develop an asymptotic theory for a class of
 kernel-based smoothed nonparametric entropy measures of serial dependence
 in a time-series context. We use this theory to derive the limiting
 distribution of Granger and Lin's (1994) normalized entropy measure of
 serial dependence, which was previously not available in the literature.
 We also apply our theory to construct a new entropy-based test for serial
 dependence, providing an alternative to Robinson's (1991) approach. To
 obtain accurate inferences, we propose and justify a consistent smoothed
 bootstrap procedure. The naive bootstrap is not consistent for our test.
 Our test is useful in, for example, testing the random walk hypothesis,
 evaluating density forecasts, and identifying important lags of a time
 series. It is asymptotically locally more powerful than Robinson's (1991)
 test, as is confirmed in our simulation. An application to the daily S&P
 500 stock price index illustrates our approach. Copyright The Econometric Society 2005.

Title:  The Loser's Curse and Information Aggregation in Common Value Auctions
Abstract: The authors consider an auction in which k identical objects of unknown
	value are auctioned off to n bidders. The k highest bidders get an object and
	pay the k + 1st bid. Bidders receive a signal that provides information about
	the value of the object. The authors characterize the unique symmetric
	equilibrium of this auction. They then consider a sequence of auctions
	A[subscript]r with n[subscript]r bidders and k[subscript]r objects.  The
	authors show that price converges in probability to the true value of the
	object if and only if both the number of objects (k) and the number of
	bidders who do not receive an object (n - k) go to infinity.

Title:  Optimal Contracts when Enforcement Is a Decision Variable
Abstract:   The paper analyzes choice-theoretic costly enforcement in an
 intertemporal contracting model with a differentially informed
 investor and entrepreneur. An intertemporal contract is modeled as a
 mechanism with limited commitment to payment and enforcement
 decisions. The paper shows that simple debt is the optimal contract
 when commitment is limited and costly enforcement is a decision
 variable. In contrast, stochastic contracts are optimal when agents
 can commit to the ex-ante optimal decisions. The paper also shows
 that the Costly State Verification model can be viewed as a reduced
 form of an enforcement model.

Title:   Risk and Insurance in Village India. 
Journal: Econometrica

Issue: 3
Volume: 62
Year: 1994
Month:  May 
Abstract:
  The full insurance model is tested using data from three poor, high-risk
 villages in the semi-arid tropics of southern India. The model presented
 here incorporates a number of salient features of the actual village
 economies. Although the model is rejected statistically, it does provide a
 surprisingly good benchmark. Household consumptions comove with village
 average consumption. More clearly, household consumptions are not much
 influenced by contemporaneous own income, sickness, unemployment, or other
 idiosyncratic shocks, controlling for village consumption (i.e., for
 village-level risk). There is evidence that the landless are less well
 insured than their village neighbors in one of the three villages.   Copyright 1994 by The Econometric Society.

Journal: Econometrica

Issue: 4
Volume: 62
Year: 1994
Month:  July 
Abstract:
  Suppose that the authors are interested in the distribution of a set of
 characteristics over a population. They study a precise sense in which
 this distribution can be said to be polarized and provide a theory of
 measurement. Polarization, as conceptualized here, is closely related to
 the generation of social tensions, to the possibilities of revolution and
 revolt, and to the existence of social unrest in general. The authors take
 special care to distinguish their theory from the theory of inequality
 measurement. They derive measures of polarization that are easily
 applicable to distributions of characteristics such as income and wealth.   Copyright 1994 by The Econometric Society.

	and attain the semiparametric efficiency bounds for a number of important
	econometric models. The idea is to find a parametric model that passes
	through the true model. The score for the parametric model is then estimated
	nonparametrically and the estimator is obtained by setting the estimated
	score to zero.

Title:   Bond Pricing and the Term Structure of Interest Rates: A New Methodology for Contingent Claims Valuation. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 77-105
Issue: 1
Volume: 60
Year: 1992
Month:  January 
Abstract:
  This paper presents a unifying theory for valuing contingent claims under
 a stochastic term structure of interest rates. The methodology, based on
 the equivalent martingale measure technique, takes as given an initial
 forward rate curve and a family of potential stochastic processes for its
 subsequent movements. A no-arbitrage condition restricts this family of
 processes, yielding valuation formula for interest rate sensitive
 contingent claims that do not explicitly depend on the market prices of
 risk. Examples are provided to illustrate the key results.   Copyright 1992 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Wage Bargaining with On-the-Job Search: Theory and Evidence 
Abstract:
				 Most applications of Nash bargaining over
 wages ignore between-employer competition for labor services and attribute
 all of the workers' rent to their bargaining power. In this paper, we
 write and estimate an equilibrium model with strategic wage bargaining and
 on-the-job search and use it to take another look at the determinants of
 wages in France. There are three essential determinants of wages in our
 model: productivity, competition between employers resulting from
 on-the-job search, and the workers' bargaining power. We find that
 between-firm competition matters a lot in the determination of wages,
 because it is quantitatively more important than wage bargaining à la Nash
 in raising wages above the workers' "reservation wages," defined as
 out-of-work income. In particular, we detect no significant bargaining
 power for intermediate- and low-skilled workers, and a modestly positive
 bargaining power for high-skilled workers. Copyright The Econometric Society 2006.

Title:  Pathological Outcomes of Observational Learning  
Abstract:   This paper explores how Bayes-rational individuals learn
 sequentially from the discrete actions of others. Unlike earlier
 informational herding papers, we admit heterogeneous preferences. 
 Not only may type-specific "herds" eventually arise, but a new
 robust possibility emerges: "confounded learning". Beliefs may
 converge to a limit point where history offers no decisive lessons
 for anyone, and each type's actions forever nontrivially split
 between two actions. To verify that our identified limit outcomes do
 arise, we exploit the Markov-martingale character of beliefs. 
 Learning dynamics are stochastically stable near a fixed point in
 many Bayesian learning models like this one.

Month:  September 
Abstract:
  This paper is concerned with the use of power properties of tests in
 econometric applications. Inverse power functions are defined. These
 functions are designed to yield summary measures of power that facilitate
 the interpretation of test results in practice. Simple approximations are
 introduced for the inverse power functions of Wald, likelihood ratio,
 Lagrange multiplier, and Hausman tests. These approximations readily
 convey the general qualitative features of the power of a test. Examples
 are provided to illustrate their usefulness in interpreting test results.   Copyright 1989 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Large Sample Properties of Matching Estimators for Average Treatment Effects 
Abstract:
				 Matching estimators for average treatment
 effects are widely used in evaluation research despite the fact that their
 large sample properties have not been established in many cases. The
 absence of formal results in this area may be partly due to the fact that
 standard asymptotic expansions do not apply to matching estimators with a
 fixed number of matches because such estimators are highly nonsmooth
 functionals of the data. In this article we develop new methods for
 analyzing the large sample properties of matching estimators and establish
 a number of new results. We focus on matching with replacement with a
 fixed number of matches. First, we show that matching estimators are not
 N-super-1&sol;2-consistent in general and describe conditions under which
 matching estimators do attain N-super-1&sol;2-consistency. Second, we show
 that even in settings where matching estimators are
 N-super-1&sol;2-consistent, simple matching estimators with a fixed number
 of matches do not attain the semiparametric efficiency bound. Third, we
 provide a consistent estimator for the large sample variance that does not
 require consistent nonparametric estimation of unknown functions. Software
 for implementing these methods is available in Matlab, Stata, and R.	     Copyright The Econometric Society 2006.

Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 745-82
Issue: 4
Volume: 61
Year: 1993
Month:  July 
Abstract:
  This paper examines how the possibility of renegotiation affects
 contractual outcomes in signaling games when an infinite number of rounds
 of renegotiations are allowed before contracts are executed. The main
 results of the paper are (1) contracts may still contain distortions, (2)
 the popular 'efficient' separating-equilibrium outcome is never an
 equilibrium outcome with renegotiation, (3) incentive-compatibility
 constraints can be generalized to incorporate renegotiation, (4)
 equilibrium outcomes can be separating and nevertheless depend on the
 uninformed player's prior, and (5) renegotiation in signaling games may
 lead to outcomes similar to equilibrium outcomes of screening games in
 which multiple contract purchases are allowed.   Copyright 1993 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Games with Imperfectly Observable Actions in Continuous Time 
Abstract:
				 This paper investigates a new class of
 two-player games in continuous time, in which the players' observations of
 each other's actions are distorted by Brownian motions. These games are
 analogous to repeated games with imperfect monitoring in which the players
 take actions frequently. Using a differential equation, we find the set
 &Escr;(r) of payoff pairs achievable by all public perfect equilibria of
 the continuous-time game, where r is the discount rate. The same
 differential equation allows us to find public perfect equilibria that
 achieve any value pair on the boundary of the set &Escr;(r). These public
 perfect equilibria are based on a pair of continuation values as a state
 variable, which moves along the boundary of &Escr;(r) during the course of
 the game. In order to give players incentives to take actions that are not
 static best responses, the pair of continuation values is stochastically
 driven by the players' observations of each other's actions along the
 boundary of the set &Escr;(r). 			    Copyright The Econometric Society 2007.

Abstract:
				 A decision maker is asked to express her
 beliefs by assigning probabilities to certain possible states. We focus on
 the relationship between her database and her beliefs. We show that if
 beliefs given a union of two databases are a convex combination of beliefs
 given each of the databases, the belief formation process follows a simple
 formula: beliefs are a similarity-weighted average of the beliefs induced
 by each past case. Copyright The Econometric Society 2005.

Month:  July 
Abstract:
  This paper examines three basic issues in the measurement of poverty: the
 choice of poverty line, the index of poverty, and the relation between
 poverty and inequality. The general theme is that th ere is a diversity of
 judgments which enter the measurement of povert y and it is necessary to
 recognize these explicitly in the procedures adopted. It is argued that
 dominance conditions provide tools which are both powerful and easy to
 apply empirically. Examples are given f or the United States.	 Copyright 1987 by The Econometric Society.

Abstract:
  A limit theory for Wald tests of Granger causality in levels vector

 which allows for stochastic trends and cointegration. Earlier work is
 extended to the general case, thereby characterizing when these Wald tests
 are asymptotically valid as 'x'(superscript 2) criteria. Our results for
 inference from unrestricted levels VAR are not encouraging: the limit
 theory often involves nuisance parameters and nonstandard distributions, a
 situation offering no satisfactory statistical basis for these tests.
 Granger causality tests in ECM's also suffer from nuisance parameter
 dependencies asymptotically and in some cases nonstandard limit theory.
 Both these results are somewhat surprising in light of earlier research.   Copyright 1993 by The Econometric Society.

Title:   Heteroskedasticity and Autocorrelation Consistent Covariance Matrix Estimation. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 817-58
Issue: 3
Volume: 59
Year: 1991
Month:  May 
Abstract:
  This paper is concerned with the estimation of covariance matrices in the
 presence of heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation of unknown forms.
 Currently available estimators that are designed for this context depend
 upon the choice of a lag truncation parameter and a weighting scheme. No
 results are available regarding the choice of lag truncation parameter for
 a fixed sample size, regarding data-dependent automatic lag truncation
 parameters, or regarding the choice of weighting scheme. This paper
 addresses these problems. Asymptotically optimal kernel/weighting scheme
 and bandwidth/lag truncation parameters are obtained. Using these results,
 data-dependent automatic bandwidth/lag truncation parameters are
 introduced.   Copyright 1991 by The Econometric Society.

Issue: 4
Volume: 58
Year: 1990

Abstract:
  Individuals with finite private information independently choose acts and
 messages. Their utilities may depend on all acts and information,
 including the center's. Incentive payments are separable and fully
 transferable. Implementable incentives making specified behavior a
 Bayesian equilibrium are derived whenever the center's information depends
 stochastically, however slightly, on all relevant private information, and
 also whenever individuals' relative valuations of acts, however divergent,
 are not too dissimilarly affected by different states of nature.
 Feasibility is resolved whenever the desired strategies reveal the agents'
 beliefs about the center's information. Key concepts of agent similarity
 are developed for nonresponsive and budget-balancing cases.   Copyright 1990 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Instrumental Variable Estimation of Nonparametric Models 
Abstract:
				 In econometrics there are many occasions
 where knowledge of the structural relationship among dependent variables
 is required to answer questions of interest. This paper gives
 identification and estimation results for nonparametric conditional moment
 restrictions. We characterize identification of structural functions as
 completeness of certain conditional distributions, and give sufficient
 identification conditions for exponential families and discrete variables.
 We also give a consistent, nonparametric estimator of the structural
 function. The estimator is nonparametric two-stage least squares based on
 series approximation, which overcomes an ill-posed inverse problem by
 placing bounds on integrals of higher-order derivatives. Copyright The Econometric Society 2003.

Title:  Mechanism Design with Collusion and Correlation  
Abstract:   In a public good environment with positively correlated types, we
 characterize optimal mechanisms when agents have private information
 and can enter collusive agreements. First, we prove a
 weak-collusion-proof principle according to which there is no
 restriction for the principal in offering weak-collusion-proof
 mechanisms. Second, with this principle, we characterize the set of
 allocations that satisfy individual and coalitional incentive
 constraints. The optimal weakly collusion-proof mechanism calls for
 distortions away from first-best efficiency obtained without
 collusion.  Allowing collusion restores continuity between the
 correlated and the uncorrelated environments. When the correlation
 becomes almost perfect, first-best efficiency is approached.
 Finally, the optimal collusion-proof mechanism is strongly
 ratifiable.

Abstract:
  Contributions by E. Maskin and S. Williams have established that any
 social choice cor respondence satisfying monotonicity, no veto power, and
 having at lea st three participants is Nash implementable under the
 proviso that th e number of social alternatives is finite and that the
 correspondence satisfies citizen sovereignty. The author makes
 improvements in two aspects of their Nash implementation theorems: a
 reduction in the str ategy space and a proof for an arbitrary alternative
 set. Each partic ipant announces two participants' preferences, an
 alternative, and a positive integer. With this strategy space
 specification, the author confirms Maskin's theorem for an arbitrary size
 of the alternative se t.   Copyright 1988 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Ambiguity, Risk, and Asset Returns in Continuous Time 
Abstract:
 Models of utility in stochastic continuous-time settings typically assume
 that beliefs are represented by a probability measure, hence ruling out a
 priori any concern with ambiguity. This paper formulates a continuous-time
 intertemporal version of multiple-priors utility, where aversion to
 ambiguity is admissible. In a representative agent asset market setting,
 the model delivers restrictions on excess returns that admit
 interpretations reflecting a premium for risk and a separate premium for
 ambiguity. Copyright The Econometric Society 2002.

Title: Estimating Semiparametric ARCH(&infin;) Models by Kernel Smoothing Methods  					 
Abstract:
				 We investigate a class of semiparametric
 ARCH(&infin;) models that includes as a special case the partially
 nonparametric (PNP) model introduced by Engle and Ng (1993) and which
 allows for both flexible dynamics and flexible function form with regard
 to the "news impact" function. We show that the functional part of the
 model satisfies a type II linear integral equation and give simple
 conditions under which there is a unique solution. We propose an
 estimation method that is based on kernel smoothing and profiled
 likelihood. We establish the distribution theory of the parametric
 components and the pointwise distribution of the nonparametric component
 of the model. We also discuss efficiency of both the parametric part and
 the nonparametric part. We investigate the performance of our procedures
 on simulated data and on a sample of S&P500 index returns. We find
 evidence of asymmetric news impact functions, consistent with the
 parametric analysis. Copyright The Econometric Society 2005.

Title:   The Probability Weighting Function 
Abstract: A probability weighting function w(p) is a prominent feature of several
	nonexpected utility theories, including prospect theory and rank-dependent
	models.  Empirical estimates indicate that w(p) is regressive with respect to
	the diagonal (w(p) > p for small p, and w(p)< p for large p), s-shaped
	(concave near p = 0, convex near p = 1), and asymmetrical (intersecting the
	diagonal at about p = l/3).  The paper provides axioms for several families
	of weighting functions, including a "compound invariant" form, w(p) =
	exp{-{-ln p}[superscript alpha]}, 0 < alpha < 1, which is regressive,
	s-shaped, and which has invariant fixed and inflection points at p = 1/e.

Title: Inference in Arch and Garch Models with Heavy--Tailed Errors 
Abstract:
 ARCH and GARCH models directly address the dependency of conditional
 second moments, and have proved particularly valuable in modelling
 processes where a relatively large degree of fluctuation is present. These
 include financial time series, which can be particularly heavy tailed.
 However, little is known about properties of ARCH or GARCH models in the
 heavy--tailed setting, and no methods are available for approximating the
 distributions of parameter estimators there. In this paper we show that,
 for heavy--tailed errors, the asymptotic distributions of quasi--maximum
 likelihood parameter estimators in ARCH and GARCH models are nonnormal,
 and are particularly difficult to estimate directly using standard
 parametric methods. Standard bootstrap methods also fail to produce
 consistent estimators. To overcome these problems we develop
 percentile--"t", subsample bootstrap approximations to estimator
 distributions. Studentizing is employed to approximate scale, and the
 subsample bootstrap is used to estimate shape. The good performance of
 this approach is demonstrated both theoretically and numerically. Copyright The Econometric Society 2003.

Title:   Oligopolistic Competition and the Optimal Provision of Products. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 1281-1301
Issue: 6
Volume: 63
Year: 1995
Month:  November 
Abstract:
  This paper reconsiders the theory of market versus optimal product
 diversity using a discrete choice approach to product differentiation. The
 authors analyze oligopoly with price competition and free entry with
 integer firm numbers. Under the Chamberlinian symmetry assumption, they
 show that log-concavity of the taste density function implies excessive
 market provision of diversity when each consumer buys one unit. This
 result is extended to price-sensitive individual demands by proving that
 the equilibrium number of firms exceeds that provided at the second-best
 optimum subject to zero profits.   Copyright 1995 by The Econometric Society.

Title: A Smooth Model of Decision Making under Ambiguity 
Abstract:
				 We propose and characterize a model of
 preferences over acts such that the decision maker prefers act f to act g
 if and only if 				       
 <openface>E</openface><sub>&mu;</sub>&phi;(				   
      <openface>E</openface><sub>&pi;</sub>u&cir;f) &ges;		   
		   <openface>E</openface><sub>&mu;</sub>&phi;(		   
			<openface>E</openface><sub>&pi;</sub>u&cir;g),
 where					  <openface>E</openface> is the
 expectation operator, u is a von Neumann-Morgenstern utility function,
 &phi;is an increasing transformation, and &mu;is a subjective probability
 over the set &Pi;of probability measures &pi;that the decision maker
 thinks are relevant given his subjective information. A key feature of our
 model is that it achieves a separation between ambiguity, identified as a
 characteristic of the decision maker's subjective beliefs, and ambiguity
 attitude, a characteristic of the decision maker's tastes. We show that
 attitudes toward pure risk are characterized by the shape of u, as usual,
 while attitudes toward ambiguity are characterized by the shape of &phi;.
 Ambiguity itself is defined behaviorally and is shown to be characterized
 by properties of the subjective set of measures &Pi;. One advantage of
 this model is that the well-developed machinery for dealing with risk
 attitudes can be applied as well to ambiguity attitudes. The model is also
 distinct from many in the literature on ambiguity in that it allows
 smooth, rather than kinked, indifference curves. This leads to different
 behavior and improved tractability, while still sharing the main features
 (e.g., Ellsberg's paradox). The maxmin expected utility model (e.g.,
 Gilboa and Schmeidler (1989)) with a given set of measures may be seen as
 a limiting case of our model with infinite ambiguity aversion. Two
 illustrative portfolio choice examples are offered.			     Copyright The Econometric Society 2005.

Title:   Inference Concerning the Number of Factors in a Multivariate Nonparametric Relationship
Abstract: This paper considers the problem of determining the number of factors
	in a multivariate nonparametric relationship. The definition of factors given
	is broad enough to encompass a number of potential applications in
	econometrics, including inferring the rank of demand, consistent tests for
	lack of identification in linear instrumental variable models, and testing
	arbitrage pricing theory. The paper gives both series and kernel methods for
	testing hypotheses concerning, and consistent estimation of, the number of
	factors. The methods are compared in a small simulation study and in an
	application to determining the rank of demand systems.

Issue: 6
Volume: 63
Year: 1995
Month:  November 
Abstract:
  Two-person repeated games with no discounting are considered where there
 is uncertainty about the type of the players. If there is a possibility
 that a player is an automaton committed to a particular pure or mixed
 stage-game action, then this provides a lower bound on the Nash
 equilibrium payoffs to a normal type of this player. The lower bound is
 the best available and is robust to the existence of other types. The
 results are extended to the case of two-sided uncertainty. This work
 extends Schmidt (1993) who analyzed the restricted class of conflicting
 interest games.   Copyright 1995 by The Econometric Society.

Issue: 3

Year: 1987

Abstract:
  Buyer's preferences over auctions depend on their measure of absolute
 risk aversion. If it is constant and they have independent private values,
 they are indifferent between a first-price auction (FPA), a second-price
 auction (SPA), and a first-price auction in which the number of bidders is
 revealed before bids are taken (FPA- R). If they have decreasing absolute
 risk aversion, they prefer the SPA to the FPA-R to the FPA. Their
 preference for the SPA is diminished to the extent that their values are
 affiliated. Affiliation also causes them to prefer the number of bidders
 to be revealed, whereas the seller then prefers to keep it secret.   Copyright 1987 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Quadratic Concavity and Determinacy of Equilibrium 
Abstract:
 One of the central features of classical models of competitive markets is
 the generic determinacy of competitive equilibria. For smooth economies
 with a finite number of commodities and a finite number of consumers,
 almost all initial endowments admit only a finite number of competitive
 equilibria, and these equilibria vary (locally) smoothly with endowments;
 thus equilibrium comparative statics are locally determinate. This paper
 establishes parallel results for economies with finitely many consumers
 and infinitely many commodities. The most important new condition we
 introduce, quadratic concavity, rules out preferences in which goods are
 perfect substitutes globally, locally, or asymptotically. Our framework is
 sufficiently general to encompass many of the models that have proved
 important in the study of continuous-time trading in financial markets,
 trading over an infinite time horizon, and trading of finely
 differentiated commodities. Copyright The Econometric Society 2002.

Title:   Semiparametric Estimation of a Proportional Hazard Model with Unobserved Heterogeneity  
Journal: Econometrica
Abstract:
  The proportional hazard model with unobserved heterogeneity gives the hazard
  function of a random variable conditional on covariates and a second random
  variable representing unobserved heterogeneity. This paper shows how to
  estimate the baseline hazard function and the distribution of the unobserved
  heterogeneity nonparametrically. The baseline hazard function and
  heterogeneity distribution are assumed to satisfy smoothness conditions but
  are not assumed to belong to known, finite-dimensional, parametric families.
  Existing estimators assume that the baseline hazard function or heterogeneity
  distribution belongs to a known parametric family. Thus, the estimators
  presented in this paper are more general than existing ones.

Title: Eliciting Risk and Time Preferences 
Abstract:
				 We design experiments to jointly elicit
 risk and time preferences for the adult Danish population. Since subjects
 are generally risk averse, we find that joint elicitation provides
 estimates of discount rates that are significantly lower than those found
 in previous studies and more in line with what would be considered as a
 priori reasonable rates. The statistical specification relies on a
 theoretical framework that involves a latent trade-off between long-run
 optimization and short-run temptation. Estimation of this specification is
 undertaken using structural, maximum likelihood methods. Our main results
 based on exponential discounting are robust to alternative specifications
 such as hyperbolic discounting. These results have direct implications for
 attempts to elicit time preferences, as well as debates over the
 appropriate domain of the utility function when characterizing risk
 aversion and time consistency. 				 Copyright Copyright  2008 by The Econometric Society.

Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 821-56
Issue: 4
Volume: 61
Year: 1993
Month:  July 
Abstract:
  This paper considers tests for parameter instability and structural
 change with unknown change point. The results apply to a wide class of
 parametric models that are suitable for estimation by generalized method
 of moments procedures. The asymptotic distributions of the test statistics
 considered here are nonstandard because the change point parameter only
 appears under the alternative hypothesis and not under the null. The tests
 considered here are shown to have nontrivial asymptotic local power
 against all alternatives for which the parameters are nonconstant. The
 tests are found to perform quite well in a Monte Carlo experiment reported
 elsewhere.   Copyright 1993 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Incentives, Contracts, and Markets: A General Equilibrium Theory of Firms  						  				 
Abstract:
				 This paper takes steps toward integrating
 firm theory in the spirit of Alchian and Demsetz (1972) and Grossman and
 Hart (1986), contract theory in the spirit of Holmstrom (1979), and
 general equilibrium theory in the spirit of Arrow and Debreu (1954) and
 McKenzie (1959). In the model presented here, the set of firms that form
 and the contractual arrangements that appear, the assignments of agents to
 firms, the prices faced by firms for inputs and outputs, and the
 incentives to agents are all determined endogenously at equilibrium.
 Agents choose consumption-but they also choose which firms to join, which
 roles to occupy in those firms, and which actions to take in those roles.
 Agents interact anonymously with the (large) market, but strategically
 within the (small) firms they join. The model accommodates moral hazard,
 adverse selection, signaling, and insurance. Equilibria may be Pareto
 ranked. Copyright The Econometric Society 2007.

Title:   A Method of Simulated Moments for Estimation of Discrete Response Models without Numerical Integration. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 995-1026
Issue: 5
Volume: 57
Year: 1989
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  This paper proposes a simple modification of a conventional generalized
 method of moments estimator for a discrete response model, replacing
 response probabilities that require numerical integration with estimators
 obtained by Monte Carlo simulation. This method of simulated moments does
 not require precise estimates of these probabilities, as the law of large
 numbers operating across observations controls simulation error, and,
 hence, can use simulations of practical size. The method is useful for
 models such as high-dimensional multinomial probit, where computation has
 previously restricted applications. Statistical properties are established
 using empirical process methods that can handle discontinuities introduced
 by simulation.   Copyright 1989 by The Econometric Society.

Title:   Consistent Specification Testing via Nonparametric Series Regression. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 1133-59
Issue: 5
Volume: 63
Year: 1995
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  This paper proposes two consistent one-sided specification tests for
 parametric regression models, one based on the sample covariance between
 the residual from the parametric model and the discrepancy between the
 parametric and nonparametric fitted values; the other based on the
 difference in sums of squared residuals between the parametric and
 nonparametric models. The authors estimate the nonparametric model by
 series regression. The new test statistics converge in distribution to a
 unit normal under correct specification and grow to infinity faster than
 the parametric rate [square root of] n under misspecification, while
 avoiding weighting, sample splitting, and nonnested testing procedures
 used elsewhere.   Copyright 1995 by The Econometric Society.

Title:   Dynamic (S, s) Economies. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 1659-86
Issue: 6
Volume: 59
Year: 1991
Month:  November 
Abstract:
  In this paper, the authors provide a framework to study the aggregate
 dynamic behavior of an economy where individual units follow (S, s)
 policies and are subject to aggregate and idiosyncratic shocks. They
 characterize structural and stochastic heterogeneities that ensure
 convergence of the economy's aggregate to that of its (stochastic)
 frictionless counterpart, determine the speed at which convergence takes
 place, and describe the transitional dynamics of this economy. They study
 the evolution of the economy's aggregate and the evolution of the
 difference between this aggregate and that of the difference between this
 aggregate and that of an economy without microeconomic friction, where the
 latter pertains to a situation where individual units adjust with no delay
 to all shocks.   Copyright 1991 by The Econometric Society.

Title:   Liquidity Constrained Markets versus Debt Constrained Markets. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 575-98
Issue: 3
Volume: 69
Year: 2001
Month:  May 
Abstract:
  This paper compares two different models in a common environment. The
 first model has liquidity constraints in that consumers save a single
 asset that they cannot sell short. The second model has debt constraints
 in that consumers cannot borrow so much that they would want to default,
 but is otherwise a standard complete markets model. Both models share the
 features that individuals are unable to completely insure against
 idiosyncratic shocks and that interest rates are lower than subjective
 discount rates. In a stochastic environment, the two models have quite
 different dynamic properties, with the debt constrained model exhibiting
 simple stochastic steady states, while the liquidity constrained model has
 greater persistence of shocks.

Title: Cross-Section Regression with Common Shocks 
Abstract:
				 This paper considers regression models for
 cross-section data that exhibit cross-section dependence due to common
 shocks, such as macroeconomic shocks. The paper analyzes the properties of
 least squares (LS) estimators in this context. The results of the paper
 allow for any form of cross-section dependence and heterogeneity across
 population units. The probability limits of the LS estimators are
 determined, and necessary and sufficient conditions are given for
 consistency. The asymptotic distributions of the estimators are found to
 be mixed normal after recentering and scaling. The t, Wald, and F
 statistics are found to have asymptotic standard normal, &chi;-super-2,
 and scaled &chi;-super-2 distributions, respectively, under the null
 hypothesis when the conditions required for consistency of the parameter
 under test hold. However, the absolute values of t, Wald, and F statistics
 are found to diverge to infinity under the null hypothesis when these
 conditions fail. Confidence intervals exhibit similarly dichotomous
 behavior. Hence, common shocks are found to be innocuous in some
 circumstances, but quite problematic in others.			     Copyright The Econometric Society 2005.

Title:   An Efficient Semiparametric Estimator for Binary Response Models. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 387-421
Issue: 2
Volume: 61
Year: 1993
Month:  March 
Abstract:
  This paper proposes an estimator for discrete choice models that makes no
 assumption concerning the functional form of th e choice probability
 function where this function can be characterized by an index. The
 estimator is shown to be consistent, asymptotically normally distributed,
 and to achieve the semiparametric efficiency bound. Monte Carlo evidence
 indicates that there may be only modest efficiency losses relative to
 maximum likelihood estimation when the distribution of the disturbances is
 known and that the small-sample behavior of the estimator in other cases
 is good.   Copyright 1993 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Measuring the Implications of Sales and Consumer Inventory Behavior 
Abstract:
				 Temporary price reductions (sales) are
 common for many goods and naturally result in large increases in the
 quantity sold. Demand estimation based on temporary price reductions may
 mismeasure the long-run responsiveness to prices. In this paper we
 quantify the extent of the problem and assess its economic implications.
 We structurally estimate a dynamic model of consumer choice using two
 years of scanner data on the purchasing behavior of a panel of households.
 The results suggest that static demand estimates, which neglect dynamics,
 (i) overestimate own-price elasticities by 30 percent, (ii) underestimate
 cross-price elasticities by up to a factor of 5, and (iii) overestimate
 the substitution to the no-purchase or outside option by over 200 percent.
 This suggests that policy analysis based on static elasticity estimates
 will underestimate price-cost margins and underpredict the effects of
 mergers. Copyright The Econometric Society 2006.

Title:   Observing Violations of Transitivity by Experimental Methods. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 425-39
Issue: 2
Volume: 59
Year: 1991
Month:  March 
Abstract:
  The preference reversal phenomenon is usually interpreted as evidence of
 nontransitivity of preference, but has also been explained as the result
 of the difference between individuals' responses to choice and valuation
 problems; the devices used by experimenters to elicit valuations; and the
 "random lottery selection" incentive system. This paper reports an
 experiment designed so that none of these factors could generate
 systematic nontransitivities; yet systematic violations of transitivity
 were still found. The pattern of violation was analogous with that found
 in previous preference reversal experiments and is consistent with regret
 theory.   Copyright 1991 by The Econometric Society.

Title:   Epistemic Conditions for Nash Equilibrium. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 1161-80
Issue: 5
Volume: 63
Year: 1995
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  Sufficient conditions for Nash equilibrium in an 'n'-person game are
 given in terms of what the players know and believe - about the game, and
 about each other's rationality, actions, knowledge, and beliefs. Mixed
 strategies are treated not as conscious randomizations, but as
 conjectures, on the part of other players, as to what a player will do.
 Common knowledge plays a smaller role in characterizing Nash equilibrium
 than had been supposed. When 'n' = 2, mutual knowledge of the payoff
 functions, of rationality, and of the conjectures implies that the

 and there is a common prior, mutual knowledge of the payoff functions and
 of rationality, and common knowledge of the conjectures, imply that the

Title:  Virtual Bayesian Implementation
Abstract: Allowing for incomplete information, this paper characterizes the
	social choice functions that can be approximated by the equilibrium outcomes
	of a mechanism:  incentive compatibility is necessary and almost sufficient
	for virtual Bayesian implementability.  In conjunction with a second
	condition, Bayesian incentive consistency, incentive compatibility is also
	sufficient.  This new condition is weak--under standard topological and
	informational assumptions it is satisfied by every social choice function.
	The type sets of the agents are taken to be arbitrary (possibly infinite)
	measurable spaces. An example shows that there are virtually (in fact,
	exactly) Bayesian implementable social choice functions that are not
	virtually implementable in iteratively undominated strategies.

Title: Inductive Inference: An Axiomatic Approach 
Abstract:
 A predictor is asked to rank eventualities according to their
 plausibility, based on past cases. We assume that she can form a ranking
 given any memory that consists of finitely many past cases. Mild
 consistency requirements on these rankings imply that they have a
 numerical representation via a matrix assigning numbers to
 eventuality--case pairs, as follows. Given a memory, each eventuality is
 ranked according to the sum of the numbers in its row, over cases in
 memory. The number attached to an eventuality--case pair can be
 interpreted as the degree of support that the past case lends to the
 plausibility of the eventuality. Special instances of this result may be
 viewed as axiomatizing kernel methods for estimation of densities and for
 classification problems. Interpreting the same result for rankings of
 theories or hypotheses, rather than of specific eventualities, it is shown
 that one may ascribe to the predictor subjective conditional probabilities
 of cases given theories, such that her rankings of theories agree with
 rankings by the likelihood functions. Copyright The Econometric Society 2003.

Title: The Power of the Last Word in Legislative Policy Making 
Abstract:
				 We examine legislative policy making in
 institutions with two empirically relevant features: agenda setting occurs
 in real time and the default policy evolves. We demonstrate that these
 institutions select Condorcet winners when they exist, provided a
 sufficient number of individuals have opportunities to make proposals. In
 policy spaces with either pork barrel or pure redistributional politics
 (where a Condorcet winner does not exist), the last proposer is
 effectively a dictator or near-dictator under relatively weak conditions. Copyright The Econometric Society 2006.

Title:   Fast Equilibrium Selection by Rational Players Living in a Changing World. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 163-89
Issue: 1
Volume: 69
Year: 2001
Month:  January 
Abstract:
  We study a coordination game with randomly changing payoffs and small
 frictions in changing actions. Using only backwards induction, we find
 that players must coordinate on the risk-dominant equilibrium. More
 precisely, a continuum of fully rational players are randomly matched to
 play a symmetric 2 x 2 game. The payoff matrix changes according to a
 random walk. Players observe these payoffs and the population distribution
 of actions as they evolve. The game has frictions: opportunities to change
 strategies arrive from independent random processes, so that the players
 are locked into their actions for some time. As the frictions disappear,
 each player ignores what the others are doing and switches at her first
 opportunity to the risk-dominant action. History dependence emerges in
 some cases when frictions remain positive.

Title:   A Model of Growth through Creative Destruction. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 323-51
Issue: 2
Volume: 60
Year: 1992
Month:  March 
Abstract:
  A model of endogenous growth is developed in which growth is driven by
 vertical innovations that involve creative destruction. Equilibrium is
 determined by a forward-looking difference equation, according to which
 the amount of research in any period depends negatively upon the amount
 expected next period. The paper analyzes positive and normative properties
 of stationary equilibria, and shows conditions for the existence of
 cyclical equilibria and no-growth traps. The growth rate may be more or
 less than optimal because a business-stealing effect counteracts the usual
 spillover and appropriability effects. In addition, innovations tend to be
 too small.   Copyright 1992 by The Econometric Society.

Title:   Intertemporal Population Ethics: Critical-Level Utilitarian Principles. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 1303-20
Issue: 6
Volume: 63
Year: 1995
Month:  November 
Abstract:
  This paper considers the problem of social evaluation in a model where
 population size, individual lifetime utilities, lengths of life, and birth
 dates vary across states. In an intertemporal framework, the authors
 investigate principles for social evaluation that allow history to matter
 to some extent. Using an axiom called independence of the utilities of the
 dead, they provide a characterization of critical-level generalized
 utilitarian rules. As a by-product of their analysis, the authors show
 that social discounting is ruled out in an intertemporal welfarist
 environment. A simple population-planning example is also discussed.   Copyright 1995 by The Econometric Society.

Title: A Subjective Spin on Roulette Wheels 
Abstract:
				 We provide a simple behavioral definition
 of 'subjective mixture' of acts for a large class of (not necessarily
 expected-utility) preferences. Subjective mixtures enjoy the same
 algebraic properties as the 'objective mixtures' used to great advantage
 in the decision setting introduced by Anscombe and Aumann (1963). This
 makes it possible to formulate mixture-space axioms in a fully subjective
 setting. For illustration, we present simple subjective axiomatizations of
 some models of choice under uncertainty, including Bewley's model of
 choice with incomplete preferences (2002). Copyright The Econometric Society 2003.

Volume: 60
Year: 1992

Abstract:
  A principal has private information that directly affects her agent's
 payoff (i.e., "common values" obtains). The authors analyze their
 relationship as a three-stage game: (1) the principal proposes a contract;
 (2) the agent accepts or rejects; and (3) the contract is executed. They
 show that the equilibrium outcomes are the allocations that weakly Pareto
 dominate the allocation maximizing the payoff of each "type" of the
 principal within the class of incentive-compatible allocations ensuring
 the agent his reservation utility irrespective of his beliefs about the
 principal's type. The authors also characterize the equilibria that are
 immune to renegotiation.   Copyright 1992 by The Econometric Society.

Abstract:
  This paper extends the revelation principle to environments in which the
 mechanism designer cannot fully commit to the outcome induced by the
 mechanism. We show that he may optimally use a direct mechanism under
 which truthful revelation is an optimal strategy for the agent. In
 contrast with the conventional revelation principle, however, the agent
 may not use this strategy with probability one. Our results apply to
 contracting problems between a principal and a single agent. By reducing
 such problems to well-defined programming problems they provide a basic
 tool for studying imperfect commitment.

Issue: 6
Volume: 62
Year: 1994
Month:  November 
Abstract:
  This paper derives a general formula for the asymptotic variance of
 semiparametric estimators that accounts for the presence of nonparametric
 estimators of functions. The general formula is specialized to show
 invariance of the asymptotic variance to the type of nonparametric
 estimator and to obtain correction terms for estimation of densities and
 mean-square projections (including conditional expectations). Regularity
 conditions for the validity of the formula are also given, including
 primitive conditions for asymptotic normality when series estimators are
 present. New examples considered include a semiparametric panel probit
 estimator and a series estimator of the average derivative.   Copyright 1994 by The Econometric Society.

Title:   "Beliefs about Beliefs" without Probabilities. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 1343-73
Issue: 6
Volume: 64
Year: 1996
Month:  November 
Abstract:
  This paper constructs a space of states of the world representing the
 exhaustive uncertainty facing each player in a strategic situation. The
 innovation is that preferences are restricted primarily by 'regularity'
 conditions and need not conform with subjective expected utility theory.
 The construction employs a hierarchy of preferences, rather than of
 beliefs as in the standard Bayesian model. Applications include the
 provision of foundations for a Harsanyi-style game of incomplete
 information and a rich framework for the axiomatization of solution
 concepts for complete information normal form games.   Copyright 1996 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Uncovering the Distribution of Motorists' Preferences for Travel Time and Reliability 
Abstract:
				 We apply recent econometric advances to
 study the distribution of commuters' preferences for speedy and reliable
 highway travel. Our analysis applies mixed logit to combined revealed and
 stated preference data on commuter choices of whether to pay a toll for
 congestion-free express travel. We find that motorists exhibit high values
 of travel time and reliability, and substantial heterogeneity in those
 values. We suggest that road pricing policies designed to cater to such
 varying preferences can improve efficiency and reduce the disparity of
 welfare impacts compared with recent pricing experiments. Copyright The Econometric Society 2005.

Title: Games Played Through Agents 
Abstract:
				 We introduce a game of complete
 information with multiple principals and multiple common agents. Each
 agent makes a decision that can affect the payoffs of all principals. Each
 principal offers monetary transfers to each agent conditional on the
 action taken by the agent. We characterize pure-strategy equilibria and we
 provide conditions-in terms of game balancedness-for the existence of an
 equilibrium with an efficient outcome. Games played through agents display
 a type of strategic inefficiency that is absent when either there is a
 unique principal or there is a unique agent. Copyright The Econometric Society 2003.

Title:   On the Optimality of Central Places. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 1101-19
Issue: 5
Volume: 58
Year: 1990
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  A model of consumer multipurpose shopping is used for studying the
 optimality of central places. There are two different commodities sold by
 two different types of firms. The shopping frequencies are exogenously
 given and different for the two commodities. Consumers can group their
 purchases of the two commodities in order to reduce transport costs. It is
 shown that the socially optimal configuration of firms always involves the
 clustering of a firm type 2 (low purchase frequency) with a firm of type 1
 (high purchase frequency), assuming that the number of firms of type 2 is
 smaller than the number of firms of type 1.   Copyright 1990 by The Econometric Society.

Title:   Cognition and Behavior in Normal-Form Games: An Experimental Study. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 1193-1235
Issue: 5
Volume: 69
Year: 2001
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  This paper reports experiments designed to study strategic
 sophistication, the extent to which behavior in games reflects attempts to
 predict others' decisions, taking their incentives into account. We study
 subjects' initial responses to normal-form games with various patterns of
 iterated dominance and unique pure-strategy equilibria without dominance,
 using a computer interface that allowed them to search for hidden payoff
 information, while recording their searches. Monitoring subjects'
 information searches along with their decisions allows us to better
 understand how their decisions are determined, and subjects' deviations
 from the search patterns suggested by equilibrium analysis help to predict
 their deviations from equilibrium decisions.

Title: Bubbles and Crashes 
Abstract:
 We present a model in which an asset bubble can persist despite the
 presence of rational arbitrageurs. The resilience of the bubble stems from
 the inability of arbitrageurs to temporarily coordinate their selling
 strategies. This "synchronization problem" together with the individual
 incentive to "time the market" results in the persistence of bubbles over
 a substantial period. Since the derived trading equilibrium is unique, our
 model rationalizes the existence of bubbles in a strong sense. The model
 also provides a natural setting in which news events, by enabling
 synchronization, can have a disproportionate impact relative to their
 intrinsic informational content. Copyright The Econometric Society 2003.

Title:   A Test of the Efficiency of a Given Portfolio. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 1121-52
Issue: 5
Volume: 57
Year: 1989
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  A test for the ex ante efficiency of a given portfolio of assets is
 analyzed. The relevant statistic has a tractable small sample
 distribution. Its power function is derived and used to study the
 sensitivity of the test to the portfolio choice and to the number of
 assets used to determine the ex post mean-variance efficient frontier.
 Several intuitive interpretations of the test are provided, including a
 simple mean-standard deviation geometric explanation. A univariate test,
 equivalent to our multivariate-based method, is derived, and it suggests
 some useful diagnostic tools which may explain why the null hypothesis is
 rejected. Empirical examples suggest that the multivariate approach can
 lead to more appropriate conclusions than those based on traditional
 inference which relies on a set of dependent univariate statistics.   Copyright 1989 by The Econometric Society.

Title:   Bayesian Elicitation Diagnostics. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 919-42
Issue: 4
Volume: 60
Year: 1992
Month:  July 
Abstract:
  One elicitation diagnostic identifies a family of prior distributions
 that are so diffuse that they are practically equivalent to the
 "completely" diffuse prior. Another elicitation diagnostic identifies a
 family of prior distributions that concentrate enough mass in the
 neighborhood of zero that they are practically equivalent to the dogmatic
 prior that sets a parameter exactly equal to zero. If either question thus
 posed can be answered in the affirmative then there is no need to go to
 the expense of a more accurate elicitation of the prior distribution.	 Copyright 1992 by The Econometric Society.

Title:   On the Existence of Pure and Mixed Strategy Nash Equilibria in Discontinuous Games
Journal: Econometrica
Abstract:
  A game is better-reply secure if for every non equilibrium strategy x* and
  every payoff vector limit u* resulting from strategies approaching x*, some
  player i has a strategy yielding a payoff strictly above u[subscript i
  superscript *] even if the others deviate slightly from x*. If strategy
  spaces are compact and convex, payoffs are quasiconcave in the owner's
  strategy, and the game is better-reply secure, then a pure strategy Nash
  equilibrium exists. Better-reply security holds in many economic games. It
  also permits new results on the existence of symmetric and mixed strategy
  equilibria.

Title:   The Principal-Agent Relationship with an Informed Principal: The Case of Private Values. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 379-409
Issue: 2
Volume: 58
Year: 1990
Month:  March 
Abstract:
  The authors analyze the principal-agent relationship when the principal
 has private information as a three-stage game: contract proposal,
 acceptance/refusal, and contract execution. They assume that the
 information does not directly affect the agent's payoff (private values).
 Equilibrium exists and is generically locally unique. Moreover, it is
 Pareto optimal for the different types of principal. The principal
 generically does strictly better than when the agent knows her
 information. Equilibrium allocations are the Walrasian equilibria of an
 "economy" where the traders are different types of principal and
 "exchange" the slack on the agent's individual rationality and incentive
 compatibility constraints.   Copyright 1990 by The Econometric Society.

Title:   The Noah's Ark Problem
Abstract: This paper is about the economic theory of biodiversity preservation. A
	cost-effectiveness methodology is constructed, which results in a ranking
	criterion sufficiently operational to be useful in suggesting what to look at
	when determining actual conservation priorities.  The formula is firmly
	rooted in a mathematically rigorous optimization framework, so that its
	theoretical underpinnings are clear. The underlying model, called the 'Noah's
	Ark Problem,' is intended to be a kind of canonical form that hones down to
	its analytical essence the problem of best preserving diversity under a
	limited budget constraint.

Title: Frontiers of Stochastically Nondominated Portfolios 
Abstract:
				 We consider the problem of constructing a
 portfolio of finitely many assets whose returns are described by a
 discrete joint distribution.We propose mean-risk models that are solvable
 by linear programming and generate portfolios whose returns are
 nondominated in the sense of second-order stochastic dominance. Next, we
 develop a specialized parametric method for recovering the entire
 mean-risk efficient frontiers of these models and we illustrate its
 operation on a large data set involving thousands of assets and
 realizations. Copyright The Econometric Society 2003.

Title: Mobility and the Return to Education: Testing a Roy Model with Multiple Markets 
Abstract:
 Self-selected migration presents one potential explanation for why
 observed returns to a college education in local labor markets vary widely
 even though U.S. workers are highly mobile. To assess the impact of
 self-selection on estimated returns, this paper first develops a Roy model
 of mobility and earnings where workers choose in which of the 50 states
 (plus the District of Columbia) to live and work. Available estimation
 methods are either infeasible for a selection model with so many
 alternatives or place potentially severe restrictions on earnings and the
 selection process. This paper develops an alternative econometric
 methodology that combines Lee's (1983) parametric maximum order statistic
 approach to reduce the dimensionality of the error terms with more recent
 work on semiparametric estimation of selection models (e.g., Ahn and
 Powell (1993)). The resulting semiparametric correction is easy to
 implement and can be adapted to a variety of other polychotomous choice
 problems. The empirical work, which uses 1990 U.S. Census data, confirms
 the role of comparative advantage in mobility decisions. The results
 suggest that self-selection of higher educated individuals to states with
 higher returns to education generally leads to "upward" biases in OLS
 estimates of the returns to education in state-specific labor markets.
 While the estimated returns to a college education are significantly
 biased, correcting for the bias does not narrow the range of returns
 across states. Consistent with the finding that the corrected return to a
 college education differs across the U.S., the relative state-to-state
 migration flows of college- versus high school-educated individuals
 respond strongly to differences in the return to education and amenities
 across states. Copyright The Econometric Society 2002.

Title:  Collusion under Asymmetric Information
Abstract: When applied to groups, the revelation principle postulates a
	Bayesian-Nash behavior between agents.  Their binding agreements are
	unenforceable or the principal can prevent them at no cost. The authors
	analyze instead a mechanism design problem in which the agents can
	communicate between themselves and collude under asymmetric information. They
	characterize the set of implementable collusion-proof contracts both when the
	principal offers anonymous and nonanonymous contracts.  After having isolated
	the nexi and the stakes of collusion, the authors proceed to normative
	analysis, do some comparative statics, discuss their concept of
	collusion-proofness, and provide some insights about transaction costs in
	side-contracting.

Title: Efficiency with Endogenous Population Growth 
Abstract:
				 In this paper, we generalize the notion of
 Pareto efficiency to make it applicable to environments with endogenous
 populations. Two efficiency concepts are proposed: &Pscr;-efficiency and
 &Ascr;-efficiency. The two concepts differ in how they treat potential
 agents that are not born. We show that these concepts are closely related
 to the notion of Pareto efficiency when fertility is exogenous. We prove a
 version of the first welfare theorem for Barro-Becker type fertility
 choice models and discuss how this result can be generalized. Finally, we
 study examples of equilibrium settings in which fertility decisions are
 not efficient, and we classify them into settings where inefficiencies
 arise inside the family and settings where they arise across families. Copyright The Econometric Society 2007.

Abstract:
  A celebrated result of D.  Black (1948) demonstrates the existence of a
 simple-majority winner when preferences are single-peaked. This paper
 provides a multidimensional analog of Black's median voter result. The
 authors provide conditions under which the mean voter's most preferred
 outcome is unbeatable according to a 64 percent majority rule. The
 conditions supporting this result represent a significant generalization
 of A.	Caplin and B.  Nalebuff (1988). The shift from median voter to mean
 voter requires a new mathematical approach; the authors introduce to
 economics a mathematical aggregation theorem due to A. Pr$8Ekopa (1971)
 and C. Borell (1975).	 Copyright 1991 by The Econometric Society.

Month:  March 
Abstract:
  An adaptive learning rule is exhibited for the Azariadis (1981)
 overlapping generations model of a monetary economy with multiple
 equilibria, under which the economy may converge to a stationary sunspot
 equilibrium, even if agents do not initially believe that outcomes are
 significantly different in different "sunspot" states. The learning rule
 studied is of the "stochastic approximation" form studied by H. Robbins
 and S. Monro (1951); methods for analyzing the convergence of this form of
 algorithm are presented that may be of use in many other contexts as well.
 Conditions are given under which convergence to a sunspot equilibrium
 occurs with probability one.   Copyright 1990 by The Econometric Society.

Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 1125-49
Issue: 5
Volume: 64
Year: 1996
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  The authors consider a single consumer buying a stream of goods from
 different sellers over time. The true value of each seller's product is
 initially unknown. Additional information is obtained by experimentation.
 For exogenous prices, this is a multiarmed bandit problem. The innovation
 here is to endogenize the cost of experimentation by allowing for price
 competition between the sellers. Prices determine the intertemporal costs
 and benefits of learning for buyer and sellers. All Markov perfect
 equilibria are efficient. Prices below marginal cost sustain
 experimentation. Intertemporal exchange of the gains of learning is
 necessary to support efficient experimentation.   Copyright 1996 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Estimating Dynamic Models of Imperfect Competition 
Abstract:
				 We describe a two-step algorithm for
 estimating dynamic games under the assumption that behavior is consistent
 with Markov perfect equilibrium. In the first step, the policy functions
 and the law of motion for the state variables are estimated. In the second
 step, the remaining structural parameters are estimated using the
 optimality conditions for equilibrium. The second step estimator is a
 simple simulated minimum distance estimator. The algorithm applies to a
 broad class of models, including industry competition models with both
 discrete and continuous controls such as the Ericson and Pakes (1995)
 model. We test the algorithm on a class of dynamic discrete choice models
 with normally distributed errors and a class of dynamic oligopoly models
 similar to that of Pakes and McGuire (1994). Copyright The Econometric Society 2007.

Title: International Business Cycles with Endogenous Incomplete Markets 
Abstract:
 Backus, Kehoe, and Kydland (1992), Baxter and Crucini (1995), and Stockman
 and Tesar (1995) find two major discrepancies between standard
 international business cycle models with complete markets and the data: In
 the models, cross-country correlations are much higher for consumption
 than for output, while in the data the opposite is true; and cross-country
 correlations of employment and investment are negative, while in the data
 they are positive. This paper introduces a friction into a standard model
 that helps resolve these anomalies. The friction is that international
 loans are imperfectly enforceable; any country can renege on its debts and
 suffer the consequences for future borrowing. To solve for equilibrium in
 this economy with endogenous incomplete markets, the methods of Marcet and
 Marimon (1999) are extended. Incorporating the friction helps resolve the
 anomalies more than does exogenously restricting the assets that can be
 traded. Copyright The Econometric Society 2002.

Title:  Duopoly Strategies Programmed by Experienced Players 
Abstract: This paper reports a strategy study on a twenty-period supergame of a
	numerically specified asymmetric Cournot duopoly. The subjects were
	twenty-three participants of a student seminar. Three rounds of game playing
	were followed by three rounds of strategy programming with computer
	tournaments. The final strategies show a typical approach to the strategic
	problem: subjects first select an 'ideal point,' a cooperative goal based on
	fairness criteria, and then design a 'measure for measure policy' that
	reciprocates movements to the ideal point or away from it; no quantitative
	expectations are formed and nothing is optimized. Typicalness is positively
	correlated with success.

Month:  July 
Abstract:
  Social experiments are characterized by their high cost. A tempting
 alternative to the establishment of a contemporaneous statistical control
 group is preexempt observat ion of the treatment group. In this paper, the
 authors analyze the tr ade-off between these two types of "con-trol" as
 functions of their relative cost and information content in a multiperiod
 error compone nts framework, where the allocation of observations across
 the two gr oups is always done in an optimal manner. Solutions for the
 optimal p roportion of the sample to be devoted to the contemporaneous
 control group are presented and their behavior as a function of relevant
 para meters is studied.   Copyright 1988 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Confidence Intervals for Diffusion Index Forecasts and Inference for Factor-Augmented Regressions 
Abstract:
				 We consider the situation when there is a
 large number of series, N, each with T observations, and each series has
 some predictive ability for some variable of interest. A methodology of
 growing interest is first to estimate common factors from the panel of
 data by the method of principal components and then to augment an
 otherwise standard regression with the estimated factors. In this paper,
 we show that the least squares estimates obtained from these
 factor-augmented regressions are	root-T 	     
  consistent and asymptotically normal if			root(T)/N -> 0.		   
 The conditional mean predicted by the estimated factors is 
 min(root(T),root(N)) 
 consistent and asymptotically normal. Except when T/N goes to zero,
 inference should take into account the effect of "estimated regressors" on
 the estimated conditional mean. We present analytical formulas for
 prediction intervals that are valid regardless of the magnitude of N/T
 and that can also be used when the factors are nonstationary.		     Copyright The Econometric Society 2006.

Abstract:
  The authors show that the CUSUM test of the stability over time of the
 coefficients of a linear regression model, which is usually based on
 recursive residuals, can also be applied to ordinary least squares
 residuals. The authors derive the limiting null distribution of the
 resulting test and compare its local power to that of the standard
 procedure. It turns out that neither version is uniformly superior to the
 other.   Copyright 1992 by The Econometric Society.

Pages: 57-76
Issue: 1
Volume: 60
Year: 1992
Month:  January 
Abstract:
  Quotas are the predominant means of protection in developed countries,
 with quota rents commonly shared between exporter and importer. This paper
 derives shadow prices appropriate to evaluating trade reform under these
 circumstances and provides a number of useful sufficient conditions for
 welfare-improving "piecemeal" reform. In doing so, the authors apply the
 distorted (quantity-constrained) expenditure function and use implicit
 separability to derive more powerful results than have previously been
 available.   Copyright 1992 by The Econometric Society.

Title: The Organization of Supplier Networks: Effects of Delegation and Intermediation 
Abstract:
				 In a one-principal two-agent model with
 adverse selection and collusion among agents, we show that delegating to
 one agent the right to subcontract with the other agent always earns lower
 profit for the principal compared with centralized contracting. Delegation
 to an intermediary is also not in the principal's interest if the agents
 supply substitutes. It can be beneficial if the agents produce complements
 and the intermediary is well informed. Copyright The Econometric Society 2004.

Title: Instrumental Variable Treatment of Nonclassical Measurement Error Models 
Abstract:
				 While the literature on nonclassical
 measurement error traditionally relies on the availability of an auxiliary
 data set containing correctly measured observations, we establish that the
 availability of instruments enables the identification of a large class of
 nonclassical nonlinear errors-in-variables models with continuously
 distributed variables. Our main identifying assumption is that,
 conditional on the value of the true regressors, some "measure of
 location" of the distribution of the measurement error (e.g., its mean,
 mode, or median) is equal to zero. The proposed approach relies on the
 eigenvalue-eigenfunction decomposition of an integral operator associated
 with specific joint probability densities. The main identifying assumption
 is used to "index" the eigenfunctions so that the decomposition is unique.
 We propose a convenient sieve-based estimator, derive its asymptotic
 properties, and investigate its finite-sample behavior through Monte Carlo
 simulations. Copyright The Econometric Society 2008.

Abstract:
  The problem of time inconsistency arises from two different sources.
 First, as shown by Guillermo A. Calvo (1978), the re is an incentive for
 each government to engage in an initial unanti cipated inflation. Second,
 as discussed by Robert E. Lucas and Nancy L. Stokey (1983), there is an
 incentive for each government to deviat e from the path of taxes announced
 by the preceding government. In th is paper, it is shown that these two
 sources of time inconsistency ca n be removed by a particular method of
 debt management, involving bot h nominal and indexed government bonds of
 various maturities.   Copyright 1987 by The Econometric Society.

Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 1331-49
Issue: 6
Volume: 60
Year: 1992
Month:  November 
Abstract:
  The author considers fair division when monetary compensations are
 feasible and utilities are quasi-linear. Four axioms are discussed:
 individual rationality, resource monotonicity, population solidarity, and
 the stand alone test. The latter views the utility from consuming all the
 goods as an upper bound on every coalition's actual (joint) utility. Under
 efficiency, the four axioms show little compatibility. However, when the
 goods have enough substitutability in everyone's preferences, the Shapley
 value of the surplus sharing game satisfies all four axioms. An example is
 the optimal assignment of indivisible goods when every agent consumes only
 one good.   Copyright 1992 by The Econometric Society.

Abstract:
  This paper studies the class of denumerable-armed (i.e., finite- or

 geometric discounting over an infinite horizon in which each arm generates
 rewards according to one of a finite number of distributions. The authors
 derive certain continuity and curvature properties of the Gittins Index,
 and provide necessary and sufficient conditions under which this index
 characterizes the optimal strategies. They then show that at each point in
 time the arm selected by an optimal strategy will, with positive
 probability, remain an optimal selection forever.   Copyright 1992 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Belief-Free Equilibria in Repeated Games 
Abstract:
				 We introduce a class of strategies that
 generalizes examples constructed in two-player games under imperfect
 private monitoring. A sequential equilibrium is belief-free if, after
 every private history, each player's continuation strategy is optimal
 independently of his belief about his opponents' private histories. We
 provide a simple and sharp characterization of equilibrium payoffs using
 those strategies. While such strategies support a large set of payoffs,
 they are not rich enough to generate a folk theorem in most games besides
 the prisoner's dilemma, even when noise vanishes.			     Copyright The Econometric Society 2005.

Title: On the Nonparametric Identification of Nonlinear Simultaneous Equations Models: Comment on Brown (1983) and Roehrig (1988) 
Abstract:
				 This note revisits the identification
 theorems of Brown (1983) and Roehrig (1988). We describe an error in the
 proofs of the main identification theorems in these papers, and provide an
 important counterexample to the theorems on the identification of the
 reduced form. Specifically, the reduced form of a nonseparable
 simultaneous equations model is not identified even under the assumptions
 of these papers. We provide conditions under which the reduced form is
 identified and is recoverable using the distribution of the endogenous
 variables conditional on the exogenous variables. However, these
 conditions place substantial limitations on the structural model. We
 conclude the note with a conjecture that it may be possible to use
 classical exclusion restrictions to recover some of the key implications
 of the theorems in more general settings. Copyright The Econometric Society 2006.

Title:   Bubbles, Crashes, and Endogenous Expectations in Experimental Spot Asset Markets. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 1119-51
Issue: 5
Volume: 56
Year: 1988
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  Spot asset trading is studied where the only external source of value is
 an independent draw from a common information dividend distribution at the
 end of each of fifteen trading periods. Fourteen of twenty-two experiments
 exhibit price bubbles. This tendency to bubble decreases with trader
 experience. The regression of changes in mean price on lagged excess bids
 (bids minus offers in the previous period) supports the hypothesis that
 the intercept is minus the one-period expected dividend value, and the
 slope is positive, where excess bids measures excess demand attributable
 to homegrown capital gains expectations.   Copyright 1988 by The Econometric Society.

Title:   Estimation When a Parameter Is on a Boundary
Journal: Econometrica
Abstract:
  This paper establishes the asymptotic distribution of extremum estimators
  when the true parameter lies on the boundary of the parameter space. The
  boundary may be linear, curved, and/or kinked.  Typically the asymptotic
  distribution is a function of a multivariate normal distribution in models
  without stochastic trends and a function of a multivariate Brownian motion in
  models with stochastic trends. The results apply to a wide variety of
  estimators and models. Examples treated in the paper are: (1) quasi-ML
  estimation of a random coefficients regression model with some coefficient
  variances equal to zero and (2) LS estimation of an augmented Dickey-Fuller
  regression with unit root and time trend parameters on the boundary of the
  parameter space.

Title: Limited Rationality and Strategic Interaction: The Impact of the Strategic Environment on Nominal Inertia 
Abstract:
				     Much evidence suggests that people are
 heterogeneous with regard to their abilities to make rational,
 forward-looking decisions. This raises the question as to when the
 rational types are decisive for aggregate outcomes and when the boundedly
 rational types shape aggregate results. We examine this question in the
 context of a long-standing and important economic problem: the adjustment
 of nominal prices after an anticipated monetary shock. Our experiments
 suggest that two types of bounded rationality-money illusion and
 anchoring-are important behavioral forces behind nominal inertia. However,
 depending on the strategic environment, bounded rationality has vastly
 different effects on aggregate price adjustment. If agents' actions are
 strategic substitutes, adjustment to the new equilibrium is extremely
 quick, whereas under strategic complementarity, adjustment is both very
 slow and associated with relatively large real effects. This adjustment
 difference is driven by price expectations, which are very flexible and
 forward-looking under substitutability but adaptive and sticky under
 complementarity. Moreover, subjects' expectations are also considerably
 more rational under substitutability.	   Copyright The Econometric Society 2008.

Title: Subjective Beliefs and ex ante Trade 
Abstract:
				 We study a definition of subjective
 beliefs applicable to preferences that allow for the perception of
 ambiguity, and provide a characterization of such beliefs in terms of
 market behavior. Using this definition, we derive necessary and sufficient
 conditions for the efficiency of ex ante trade and show that these
 conditions follow from the fundamental welfare theorems. When aggregate
 uncertainty is absent, our results show that full insurance is efficient
 if and only if agents share some common subjective beliefs. Our results
 hold for a general class of convex preferences, which contains many
 functional forms used in applications involving ambiguity and ambiguity
 aversion. We show how our results can be articulated in the language of
 these functional forms, confirming results existing in the literature,
 generating new results, and providing a useful tool for applications. Copyright  2008 The Econometric Society.

Title:   An Econometric Analysis of Fluctuations in Aggregate Labor Supply and Demand. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 317-33
Issue: 2
Volume: 56
Year: 1988
Month:  March 
Abstract:
  This paper contains an equilibrium model of the labor market. The supply
 function allows f or temporal substitution in response to wage
 fluctuations, and the de mand function allows for adjustment costs. Two
 related issues are emp hasized: identification of supply and demand
 functions, and sources o f serial correlation in employment and real
 wages. When the supply an d demand shocks are AR(1) processes, the
 equilibrium process for empl oyment and real wages is a restricted VAR(2).
 The supply and demand f unctions are (locally) identified using only
 employment and real wage data. An illustrative application is presented,
 using U.S. data for 1948-71.   Copyright 1988 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Existence and Uniqueness of Solutions to the Bellman Equation in the Unbounded Case 
Abstract:
				 We study the problem of the existence and
 uniqueness of solutions to the Bellman equation in the presence of
 unbounded returns. We introduce a new approach based both on consideration
 of a metric on the space of all continuous functions over the state space,
 and on the application of some metric fixed point theorems. With
 appropriate conditions we prove uniqueness of solutions with respect to
 the whole space of continuous functions. Furthermore, the paper provides
 new sufficient conditions for the existence of solutions that can be
 applied to fairly general models. It is also proven that the fixed point
 coincides with the value function and that it can be approached by
 successive iterations of the Bellman operator. Copyright The Econometric Society 2003.

Title: Computing Normal Form Perfect Equilibria for Extensive Two-Person Games 
Abstract:
 This paper presents an algorithm for computing an equilibrium of an
 extensive two-person game with perfect recall. The method is
 computationally efficient by virtue of using the sequence form, whose size
 is proportional to the size of the game tree. The equilibrium is traced on
 a piecewise linear path in the sequence form strategy space from an
 arbitrary starting vector. If the starting vector represents a pair of
 completely mixed strategies, then the equilibrium is normal form perfect.
 Computational experiments compare the sequence form and the reduced normal
 form, and show that only the sequence form is tractable for larger games. Copyright The Econometric Society 2002.

Abstract:
  In a repeated partnership game with imperfect monitoring, the authors

 shortening the period over which actions are held fixed, and (3)
 shortening the lag with which accumulated information is reported. All
 three changes are equivalent in games with perfect monitoring. With
 imperfect monitoring, reducing the interest rate always increases the
 possibilities for cooperation, but the other two changes always have the
 reverse effect when the interest rate is small.   Copyright 1991 by The Econometric Society.

Title:  How Social Security and Medicare Affect Retirement Behavior in a World of Incomplete Markets
Abstract: This paper provides an empirical analysis of how the U.S. Social
	Security and Medicare system affects the labor supply of older males in the
	presence of incomplete markets. The authors estimate a dynamic programming
	model of the joint labor supply and Social Security acceptance decision. The
	model is able to account for a wide variety of phenomena observed in the
	data, including the pronounced peaks in the distribution of retirement ages
	at sixty-two and sixty-five. Overall, the authors' model suggests that
	several puzzling aspects of retirement behavior can be viewed as artifacts of
	particular details of the Social Security rules.

Journal: Econometrica

Issue: 2
Volume: 59
Year: 1991
Month:  March 
Abstract:
  Properties of maximum likelihood estimates of cointegrated systems are
 studied. Alternative formulations are considered, including a new
 triangular system error correction mechanism. We demonstrate that full
 system maximum likelihood brings the problem of inference within the
 family covered by the locally asymptotically mixed normal asymptotic
 theory, provided all unit roots have been eliminated by specification and
 data transformation. Methodological issues provide a major focus of the
 paper. Our results favor use of full system estimation in error correction
 mechanisms or subsystem methods that are asymptotically equivalent. They
 also point to disadvantages in the use of unrestricted VAR's formulated in
 levels and of certain single equation approaches to estimation of error
 correction mechanisms.   Copyright 1991 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Likelihood Estimation and Inference in a Class of Nonregular Econometric Models 
Abstract:
				 We study inference in structural models
 with a jump in the conditional density, where location and size of the
 jump are described by regression curves. Two prominent examples are
 auction models, where the bid density jumps from zero to a positive value
 at the lowest cost, and equilibrium job-search models, where the wage
 density jumps from one positive level to another at the reservation wage.
 General inference in such models remained a long-standing, unresolved
 problem, primarily due to nonregularities and computational difficulties
 caused by discontinuous likelihood functions. Copyright The Econometric Society 2004.

Title: Anchoring Economic Predictions in Common Knowledge 
Abstract:
 The paper examines within a unified methodology expectational coordination
 in a series of economic models. The methodology views the predictions
 associated with the Rational Expectations Hypothesis as reasonable
 whenever they can be derived from the more basic Common Knowledge
 Hypothesis. The paper successively considers a simple non-noisy 
 "N"-dimensional model, standard models with "intrinsic" uncertainty, and
 reference intertemporal models with infinite horizon. It reviews existing
 results and suggests new ones. It translates the formal results into
 looser but economically intuitive statements, whose robustness, in the
 present state of knowledge, is tentatively ascertained. Copyright The Econometric Society 2002.

Month:  May 
Abstract:
  An alternating-offers bargaining model in which a normal-form game
 determines players' payoffs in disagreement periods can have multiple
 perfect equilibria, provided that players are sufficiently patient. Even
 though there is perfect information, delay can arise and the length of
 delay depends only on the payoff structure of the disagreement game and
 not on the discount factor. On the other hand, not all feasible and
 individually rational payoffs of the disagreement game can be supported as
 average payoffs in equilibrium and some negotiation games have a unique
 perfect equilibrium with immediate agreement.	 Copyright 1995 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Robust Priors in Nonlinear Panel Data Models 
Abstract:
				 Many approaches to estimation of panel
 models are based on an average or integrated likelihood that assigns
 weights to different values of the individual effects. Fixed effects,
 random effects, and Bayesian approaches all fall into this category. We
 provide a characterization of the class of weights (or priors) that
 produce estimators that are first-order unbiased. We show that such
 bias-reducing weights will depend on the data in general unless an
 orthogonal reparameterization or an essentially equivalent condition is
 available. Two intuitively appealing weighting schemes are discussed. We
 argue that asymptotically valid confidence intervals can be read from the
 posterior distribution of the common parameters when N and T grow at the
 same rate. Next, we show that random effects estimators are not bias
 reducing in general and we discuss important exceptions. Moreover, the
 bias depends on the Kullback-Leibler distance between the population
 distribution of the effects and its best approximation in the random
 effects family. Finally, we show that, in general, standard random effects
 estimation of marginal effects is inconsistent for large T, whereas the
 posterior mean of the marginal effect is large-T consistent, and we
 provide conditions for bias reduction. Some examples and Monte Carlo
 experiments illustrate the results.				       Copyright  2009 The Econometric Society.

 to influence the outcome by entering or exiting the election.

Title: The Comparative Statics of Constrained Optimization Problems 
Abstract:
				 This paper develops and applies some new
 results in the theory of monotone comparative statics. Let f be a
 real-valued function defined on R-super-l and consider the problem of
 maximizing f(x) when x is constrained to lie in some subset C of
 R-super-l. We develop a natural way to order the constraint sets C and
 find the corresponding restrictions on the objective function f that
 guarantee that optimal solutions increase with the constraint set. We
 apply our techniques to problems in consumer, producer, and portfolio
 theory. We also use them to generalize Rybcsynski's theorem and the
 LeChatelier principle. 			    Copyright The Econometric Society 2007.

Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 1341-54
Issue: 6
Volume: 61
Year: 1993
Month:  November 
Abstract:
  This paper considers economies involving one public good, one private
 good, and convex technology and proposes an informationally decentralized
 dynamic nontatonnement procedure that converges in general from the
 initial endowments to an allocation in the core. The procedure may be seen
 as enunciating a plausible method of cooperation among the agents for
 achieving an optimal provision of a public good and an equitable sharing
 of its cost. The viewpoint of noncooperative game theory is also
 considered and it is shown that there exists a trade-off between the
 requirements of local incentive compatibility and equitable cost sharing.   Copyright 1993 by The Econometric Society.

Volume: 69

Month:  March 
Abstract:
  Consider nonempty finite pure strategy sets S[subscript 1], . . . ,
 S[subscript n], let S = S[subscript 1] times . . . times S[subscript n],
 let Omega be a finite space of "outcomes," let Delta(Omega) be the set of
 probability distributions on Omega, and let theta: S approaches
 Delta(Omega) be a function. We study the conjecture that for any utility
 in a generic set of n-tuples of utilities on Omega there are finitely many
 distributions on Omega induced by the Nash equilibria of the game given by
 the induced utilities on S. We give a counterexample refuting the
 conjecture for n >= 3. Several special cases of the conjecture follow from
 well-known theorems, and we provide some generalizations of these results.

Issue: 5
Volume: 57
Year: 1989

Abstract:
  The extent to which specification error can explain rejection of the
 intertemporal capital asset pricing model is investigated using
 seminonparametric representations of the law of motion and utility. The
 authors find (1) consumption growth and asset returns display conditional
 heterogeneity, but this does not account for rejection of models assuming
 additively separable, constant relative risk aversion utility; (2) the
 model is accepted upon relaxation of the utility function in the direction
 of nonseparable utility; and (3) relaxation reduces overprediction of the
 conditional variance of consumption growth, overprediction of the
 conditional covariance of asset returns with consumption growth, and the
 equity premium.   Copyright 1989 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Behavioral Identification in Coalitional Bargaining: An Experimental Analysis of Demand Bargaining and Alternating Offers 
Abstract:
				 Alternating-offer and demand bargaining
 models of legislative bargaining make very different predictions in terms
 of both ex ante and ex post distribution of payoffs, as well as in the
 role of the order of play. The experiment shows that actual bargaining
 behavior is not as sensitive to the different bargaining rules as the
 theoretical point predictions, whereas the comparative statics are in line
 with both models. We compare our results to studies that attempt to
 distinguish between these two approaches using field data, finding strong
 similarities between the laboratory and field data regardless of the
 underlying bargaining process. Copyright The Econometric Society 2005.

Abstract:
  This paper derives several properties unique to nonlinear model
 hypothesis testing problems involving linear or nonlinear inequality
 constraints in the null or alternative hypothesis. The paper is organized
 around a lemma that characterizes the set containing the least favorable
 parameter value for a nonlinear model inequality constraints hypothesis
 test. The author then presents two examples that illustrate several
 implications of this lemma. He also discusses the impact of these
 properties on the empirical implementation and interpretation of these
 test procedures.   Copyright 1991 by The Econometric Society.

Title:   Monopoly Provision of Quality and Warranties: An Exploration in the Theory of Multidimensional Screening. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 441-67
Issue: 2
Volume: 55
Year: 1987
Month:  March 
Abstract:
  New ways of handling incentive constraints between nonadjacent types of
 buyer are used to solve a monopoly screening problem. The monopoly wishes
 to price discriminate by designing a product line of goods distinguished
 by different quality, warranty, and price attributes. The
 multidimensionality of the line causes the local approach usually taken to
 fail. The optimal product line is nevertheless fully characterized.
 Contrary to the result always obtained in simple models, attributes need
 not be monotone in buyer type, e.g., more eager types sometimes receive
 lower quality.   Copyright 1987 by The Econometric Society.

Abstract:
  An experimental test of some qualitative predictions of the Kreps-Wilson
 (1982) model of reputation building is conducted in a version of a
 borrower-lender game first used experimentally by Colin Camerer and Keith
 Weigelt (1988). A systematic response to changes in the payoff function of
 borrowers is observed. However, the response is opposite to the direction
 predicted by the theory. Furthermore, the observed behavior cannot be
 reconciled with the theory by an appeal to "homemade" priors of the type
 specified by Camerer and Weigelt.   Copyright 1992 by The Econometric Society.

Title:   Bootstrap Methods for Median Regression Models
Abstract: The least-absolute-deviations (LAD) estimator for a median-regression
	or censored median-regression model does not satisfy the standard conditions
	for obtaining asymptotic refinements through use of the bootstrap because the
	LAD objective function is not smooth.  This paper overcomes this problem by
	smoothing the objective function.  The smoothed estimator is asymptotically
	equivalent to the ordinary LAD estimator. With bootstrap critical values, the
	rejection probabilities of symmetrical t and chi-square tests based on the
	smoothed estimator are correct to nearly order 1/n under the null hypothesis.
	In contrast, first-order asymptotic approximations make errors of this size.

Title:   Preference for Flexibility in a Savage Framework
Abstract: The authors study preferences over Savage acts that map states to opportunity
  sets and satisfy the Savage axioms.  Preferences over opportunity sets may
  exhibit a preference for flexibility due to an implicit uncertainty about
  future preferences reflecting anticipated unforeseen contingencies. The main
  result of the paper characterizes maximization of the expected indirect
  utility in terms of an 'indirect stochastic dominance' axiom that expresses a
  preference for 'more opportunities in expectation.' The key technical tool of
  the paper, conjugate Mobius inversion, allows an alternative representation
  using Choquet integration and yields a simple proof of D. Kreps's (1979)
  classic result.

Title:   Direct and Indirect Sale of Information. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 901-28
Issue: 4
Volume: 58
Year: 1990
Month:  July 
Abstract:
  The authors compare two methods for a monopolist to sell information to
 traders in a financial market. In a direct sale, information buyers
 observe versions of the seller's signal while in an indirect sale the
 seller sells shares in a portfolio based on his private information. It is
 shown that, when traders are identical and pricing is linear, there is a
 trade-off between optimal surplus extraction that is possible under direct
 sale and more effective control of the usage of information that is
 possible under indirect sale. The optimal selling method depends on how
 much information is revealed by equilibrium prices.   Copyright 1990 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Convergence Properties of the Likelihood of Computed Dynamic Models 
Abstract:
				 This paper studies the econometrics of
 computed dynamic models. Since these models generally lack a closed-form
 solution, their policy functions are approximated by numerical methods.
 Hence, the researcher can only evaluate an approximated likelihood
 associated with the approximated policy function rather than the exact
 likelihood implied by the exact policy function. What are the consequences
 for inference of the use of approximated likelihoods&quest; First, we find
 conditions under which, as the approximated policy function converges to
 the exact policy, the approximated likelihood also converges to the exact
 likelihood. Second, we show that second order approximation errors in the
 policy function, which almost always are ignored by researchers, have
 first order effects on the likelihood function. Third, we discuss
 convergence of Bayesian and classical estimates. Finally, we propose to
 use a likelihood ratio test as a diagnostic device for problems derived
 from the use of approximated likelihoods. Copyright The Econometric Society 2006.

Title:   Exact Tests and Confidence Sets in Linear Regressions with Autocorrelated Errors. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 475-94
Issue: 2
Volume: 58
Year: 1990
Month:  March 
Abstract:
  This article proposes a general method to build exact tests and
 confidence sets in linear regressions with first-order autoregressive
 Gaussian disturbances. Because of a nuisance parameter problem, we argue
 that generalized bounds tests and conservative confidence sets provide
 natural inference procedures in such a context. Given an exact confidence
 set for the autocorrelation coefficient, we describe how to obtain a
 similar simultaneous confidence set for the autocorrelation coefficient
 and any subvector of regression coefficient. Conservative confidence sets
 for the regression coefficients are then deduced by a projection method.
 For any hypothesis that specifies jointly the value of the autocorrelation
 coefficient and any set of linear restrictions on the regression
 coefficients, we get exact similar tests. For tesing linear hypotheses
 about the regression coefficients only, we suggest bounds-type procedures.
 Exact confidence sets for the autocorrelation coefficient are built by
 "inverting" autocorrelation tests. The method is illustrated with two
 examples.   Copyright 1990 by The Econometric Society.

Title:   Public and Private Information: An Experimental Study of Information Pooling. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 1321-39
Issue: 6
Volume: 58
Year: 1990
Month:  November 
Abstract:
  This paper reports on an experimental study of the way in which
 individuals make inferences from publicly available information. We
 compare the predictions of a theoretical model of a common knowledge
 inference process with actual behavior. In the theoretical model, "perfect
 Bayesians," starting with private information, take actions; an aggregate
 statistic is made publicly available; the individuals do optimal Bayesian
 updating and take new actions; and the process continues until there is a
 common knowledge equilibrium with complete information pooling. We find
 that the theoretical model roughly predicts the observed behavior, but the
 actual inference process is clearly less efficient that the standard of
 the theoretical model, and while there is some pooling, it is incomplete.   Copyright 1990 by The Econometric Society.

Title:   Unemployment Insurance and Unemployment Spells. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 757-82
Issue: 4
Volume: 58
Year: 1990
Month:  July 
Abstract:
  This paper tests the effects of the level and length of unemployment
 insurance benefits on unemployment durations. The paper particularly
 studies individual behavior during the weeks just prior to when benefits
 lapse. Higher unemployment insurance benefits are found to have a strong
 negative effect on the probability of leaving unemployment. However, the
 probability of leaving unemployment rises dramatically just prior to when
 benefits lapse. Individual data are used with accurate information of
 spell durations, and the level and length of benefits. The semiparametric
 estimation techniques used in the paper yield more plausible estimates
 than conventional approaches and provide useful diagnostics.   Copyright 1990 by The Econometric Society.

Title:  Truncation Strategies in Matching Markets--In Search of Advice for Participants
Abstract: The authors consider the strategic options facing workers in labor markets
  with centralized market clearing mechanisms, such as those in the entry-level
  labor markets of a number of professions. If workers do not have detailed
  information about the preferences of other workers and firms, the scope of
  potentially profitable strategic behavior is considerably reduced, although
  not entirely eliminated. Specifically, the authors demonstrate that stating
  preferences that reverse the true preference order of two acceptable firms is
  not beneficial in a low information environment, but submitting a truncation
  of the true preferences may be. This gives some insight into the successful
  operation of these market mechanisms.

Year: 1990
Month:  November 
Abstract:
  A scheme of plain conversation is constructed, which is a universal
 mechanism for all noncooperative games with incomplete information with at
 least four players, in the following sense: every solution that can be
 achieved by means of an arbitrary communication mechanism is a correlated
 equilibrium payoff of the game extended by the scheme of plain
 conversation. By a property of the correlated equilibrium, a similar
 result holds also with the Nash equilibrium solution concept. The
 universal mechanism can be used without any loss of efficiency.   Copyright 1990 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Marginal Contributions and Externalities in the Value 
Abstract:
				 Our concern is the extension of the theory
 of the Shapley value to problems involving externalities. Using the
 standard axiom systems behind the Shapley value leads to the
 identification of bounds on players' payoffs around an "externality-free"
 value. The approach determines the direction and maximum size of
 Pigouvian-like transfers among players, transfers based on the specific
 nature of externalities that are compatible with basic normative
 principles. Examples are provided to illustrate the approach and to draw
 comparisons with previous literature. Copyright  2008 The Econometric Society.

Title: Efficient Semiparametric Estimation via Moment Restrictions 
Abstract:
				 Conditional moment restrictions can be
 combined through GMM estimation to construct more efficient semiparametric
 estimators. This paper is about attainable efficiency for such estimators.
 We define and use a moment tangent set, the directions of departure from
 the truth allowed by the moments, to characterize when the semiparametric
 efficiency bound can be attained. The efficiency condition is that the
 moment tangent set equals the model tangent set. We apply these results to
 transformed, censored, and truncated regression models, e.g., finding that
 the conditional moment restrictions from Powell's (1986) censored
 regression quantile estimators can be combined to approximate efficiency
 when the disturbance is independent of regressors. Copyright The Econometric Society 2004.

Title: Income Variance Dynamics and Heterogeneity 
Abstract:
				 Recent theoretical work has shown the
 importance of measuring microeconomic uncertainty for models of both
 general and partial equilibrium under imperfect insurance. In this paper
 the assumption of i.i.d. income innovations used in previous empirical
 studies is removed and the focus of the analysis is placed on models for
 the conditional variance of income shocks, which is related to the measure
 of risk emphasized by the theory. We first discriminate amongst various
 models of earnings determination that separate income shocks into
 idiosyncratic transitory and permanent components. We allow for education-
 and time-specific differences in the stochastic process for earnings and
 for measurement error. The conditional variance of the income shocks is
 modelled as a parsimonious ARCH process with both observable and
 unobserved heterogeneity. The empirical analysis is conducted on data
 drawn from the 1967-1992 Panel Study of Income Dynamics. We find strong
 evidence of sizeable ARCH effects as well as evidence of unobserved
 heterogeneity in the variances. Copyright Econometric Society 2004.

Pages: 265-79
Issue: 2
Volume: 63
Year: 1995
Month:  March 
Abstract:
  A definition of extended memory is provided, generalizing the ideas of
 long memory and persistence, based on the properties of forecasts over
 long horizons. Specification of nonlinear models with variables having
 extended memory is considered in terms of the balance of an equation and
 it is suggested that many more types of misspecification can occur than
 with usual situations and could produce important specification errors.
 Tests of linearity and standard methods of nonlinear modeling are briefly
 considered and advice is given on circumstances in which they can be used.    Copyright 1995 by The Econometric Society.

Month:  January 
Abstract:
  This paper is concerned with a problem of implementation of a given
 social choice correspondence. The authors introduces an essential
 monotonicity condition and show that any implementable social choice
 correspondence satisfies this condition. Conversely, in a case of three or
 more participants, any essentially monotone social choice correspondence
 is implementable. In a case of two participants, the essential
 monotonicity condition must be completed by a requirement that the social
 choice correspondence is close to an individually rational correspondence.    Copyright 1992 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Equilibrium Wage-Tenure Contracts 
Abstract:
				 In this study we consider a labor market
 matching model where firms post wage-tenure contracts and workers, both
 employed and unemployed, search for new job opportunities. Given workers
 are risk averse, we establish there is a unique equilibrium in the
 environment considered. Although firms in the market make different offers
 in equilibrium, all post a wage-tenure contract that implies a worker's
 wage increases smoothly with tenure at the firm. As firms make different
 offers, there is job turnover, as employed workers move jobs as the
 opportunity arises. This implies the increase in a worker's wage can be
 due to job-to-job movements as well as wage-tenure effects. Further, there
 is a nondegenerate equilibrium distribution of initial wage offers that is
 differentiable on its support except for a mass point at the lowest
 initial wage. We also show that relevant characteristics of the
 equilibrium can be written as explicit functions of preferences and the
 other market parameters. Copyright The Econometric Society 2003.

Title:   An Efficient Method of Moments Estimator for Discrete Choice Models with Choice-Based Sampling. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 1187-214
Issue: 5
Volume: 60
Year: 1992
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  In this paper, a new estimator is proposed for discrete choice models
 with choice-based sampling. The estimator is efficient and can incorporate
 information on the marginal choice probabilities in a straightforward
 manner and for that case leads to a procedure that is computationally and
 intuitively more appealing than the estimators that have been proposed
 before. The idea is to start with a flexible parametrization of the
 distribution of the explanatory variables and then rewrite the estimator
 to remove dependence on these parametric assumptions.	 Copyright 1992 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Expedient and Monotone Learning Rules 
Abstract:
				 This paper considers learning rules for
 environments in which little prior and feedback information is available
 to the decision maker. Two properties of such learning rules are studied:
 absolute expediency and monotonicity. Both require that some aspect of the
 decision maker's performance improves from the current period to the next.
 The paper provides some necessary, and some sufficient conditions for
 these properties. It turns out that there is a large variety of learning
 rules that have the properties. However, all learning rules that have
 these properties are related to the replicator dynamics of evolutionary
 game theory. For the case in which there are only two actions, it is shown
 that one of the absolutely expedient learning rules dominates all others. Copyright The Econometric Society 2004.

Title:   Context-Dependent Choice with Nonlinear and Nontransitive Preferences. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 1221-39
Issue: 5
Volume: 56
Year: 1988
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  This paper explores implications for one-stage and two-stage decision
 processes of a theory of choice tha t accommodates nontransitive
 preferences. It focuses on probabilistic convexification of finite base
 sets and on choice from convex sets. The one-stage formulation always has
 a maximally-preferred element in the convex set. Two-stage processes allow
 not only a holistic procedure for the entire problem, but also give rise
 to naive and sophisticated sequential procedures. All three have
 unambiguous solutions, but they can be radically different under
 intransitivities. The thre e two-stage solutions coincide when preferences
 are transitive.   Copyright 1988 by The Econometric Society.

Title:   The Structure of Nash Equilibrium in Repeated Games with Finite Automata. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 1259-81
Issue: 6
Volume: 56
Year: 1988
Month:  November 
Abstract:
  The authors study the Nash equilibria of a two-person,
 infinitely-repeated game in which players' preferences depend on repeated
 game payoffs and the complexity of the strategies they use. The model
 considered is that of A. Rubinstein (1986). Necessary conditions on the
 structure of the equilibria are derived. These results place significant
 restrictions on equilibrium payoffs. The results suggest that the
 introduction of implementation costs results in a striking discontinuity
 in the Nash equilibrium sets in terms of strategies and payoffs.   Copyright 1988 by The Econometric Society.

Title:   Experimental Tests of a Sequential Equilibrium Reputation Model. 
Journal: Econometrica

Volume: 56
Year: 1988
Month:  January 
Abstract:
  The authors find that subjects' behavior in an incomplete-information,
 repeated-game experiment is roughly a sequent ial equilibrium. The
 deviations from sequential equilibrium can be ex plained by the existence
 of a "homemade prior" probability (about 1 7 percent) that players will
 cooperate even when they should not. The authors conclude that equilibrium
 concepts which are more complicate d than Nash (such as sequential) can
 describe individual behavior wel l enough that theories using such
 equilibrium concepts are plausible.   Copyright 1988 by The Econometric Society.

Title:   A New Form of the Information Matrix Test. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 145-57
Issue: 1
Volume: 60
Year: 1992
Month:  January 
Abstract:
  A new form of the information matrix test is developed for a wide variety
 of statistical models. The test is constructed against an explicit
 alternative with random parameter variation. It is computed using a
 double-length artificial regression instead of the more conventional
 outer-product-of-the-gradient regression, which is known to have very poor
 finite-sample properties. In Monte Carlo experiments for the case of
 univariate linear regression models, the new form performs remarkably
 well. Some approximate finite-sample distributions are also calculated for
 this case and lend support to the use of the new form.   Copyright 1992 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Common Learning 
Abstract:
				 Consider two agents who learn the value of
 an unknown parameter by observing a sequence of private signals. The
 signals are independent and identically distributed across time but not
 necessarily across agents. We show that when each agent's signal space is
 finite, the agents will commonly learn the value of the parameter, that
 is, that the true value of the parameter will become approximate common
 knowledge. The essential step in this argument is to express the
 expectation of one agent's signals, conditional on those of the other
 agent, in terms of a Markov chain. This allows us to invoke a contraction
 mapping principle ensuring that if one agent's signals are close to those
 expected under a particular value of the parameter, then that agent
 expects the other agent's signals to be even closer to those expected
 under the parameter value. In contrast, if the agents' observations come
 from a countably infinite signal space, then this contraction mapping
 property fails. We show by example that common learning can fail in this
 case.				   Copyright Copyright  2008 by The Econometric Society.

Title:   Computing Equilibria When Asset Markets Are Incomplete. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 1-27
Issue: 1
Volume: 64
Year: 1996
Month:  January 
Abstract:
  Existence of equilibrium with incomplete markets is problematic because
 demand functions are typically not continuous. Discontinuities occur at
 prices for which a marketed asset suddenly becomes redundant. The authors
 show that this discontinuity disappears if they allow an agent in the
 economy to introduce a new asset when such redundancies occur. This
 enables them to prove generic existence with incomplete markets using a
 standard path-following argument. Moreover, the authors' approach suggests
 a simple algorithm for computing equilibria when markets are incomplete.
 They demonstrate this by computing equilibrium for a numerical example.   Copyright 1996 by The Econometric Society.

Title:   The New Economics of Regulation Ten Years After. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 507-37
Issue: 3
Volume: 62
Year: 1994
Month:  May 
Abstract:
  After a critique of the traditional paradigms of regulation from the
 point of view of information economics, a canonical model of regulation
 under asymmetric information is developed. A survey of the main results
 obtained in the new economics of regulation is then provided, in
 particular concerning the implementation of optimal contracts by a menu of
 linear contracts, the dichotomy between pricing and cost reimbursement
 rules, the auctioning of incentive contracts, the dynamics of contracting
 under limited commitment, and the hierarchical problems in regulation.
 Empirical implications are then discussed and avenues of further research
 are described in the conclusion.   Copyright 1994 by The Econometric Society.

Title:  Equilibria in Networks
Abstract:
  We study a model in which two carriers choose networks to connect cities and
  compete for customers. We show that if carriers compete aggressively (e.g.,
  Bertrand-like behavior), one carrier operating a single hub-spoke network is
  an equilibrium outcome. Competing hub-spoke networks are not an equilibrium
  outcome, although duopoly equilibria in non-hub networks can exist. If
  carriers do not compete aggressively, a duopoly equilibrium in hubs always
  exists if the number of cities is not small. We provide conditions under
  which all equilibria consist of hub-spoke networks.

Title: Minimum Wage Effects on Labor Market Outcomes under Search, Matching, and Endogenous Contact Rates 
Abstract:
				 Building upon a continuous-time model of
 search with Nash bargaining in a stationary environment, we analyze the
 effect of changes in minimum wages on labor market outcomes and welfare.
 Although minimum wage increases may or may not lead to increases in
 unemployment in our model, they can be welfare-improving to labor market
 participants on both the supply and demand sides of the labor market. We
 discuss identification of the model using Current Population Survey data
 on accepted wages and unemployment durations, and show that by
 incorporating a limited amount of information from the demand side of the
 market it is possible to obtain credible and precise estimates of all
 primitive parameters. We show that the optimal minimum wage in 1996
 depends critically on whether or not contact rates can be considered to be
 exogenous and we note that the limited variation in minimum wages makes
 testing this assumption problematic. Copyright The Econometric Society 2006.

Title: Self-Control and the Theory of Consumption 
Abstract:
				 To study the behavior of agents who are
 susceptible to temptation in infinite horizon consumption problems under
 uncertainty, we define and characterize dynamic self-control (DSC)
 preferences. DSC preferences are recursive and separable. In economies
 with DSC agents, equilibria exist but may be inefficient; in such
 equilibria, steady state consumption is independent of initial endowments
 and increases in self-control. Increasing the preference for commitment
 while keeping self-control constant increases the equity premium. Removing
 nonbinding constraints changes equilibrium allocations and prices. Debt
 contracts can be sustained even if the only feasible punishment for
 default is the termination of the contract.				    Copyright Econometric Society 2004.

Title: The Theory of Global Games on Test: Experimental Analysis of Coordination Games with Public and Private Information 
Abstract:
				 The theory of global games has shown that
 coordination games with multiple equilibria may have a unique equilibrium
 if certain parameters of the payoff function are private information
 instead of common knowledge. We report the results of an experiment
 designed to test the predictions of this theory. Comparing sessions with
 common and private information, we observe only small differences in
 behavior. For common information, subjects coordinate on threshold
 strategies that deviate from the global game solution towards the
 payoff-dominant equilibrium. For private information, thresholds are
 closer to the global game solution than for common information. Variations
 in the payoff function affect behavior as predicted by comparative statics
 of the global game solution. Predictability of coordination points is
 about the same for both information conditions. Copyright The Econometric Society 2004.

Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 343-76
Issue: 2
Volume: 69
Year: 2001
Month:  March 
Abstract:
  We study a two-person bargaining problem in which the buyer may invest
 and increase his valuation of the object before bargaining. We show that
 if all offers are made by the seller and the time between offers is small,
 then the buyer invests efficiently and the seller extracts all of the
 surplus. Hence, bargaining with frequently repeated offers remedies the
 hold-up problem even when the agent who makes the relation-specific
 investment has no bargaining power and contracting is not possible. We
 consider alternative formulations with uncertain gains from trade or
 two-sided investment.

Title: On the Role of Outside Options in Bargaining with Obstinate Parties 
Abstract:
 The presence of obstinate types in bargaining has been shown to alter
 dramatically the bargaining equilibrium strategies and outcomes. This
 paper shows that outside options may cancel out the effect of obstinacy in
 bargaining. When parties have access to stationary outside options, we
 show that when opting out is preferable to accepting the inflexible demand
 of the other party, there is a unique Perfect Bayesian Equilibrium in
 which each party reveals himself as rational as soon as possible. A
 similar conclusion holds when outside options may only be available at a
 later date or when only one party has access to an outside option. Copyright The Econometric Society 2002.

Title:   A Folk Theorem for Asynchronously Repeated Games. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 191-200
Issue: 1
Volume: 69
Year: 2001
Month:  January 
Abstract:
  We prove a Folk Theorem for asynchronously repeated games in which the
 set of players who may not be able to change their actions simultaneously.
 We impose a condition, the finite periods of inaction (FPI) condition,
 which requires that the number of periods in which every player has at
 least one opportunity to move is bounded. Given the FPI condition together
 with the standard nonequivalent utilities (NEU) condition, we show that
 every feasible and strictly individually rational payoff vector can be
 supported as a subgame perfect equilibrium outcome of an asynchronously
 repeated game.

Title: Admissibility in Games  						  				 
Abstract:
				     Suppose that each player in a game is
 rational, each player thinks the other players are rational, and so on.
 Also, suppose that rationality is taken to incorporate an admissibility
 requirement-that is, the avoidance of weakly dominated strategies. Which
 strategies can be played? We provide an epistemic framework in which to
 address this question. Specifically, we formulate conditions of
 rationality and mth-order assumption of rationality (RmAR) and rationality
 and common assumption of rationality (RCAR). We show that (i) RCAR is
 characterized by a solution concept we call a "self-admissible set"; (ii)
 in a "complete" type structure, RmAR is characterized by the set of
 strategies that survive m+1 rounds of elimination of inadmissible
 strategies; (iii) under certain conditions, RCAR is impossible in a
 complete structure.					  Copyright The Econometric Society 2008.

Title:  A Liquidity-Based Model of Security Design
Abstract: The authors consider the problem of design and sale of a security backed by
  specified assets. Given access to higher-return investments, the issuer has
  an incentive to raise capital by securitizing part of these assets. At the
  time the security is issued, the issuer's or underwriter's private
  information regarding the payoff of the security may cause illiquidity in the
  form of a downward-sloping demand curve for the security. The authors
  characterize the optimal security design in several cases. They also
  demonstrate circumstances under which standard debt is optimal and show that
  the riskiness of the debt is increasing in the issuer's retention costs for
  assets.

Title: Social Indeterminacy 
Abstract:
				 An extension of Condorcet's paradox by
 McGarvey (1953) asserts that for every asymmetric relation R on a finite
 set of candidates there is a strict-preferences voter profile that has the
 relation R as its strict simple majority relation. We prove that
 McGarvey's theorem can be extended to arbitrary neutral monotone social
 welfare functions that can be described by a strong simple game G if the
 voting power of each individual, measured by the Shapley-Shubik power
 index, is sufficiently small.				       Copyright The Econometric Society 2004.

Title:   Subgame Perfect Implementation. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 1191-1220
Issue: 5
Volume: 56
Year: 1988
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  This paper examines the use of stage mechanisms in implementation
 problems and provides a partial characterization of the set of subgam e
 perfect implementable choice rules. It is shown that, in many economic
 environments, virtually an y choice rule can be implemented. To illustrate
 the power of this approach, the paper discusses a number of models in
 which it is possible to implement the first-best (although it wouldn't
 have been possible to do so without using stage mechanisms). The diversity
 of these models suggests that subgame perfect implementation may find wide
 application.   Copyright 1988 by The Econometric Society.

Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 711-30
Issue: 3
Volume: 59
Year: 1991
Month:  May 
Abstract:
  W. M. Gorman's (1981) concept of Engel curve "rank" is extended to apply
 to any demand system. Rank is shown to have implications for
 specification, separability, and aggregation of demands. A simple
 nonparametric test of rank using Engel curve data is described and applied
 to U.S. and U.K. consumer survey data. The test employs a new general
 method for testing the rank of estimated matrices. The results are used to
 assess theoretical and empirical aggregation error in representative
 consumer models, and to explain a representative consumer paradox.   Copyright 1991 by The Econometric Society.

Title:   Information Revelation in a Market with Pairwise Meetings. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 1-23
Issue: 1
Volume: 58
Year: 1990
Month:  January 
Abstract:
  A model of a market with pairwise meetings is developed in which traders
 have asymmetric information about the true state of the world. The focus
 is on information transmission. The main questions concern the extent to
 which the information is revealed to uninformed agents through the trade
 process and, in particular, whether nearly frictionless versions of this
 market give rise to full revelation results, as obtained by the literature
 on rational expectations for centralized and competitive markets. It turns
 out that, in equilibrium, the information is not fully revealed to
 uninformed agents, even when the market is approximately frictionless.   Copyright 1990 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Identification of Standard Auction Models 
Abstract:
 This paper presents new identification results for models of first-price,
 second-price, ascending (English), and descending (Dutch) auctions. We
 consider a general specification of the latent demand and information
 structure, nesting both private values and common values models, and
 allowing correlated types as well as ex ante asymmetry. We address
 identification of a series of nested models and derive testable
 restrictions enabling discrimination between models on the basis of
 observed data. The simplest model--symmetric independent private
 values--is nonparametrically identified even if only the transaction
 price from each auction is observed. For richer models, identification and
 testable restrictions may be obtained when additional information of one
 or more of the following types is available: (i) the identity of the
 winning bidder or other bidders; (ii) one or more bids in addition to the
 transaction price; (iii) exogenous variation in the number of bidders;
 (iv) bidder-specific covariates. While many private values (PV) models are
 nonparametrically identified and testable with commonly available data,
 identification of common values (CV) models requires stringent
 assumptions. Nonetheless, the PV model can be tested against the CV
 alternative, even when neither model is identified. Copyright The Econometric Society 2002.

Title: Mechanism Design with Interdependent Valuations: Efficiency 
Abstract:
				 Agents' valuations are interdependent if
 they depend on the signals, or types, of all agents. Under the implicit
 assumption that agents cannot observe their outcome-decision payoffs,
 previous literature has shown that with interdependent valuations and
 independent signals, efficient design is impossible. This paper shows that
 an efficient mechanism exists in an environment where first the final
 outcome (e.g., allocation of the goods) is determined, then the agents
 observe their own outcome-decision payoffs, and then final transfers are
 made. Copyright The Econometric Society 2004.

Title: Estimation of a Dynamic Auction Game 
Abstract:
				 This paper proposes an estimation method
 for a repeated auction game under the presence of capacity constraints.
 The estimation strategy is computationally simple as it does not require
 solving for the equilibrium of the game. It uses a two stage approach. In
 the first stage the distribution of bids conditional on state variables is
 estimated using data on bids, bidder characteristics, and contract
 characteristics. In the second stage, an expression of the expected sum of
 future profits based on the distribution of bids is obtained, and costs
 are inferred based on the first order condition of optimal bids. Copyright The Econometric Society 2003.

Title:   Testing When a Parameter Is on the Boundary of the Maintained Hypothesis. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 683-734
Issue: 3
Volume: 69
Year: 2001
Month:  May 
Abstract:
  This paper considers testing problems where several of the standard
 regularity conditions fail to hold. We consider the case where (i)
 parameter vectors in the null hypothesis may lie on the boundary of the
 maintained hypothesis and (ii) there may be a nuisance parameter that
 appears under the alternative hypothesis, but not under the null. The
 paper establishes the asymptotic null and local alternative distributions
 of quasi-likelihood ratio, rescaled quasilikelihood ratio, Wald, and score
 tests in this case. The results apply to tests based on a wide variety of
 extremum estimators and apply to a wide variety of models. Examples
 treated in the paper are: (i) tests of the null hypothesis of no
 conditional heteroskedasticity in a GARCH(1,-1) regression model and (ii)
 tests of the null hypothesis that some random coefficients have variances
 equal to zero in a random coefficients regression model with (possibly)
 correlated random coefficients.

Title: Adapting to Unknown Disturbance Autocorrelation in Regression with Long Memory 
Abstract:
 We show that it is possible to adapt to nonparametric disturbance
 autocorrelation in time series regression in the presence of long memory
 in both regressors and disturbances by using a smoothed nonparametric
 spectrum estimate in frequency-domain generalized least squares. When the
 collective memory in regressors and disturbances is sufficiently strong,
 ordinary least squares is not only asymptotically inefficient but
 asymptotically non-normal and has a slow rate of convergence, whereas
 generalized least squares is asymptotically normal and Gauss-Markov
 efficient with standard convergence rate. Despite the anomalous behavior
 of nonparametric spectrum estimates near a spectral pole, we are able to
 justify a standard construction of frequency-domain generalized least
 squares, earlier considered in case of short memory disturbances. A small
 Monte Carlo study of finite sample performance is included. Copyright The Econometric Society 2002.

Abstract:
  Perfect equilibria of finitely repeated games may be vulnerable to the
 possibility of renegotiation among players. The authors study the limiting
 properties of the set of payoffs from equilibria that are immune to
 renegotiation. Their main result is th at the limit of the set of payoffs
 from renegotiation-proof equilibria is either a singleton or a connected
 subset of the Pareto efficient frontier. A simple sufficient condition for
 the latter to occur is a lso provided.   Copyright 1993 by The Econometric Society.

Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 377-411
Issue: 2
Volume: 69
Year: 2001
Month:  March 
Abstract:
  We identify the inefficiencies that arise when negotiation between two
 parties takes place in the presence of transaction costs. First, for some
 values of these costs it is efficient to reach an agreement but the unique
 equilibrium outcome is one in which agreement is never reached. Secondly,
 even when there are equilibria in which an agreement is reached, we find
 that the model always has an equilibrium in which agreement is never
 reached, as well as equilibria in which agreement is delayed for an
 arbitrary length of time. Finally, the only way in which the parties can
 reach an agreement in equilibrium is by using inefficient punishments for
 (some of) the opponent's deviations. We argue that this implies that, when
 the parties are given the opportunity to renegotiate out of these
 inefficiencies, the only equilibrium outcome that survives is the one in
 which agreement is never reached, regardless of the value of the
 transaction costs.

Title: Notes and Comments the Amsterdam Auction 
Abstract:
				 The Amsterdam auction has been used to
 sell real estate in the Dutch capital for centuries. By awarding a premium
 to the highest losing bidder, the Amsterdam auction favors weak bidders
 without having the implementation difficulties of Myerson's (1981) optimal
 auction. In a series of experiments, we compare the standard first-price
 and English auctions, the optimal auction, and two variants of the
 Amsterdam auction. With strongly asymmetric bidders, the second-price
 Amsterdam auction raises substantially more revenues than standard formats
 and only slightly less than the optimal auction. Copyright Econometric Society 2004.

Title:  Linear Regression Limit Theory for Nonstationary Panel Data
Journal: Econometrica
Abstract:
  This paper develops a regression limit theory for nonstationary panel data
  with large numbers of cross section and time series observations. The limit
  theory allows for both sequential limits and joins limits, and the
  relationship between these multidimensional limits is explored. The panel
  structures considered allow for no time series cointegration, heterogeneous
  cointegration, homogeneous cointegration, and near-homogeneous cointegration.
  The paper explores the existence of long-run average relations between
  integrated panel vectors. In the case of homogeneous and near homogeneous
  cointegrating panels, a panel fully modified regression estimator is
  developed and studied.

Title: Identifying Social Interactions Through Conditional Variance Restrictions 
Abstract:
				 This paper proposes a new method for
 identifying social interactions using conditional variance restrictions.
 The method provides a consistent estimate of the social multiplier when
 social interactions take the "linear-in-means" form (Manski (1993)). When
 social interactions are not of the linear-in-means form, the estimator,
 under certain conditions, continues to form the basis of a consistent test
 of the no social interactions null with correct large sample size. The
 methods are illustrated using data from the Tennessee class size reduction
 experiment Project STAR. The application suggests that differences in peer
 group quality were an important source of individual-level variation in
 the academic achievement of Project STAR kindergarten students. Copyright Copyright  2008 by The Econometric Society.

Abstract:
  The authors consider the problem of allocating a bundle of commodities

 proved that, for an atomless economy with possibly satiated preferences,
 any solution that is efficient, equitable, and consistent must select
 allocations that are supported by equal-budget Walrasian equilibria with
 slack.   Copyright 1993 by The Econometric Society.

Title:  Instrumental Models and Indirect Encompassing	
Abstract: Methods of indirect, simulation-based inference for nested and
	nonnested hypotheses are developed. The methods make use of instrumental
	models and are applicable in cases where likelihood-based inference is
	numerically unfeasible.  The asymptotic normality of an indirect Wald vector
	is shown and the implicit null hypotheses of the proposed tests are
	characterized as generalizations of the standard encompassing hypothesis.
	Some of the tests generalize well-known instrumental variable methods and
	Hausman-Wu specification tests.

Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 1065-85
Issue: 5
Volume: 62
Year: 1994
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  The authors characterize the symmetric equilibria of an investment game
 with a pure informational externality. When the period length is very
 short, the game ends very quickly; with positive probability, an
 informational cascade (herding) causes an investment collapse. As the
 period length increases, the possibility of herding disappears. As the
 number of players increases, the rate of investment and the information
 flow are eventually independent of the number of players; adding more
 players simply increases the number who delay. In the limit, a period of
 low investment is followed by either an investment surge or a collapse.   Copyright 1994 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Schumpeterian Growth Theory and the Dynamics of Income Inequality 
Abstract:
 In this lecture, it is argued that Schumpeterian Growth Theory, in which
 growth is driven by a sequence of quality-improving innovations, can shed
 light on two important puzzles raised by the recent evolution of wage
 inequality in developed economies. The first puzzle concerns wage
 inequality "between" educational groups, which has substantially risen in
 the US and the UK during the past two decades following a sharp increase
 in the supply of educated labor. The second puzzle concerns wage
 inequality "within" educational groups, which accounts for a large
 fraction of the observed increase in wage inequality, although in contrast
 to between-group wage inequality it has mainly affected the "temporary"
 component of income. Copyright The Econometric Society 2002.

Abstract:
  This study undertakes a systematic analysis of several theoretic and
 statistical assumption s used in many empirical models of female labor
 supply. Using a singl e data set (PSID 1975 labor supply data) the author
 is able to replic ate most of the range of estimated income and
 substitution effects fo und in previous studies in this field. He
 undertakes extensive specif ication tests and finds that most of this
 range should be rejected du e to statistical and model misspecifications.
 The two most important assumptions appear to be the Tobit assumption used
 to control for sel f-selection into the labor force and exogeneity
 assumptions on the wi fe's wage rate and her labor market experience.	 Copyright 1987 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Prices and Portfolio Choices in Financial Markets: Theory, Econometrics, Experiments 
Abstract:
				 Many tests of asset-pricing models address
 only the pricing predictions, but these pricing predictions rest on
 portfolio choice predictions that seem obviously wrong. This paper
 suggests a new approach to asset pricing and portfolio choices based on
 unobserved heterogeneity. This approach yields the standard pricing
 conclusions of classical models but is consistent with very different
 portfolio choices. Novel econometric tests link the price and portfolio
 predictions and take into account the general equilibrium effects of
 sample-size bias. This paper works through the approach in detail for the
 case of the classical capital asset pricing model (CAPM), producing a
 model called CAPM+&epsi;. When these econometric tests are applied to data
 generated by large-scale laboratory asset markets that reveal both prices
 and portfolio choices, CAPM+&epsi;is not rejected. Copyright The Econometric Society 2007.

Title:  Social Security and Demographic Shocks	
Journal: Econometrica
Abstract:
  An overlapping generations model of social security with productivity and
  demographic shocks is studied. The authors focus attention on stationary
  long-run allocations. An allocation is interim optimal if there does not
  exist another feasible allocation that improves the expected welfare of all
  generations, computed conditionally on the state of the world when they are
  born. The authors characterize the set of interim optimal allocations and
  study the equilibria associated with various institutional forms of social
  security from the point of view of this optimality criterion. They obtain the
  analogs of the two traditional welfare theorems of microeconomic theory.

Title:   Likelihood Inference for Discretely Observed Nonlinear Diffusions. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 959-93
Issue: 4
Volume: 69
Year: 2001
Month:  July 
Abstract:
  This paper is concerned with the Bayesian estimation of nonlinear
 stochastic differential equations when observations are discretely
 sampled. The estimation framework relies on the introduction of latent
 auxiliary data to complete the missing diffusion between each pair of
 measurements. Tuned Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods based on the
 Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, in conjunction with the Euler-Maruyama
 discretization scheme, are used to sample the posterior distribution of
 the latent data and the model parameters. Techniques for computing the
 likelihood function, the marginal likelihood, and diagnostic measures (all
 based on the MCMC output) are developed. Examples using simulated and real
 data are presented and discussed in detail.

Title:   Ex Ante Price Offers in Matching Games Non-steady States. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 1425-54
Issue: 5
Volume: 59
Year: 1991
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  A matching problem is considered in which sellers can publicly commit to
 a trading price that differs from the price at which buyers expect to
 trade elsewhere in the market. When demand and supply are nearly equal,
 the equilibrium ex ante price offer lies below the price associated with
 the Nash bargaining split. This relationship reverses when the level of
 excess demand is large. Sellers always have an incentive to make ex ante
 offers when prices elsewhere are determined by Nash bargaining. This can
 be interpreted to mean that Nash bargaining is an unstable pricing
 institution.   Copyright 1991 by The Econometric Society.

Title:   Communication in Repeated Games with Imperfect Private Monitoring
Abstract: This paper examines repeated games in which each player observes a
	private and imperfect signal on the actions played and in which players are
	allowed to communicate using public messages. Providing incentives for
	players to reveal their observations generate revelation constraints which,
	combined with signal imperfections, may be a source of inefficiencies.
	However, the author shows that, by delaying the revelation of their
	observations, players may reduce the cost of deterring deviations. With at
	least three players, he obtains a Nash threat version of the folk theorem.
	With two players, the author shows that an efficient outcome can (almost)
	always be approximated.

Title: Markov Perfect Industry Dynamics With Many Firms 
Abstract:
				 We propose an approximation method for
 analyzing Ericson and Pakes (1995)-style dynamic models of imperfect
 competition. We define a new equilibrium concept that we call oblivious
 equilibrium, in which each firm is assumed to make decisions based only on
 its own state and knowledge of the long-run average industry state, but
 where firms ignore current information about competitors' states. The
 great advantage of oblivious equilibria is that they are much easier to
 compute than are Markov perfect equilibria. Moreover, we show that, as the
 market becomes large, if the equilibrium distribution of firm states obeys
 a certain "light-tail" condition, then oblivious equilibria closely
 approximate Markov perfect equilibria. This theorem justifies using
 oblivious equilibria to analyze Markov perfect industry dynamics in
 Ericson and Pakes (1995)-style models with many firms. Copyright  2008 The Econometric Society.

Title: The Effect of School Choice on Participants: Evidence from Randomized Lotteries 
Abstract:
				 School choice has become an increasingly
 prominent strategy for enhancing academic achievement. To evaluate the
 impact on participants, we exploit randomized lotteries that determine
 high school admission in the Chicago Public Schools. Compared to those
 students who lose lotteries, students who win attend high schools that are
 better in a number of dimensions, including peer achievement and
 attainment levels. Nonetheless, we find little evidence that winning a
 lottery provides any systematic benefit across a wide variety of
 traditional academic measures. Lottery winners do, however, experience
 improvements on a subset of nontraditional outcome measures, such as
 self-reported disciplinary incidents and arrest rates. Copyright The Econometric Society 2006.

Title: Uniform Inference in Autoregressive Models 
Abstract:
				 The purpose of this paper is to provide
 theoretical justification for some existing methods for constructing
 confidence intervals for the sum of coefficients in autoregressive models.
 We show that the methods of Stock (1991), Andrews (1993), and Hansen
 (1999) provide asymptotically valid confidence intervals, whereas the
 subsampling method of Romano and Wolf (2001) does not. In addition, we
 generalize the three valid methods to a larger class of statistics. We
 also clarify the difference between uniform and pointwise asymptotic
 approximations, and show that a pointwise convergence of coverage
 probabilities for all values of the parameter does not guarantee the
 validity of the confidence set. Copyright The Econometric Society 2007.

Title:   Asymptotically Optimal Smoothing with ARCH Models. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 561-73
Issue: 3
Volume: 64
Year: 1996
Month:  May 
Abstract:
  Suppose an observed time series is generated by a stochastic volatility
 model. As shown by D. B. Nelson (1992) and D. B. Nelson and D. P. Foster
 (1994), a misspecified ARCH model will often be able to consistently (as a
 continuous time limit is approached) estimate the unobserved volatility
 process using information in the lagged residuals. This paper shows how to
 more efficiently estimate such a volatility process using information in
 both lagged and led residuals. In particular, this paper expands the
 optimal filtering results of Nelson and Foster (1994) and Nelson (1994) to
 smoothing and to filtering with a random initial condition.   Copyright 1996 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Virtual Determinacy in Overlapping Generations Models 
Abstract:
				 We reappraise the significance and
 robustness of indeterminacy in overlapping-generations models. In any of
 Gale's example economies with an equilibrium that is not locally unique,
 for instance, perturbing the economy by judiciously splitting each of
 Gale's goods into two close substitutes restricts that indeterminacy to
 each period's allocation of consumption between those substitutes. In
 particular, prices, interest rates, the commodity value of nominal savings
 (including money), and utility levels become determinate. Any
 indeterminacy of equilibrium consumption in the perturbed economy is thus
 insignificant to consumers, and some forecasting and comparative-statics
 policy exercises become possible. Copyright  2009 The Econometric Society.

Title: Long-Term Risk: An Operator Approach 
Abstract:
				 We create an analytical structure that
 reveals the long-run risk-return relationship for nonlinear
 continuous-time Markov environments. We do so by studying an eigenvalue
 problem associated with a positive eigenfunction for a conveniently chosen
 family of valuation operators. The members of this family are indexed by
 the elapsed time between payoff and valuation dates, and they are
 necessarily related via a mathematical structure called a semigroup. We
 represent the semigroup using a positive process with three components: an
 exponential term constructed from the eigenvalue, a martingale, and a
 transient eigenfunction term. The eigenvalue encodes the risk adjustment,
 the martingale alters the probability measure to capture long-run
 approximation, and the eigenfunction gives the long-run dependence on the
 Markov state. We discuss sufficient conditions for the existence and
 uniqueness of the relevant eigenvalue and eigenfunction. By showing how
 changes in the stochastic growth components of cash flows induce changes
 in the corresponding eigenvalues and eigenfunctions, we reveal a long-run
 risk-return trade-off. Copyright  2009 The Econometric Society.

Journal: Econometrica

Issue: 1
Volume: 63
Year: 1995
Month:  January 
Abstract:
  This paper describes the U.S. offshore oil and gas lease sales conducted
 by the Department of the Interior since 1954. Several decision variables
 are discussed, including bidding for leases, the government's decision
 whether to accept the highest bid, the incidence and timing of exploratory
 drilling, and the formation of bidding consortia. Equilibrium models of
 these decisions that emphasize informational and strategic issues and that
 account for institutional features of the leasing program are analyzed and
 their predictions compared to outcomes in the data.   Copyright 1995 by The Econometric Society.

Title:  Relative Utilitarianism	 
Journal: Econometrica
Abstract:
  In a framework of preferences over lotteries, the authors show that an axiom
  system consisting of weakened versions of Arrow's axioms has a unique
  solution, 'relative utilitarianism.' This consists of first normalizing
  individual von Neumann-Morgenstern utilities between zero and one and then
  summing them. The weakening consists chiefly in removing from IIA the
  requirement that social preferences be insensitive to variations in the
  intensity of preferences. The authors also show the resulting axiom system to
  be in a strong sense independent.

Title:   On Delay in Bargaining with One-Sided Uncertainty. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 601-11
Issue: 3
Volume: 56
Year: 1988
Month:  May 
Abstract:
  Recently, attention has been given to a model of two-person bargaining in
 which the parties alternate making of fers and there is uncertainty about
 the valuation of one party. The p urpose of the analysis has been to
 identify delay to agreement with a screening process, where agents with
 relatively lower valuations dis tinguish themselves by waiting longer to
 settle. The authors point ou t a fundamental difficulty with this program
 by demonstrating that th e assumptions used in the literature allow for
 delay only in so far a s the time between offers is significant.   Copyright 1988 by The Econometric Society.

Title:  Subject Evaluation in Social Experiments
Abstract: This paper concerns inferring how self-interested subjects, as opposed
	to altruistic investigators, evaluate treatments in social experiments. The
	authors argue that the attrition behavior of subjects reveals their
	evaluation and discuss the usefulness of using such data in performing
	subject-based evaluation. The authors study the causes of disagreements
	between investigators and subjects in evaluating treatments and empirically
	assess the degree to which they disagree.  The paper provides an empirical
	framework for estimating the systematic level of disagreement in the presence
	of such errors. Using clinical trials, the authors  find substantial evidence
	of overapproval by investigators in about one-third of the trials analyzed.

Volume: 60
Year: 1992
Month:  May 
Abstract:
  This paper describes a semiparametric estimator for binary response
 models in which there may be arbitrary heteroskedasticity of unknown form.
 The estimator is obtained by maximizing a smoothed version of the
 objective function of C. Manski's maximum score estimator. The smoothing
 procedure is similar to that used in kernel nonparametric density
 estimation. The resulting estimator's rate of convergence in probability
 is the fastest possible under the assumptions that are made. The centered,
 normalized estimator is asymptotically normally distributed. Methods are
 given for consistently estimating the parameters of the limiting
 distribution and for selecting the bandwidth required by the smoothing
 procedure.   Copyright 1992 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Relational Contracts and the Nature of Market Interactions 
Abstract:
				 We provide evidence that long-term
 relationships between trading parties emerge endogenously in the absence
 of third party enforcement of contracts and are associated with a
 fundamental change in the nature of market interactions. Without third
 party enforcement, the vast majority of trades are initiated with private
 offers and the parties share the gains from trade equally. Low effort or
 bad quality is penalized by the termination of the relationship, wielding
 a powerful effect on contract enforcement. Successful long-term relations
 exhibit generous rent sharing and high effort (quality) from the very
 beginning of the relationship. In the absence of third-party enforcement,
 markets resemble a collection of bilateral trading islands rather than a
 competitive market. If contracts are third party enforceable, rent sharing
 and long-term relations are absent and the vast majority of trades are
 initiated with public offers. Most trades take place in one-shot
 transactions and the contracting parties are indifferent with regard to
 the identity of their trading partner. Copyright The Econometric Society 2004.

Title: The Optimal Income Taxation of Couples 
Abstract:
				 This paper analyzes the general nonlinear
 optimal income tax for couples, a multidimensional screening problem. Each
 couple consists of a primary earner who always participates in the labor
 market, but makes an hours-of-work choice, and a secondary earner who
 chooses whether or not to work. If second-earner participation is a signal
 of the couple being better (worse) off, we prove that optimal tax schemes
 display a positive tax (subsidy) on secondary earnings and that the tax
 (subsidy) on secondary earnings decreases with primary earnings and
 converges to zero asymptotically. We present calibrated microsimulations
 for the United Kingdom showing that decreasing tax rates on secondary
 earnings is quantitatively significant and consistent with actual income
 tax and transfer programs.				     Copyright  2009 The Econometric Society.

 Economists have lately been called upon not only to analyze markets, but
 to design them. Market design involves a responsibility for detail, a need
 to deal with all of a market's complications, not just its principle
 features. Designers therefore cannot work only with the simple conceptual
 models used for theoretical insights into the general working of markets.
 Instead, market design calls for an engineering approach. Drawing
 primarily on the design of the entry level labor market for American
 doctors (the National Resident Matching Program), and of the auctions of
 radio spectrum conducted by the Federal Communications Commission, this
 paper makes the case that experimental and computational economics are
 natural complements to game theory in the work of design. The paper also
 argues that some of the challenges facing both markets involve dealing
 with related kinds of complementarities, and that this suggests an agenda
 for future theoretical research. Copyright The Econometric Society 2002.

Title: Approximate Generalizations and Computational Experiments 
Abstract:
				 In this paper I demonstrate how one can
 generalize finitely many examples to statements about (infinite) classes
 of economic models. If there exist upper bounds on the number of connected
 components of one-dimensional linear subsets of the set of parameters for
 which a conjecture is true, one can conclude that it is correct for all
 parameter values in the class considered, except for a small residual set,
 once one has verified the conjecture for a predetermined finite set of
 points. I show how to apply this insight to computational experiments and
 spell out assumptions on the economic fundamentals that ensure that the
 necessary bounds on the number of connected components exist. Copyright The Econometric Society 2007.

Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 993-1008
Issue: 5
Volume: 60
Year: 1992
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  The authors investigate the implementation of social choice functions
 that map to lotteries over alternatives. They require virtual
 implementation in iteratively undominated strategies. Under very weak
 domain restrictions, they show that if there are three or more players,
 any social choice function may be so implemented. The literature on
 implementation in Nash equilibrium and its refinements is compromised by
 its reliance on game forms with unnatural features (for example, "integer
 games") or "modulo" constructions with mixed strategies arbitrarily
 excluded. In contrast, the authors' results employ finite (consequently
 "well-behaved") mechanisms and allow for mixed strategies.   Copyright 1992 by The Econometric Society.

Title:   Bayesian Vector Autoregressions with Stochastic Volatility
Abstract: This paper proposes a Bayesian approach to a vector autoregression with
	stochastic volatility, where the multiplicative evolution of the precision
	matrix is driven by a multivariate beta variate. Exact updating formulas are
	given to the nonlinear filtering of the precision matrix. Estimation of the
	autoregressive parameters requires numerical methods: an
	importance-sampling-based approach is explained here.

Title:   Two-Stage Lotteries without the Reduction Axiom. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 349-77
Issue: 2
Volume: 58
Year: 1990
Month:  March 
Abstract:
  Preference relations over two-stage lotteries are analyzed.  Empirical
 evidence indicates that decisionmakers do not always behave in accordance
 with the reduction of compound lotteries axiom, but they seem to satisfy a
 compound independence axiom. Although the reduction and the compound
 independence axioms, together with continuity, imply expected utility
 theory, each of them by itself is compatible with all possible preference
 relations over simple lotteries. Using these axioms, the author analyzes
 three different versions of expected utility for two-stage lotteries. The
 author suggests several different compound dominance axioms as possible
 replacements of the reduction axiom, which are strictly weaker than the
 reduction of compound lotteries axiom.   Copyright 1990 by The Econometric Society.

Abstract:
  The authors introduce, in this paper, a method for solving nonlinear

 distributions of a variety of statistics, which will give a detailed
 description of the model's properties. In particular, those statistics can
 be compared with the similar ones obtained from actual data, and different
 criteria for goodness of fit can be defined on the basis of these
 comparisons.   Copyright 1990 by The Econometric Society.

Year: 1996
Month:  July 
Abstract:
  This paper is concerned with model determination methods and their use in
 the prediction of economic time series. The methods are Bayesian but they
 can be justified by classical arguments as well. The paper continues some
 recent work on Bayesian asymptotic, develops embedding techniques for
 vector martingales, and implements the modeling ideas in a multivariate
 regression framework that includes Bayesian vector autoregression (BVAR's)
 and reduced rank regressions (RRR's). It is shown how the theory in the
 paper can be used; (i) to construct optimized BVAR's; (ii) to compare
 models such as BVAR's, optimized BVAR's and RRR's; (iii) to perform joint
 order selection of cointegrating rank, lag length and trend degree in a
 VAR; and (iv) to discard data that may be irrelevant and reset the initial
 conditions of a model.   Copyright 1996 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Liquidity in Asset Markets With Search Frictions 
Abstract:
				 We develop a search-theoretic model of
 financial intermediation in an over-the-counter market and study how
 trading frictions affect the distribution of asset holdings and standard
 measures of liquidity. A distinctive feature of our theory is that it
 allows for unrestricted asset holdings, so market participants can
 accommodate trading frictions by adjusting their asset positions. We show
 that these individual responses of asset demands constitute a fundamental
 feature of illiquid markets: they are a key determinant of trade volume,
 bid-ask spreads, and trading delays-the dimensions of market liquidity
 that search-based theories seek to explain. Copyright  2009 The Econometric Society.

Title:   Efficiency Bounds for Distribution-free Estimators of the Binary. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 559-85
Issue: 3
Volume: 55
Year: 1987
Month:  May 
Abstract:
  Lower bounds are derived for the asymptotic variances of regular
 distribution-free (or semiparametric) estimators of the parameters of the
 binary-choice model and the censored-regression (Tobit) model. A
 semiparametric estimator is one that does not require any assumption about
 the distribution of the stochastic error term in the model, apart from
 regularity conditions. Comparison of the bounds with the corresponding
 asymptotic Cramer-Rao bounds for the classical parametric problem shows
 the loss of information due to lack of a priori knowledge of the
 functional form of the error distribution.   Copyright 1987 by The Econometric Society.

Title:   Simulated Moments Estimation of Markov Models of Asset Prices. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 929-52
Issue: 4
Volume: 61
Year: 1993
Month:  July 
Abstract:
  This paper provides a simulated moments estimator of the parameters of
 dynamic models in which the state vector follows a time-homogeneous Markov
 process. Conditions are provided for both weak and strong consistency as
 well as asymptotic normality. Various trade-offs among the regularity
 conditions underlying the large sample properties of the simulated moments
 estimator are discussed in the context of an asset-pricing model.
 Geometric ergodicity of the underlying Markov process plays a central role
 in the analysis, ensuring that the simulated processes are asymptotically
 stationary with an ergodic distribution that is independent of starting
 values.   Copyright 1993 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Bootstrapping Realized Volatility 
Abstract:
				 We propose bootstrap methods for a general
 class of nonlinear transformations of realized volatility which includes
 the raw version of realized volatility and its logarithmic transformation
 as special cases. We consider the independent and identically distributed
 (i.i.d.) bootstrap and the wild bootstrap (WB), and prove their
 first-order asymptotic validity under general assumptions on the log-price
 process that allow for drift and leverage effects. We derive Edgeworth
 expansions in a simpler model that rules out these effects. The i.i.d.
 bootstrap provides a second-order asymptotic refinement when volatility is
 constant, but not otherwise. The WB yields a second-order asymptotic
 refinement under stochastic volatility provided we choose the external
 random variable used to construct the WB data appropriately. None of these
 methods provides third-order asymptotic refinements. Both methods improve
 upon the first-order asymptotic theory in finite samples. Copyright  2009 The Econometric Society.

Title: Over-the-Counter Markets 
Abstract:
				 We study how intermediation and asset
 prices in over-the-counter markets are affected by illiquidity associated
 with search and bargaining. We compute explicitly the prices at which
 investors trade with each other, as well as marketmakers' bid and ask
 prices, in a dynamic model with strategic agents. Bid-ask spreads are
 lower if investors can more easily find other investors or have easier
 access to multiple marketmakers. With a monopolistic marketmaker, bid-ask
 spreads are higher if investors have easier access to the marketmaker. We
 characterize endogenous search and welfare, and discuss empirical
 implications. Copyright The Econometric Society 2005.

Title: The Measurement of Intellectual Influence 
Abstract:
				 This paper examines the problem of
 measuring intellectual influence based on data on citations between
 scholarly publications. We follow an axiomatic approach and find that the
 properties of invariance to reference intensity, weak homogeneity, weak
 consistency, and invariance to splitting of journals characterize a unique
 ranking method. This method is different from those regularly used in
 economics and other social sciences. Copyright The Econometric Society 2004.

Abstract:
  For the first-order univariate autoregression without constant term, the
 joint density (corresponding to a flat prior) for the true coefficient and
 its least squares estimate is estimated by Monte Carlo and graphically
 displayed. The graphs show how a symmetric distribution for the
 coefficient conditional on the estimate coexists with an asymmetric
 distribution for the estimate conditional on the coefficient. Prior
 densities implicit in treating classical significance levels as if they
 were Bayesian posterior probabilities are calculated. They are shown to
 depend sensitively on the estimated coefficient and to put substantial
 probability on values of the coefficient above one.   Copyright 1991 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Affirmative Action in Higher Education: How Do Admission and Financial Aid Rules Affect Future Earnings&quest; 
Abstract:
				 This paper addresses how changing the
 admission and financial aid rules at colleges affects future earnings. I
 estimate a structural model of the following decisions by individuals:
 where to submit applications, which school to attend, and what field to
 study. The model also includes decisions by schools as to which students
 to accept and how much financial aid to offer. Simulating how black
 educational choices would change were they to face the white admission and
 aid rules shows that race-based advantages had little effect on earnings.
 However, removing race-based advantages does affect black educational
 outcomes. In particular, removing advantages in admissions substantially
 decreases the number of black students at top-tier schools, while removing
 advantages in financial aid causes a decrease in the number of blacks who
 attend college. Copyright The Econometric Society 2005.

Title:  Separable Preferences, Strategyproofness, and Decomposability	
Journal: Econometrica
Abstract:
  The authors consider strategyproof social choice functions defined over
  product domains. If preferences are strict orderings and separable, then
  strategyproof social choice functions must be decomposable provided that the
  domain of preferences is rich. The authors provide several applications of
  this result, including a characterization of the libertarian social choice
  function.

Title:  Short Run and Long Run Causality in Time Series: Theory
Abstract: Causality in Granger's sense is defined in terms of predictibility one
	period ahead. The notion of causality is generalized by considering causality
	at any given horizon 1 <= h <= inifinity, providing a rigorous formalization
	of indirect causal effects and causality chains in (possibly) nonstationary
	time series.  The authors derive necessary and sufficient conditions for
	noncausality between vectors up to any given horizon. They observe that
	coefficients of lagged variables in forecasts at various horizons can be
	interpreted as generalized impulse response coefficients yielding a complete
	picture of linear causality, in contrast with usual impulse coefficients
	which can be misleading.

Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 119-45
Issue: 1
Volume: 56
Year: 1988

Abstract:
  The exact distribution of the regression t statistic for testing the
 value of the AR parameter in a Gaussian first ord er autoregressive model
 is investigated by Monte Carlo methods. The S tudent's t distribution is
 not a satisfactory approximation for sampl es typical in economic
 applications. The main problem is the location of the distribution of the
 t statistic rather than the shape. Once t he t statistic is adjusted so
 that it has the same mean and standard deviation as Student's t, the
 distribution of the adjusted t statisti c is accurately approximated by
 Student's t. Techniques are presented for mak-ing these adjustments in
 practice.   Copyright 1988 by The Econometric Society.

Title:  Analysis of a Numerical Dynamic Programming Algorithm Applied to Economic Models
Abstract: In this paper, the authors develop a discretized version of the dynamic
	programming algorithm and study its convergence and stability properties. 
	They show that the computed value function converges quadratically to the
	true value function and that the computed value function converges linearly,
	as the mesh size of the discretization converges to zero; further, the
	algorithm is stable.  The authors also discuss several aspects of the
	implementation of their procedures as applied to some commonly studied growth
	models.

Title:   Trend Function Hypothesis Testing in the Presence of Serial Correlation
Abstract: Test statistics are proposed for testing hypotheses about the
	parameters of the deterministic trend function of a univariate time series.
	The tests are valid for general forms of serial correlation in the errors and
	do not require estimates (parametric or nonparametric) of serial correlation
	parameters. The tests are valid for stationary and unit root errors.
	Allowable trend functions include linear polynomials of time that may have
	structural change.  Asymptotic results are applied to a model with a simple
	linear trend and are used to construct confidence intervals for average GNP
	growth rates for eight industrialized countries using postwar data.

Title: Wavelet-Based Testing for Serial Correlation of Unknown Form in Panel Models 
Abstract:
				 Wavelet analysis is a new mathematical
 method developed as a unified field of science over the last decade or so.
 As a spatially adaptive analytic tool, wavelets are useful for capturing
 serial correlation where the spectrum has peaks or kinks, as can arise
 from persistent dependence, seasonality, and other kinds of periodicity.
 This paper proposes a new class of generally applicable wavelet-based
 tests for serial correlation of unknown form in the estimated residuals of
 a panel regression model, where error components can be one-way or
 two-way, individual and time effects can be fixed or random, and
 regressors may contain lagged dependent variables or
 deterministic/stochastic trending variables. Our tests are applicable to
 unbalanced heterogenous panel data. They have a convenient null limit
 N(0,1) distribution. No formulation of an alternative model is required,
 and our tests are consistent against serial correlation of unknown form
 even in the presence of substantial inhomogeneity in serial correlation
 across individuals. This is in contrast to existing serial correlation
 tests for panel models, which ignore inhomogeneity in serial correlation
 across individuals by assuming a common alternative, and thus have no
 power against the alternatives where the average of serial correlations
 among individuals is close to zero. We propose and justify a data-driven
 method to choose the smoothing parameter-the finest scale in wavelet
 spectral estimation, making the tests completely operational in practice.
 The data-driven finest scale automatically converges to zero under the
 null hypothesis of no serial correlation and diverges to infinity as the
 sample size increases under the alternative, ensuring the consistency of
 our tests. Simulation shows that our tests perform well in small and
 finite samples relative to some existing tests. Copyright The Econometric Society 2004.

Title: Theories of Learning in Games and Heterogeneity Bias 
Abstract:
				 Comparisons of learning models in repeated
 games have been a central preoccupation of experimental and behavioral
 economics over the last decade. Much of this work begins with pooled
 estimation of the model(s) under scrutiny. I show that in the presence of
 parameter heterogeneity, pooled estimation can produce a severe bias that
 tends to unduly favor reinforcement learning relative to belief learning.
 This occurs when comparisons are based on goodness of fit and when
 comparisons are based on the relative importance of the two kinds of
 learning in hybrid structural models. Even misspecified random parameter
 estimators can greatly reduce the bias relative to pooled estimation. Copyright The Econometric Society 2006.

Title: Nonparametric Identification of Finite Mixture Models of Dynamic Discrete Choices 
Abstract:
				 In dynamic discrete choice analysis,
 controlling for unobserved heterogeneity is an important issue, and finite
 mixture models provide flexible ways to account for it. This paper studies
 nonparametric identifiability of type probabilities and type-specific
 component distributions in finite mixture models of dynamic discrete
 choices. We derive sufficient conditions for nonparametric identification
 for various finite mixture models of dynamic discrete choices used in
 applied work under different assumptions on the Markov property,
 stationarity, and type-invariance in the transition process. Three
 elements emerge as the important determinants of identification: the
 time-dimension of panel data, the number of values the covariates can
 take, and the heterogeneity of the response of different types to changes
 in the covariates. For example, in a simple case where the transition
 function is type-invariant, a time-dimension of T = 3 is sufficient for
 identification, provided that the number of values the covariates can take
 is no smaller than the number of types and that the changes in the
 covariates induce sufficiently heterogeneous variations in the choice
 probabilities across types. Identification is achieved even when state
 dependence is present if a model is stationary first-order Markovian and
 the panel has a moderate time-dimension (T&ges; 6).			     Copyright  2009 The Econometric Society.

Title:   Asymptotic Properties of Residual Based Tests for Cointegration. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 165-93
Issue: 1
Volume: 58
Year: 1990
Month:  January 
Abstract:
  This paper develops an asymptotic theory for residual based tests for
 cointegration. Attention is given to the augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF)
 test and the Z(subscript "alpha") and Z(subscript "t") unit root tests.
 Two new tests are also introduced. The tests are shown to be
 asymptotically similar, and simple representations of their limiting
 distributions are given and asymptotic critical values are tabulated. The
 ADF and Z(subscript "t") tests are asymptotically equivalent. Power
 properties of the test are also studied. The tests are consistent if

Title: Fisher's Information for Discretely Sampled Lévy Processes 
Abstract:
				 This paper studies the asymptotic behavior
 of Fisher's information for a Lévy process discretely sampled at an
 increasing frequency. As a result, we derive the optimal rates of
 convergence of efficient estimators of the different parameters of the
 process and show that the rates are often nonstandard and differ across
 parameters. We also show that it is possible to distinguish the continuous
 part of the process from its jumps part, and even different types of jumps
 from one another. Copyright Copyright  2008 by The Econometric Society.

Title:   Nash Implementation: A Full Characterization. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 1083-99
Issue: 5
Volume: 58
Year: 1990
Month:  September 
Abstract:
  The authors extend E. Maskin's results on Nash implementation. First,
 they establish a condition that is both necessary and sufficient for Nash
 implementability if there are three or more agents (the case covered by
 Maskin's sufficiency result). Second--and more important--they examine the
 two-agent case (for which there existed no general sufficiency results).
 The two-agent model is the leading case for applications to contracting
 and bargaining. For this case, too, they establish a condition that is
 both necessary and sufficient. The authors use their theorems to derive
 simpler sufficiency conditions that are applicable in a wide variety of
 economic environments.   Copyright 1990 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Nonparametric Identification under Discrete Variation 
Abstract:
				 This paper provides weak conditions under
 which there is nonparametric interval identification of local features of
 a structural function that depends on a discrete endogenous variable and
 is nonseparable in latent variates. The function delivers values of a
 discrete or continuous outcome and instruments may be discrete valued.
 Application of the analog principle leads to quantile regression based
 interval estimators of values and partial differences of structural
 functions. The results are used to investigate the nonparametric
 identifying power of the quarter-of-birth instruments used in Angrist and
 Krueger's 1991 study of the returns to schooling. Copyright The Econometric Society 2005.

Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 239-70
Issue: 2
Volume: 60
Year: 1992
Month:  March 
Abstract:
  The author shows that it is possible to identify binary threshold
 crossing models and binary choice models without imposing any parametric
 structure either on the systematic function of observable exogenous
 variables or on the distribution of the random term. This identification
 result is employed to develop a fully nonparametric maximum likelihood
 estimator for both the function of observable exogenous variables and the
 distribution of the random term. The estimator is shown to be strongly
 consistent and a two step procedure for its calculation is developed. The
 paper also includes examples of economic models that satisfy the
 conditions necessary to apply the results.   Copyright 1992 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Directed Search for Equilibrium Wage-Tenure Contracts 
Abstract:
				 I construct a theoretical framework in
 which firms offer wage-tenure contracts to direct the search by
 risk-averse workers. All workers can search, on or off the job. I
 characterize an equilibrium and prove its existence. The equilibrium
 generates a nondegenerate, continuous distribution of employed workers
 over the values of contracts, despite that all matches are identical and
 workers observe all offers. A striking property is that the equilibrium is
 block recursive; that is, individuals' optimal decisions and optimal
 contracts are independent of the distribution of workers. This property
 makes the equilibrium analysis tractable. Consistent with stylized facts,
 the equilibrium predicts that (i) wages increase with tenure, (ii)
 job-to-job transitions decrease with tenure and wages, and (iii) wage
 mobility is limited in the sense that the lower the worker's wage, the
 lower the future wage a worker will move to in the next job transition.
 Moreover, block recursivity implies that changes in the unemployment
 benefit and the minimum wage have no effect on an employed worker's
 job-to-job transitions and contracts. Copyright  2009 The Econometric Society.

Title:   Dynamic Choices of Hyperbolic Consumers. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 935-57
Issue: 4
Volume: 69
Year: 2001
Month:  July 
Abstract:
  Laboratory and field studies of time preference find that discount rates
 are much greater in the short-run than in the long-run. Hyperbolic
 discount functions capture this property. This paper solves the decision
 problem of a hyperbolic consumer who faces stochastic income and a
 borrowing constraint. The paper uses the bounded variation calculus to
 derive the Hyperbolic Euler Relation, a natural generalization of the
 standard Exponential Euler Relation. The Hyperbolic Euler Relation implies
 that consumers act as if they have endogenous rates of time preference
 that rise and fall with the future marginal propensity to consume (e.g.,
 discount rates that endogenously range from 5% to 41% for the example
 discussed in the paper).

Title:   Prediction, Optimization, and Learning in Repeated Games
Abstract: This paper shows that, in many infinitely repeated games, if players
	optimize with respect to beliefs that satisfy a diversity condition termed
	neutrality, then each player will choose a strategy that his opponent was
	certain would not be played.  This is an obstacle to formulation of a
	learning theory in which Nash equilibrium behavior is a necessary long-run
	consequence of optimization by cautious players.

Title:   A General Approach to the Limiting Distribution for Estimators in Time Series Regression with Nonstable Autoregressive Errors. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 145-63
Issue: 1
Volume: 58
Year: 1990
Month:  January 
Abstract:
  The authors consider the time series regression model where the error
 term follows a nonstable autoregressive process and present a general
 approach for delivering the limiting distribution of a normalized
 estimator for the autoregressive parameter. The present approach is quite
 straightforward and leads them to an accurate evaluation of the
 distribution function, unlike the other approaches suggested in the
 literature. The authors' methodology is illustrated and percent points are
 tabulated. The present approach produces a good approximation method for
 the finite sample distribution and also provides an accurate evaluation of
 the limiting powers of some unit root tests under a sequence of local
 alternatives.	 Copyright 1990 by The Econometric Society.

Title:   Reputation and Equilibrium Characterization in Repeated Games with Conflicting Interests. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 325-51
Issue: 2
Volume: 61
Year: 1993
Month:  March 
Abstract:
  A two-person game is of conflicting interests if the strategy to which
 player one would most like to commit herself holds player two down to his
 minimax payoff. Suppose there is a positive prior probability that player
 one is a "commitme nt type" who will always play this strategy. Then
 player one will get a t least her commitment payoff in any Nash
 equilibrium of the repeated game if her discount factor approaches one.
 This result is robust against further perturbations of the informational
 structure and in striking contrast to the message of the Folk theorem for
 games with incomplete information.   Copyright 1993 by The Econometric Society.

Title:   Consistent Testing for Serial Correlation of Unknown Form. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 837-64
Issue: 4
Volume: 64
Year: 1996
Month:  July 
Abstract:
  This paper proposes three classes of consistent tests for serial
 correlation of the residuals from a linear dynamic regression model. The
 tests are obtained by comparing a kernel-based spectral density estimator
 and the null spectral density using three divergence measures. The null
 normal distributions are invariant whether the regressors include lagged
 dependent variables. Both asymptotic local and global power properties are
 investigated. G. Box and D. Pierce's (1970) test can be viewed as a test
 based on the truncated kernel; many other kernels deliver better power
 than Box and Pierce's test. A simulation study shows that the new tests
 have good power against weak and strong dependence.   Copyright 1996 by The Econometric Society.

Title:   A Probabilistic Model of Learning in Games. 
Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 1375-93
Issue: 6
Volume: 64
Year: 1996
Month:  November 
Abstract:
  This paper presents a new, probabilistic model of learning in games. The
 model is set in the usual repeated game framework but the two key
 assumptions are framed in terms of the likelihood of beliefs and actions
 conditional on the history of play. The first assumption formalizes the
 basic intuition of the learning approach; the second, the indeterminacy
 that inspired resort to learning models in the first place. Together the
 assumptions imply that, almost surely, play will remain almost always
 within one of the stage game's 'minimal inclusive sets.' In important
 classes of games, all such sets are singleton Nash.   Copyright 1996 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Experientia Docet: Professionals Play Minimax in Laboratory Experiments 
Abstract:
				 We study how professional players and
 college students play zero-sum two-person strategic games in a laboratory
 setting. We first ask professionals to play a 2 &times; 2 game that is
 formally identical to a strategic interaction situation that they face in
 their natural environment. Consistent with their behavior in the field,
 they play very close to the equilibrium of the game. In particular, (i)
 they equate their strategies' payoffs to the equilibrium ones and (ii)
 they generate sequences of choices that are serially independent. In sharp
 contrast, however, we find that college students play the game far from
 the equilibrium predictions. We then study the behavior of professional
 players and college students in the classic O'Neill 4 &times; 4 zero-sum
 game, a game that none of the subjects has encountered previously, and
 find the same differences in the behavior of these two pools of subjects.
 The transfer of skills and experience from the familiar field to the
 unfamiliar laboratory observed for professional players is relevant to
 evaluate the circumstances under which behavior in a laboratory setting
 may be a reliable indicator of behavior in a naturally occurring setting.
 From a cognitive perspective, it is useful for research on recognition
 processes, intuition, and similarity as a basis for inductive reasoning. Copyright The Econometric Society 2008.

Title: Aggregation and Optimization with State-Dependent Pricing: A Comment 
Abstract:
				 A key argument in Caplin and Leahy (1997)
 states that the correlation between monetary shocks and output is falling
 in the variance of the money supply. We demonstrate that this conclusion
 depends on solving for the correlation in the nonstationary state of the
 model. In the stationary state, that correlation is initially rising. Copyright The Econometric Society 2006.

Title: Aggregating Infinite Utility Streams with InterGenerational Equity: The Impossibility of Being Paretian 
Abstract:
				 It has been known that, in aggregating
 infinite utility streams, there does not exist any social welfare
 function, which satisfies the axioms of Pareto, intergenerational equity,
 and continuity. We show that the impossibility result persists even
 without imposing the continuity axiom, and in frameworks allowing for more
 general domains of utilities than those used in the existing literature. Copyright The Econometric Society 2003.

Journal: Econometrica
Pages: 275-306
Issue: 2
Volume: 57
Year: 1989
Month:  March 
Abstract:
  The concept of economic reform is described as a planned shift from one
 Pareto inefficient, but quasi-stable, Nash equilibrium (or "trap") to a
 new Pareto superior equilibrium, which will also be stable. The concept is
 applied to recent "shock" stabilization programs, with special reference
 to Israel, where the economy was credibly shifted from a three-digit
 inflationary process, with considerable inertia, to relative price
 stability with higher real growth, at only moderate adjustment costs, by
 means of a "heterodox" plan. The idea is rationalized with a simple dual
 equilibrium inflation model, for which some econometric estimates are also
 given.  Copyright 1989 by The Econometric Society.

Title: Promises and Partnership 
Abstract:
				 We examine experimentally the impact of
 communication on trust and cooperation. Our design admits observation of
 promises, lies, and beliefs. The evidence is consistent with people
 striving to live up to others' expectations so as to avoid guilt, as can
 be modeled using psychological game theory. When players exhibit such
 guilt aversion, communication may influence motivation and behavior by
 influencing beliefs about beliefs. Promises may enhance trustworthy
 behavior, which is what we observe. We argue that guilt aversion may be
 relevant for understanding strategic interaction in a variety of settings,
 and that it may shed light on the role of language, discussions,
 agreements, and social norms in these contexts.			     Copyright The Econometric Society 2006.

Issue: 4
Volume: 61
Year: 1993
Month:  July 
Abstract:
  Methods for nonlinear impulse response analysis are introduced. The
 methods are based on conditional moment profiles defined for a stationary
 time series. Comparing conditional moment profiles to baseline profiles is
 the nonlinear analog of conventional impulse-response analysis. The
 bootstrap may be used for statistical inference. Profile bundles may be
 examined for evidence of damping or persistence. Application to bivariate
 NYSE price and volume series from 1928 to 1987 finds evidence of a heavily
 damped 'leverage effect' and a differential response of trading volume to
 'common-knowledge' price shocks.   Copyright 1993 by The Econometric Society.
