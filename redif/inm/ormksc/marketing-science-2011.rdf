Title: Modeling Multivariate Distributions Using Copulas: Applications in Marketing
Abstract: In this research we introduce a new class of multivariate probability models to the marketing literature. Known as "copula models," they have a number of attractive features. First, they permit the combination of any univariate marginal distributions that need not come from the same distributional family. Second, a particular class of copula models, called "elliptical copula," has the property that they increase in complexity at a much slower rate than existing multivariate probability models as the number of dimensions increase. Third, they are very general, encompassing a number of existing multivariate models and providing a framework for generating many more. These advantages give copula models a greater potential for use in empirical analysis than existing probability models used in marketing. We exploit and extend recent developments in Bayesian estimation to propose an approach that allows reliable estimation of elliptical copula models in high dimensions. Rather than focusing on a single marketing problem, we demonstrate the versatility and accuracy of copula models with four examples to show the flexibility of the method. In every case, the copula model either handles a situation that could not be modeled previously or gives improved accuracy compared with prior models.

Title: Rejoinder--Estimation Issues for Copulas Applied to Marketing Data
Abstract: Estimating copula models using Bayesian methods presents some subtle challenges, ranging from specification of the prior to computational tractability. There is also some debate about what is the most appropriate copula to employ from those available. We address these issues here and conclude by discussing further applications of copula models in marketing.

Title: Internet Channel Entry: A Strategic Analysis of Mixed Channel Structures
Abstract: By analyzing various alternative mixed channel structures composed of a monopoly manufacturer and online and offline outlets, we investigate how the specific channel structure and varying market conditions moderate the impact of Internet channel entry on the channel members and consumers. As an extension of Balasubramanian's model [Balasubramanian, S. 1998. Mail versus mall: A strategic analysis of competition between direct marketers and conventional retailers. Marketing Sci. 17(3) 181-195], our game-theoretic model captures the fundamental difference between two different channel types and consumer heterogeneity in preference for the Internet channel use. The equilibrium solutions indicate that Internet channel entry does not always lead to lower retail prices and enhanced consumer welfare. We also find that an independent retailer might become worse off after adding its own Internet outlet under certain market conditions. We find that the impact of the Internet channel introduction substantially varies across channel structures and market environments. We explain these varied results by proposing a framework of five key strategic forces that shape the overall impact of the Internet channel introduction.

Title: "Bricks and Clicks": The Impact of Product Returns on the Strategies of Multichannel Retailers
Abstract: The Internet has increased the flexibility of retailers, allowing them to operate an online arm in addition to their physical stores. The online channel offers potential benefits in selling to customer segments that value the convenience of online shopping, but it also raises new challenges. These include the higher likelihood of costly product returns when customers' ability to "touch and feel" products is important in determining fit. We study competing retailers that can operate dual channels ("bricks and clicks") and examine how pricing strategies and physical store assistance levels change as a result of the additional Internet outlet. A central result we obtain is that when differentiation among competing retailers is not too high, having an online channel can actually increase investment in store assistance levels (e.g., greater shelf display, more-qualified sales staff, floor samples) and decrease profits. Consequently, when the decision to open an Internet channel is endogenized, there can exist an asymmetric equilibrium where only one retailer elects to operate an online arm but earns lower profits than its bricks-only rival. We also characterize equilibria where firms open an online channel, even though consumers only use it for research and learning purposes but buy in stores. A number of extensions are discussed, including retail settings where firms carry multiple product categories, shipping and handling costs, and the role of store assistance in impacting consumer perceived benefits.

Title: Identifying Unmet Demand
Abstract: Brand preferences and marketplace demand are a reflection of the importance of underlying needs of consumers and the efficacy of product attributes for delivering value. Dog owners, for example, may look to dog foods to provide specific benefits for their pets (e.g., shiny coats) that may not be available from current offerings. An analysis of consumer wants for these consumers would reveal weak demand for product attributes resulting from low efficacy, despite the presence of strong latent interest. The challenge in identifying such unmet demand is in distinguishing it from other reasons for weak preference, such as general noninterest in the category and heterogeneous tastes. We propose a model for separating out these effects within the context of conjoint analysis, and we demonstrate its value with data from a national survey of toothpaste preferences. Implications for product development and reformulation are explored.

Title: The Effect of Media Advertising on Brand Consideration and Choice
Abstract: The nature of the effect of media advertising on brand choice is investigated in two product categories in analyses that combine household scanner panel data with media exposure information. Alternative model specifications are tested in which advertising is assumed to directly affect brand utility, model error variance, and brand consideration. We find strong support for advertising effects on choice through an indirect route of consideration set formation that does not directly affect brand utility. Implications for media buying and advertising effects are explored.

Title: Brands: The Opiate of the Nonreligious Masses?
Abstract: Are brands the "new religion"? Practitioners and scholars have been intrigued by the possibility, but strong theory and empirical evidence supporting the existence of a relationship between brands and religion is scarce. In what follows, we argue and demonstrate that religiosity is indeed related to "brand reliance," i.e., the degree to which consumers prefer branded goods over unbranded goods or goods without a well-known national brand. We theorize that brands and religiosity may serve as substitutes for one another because both allow individuals to express their feelings of self-worth. We provide support for this substitution hypothesis with U.S. state-level data (field study) as well as individual-level data where religiosity is experimentally primed (study 1) or measured as a chronic individual difference (study 2). Importantly, studies 1 and 2 demonstrate that the relationship between religiosity and brand reliance only exists in product categories in which brands enable consumers to express themselves (e.g., clothes). Moreover, studies 3 and 4 demonstrate that the expression of self-worth is an important factor underlying the negative relationship.

Title: The Design of Durable Goods
Abstract: The use of a durable good is limited by both its physical life and usable life. For example, an electric-car battery can last for five years (physical life) or 100,000 miles (usable life), whichever comes first. We propose a framework for examining how a profit-maximizing firm might choose the usable life, physical life, and selling price of a durable good. The proposed framework considers differences in usage rates and product valuations by consumers and allows for the effects of technological constraints and product obsolescence on a product's usable and physical lives. Our main result characterizes a relationship between optimal price, cost elasticities, and opportunity costs associated with relaxing upper bounds on usable and physical lives. We describe conditions under which either usable life or physical life, or both, obtains its maximum possible values; examine why a firm might devote effort to relaxing nonbinding constraints on usable life or physical life; consider when price cuts might be accompanied with product improvements; and examine how a firm might be able to cross-subsidize product improvements.

Title: Bayesian Analysis of Hierarchical Effects
Abstract: The idea of hierarchical, sequential, or intermediate effects has long been posited in textbooks and academic literature. Hierarchical effects occur when relationships among variables are mediated through other variables. Challenges in studying hierarchical effects in marketing include the large number of items present in most commercial studies and the presence of heterogeneous relationships among the variables. Existing approaches have dealt with the large number of variables by employing a factor structure representation of the data and have used standard mixture distributions for representing different response segments. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian model for the analysis of hierarchical data using the actual response items and incorporating heterogeneity that better reflects consumer stages in a decision process. Cross-sectional data from a national brand-tracking study are used to illustrate our model, where we find empirical support for a hierarchical relationship among media recall, brand beliefs, and intended actions. We find these effects to be insignificant when measured with standard models and aggregate analyses. The proposed model is useful for understanding the influence of variables that lead to intermediate as opposed to direct effects on brand choice.

Title: Cross-Market Discounts
Abstract: Firms in several markets attract consumers by offering discounts in other unrelated markets. This promotion strategy, which we call "cross-market discounts," has been successfully adopted in the last few years by many grocery retailers in partnership with gasoline retailers across North America, Europe, and Australia. In this paper, we use an analytical model to investigate the major forces driving the profitability of this novel promotion strategy. We consider a generalized scenario in which purchases in a source market lead to price discounts redeemable in a target market. Our analysis shows that this strategy can be a revenue driver by simultaneously increasing prices as well as sales in the source market, even though we assume the demand curve to be downward sloping in price. Moreover, it distributes additional consumption (motivated by the discount) in two markets, and under diminishing marginal returns from consumption, this can simultaneously increase firm profits and consumer welfare more effectively than traditional nonlinear pricing strategies. Our study provides many other interesting insights as well, and our key results are in accordance with anecdotal evidence obtained from managers and industry publications.

Title: Preview Provision Under Competition
Abstract: In certain categories, an important element of competition is the use of previews to signal information to potential consumers about product attributes. For example, the front page of a newspaper provides a preview to potential newspaper buyers before they purchase the product. In this context, a news provider can provide previews that are highly informative about the content of the news product. Conversely, a news provider can utilize a preview that is relatively uninformative. We examine the incentives that firms have to adopt different preview strategies in a context where they do not have complete control of product positioning. Our analysis shows that preview strategy can be a useful source of differentiation. However, when a firm adopts a strategy of providing informative previews, it confers a positive externality on a competitor that utilizes uninformative previews. This reinforces the incentive of the competitor to use uninformative previews and explains why the market landscape in news provision is often characterized by asymmetric competition.

Title: The Perils of Behavior-Based Personalization
Abstract: "Behavior-based personalization" has gained popularity in recent years, whereby businesses offer personalized products based on consumers' purchase histories. This paper highlights two perils of behavior-based personalization in competitive markets. First, although purchase histories reveal consumer preferences, competitive exploitation of such information damages differentiation, similar to the classic finding that behavior-based price discrimination intensifies price competition. With endogenous product design, there is yet a second peril. It emerges when forward-looking firms try to avoid the first peril by suppressing the information value of purchase histories. Ideally, if a market leader serves all consumers on day 1, purchase histories contain no information about consumer preferences. However, knowing that their rivals are willing to accommodate a market leader, firms are more likely to offer a mainstream design at day 1, which jeopardizes differentiation. Based on this understanding, I investigate how the perils of behavior-based personalization change under alternative market conditions, such as firms' better knowledge about their own customers, consumer loyalty and inertia, consumer self-selection, and the need for classic designs.

Title: Opinion Leadership and Social Contagion in New Product Diffusion
Abstract: We study how opinion leadership and social contagion within social networks affect the adoption of a new product. In contrast to earlier studies, we find evidence of contagion operating over network ties, even after controlling for marketing effort and arbitrary systemwide changes. More importantly, we also find that the amount of contagion is moderated by both the recipients' perception of their opinion leadership and the sources' volume of product usage. The other key finding is that sociometric and self-reported measures of leadership are weakly correlated and associated with different kinds of adoption-related behaviors, which suggests that they probably capture different constructs. We discuss the implications of these novel findings for diffusion theory and research and for marketing practice.

Title: Rejoinder--Further Reflections on Studying Social Influence in New Product Diffusion
Abstract: Building on the commentaries on our work, we make additional suggestions for future research on social contagion and new product diffusion. In particular, we note that social contagion may occur for many reasons and that investigating how various personal or group characteristics moderate the amount of influence some customers exert or the extent to which others are sensitive to potential influence can provide insights into the social mechanism(s) at work.

Title: Tricked by Truncation: Spurious Duration Dependence and Social Contagion in Hazard Models
Abstract: We show both analytically and through Monte Carlo simulations that applying standard hazard models to right-truncated data, i.e., data from which all right-censored observations are omitted, induces spurious positive duration dependence and hence can trick researchers into believing to have found evidence of social contagion when there is none. Truncation also tends to deflate the effect of time-invariant covariates. These results imply that not accounting for right truncation can lead managers to rely too much on word of mouth in generating new product adoption and to poorly identify the customers most likely to adopt early. Not accounting for right truncation can also lead to suboptimal pricing decisions and to erroneous assessments of variations in customer lifetime value. We assess the effectiveness of four possible solutions to the problem and find that only using an analytically corrected likelihood function protects one against truncation artifacts inflating coefficients of contagion and attenuating coefficients of time-invariant covariates.

Title: Hybrid Advertising Auctions
Abstract: Facebook and Google offer hybrid advertising auctions that allow advertisers to bid on a per-impression or a per-click basis for the same advertising space. This paper studies the properties of equilibrium and considers how to increase efficiency in this new auction format. Rational expectations require the publisher to consider past bid types to prevent revenue losses to strategic advertiser behavior. The equilibrium results contradict publisher statements and suggest that, conditional on setting rational expectations, publishers should consider offering multiple bid types to advertisers. For a special case of the model, we provide a payment scheme that achieves the socially optimal allocation of advertisers to slots and maximizes publisher revenues within the class of socially optimal payment schemes. When this special case does not hold, no payment scheme will always achieve the social optimum.

Title: The Evolution of Internal Market Structure
Abstract: We present a dynamic factor-analytic choice model to capture evolution of brand positions in latent attribute space. Our dynamic model allows researchers to investigate brand positioning in new categories or mature categories affected by structural change such as entry. We argue that even for mature categories not affected by structural change, the assumption of stable attributes may be untenable. We allow for evolution in attributes by modeling individual-level time-specific attributes as arising from dynamic means. The dynamic attribute means are modeled as a Bayesian dynamic linear model (DLM). The DLM is nested within a factor-analytic choice model. Our approach makes efficient use of the data by leveraging estimates from previous and future periods to estimate current period attributes. We demonstrate the robustness of our model with data that simulate a variety of dynamic scenarios, including stationary behavior. We show that misspecified attribute dynamics induce temporal heteroskedasticty and correlation between the preference weights and the error term. Applying the model to a panel data set on household purchases in the malt beverage category, we find considerable evidence for dynamics in the latent brand attributes. From a managerial perspective, we find advertising expenditures help explain variation in the dynamic attribute means.

Title: Profitability of the Name-Your-Own-Price Channel in the Case of Risk-Averse Buyers
Abstract: In this paper, I study profitability of the name-your-own-price channel (NYOP) in the presence of risk-averse buyers. First, I provide conditions that guarantee that for the monopolistic seller the NYOP is more profitable than the posted price. Second, I consider a more competitive framework where buyers with rejected bids have access to an alternative option. I show that if under the posted-price scenario there are unserved customers with low valuations, then NYOP is more profitable than the posted price. Finally, I study whether adding the posted-price option to the NYOP will further increase the seller's profit and show that for the decreasing absolute risk-aversion utility and a monopolistic seller it does not. In the presence of an alternative option, the answer depends on whether buyers consider the posted-price option and the alternative option to be close substitutes or not. Adding the posted-price option will increase the profit in the former case and will not in the latter.

Title: Predictably Non-Bayesian: Quantifying Salience Effects in Physician Learning About Drug Quality
Abstract: Experimental and survey-based research suggests that consumers often rely on their intuition and cognitive shortcuts to make decisions. Intuition and cognitive shortcuts can lead to suboptimal decisions and, especially in high-stakes decisions, to legitimate welfare concerns. In this paper, we propose an extension of a Bayesian learning model that allows us to quantify the impact of salience--the fact that some pieces of information are easier to retrieve from memory than others--on physician learning. We show, using data on actual prescriptions for real patients, that physicians' belief formation is strongly influenced by salience effects. Feedback from switching patients--the ones the physician decided to switch to a clinically equivalent treatment--receives considerably more weight than feedback from other patients. In the category we study, salience effects slowed down physicians' speed of learning and the adoption of a new treatment, which raises welfare concerns. For managers, our findings suggest that firms that are able to eliminate, or at least reduce, salience effects to a greater extent than their competitors can speed up the adoption of new treatments. We explore the implications of these results and suggest alternative applications of our model that are relevant for policy makers and managers.

Title: Efficient Choice Designs for a Consider-Then-Choose Model
Abstract: Existing research on choice designs focuses exclusively on compensatory models that assume that all available alternatives are considered in the choice process. In this paper, we develop a method to construct efficient designs for a two-stage, consider-then-choose model that involves a noncompensatory screening process at the first stage and a compensatory choice process at the second stage. The method applies to both conjunctive and disjunctive screening rules. Under certain conditions, the method also applies to the subset conjunctive and disjunctions of conjunctions screening rules. Based on the local design criterion, we conduct a comparative study of compensatory and conjunctive designs--the former are optimized for a compensatory model and the latter for a two-stage model that uses conjunctive screening in its first stage. We find that conjunctive designs have higher level overlap than compensatory designs. This occurs because level overlap helps pinpoint screening behavior. Higher overlap of conjunctive designs is also accompanied by lower orthogonality, less level balance, and more utility balance. We find that compensatory designs have a significant loss of design efficiency when the true model involves conjunctive screening at the consideration stage. These designs also have much less power than conjunctive designs in identifying a true consider-then-choose process with conjunctive screening. In contrast, when the true model is compensatory, the efficiency loss from using a conjunctive design is lower. Also, conjunctive designs have about the same power as compensatory designs in identifying a true compensatory choice process. Our findings make a strong case for the use of conjunctive designs when there is prior evidence to support respondent screening.

Title: Demystifying Disruption: A New Model for Understanding and Predicting Disruptive Technologies
Abstract: The failure of firms in the face of technological change has been a topic of intense research and debate, spawning the theory (among others) of disruptive technologies. However, the theory suffers from circular definitions, inadequate empirical evidence, and lack of a predictive model. We develop a new schema to address these limitations. The schema generates seven hypotheses and a testable model relating to platform technologies. We test this model and hypotheses with data on 36 technologies from seven markets. Contrary to extant theory, technologies that adopt a lower attack ("potentially disruptive technologies") (1) are introduced as frequently by incumbents as by entrants, (2) are not cheaper than older technologies, and (3) rarely disrupt firms; and (4) both entrants and lower attacks significantly reduce the hazard of disruption. Moreover, technology disruption is not permanent because of multiple crossings in technology performance and numerous rival technologies coexisting without one disrupting the other. The proposed predictive model of disruption shows good out-of-sample predictive accuracy. We discuss the implications of these findings.

Title: Stuck in the Adoption Funnel: The Effect of Interruptions in the Adoption Process on Usage
Abstract: Many firms have introduced Internet-based customer self-service applications such as online payments or brokerage services. Despite high initial sign-up rates, not all customers actually shift their dealings online. We investigate whether the multistage nature of the adoption process (an "adoption funnel") for such technologies can explain this low take-up. We use exogenous variation in events that possibly interrupt adoption, in the form of vacations and public holidays in different German states, to identify the effect on regular usage of being interrupted earlier in the adoption process. We find that interruptions in the early stages of the adoption process reduce a customer's probability of using the technology regularly. Our results suggest significant cost-saving opportunities from eliminating interruptions in the adoption funnel.

Title: How Peer Influence Affects Attribute Preferences: A Bayesian Updating Mechanism
Abstract: We study how multiattribute product choices are affected by peer influence. We propose a two-stage conjoint-based approach to examine three behavioral mechanisms of peer influence. We find that when faced with information on peer choices, consumers update their attribute preferences in a Bayesian manner. This suggests that greater uncertainty in the attribute preferences of a focal consumer and lesser uncertainty in preferences of peers both lead to greater preference revision. Greater number of peers is associated with greater preference revision, although the extent of preference revision diminishes with increasing number of peers. Furthermore, to address the significant time and costs associated with collecting sociometric data, we estimate the accuracy of predicted consumer choices when peer influence data are unavailable. Online social network membership and frequency of peer interactions provide better proxies than more common demographic similarity measures. These findings have key implications, especially for word-of-mouth marketing.

Title: Online Display Advertising: Targeting and Obtrusiveness
Abstract: We use data from a large-scale field experiment to explore what influences the effectiveness of online advertising. We find that matching an ad to website content and increasing an ad's obtrusiveness independently increase purchase intent. However, in combination, these two strategies are ineffective. Ads that match both website content and are obtrusive do worse at increasing purchase intent than ads that do only one or the other. This failure appears to be related to privacy concerns: the negative effect of combining targeting with obtrusiveness is strongest for people who refuse to give their income and for categories where privacy matters most. Our results suggest a possible explanation for the growing bifurcation in Internet advertising between highly targeted plain text ads and more visually striking but less targeted ads.

Title: Commentary--When Is Less More, and How Much More? Thoughts on the Psychological and Economic Implications of Online Targeting and Obtrusiveness
Abstract: In a very intriguing and groundbreaking study, Goldfarb and Tucker [Goldfarb, A., C. Tucker. 2011. Online display advertising: Targeting and obtrusiveness. Marketing Sci. 30(3) 389-404] show that online advertising targeting and obtrusiveness boost purchase intent independently, but not jointly. The authors rule out recall as an explanatory mechanism and provide preliminary evidence that the effect may be driven by privacy concerns. We comment on the substantive importance of this finding by discussing the psychological and economic implications of the effect.

Title: Commentary--Discussion of "Online Display Advertising: Targeting and Obtrusiveness" by Avi Goldfarb and Catherine Tucker
Abstract: In "Online Display Advertising: Targeting and Obtrusiveness," Avi Goldfarb and Catherine Tucker present an empirical investigation and discussion of consumers' reactions to obtrusive and targeted Internet advertisements. They find, among other things, that obtrusive advertisements when combined with targeting tend to generate no greater effectiveness in consumer response than either method used alone. Perhaps one of the most interesting findings in their results involves the authors' focus on privacy salience and its connection to advertisement presentation. This brief discussion of their work (1) highlights the importance of further research in line with the well-crafted privacy preference inquiries of Goldfarb and Tucker's study and (2) complements the authors' discussion regarding possible public policy implications with a legal discussion elaborating on existing legal grounds for liability and restrictions on advertising consumers perceive as privacy invasive.

Title: Rejoinder--Implications of "Online Display Advertising: Targeting and Obtrusiveness"
Abstract: The commentaries on our work suggest several broader implications of our findings as well as a concern that we understate the size of the effect. In this rejoinder, we discuss our views on the regulatory implications, the implications for firm strategies, and the implications for our understanding of the underlying behavioral processes. We also acknowledge that our original calculation of $464 million in cost savings for industry is conservative. We conclude with a call for "privacy engineering" research that combines computer science tools with an understanding of consumer behavior and economics to improve marketing and economic outcomes while safeguarding consumer privacy.

Title: Gut Liking for the Ordinary: Incorporating Design Fluency Improves Automobile Sales Forecasts
Abstract: Automotive sales forecasts traditionally focus on predictors such as advertising, brand preference, life cycle position, retail price, and technological sophistication. The quality of the cars' design is, however, an often-neglected variable in such models. We show that incorporating objective measures of design prototypicality and design complexity in sales forecasting models improves their prediction by up to 19%. To this end, we professionally photographed the frontal designs of 28 popular models, morphed the images, and created objective prototypicality (car-to-morph Euclidian proximity) and complexity (size of a compressed image file) scores for each car. Results show that prototypical but complex car designs feel surprisingly fluent to process, and that this form of surprising fluency evokes positive gut reactions that become associated with the design and positively impact car sales. It is important to note that the effect holds for both economy (functionality oriented) and premium (identity oriented) cars, as well as when the above-mentioned traditional forecasting variables are considered. These findings are counter to a common intuition that consumers like unusual-complex designs that reflect their individuality or prototypical-simple designs that are functional.

Title: The Seeds of Negativity: Knowledge and Money
Abstract: This paper studies the tendency to use negative ads. For this purpose, we focus on an interesting industry (political campaigns) and an intriguing empirical regularity (the tendency to "go negative" is higher in close races). We present a model of electoral competition in which ads inform voters either of the good traits of the candidate or of the bad traits of his opponent. We find that in equilibrium, the proportion of negative ads depends on both voters' knowledge and the candidate's budget. Furthermore, for an interesting subset of the parameter space, negativity increases in both knowledge and budget. Using data on the elections for the U.S. House of Representative in 2000, 2002, and 2004, we examine the model and its implications. Using nonstructural estimation, we find that negativity indeed increases in both voters' knowledge and the candidate's budget. Furthermore, we also find that knowledge and budget mediate the effect of closeness on negativity. Using structural estimation, we reinforce these findings. Specifically, we find that the model's parameters are within the subset of the parameter space discussed above. Thus, the evidence implies that the model is not only helpful in identifying variables that were ignored by previous studies (i.e., knowledge and budget) but also in explaining an intriguing empirical regularity.

Title: A Dynamic Model of Sponsored Search Advertising
Abstract: Sponsored search advertising is ascendant--Forrester Research reports expenditures rose 28% in 2007 to $8.1 billion and will continue to rise at a 26% compound annual growth rate [VanBoskirk, S. 2007. U.S. interactive marketing forecast, 2007 to 2012. Forrester Research (October 10)], approaching half the level of television advertising and making sponsored search one of the major advertising trends to affect the marketing landscape. Yet little empirical research exists to explore how the interaction of various agents (searchers, advertisers, and the search engine) in keyword markets affects consumer welfare and firm profits. The dynamic structural model we propose serves as a foundation to explore these outcomes. We fit this model to a proprietary data set provided by an anonymous search engine. These data include consumer search and clicking behavior, advertiser bidding behavior, and search engine information such as keyword pricing and website design. With respect to advertisers, we find evidence of dynamic bidding behavior. Advertiser value for clicks on their links averages about 26 cents. Given the typical $22 retail price of the software products advertised on the considered search engine, this implies a conversion rate (sales per click) of about 1.2%, well within common estimates of 1%-2% [Narcisse, E. 2007. Magid: Casual free to pay conversion rate too low. GameDaily.com (September 20)]. With respect to consumers, we find that frequent clickers place a greater emphasis on the position of the sponsored advertising link. We further find that about 10% of consumers do 90% of the clicks. We then conduct several policy simulations to illustrate the effects of changes in search engine policy. First, we find the search engine obtains revenue gains of 1% by sharing individual-level information with advertisers and enabling them to vary their bids by consumer segment. This also improves advertiser revenue by 6% and consumer welfare by 1.6%. Second, we find that a switch from a first- to second-price auction results in truth telling (advertiser bids rise to advertiser valuations). However, the second-price auction has little impact on search engine profits. Third, consumer search tools lead to a platform revenue increase of 2.9% and an increase of consumer welfare by 3.8%. However, these tools, by reducing advertising exposures, lower advertiser profits by 2.1%.

Title: A Regime-Switching Model of Cyclical Category Buying
Abstract: In many categories consumers display cyclical buying: they repeatedly purchase in the category for several periods, followed by several periods of not buying. We believe that the cyclicality is a manifestation of cross-category substitution by the consumer, caused by "variety-seeking" tendencies as well as by the firm's marketing activities in all relevant categories. We propose a Markov regime-switching random coefficient logit model to represent these behaviors as stochastic switching between high and low category purchase tendencies. The main feature of the proposed model is that it divides the stream of purchase decisions of a consumer into distinct regimes with different parameter values that characterize high versus low purchase tendencies. In an empirical application of the model to purchases of yogurt-buying households, we find that as many as 38.3% households display cyclicality between high and low yogurt-purchasing tendencies. Predictions from our proposed model track observed yogurt purchases of households over time closely, and the model also fits better than two benchmark models. Alternating between high and low purchase tendencies may correspond with changing levels of consumer inventory in a substitute category. If one ignores this phenomenon, a correlation between yogurt inventory and the error term in utility arises, leading to biased estimates. Also, we show that cyclicality in buying has a key implication for a firm's price promotion strategies: a price reduction that is offered to a household during its high purchasing tendency period will result in greater increases in sales than one that is offered during its low purchasing period. This opens up a new dimension for enhancing the effectiveness of promotions--customized timing of price reductions.

Title: Multiple-Constraint Choice Models with Corner and Interior Solutions
Abstract: A choice model based on direct utility maximization subject to an arbitrary number of constraints is developed and applied to conjoint data. The model can accommodate both corner and interior solutions, and it provides insights into the proportion of respondents bound by each constraint. Application to volumetric choice data reveals that the majority of respondents make choices consistent with price and quantity restrictions. Estimates based on a single monetary-constraint choice model are shown to lead to biased estimates of the monetary value of attribute levels.

Title: Crisis and Consumption Smoothing
Abstract: The dramatic impact of the current crisis on performance of businesses across sectors and economies has been headlining the business press for the past several months. Extant reconciliations of these patterns in the popular press rely on ad hoc reasoning. Using historical data on currency crisis episodes across the world, we show that the impact of the crisis on a firm's business is best understood by focusing on the impact of the crisis on the behavior of consumers. Our analyses show that consumer behavior in a crisis is characterized by consumption smoothing at various levels--intertemporal, intercategory, and intracategory. These behavioral adjustments result in significant reallocation of consumption expenditures. More importantly, the smoothing decisions because of a crisis are distinct and independent of the impact of changes in income and prices that accompany a crisis. Interestingly, there is marked variation in the patterns of consumption smoothing across different types of economies. Taken together, these results have important and interesting implications for managers, policy makers, and academics.

Title: Scalable Inference of Customer Similarities from Interactions Data Using Dirichlet Processes
Abstract: Under the sociological theory of homophily, people who are similar to one another are more likely to interact with one another. Marketers often have access to data on interactions among customers from which, with homophily as a guiding principle, inferences could be made about the underlying similarities. However, larger networks face a quadratic explosion in the number of potential interactions that need to be modeled. This scalability problem renders probability models of social interactions computationally infeasible for all but the smallest networks. In this paper, we develop a probabilistic framework for modeling customer interactions that is both grounded in the theory of homophily and is flexible enough to account for random variation in who interacts with whom. In particular, we present a novel Bayesian nonparametric approach, using Dirichlet processes, to moderate the scalability problems that marketing researchers encounter when working with networked data. We find that this framework is a powerful way to draw insights into latent similarities of customers, and we discuss how marketers can apply these insights to segmentation and targeting activities.

Title: Efficient Methods for Sampling Responses from Large-Scale Qualitative Data
Abstract: The World Wide Web contains a vast corpus of consumer-generated content that holds invaluable insights for improving the product and service offerings of firms. Yet the typical method for extracting diagnostic information from online content--text mining--has limitations. As a starting point, we propose analyzing a sample of comments before initiating text mining. Using a combination of real data and simulations, we demonstrate that a sampling procedure that selects respondents whose comments contain a large amount of information is superior to the two most popular sampling methods--simple random sampling and stratified random sampling---in gaining insights from the data. In addition, we derive a method that determines the probability of observing diagnostic information repeated a specific number of times in the population, which will enable managers to base sample size decisions on the trade-off between obtaining additional diagnostic information and the added expense of a larger sample. We provide an illustration of one of the methods using a real data set from a website containing qualitative comments about staying at a hotel and demonstrate how sampling qualitative comments can be a useful first step in text mining.

Title: Commentary--Reexamining Bayesian Model-Comparison Evidence of Cross-Brand Pass-Through
Abstract: Using the Bayes factor estimated by harmonic mean [Newton, M. A., A. E. Raftery. 1994. Approximate Bayesian inference by the weighted likelihood bootstrap. J. Roy. Statist. Soc. Ser. B. 56(1) 3-48] to compare models with and without cross-brand pass-through, Dubé and Gupta [Dubé, J.-P., S. Gupta. 2008. Cross-brand pass-through in supermarket pricing. Marketing Sci. 27(3) 324-333] found that, in the refrigerated orange juice category, a model with cross-brand pass-through was selected 68% of the time. However, Lenk [Lenk, P. J. 2009. Simulation pseudo-bias correction to the harmonic mean estimator of integrated likelihoods. J. Comput. Graph. Statist. 18(1) 941-960] has demonstrated that the infinite variance harmonic mean estimator often exhibits simulation pseudo-bias in favor of more complex models. We replicate the results of Dubé and Gupta in the refrigerated orange juice category and then show that any of three more stable finite variance estimators select the model with cross-brand pass-through less than 1% of the time. Relaxing the assumption that model errors are distributed normally eliminates all instances in which the cross-brand pass-through model is selected. In 10 additional categories, the harmonic-mean-estimated Bayes factor selects the model with cross-brand pass-through 69% of the time, whereas a finite variance estimator of the Bayes factor selects the model with cross-brand pass-through only 5% of the time. Applying arguments in McAlister [McAlister, L. 2007. Cross-brand pass-through: Fact or artifact? Marketing Sci. 26(6) 876-898], these 5% of cases can be attributed to capitalization on chance. We conclude that Dubé and Gupta should not be interpreted as providing evidence of cross-brand pass-through.
