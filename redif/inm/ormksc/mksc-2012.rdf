Title: <b>Practice Prize Winner</b>--Dynamic Marketing Budget Allocation Across Countries, Products, and Marketing Activities
Abstract: Previous research on marketing budget decisions has shown that profit improvement from better allocation across products or regions is much higher than from improving the overall budget. However, despite its high managerial relevance, contributions by marketing scholars are rare.</p> <p>In this paper, we introduce an innovative and feasible solution to the dynamic marketing budget allocation problem for multiproduct, multicountry firms. Specifically, our decision support model allows determining near-optimal marketing budgets at the country-product-marketing-activity level in an Excel-supported environment each year. The model accounts for marketing dynamics and a product's growth potential as well as for trade-offs with respect to marketing effectiveness and profit contribution. The model has been successfully implemented at Bayer, one the world's largest pharmaceutical and chemical firms. The profit improvement potential is more than 50% and worth nearly euro 500 million in incremental discounted cash flows.

Title: <b>Practice Prize Paper</b>--Applying a Dynamic Model of Consumer Choice to Guide Brand Development at Jetstar Airways
Abstract: This paper describes the use of a marketing science model by Jetstar, a subsidiary of Australia's leading airline, Qantas, to effectively and profitably compete in the low-cost carrier marketplace. We trace the evolution of the Jetstar strategy from a baseline calibration of its initial position, to its efforts to attain price competitiveness and service parity, followed by its highly focused, cost-effective service delivery strategy. We develop a hierarchical model with parameters estimated at the individual level. This allows us to study not only how service design and pricing initiatives shift the perceived performance of Jetstar relative to its competitors but also how the airline can move market preferences toward areas in which it has competitive advantage. The contribution of the research is substantial. The Jetstar market share went from 14.0% to 18.1% during the first five quarterly waves of the research, and profits went from $79 million in 2006-2007, before the study was commissioned, to $124 million in 2008-2009.

Title: <b>Practice Prize Paper</b>--Uncovering <i>Implicit</i> Consumer Needs for Determining <i>Explicit</i> Product Positioning: Growing Prudential Annuities' Variable Annuity Sales
Abstract: A variable annuity is a popular product for investing retirement income. However, thousands of similar-looking variable annuity products are being offered by hundreds of financial service companies. In such a scenario, how can Prudential achieve meaningful product differentiation to increase the sales of its variable annuities? The solution led to the development and implementation of the "Emotion Quotient" (EQ) Tool. The EQ Tool enabled Prudential to redefine its marketing and sales approach along a proactive (as opposed to responsive) market orientation paradigm. This was accomplished by first using the EQ Tool to uncover and quantify the prevalence of certain emotions (such as fear and regret) in the prospective consumer and then pitching relevant variable annuity product(s) that could mitigate the specific behavioral risk corresponding to the prevalent emotion(s). This approach, which was backed by extensive research (as described in this study), enabled Prudential to gain over $450 million lift in variable annuity sales and contributed to consumer welfare by promoting awareness of behavioral risk to investors who are within five years of their retirement. This research study illustrates how industry can collaborate with academia to successfully apply marketing science to solve real-world business problems.

Title: <b>Practice Prize Paper</b>--Marketing's Profit Impact: Quantifying Online and Off-line Funnel Progression
Abstract: Inofec, a small- to medium-sized enterprise in the business-to-business sector, desired a more analytic approach to allocate marketing resources across communication activities and channels. We developed a conceptual framework and econometric model to empirically investigate (1) the marketing communication effects on off-line and online purchase funnel metrics and (2) the magnitude and timing of the profit impact of firm-initiated and customer-initiated contacts. We find evidence of many cross-channel effects, in particular, off-line marketing effects on online funnel metrics and online funnel metrics on off-line purchases. Moreover, marketing communication activities directly affect both early and later purchase funnel stages (website visits, online and off-line information, and quote requests). Finally, we find that online customer-initiated contacts have substantially higher profit impact than off-line firm-initiated contacts. Shifting marketing budgets toward these activities in a field experiment yielded net profit increases 14 times larger than those for the status quo allocation.

Title: A "Position Paradox" in Sponsored Search Auctions
Abstract: We study the bidding strategies of vertically differentiated firms that bid for sponsored search advertisement positions for a keyword at a search engine. We explicitly model how consumers navigate and click on sponsored links based on their knowledge and beliefs about firm qualities. Our model yields several interesting insights; a main counterintuitive result we focus on is the "position paradox." The paradox is that a superior firm may bid lower than an inferior firm and obtain a position below it, yet it still obtains more clicks than the inferior firm. Under a pay-per-impression mechanism, the inferior firm wants to be at the top where more consumers click on its link, whereas the superior firm is better off by placing its link at a lower position because it pays a smaller advertising fee, but some consumers will still reach it in search of the higher-quality firm. Under a pay-per-click mechanism, the inferior firm has an even stronger incentive to be at the top because now it only has to pay for the consumers who do not know the firms' reputations and, therefore, can bid more aggressively. Interestingly, as the quality premium for the superior firm increases, and/or if more consumers know the identity of the superior firm, the incentive for the inferior firm to be at the top may increase. Contrary to conventional belief, we find that the search engine may have the incentive to overweight the inferior firm's bid and strategically create the position paradox to increase overall clicks by consumers. To validate our model, we analyze a data set from a popular Korean search engine firm and find that (i) a large proportion of auction outcomes in the data show the position paradox, and (ii) sharp predictions from our model are validated in the data.

Title: The Impact of Economic Contractions on the Effectiveness of R&D and Advertising: Evidence from U.S. Companies Spanning Three Decades
Abstract: The critical role of research and development (R&D) and advertising in the marketing strategy of the firm is well established. This paper conceptually and empirically examines why and how much the effectiveness of these two marketing instruments differs between times of economic expansions versus periods of economic contractions--and whether these results depend on the cyclicality of the industry in question. We consider a key marketing metric (market share) and a key financial metric (firm profit). Our empirical setting is 1,175 U.S. firms across a time period spanning over three decades. We find that R&D and advertising contribute to firm performance but that their effectiveness is not constant across the business cycle. Increasing advertising share in contractions has a stronger effect on profit and market share than increasing advertising share in expansions. Likewise, investments in R&D in contractions lead to higher gains in market share and profit than R&D investments in expansions, albeit only in subsequent years. If in contractions the firm faces tight budget constraints and has to choose between either maintaining R&D or advertising, our simulation results show that maintaining R&D is associated with better company performance. We find that advertising effectiveness, in general, and in contractions, in particular, is systematically moderated by the degree of cyclicality of the industry in which the firm operates. In relatively stable industries, advertising effects are small or even nonsignificant, and they do not go beyond the year the firm advertises. However, in highly cyclical industries, advertising effects are long-lasting, its total effect being 50% larger (market share) and 200% larger (profits) than in industries of average cyclicality. The effect of industry cyclicality on advertising effectiveness is especially pronounced in contractions. Collectively, these findings provide valuable and actionable insights into how firms should respond to contractions in order to grow profits and market share.

Title: Modeling Indirect Effects of Paid Search Advertising: Which Keywords Lead to More Future Visits?
Abstract: Many online shoppers initially acquired through paid search advertising later return to the same website directly. These so-called "direct type-in" visits can be an important indirect effect of paid search. Because visitors come to sites via different keywords and can vary in their propensity to make return visits, traffic at the keyword level is likely to be heterogeneous with respect to how much direct type-in visitation is generated.</p> <p>Estimating this indirect effect, especially at the keyword level, is difficult. First, standard paid search data are aggregated across consumers. Second, there are typically far more keywords than available observations. Third, data across keywords may be highly correlated. To address these issues, the authors propose a hierarchical Bayesian elastic net model that allows the textual attributes of keywords to be incorporated.</p> <p>The authors apply the model to a keyword-level data set from a major commercial website in the automotive industry. The results show a significant indirect effect of paid search that clearly differs across keywords. The estimated indirect effect is large enough that it could recover a substantial part of the cost of the paid search advertising. Results from textual attribute analysis suggest that branded and broader search terms are associated with higher levels of subsequent direct type-in visitation.

Title: Uninformative Advertising as an Invitation to Search
Abstract: What the firm should say in an advertising message, the choice of <i>content</i>, is a critical managerial decision. Here, we focus on a particular aspect of the advertising content choice: an attribute-focused appeal versus an appeal with no direct information on product attributes. We make two assumptions that capture the reality of the advertising context. First, we assume that the bandwidth of advertising is limited: a firm can only communicate about a limited number of attributes. Second, we assume that consumers are active: they can choose to engage in a costly search to obtain additional product-related information. In this setting, we show that there exists an equilibrium where the high-quality firm chooses to produce messages devoid of any attribute information in order to invite the consumer to engage in search, which is likely to uncover positive information about the product. Whereas most of the previous literature has focused on the decision to advertise as a signal of quality, we show that message content, coupled with consumer search, can also serve as a credible signal of quality. In an extension, we show that our results are robust to endogenizing the firm's decision on the amount of advertising spending.

Title: Testing Models of Strategic Behavior Characterized by Conditional Likelihoods
Abstract: Marketing expenditures in the form of pricing, product development, promotion, and channel development are made to maximize profits. A challenge in evaluating the effectiveness of these expenditures is that decisions such as whether to lower prices or run promotions are made based on managers' knowledge of how sensitive consumers are to these marketing activities. Although marketing control variables are explanatory of sales, they are often set in anticipation of a market response, which reflects strategic behavior on the part of a firm. A challenge in developing a model of strategic behavior is that the process by which marketing expenditures are made is often not directly observable. We propose tests for comparing supply-side model formulations in which input variables are strategically determined. In these models, the joint likelihood of demand (y) and supply (x) can be factored into a conditional factor of demand given supply and into a marginal factor of supply. We illustrate our approach using data from a services company that operates in multiple geographic regions.

Title: A Dynamic Model of the Effect of Online Communications on Firm Sales
Abstract: Interpersonal communications have long been recognized as an influential source of information for consumers. Internet-based media have facilitated information exchange among firms and consumers, as well as observability and measurement of such exchanges. However, much of the research addressing online communication focuses on ratings collected from online forums. In this paper, we look beyond ratings to a more comprehensive view of online communications. We consider the sales effect of the volume of positive, negative, and neutral online communications captured by Web crawler technology and classified by automated sentiment analysis. Our modeling approach captures two key features of our data, dynamics and endogeneity. In terms of dynamics, we model daily measures of online communications about a firm and its products as contributing to a latent demand-generating stock variable. To account for the endogeneity, we extend the latent instrumental variable technique to account for dynamic endogenous regressors. Our results demonstrate a significant effect of positive, negative, and neutral online communications on daily sales performance. Failure to account for endogeneity results in a severe attenuation of the estimated effects. From a managerial perspective, we demonstrate the importance of accounting for communication valence as well as the impact of shocks to positive, negative, and neutral online communications.

Title: No Customer Left Behind: A Distribution-Free Bayesian Approach to Accounting for Missing Xs in Marketing Models
Abstract: In marketing applications, it is common that some key covariates in a regression model, such as marketing mix variables or consumer profiles, are subject to missingness. The convenient method that excludes the consumers with missingness in <i>any</i> covariate can result in a substantial loss of efficiency and may lead to strong selection bias in the estimation of consumer preferences and sensitivities. To solve these problems, we propose a new Bayesian distribution-free approach, which can ensure that no customer is left behind in the analysis as a result of missing covariates. In this way, all customers are being considered in devising managerial policies. The proposed approach allows for flexible modeling of a joint distribution of multidimensional interrelated covariates that can contain both continuous and discrete variables. At the same time, it minimizes the impact of distributional assumptions involved in covariate modeling because the method does not require researchers to specify parametric distributions for covariates and can automatically generate suitable distributions for missing covariates. We have developed an efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm for inference. Besides robustness and flexibility, the proposed approach reduces modeling and computational efforts associated with missing covariates and therefore makes the missing covariate problems easier to handle. We evaluate the performance of the proposed method using extensive simulation studies. We then illustrate the method in two real data examples in which missing covariates occur: a mixed multinomial logit discrete-choice model in a ketchup data set and a hierarchical probit purchase incidence model in a retail store data set. These analyses demonstrate that the proposed method overcomes several important limitations of existing approaches for solving missing covariate problems and offers opportunities to make better managerial decisions with the current available marketing databases. Although our applications focus on consumer-level data, the proposed method is general and can be applied to other marketing applications where other types of marketing players are the units of analysis.

Title: Optimizing E-tailer Profits and Customer Savings: Pricing Multistage Customized Online Bundles
Abstract: Online retailing provides an opportunity for new pricing options that are not feasible in traditional retail settings. This paper proposes an interactive, dynamic pricing strategy from the perspective of customized bundling to derive savings for customers while maximizing profits for electronic retailers ("e-tailers"). Given product costs, posted prices, shipping fees, and customers' reservation prices, we propose a nonlinear mixed-integer programming model to increase e-tailers' profits by sequentially pricing customized bundles. The model is flexible in terms of the number and variety of products customers may choose to incorporate during the various stages of their online shopping. Our computational study suggests that the proposed model not only attracts more customers to purchase the discounted bundle but also noticeably increases profits for e-tailers. This online dynamic bundle pricing model is robust under various bundle sizes and scenarios. It improves e-tailer profit and customer savings the most when facing divergent views about product values, lower budgets, and higher cost ratios.

Title: Firm Strategies in the "Mid Tail" of Platform-Based Retailing
Abstract: While millions of products are sold on its retail platform, Amazon.com itself stocks and sells only a very small fraction of them. Most of these products are sold by third-party sellers who pay Amazon a fee for each unit sold. Empirical evidence clearly suggests that Amazon tends to sell high-demand products and leave long-tail products for independent sellers to offer. We investigate how a platform owner such as Amazon, facing ex ante demand uncertainty, may strategically learn from these sellers' early sales which of the "mid-tail" products are worthwhile for its direct selling and which are best left for others to sell. The platform owner's "cherry-picking" of the successful products, however, gives an independent seller the incentive to mask any high demand by lowering his sales with a reduced service level (unobserved by the platform owner).</p> <p>We analyze this strategic interaction between a platform owner and an independent seller using a game-theoretic model with two types of sellers--one with high demand and one with low demand. We show that it may not always be optimal for the platform owner to identify the seller's demand. Interestingly, the platform owner may be <i>worse off</i> by retaining its option to sell the independent seller's product, whereas both types of sellers may <i>benefit</i> from the platform owner's threat of entry. The platform owner's entry option may reduce consumer surplus in the early period, although it increases consumer surplus in the later period. We also investigate how consumer reviews influence the market outcome.

Title: Competing for Low-End Markets
Abstract: Recent business research points to the fortune awaiting to be tapped in low-end markets. In this paper, we investigate how the size of the low-end market influences a firm's profits and the pioneering firm's quality choice. As low-valuation consumers increase in a market, on average, consumers' willingness to pay decreases. This may lead us to expect firms' profits to decrease as the size of the low-end market increases. Our analysis shows that, if the size of the low-end market is below a threshold, an increase in the size of the low-end market may actually dampen price competition and improve profits, as firms can then strategically choose their quality levels such that their products are more differentiated. Conventional wisdom also suggests that the pioneering firm will offer a higher-quality product and earn more profits compared with the later entrant. In contrast to this notion of quality advantage, our analysis identifies circumstances in which a pioneer can offer a lower-quality product and yet earn more profits. An experimental test lends support for some of our model's predictions. We further extend the model to consider markets with multiple firms, firms with multiple products, and consumers with limited purchasing power.

Title: Zooming In on Paid Search Ads--A Consumer-Level Model Calibrated on Aggregated Data
Abstract: We develop a two-stage consumer-level model of paid search advertising response based on standard aggregated data provided to advertisers by major search engines such as Google or Bing. The proposed model uses behavioral primitives in accord with utility maximization and allows recovering parameters of the heterogeneity distribution in consumer preferences. The model is estimated on a novel paid search data set that includes information on the ad copy. To that end, we develop an original framework to analyze composition and design attributes of paid search ads. Our results allow us to correctly evaluate the effects of specific ad properties on ad performance, taking consumer heterogeneity into account. Another benefit of our approach is allowing recovery of preference correlation across the click-through and conversion stage. Based on the estimated correlation between price- and position-sensitivity, we propose a novel contextual targeting scheme in which a coupon is offered to a consumer depending on the position in which the paid search ad was displayed. Our analysis shows that total revenues from conversion can be increased using this targeting scheme while keeping cost constant.

Title: Active Machine Learning for Consideration Heuristics
Abstract: We develop and test an active-machine-learning method to select questions adaptively when consumers use heuristic decision rules. The method tailors priors to each consumer based on a "configurator." Subsequent questions maximize information about the decision heuristics (minimize expected posterior entropy). To update posteriors after each question, we approximate the posterior with a variational distribution and use belief propagation (iterative loops of Bayes updating). The method runs sufficiently fast to select new queries in under a second and provides significantly and substantially more information per question than existing methods based on random, market-based, or orthogonal-design questions.</p> <p>Synthetic data experiments demonstrate that adaptive questions provide close-to-optimal information and outperform existing methods even when there are response errors or "bad" priors. The basic algorithm focuses on conjunctive or disjunctive rules, but we demonstrate generalizations to more complex heuristics and to the use of previous-respondent data to improve consumer-specific priors. We illustrate the algorithm empirically in a Web-based survey conducted by an American automotive manufacturer to study vehicle consideration (872 respondents, 53 feature levels). Adaptive questions outperform market-based questions when estimating heuristic decision rules. Heuristic decision rules predict validation decisions better than compensatory rules.

Title: The Impact of Tariff Structure on Customer Retention, Usage, and Profitability of Access Services
Abstract: Past research in marketing and psychology suggests that pricing structure may influence consumers' perception of value. In the context of two commonly used pricing schemes, pay-per-use and two-part tariff, we evaluate the impact of pricing structure on consumer preferences for access services. To this end, we develop a utility-based model of consumer retention and usage of a new service. A notable feature of the model is its ability to capture the pricing structure effect and measure its impact on consumer retention, usage, and pricing policy.</p> <p>Using data from a pricing field experiment for a new telecommunication service, we find that consumers derive lower utility from consumption under a two-part tariff than pay-per-use pricing, resulting in lower retention of customers and lower usage of the service. Specifically, our demand analysis shows that a two-part tariff structure leads to an average decline of 10.5% in the annual retention rate and an average decrease of 38.7% in yearly usage relative to pay-per-use pricing after controlling for income effects. Despite the higher customer churn and lower usage, we find that the two-part tariff is still the profit-maximizing pricing structure. However, our results show that if firms ignore the pricing structure (or access fee) effect, then they would overcharge customers for the access fee and undercharge them for the per-minute price. Translated in terms of profitability, the failure to account for the access fee effect leads to a reduction of 11% in firm profit.

Title: Measuring the Lifetime Value of Customers Acquired from Google Search Advertising
Abstract: Our main objective in this paper is to measure the value of customers acquired from Google search advertising accounting for two factors that have been overlooked in the conventional method widely adopted in the industry: (1) the spillover effect of search advertising on customer acquisition and sales in off-line channels and (2) the lifetime value of acquired customers. By merging Web traffic and sales data from a small-sized U.S. firm, we create an individual customer-level panel that tracks all repeated purchases, both online and off-line, and tracks whether or not these purchases were referred from Google search advertising.</p> <p>To estimate the customer lifetime value, we apply the methodology in the customer relationship management literature by developing an integrated model of customer lifetime, transaction rate, and gross profit margin, allowing for individual heterogeneity and a full correlation of the three processes. Results show that customers acquired through Google search advertising in our data have a higher transaction rate than customers acquired from other channels. After accounting for future purchases and spillover to off-line channels, the calculated value of new customers using our approach is much higher than the value obtained using conventional method. The approach used in our study provides a practical framework for firms to evaluate the long-term profit impact of their search advertising investment in a multichannel setting.

Title: Social Learning and Dynamic Pricing of Durable Goods
Abstract: We analyze the impacts of social learning (SL) on the dynamic pricing and consumer adoption of durable goods in a two-period monopoly. Consumers can make either early, uninformed purchases or late but potentially informed purchases as a result of social learning. Several results are derived. First, we identify the market conditions under which ex ante homogeneous consumers may choose to purchase at different times. Second, equilibrium adoption may demonstrate inertia (where all adopt late) or frenzy (where all adopt early). In particular, adoption inertia appears when SL intensity is reasonably high but may vanish when SL intensity exceeds a certain threshold. Third, firm profits and social welfare first weakly decrease in SL intensity and may then jump up by a lump-sum amount at the threshold SL intensity level mentioned above. Last, we show that the firm potentially benefits from informative advertising or investing to cultivate more social learning.

Title: New Perspectives on Customer "Death" Using a Generalization of the Pareto/NBD Model
Abstract: Several researchers have proposed models of buyer behavior in noncontractual settings that assume that customers are "alive" for some period of time and then become permanently inactive. The best-known such model is the Pareto/NBD, which assumes that customer attrition (dropout or "death") can occur at any point in calendar time. A recent alternative model, the BG/NBD, assumes that customer attrition follows a Bernoulli "coin-flipping" process that occurs in "transaction time" (i.e., after every purchase occasion). Although the modification results in a model that is much easier to implement, it means that heavy buyers have more opportunities to "die."</p> <p>In this paper, we develop a model with a discrete-time dropout process tied to calendar time. Specifically, we assume that every customer periodically "flips a coin" to determine whether she "drops out" or continues as a customer. For the component of purchasing while alive, we maintain the assumptions of the Pareto/NBD and BG/NBD models. This <i>periodic death opportunity</i> (PDO) model allows us to take a closer look at how assumptions about customer death influence model fit and various metrics typically used by managers to characterize a cohort of customers. When the time period after which each customer makes her dropout decision (which we call <i>period length</i>) is very small, we show analytically that the PDO model reduces to the Pareto/NBD. When the period length is longer than the calibration period, the dropout process is "shut off," and the PDO model collapses to the negative binomial distribution (NBD) model. By systematically varying the period length between these limits, we can explore the full spectrum of models between the "continuous-time-death" Pareto/NBD and the naïve "no-death" NBD.</p> <p>In covering this spectrum, the PDO model performs at least as well as either of these models; our empirical analysis demonstrates the superior performance of the PDO model on two data sets. We also show that the different models provide significantly different estimates of both purchasing-related and death-related metrics for both data sets, and these differences can be quite dramatic for the death-related metrics. As more researchers and managers make managerial judgments that directly relate to the death process, we assert that the model employed to generate these metrics should be chosen carefully.

Title: Modeling Customer Lifetimes with Multiple Causes of Churn
Abstract: Customer retention and customer churn are key metrics of interest to marketers, but little attention has been placed on linking the different reasons for which customers churn to their value to a contractual service provider. In this paper, we put forth a hierarchical competing-risk model to jointly model when customers choose to terminate their service and why. Some of these reasons for churn can be influenced by the firm (e.g., service problems or price-value trade-offs), but others are uncontrollable (e.g., customer relocation and death). Using this framework, we demonstrate that the impact of a firm's efforts to reduce customer churn for controllable reasons is mitigated by the prevalence of uncontrollable ones, resulting in a "damper effect" on the return from a firm's retention marketing efforts. We use data from a provider of land-based telecommunication services to demonstrate how the competing-risk model can be used to derive a measure of the incremental customer value that a firm can expect to accrue through its efforts to delay churn, taking this damper effect into account. In addition to varying across customers based on geodemographic information, the magnitude of the damper effect depends on a customer's tenure to date. We discuss how our framework can be used to tailor the firm's retention strategy to individual customers, both in terms of which customers to target and when retention efforts should be deployed.

Title: Product Positioning in a Two-Dimensional Vertical Differentiation Model: The Role of Quality Costs
Abstract: We study a duopoly model where consumers are heterogeneous with respect to their willingness to pay for two product characteristics and marginal costs are increasing with the quality level chosen on each attribute. We show that although firms seek to manage competition through product positioning, their differentiation strategies critically depend on how costly it is to provide higher quality. When the cost of providing quality is not too high, firms use only one attribute to differentiate their products: they maximally differentiate on one dimension and minimally differentiate on the other (a Max-Min equilibrium). Furthermore, they always differentiate along the dimension with the greater attribute range. As for the dimension with the smaller range and along which they agglomerate, firms either choose the highest quality level or the lowest quality level possible, depending on whether the marginal costs of quality provision are low or intermediate, respectively. However, for larger quality provision costs, firms exploit both dimensions to differentiate their products. In particular, we characterize a maximal differentiation equilibrium in which one firm chooses the highest quality level on both attributes while its rival offers the lowest quality level on both attributes (a Max-Max equilibrium). We discuss the managerial implications of our findings and explain how they enrich and qualify previous results reported in the literature on two-dimensional differentiation models.

Title: Assessing the Effect of Marketing Investments in a Business Marketing Context
Abstract: Recent research has empirically characterized the buyer-seller relationship as dynamically evolving from one discrete state to another. Conventional wisdom would suggest that a customer in a higher relationship state that has a higher transaction value would also have greater lifetime value to the firm. However, recent evidence suggests that higher relationship states can be ephemeral. Hence, the link between transaction value and lifetime value is not obvious. In this study, we seek to understand, within a specific empirical context, (i) the relationship between a customer's transaction value and that customer's lifetime value and (ii) the relationship between the lifetime value of a customer and the optimal level of marketing activity that needs to be directed at that customer. To this end, we develop a trivariate Tobit hidden Markov model that allows for (a) transitions among relationship states, (b) possible synergies between the various products that the supplier firm offers, (c) endogeneity in marketing activity, (d) heterogeneity in model parameters, and (e) the presence of the no-purchase option. Our results reinforce recent findings by Schweidel et al. [Schweidel, D. A., E. T. Bradlow, P. S. Fader. 2011. Portfolio dynamics for customers of a multiservice provider. <i>Management Sci.</i> <b>57</b>(3) 471-486] that higher relationship states can be short-lived. Importantly for the supplier firm, a customer in the highest relationship state in a given period does not yield the highest lifetime value to the firm. Hence, the relationship between transaction value (i.e., relationship state) and lifetime value can be nonmonotonic. At the same time, we also find a nonmonotonic relationship between the optimal expenditures that should be directed at a customer and that customer's lifetime value; i.e., the optimal level of marketing contacts is not the highest for customers with the highest lifetime value. Furthermore, we find that the optimal marketing expenditures for myopic agents are 14%-33% lower than the corresponding values for forward-looking agents. Therefore, not accounting for the long-term effects of marketing contacts would lead to suboptimal marketing budgets. Moreover, a comparison with the current marketing expenditures suggests that the current practice is closer to the myopic policy than to the forward-looking one.

Title: <b>Foreword</b>--Revisiting the Workshop on Quantitative Marketing and Structural Econometrics
Abstract: This foreword and the subsequent four invited articles were commissioned by Eric T. Bradlow while Editor-in-Chief of <i>Marketing Science</i>. The foreword was written in four parts; each part covers a different aspect of the Workshop on Quantitative Marketing and Structural Econometrics. The workshop was cosponsored by Columbia Business School, Duke University, the University of California at Los Angeles, and the INFORMS Society for Marketing Science and was held at the Fuqua School of Business at Duke University in August 2010. The introductory section, written by Bradlow, covers why he commissioned these articles in the first place. In his section, Jean-Pierre Dubé discusses "going from good to great" in the structural econometrics area as applied to marketing problems. A section jointly written by Brett R. Gordon and Raphael Thomadsen (both co-organizers of the workshop) discusses the workshop itself and some important thoughts for those people doing "structural econometrics in the trenches." Finally, co-workshop organizer Richard Staelin's section provides some perspective on both the workshop and structural econometrics as they relate to analytical models and empirical work for quantitative marketing researchers.

Title: <b>Structural Workshop Paper</b>--Descriptive, Structural, and Experimental Empirical Methods in Marketing Research
Abstract: What can be learned about marketing phenomena from descriptive, structural, and experimental empirical models? Is structure implicit in a descriptive empirical model? What is a "reduced-form model?" What is a natural experiment, and what can one infer from a study that uses experimental data? Having clear answers to these questions can improve empirical dialog. This paper defines descriptive, structural, and experimental empirical work, provides examples, discusses their similarities and differences, and comments on their strengths and weaknesses. An important theme is that the marketing question and the data available should determine the methods used, and not the other way around. Most of the examples discussed reference linear models that are widely employed in the marketing literature. Many of the points, however, extend to the development and interpretation of cutting-edge nonlinear, dynamic, or nonparametric models used in marketing.

Title: <b>Structural Workshop Paper</b>--Data Selection and Procurement
Abstract: In this note I overview the data selection and procurement process in the context of structural models. Data selection for structural models presents unique challenges because data and structure often substitute and because it is imperative to consider what information identifies causal effects of interest.</p> <p>I further discuss three types of field data on which to build empirical models: (i) data that are proprietary to firms, (ii) data that can come from the public domain, or (iii) data that can be purchased from private research firms, and I discuss the benefits and limits of each. I then detail a process for obtaining proprietary data and the potential pitfalls inherent in the process.

Title: <b>Structural Workshop Paper</b>--Discrete-Choice Models of Consumer Demand in Marketing
Abstract: Marketing researchers have used models of consumer demand to forecast future sales, to describe and test theories of behavior, and to measure the response to marketing interventions. The basic framework typically starts from microfoundations of expected utility theory to obtain an econometric system that describes consumers' choices over available options, and to thus characterize product demand. The basic framework has been augmented significantly to account for quantity choices, to accommodate purchases of several products on a single purchase occasion (multiple discreteness and multicategory purchases), and to allow for asymmetric switching between brands across different price tiers. These extensions have enabled researchers to bring the analysis to bear on several related marketing phenomena of interest. This paper has three main objectives. The first objective is to articulate the main <i>goals of demand analysis</i>--forecasting, measurement, and testing--and to highlight several considerations associated with these goals. Our second objective is to describe the main <i>building blocks of individual-level demand models</i>. We discuss approaches built on direct and indirect utility specifications of demand systems, and we review extensions that have appeared in the marketing literature. The third objective is to explore a few <i>emerging directions in demand analysis</i>, including considering demand-side dynamics, combining purchase data with primary information, and using semiparametric and nonparametric approaches. We hope researchers new to this literature will take away a broader perspective on these models and see the potential for new directions in future research.

Title: <b>Structural Workshop Paper</b>--Estimating Discrete Games
Abstract: This paper provides a critical review of the methods for estimating static discrete games and their relevance for quantitative marketing. We discuss the various modeling approaches, alternative assumptions, and relevant trade-offs involved in taking these empirical methods to data. We consider games of both complete and incomplete information, examine the primary methods for dealing with the coherency problems introduced by multiplicity of equilibria, and provide concrete examples from the literature. We illustrate the mechanics of estimation using a real-world example and provide the computer code and data set with which to replicate our results.

Title: Music Downloads and the Flip Side of Digital Rights Management
Abstract: Digital rights management (DRM) is an important yet controversial issue in the information goods markets. Although DRM is supposed to help copyright owners by protecting digital content from illegal copying or distribution, it is controversial because DRM imposes restrictions on even legal users, and there are many industry practitioners who believe that the industry would be better off without DRM. In this paper, we model consumers' utilities and their incentives to purchase legal products versus pirate illegal ones. This allows us to endogenize the level of piracy and understand how it is influenced by the presence or absence of DRM. Our analysis suggests that, counterintuitively, download piracy might decrease when the firm allows legal DRM-free downloads. Furthermore, we find that a decrease in piracy does not guarantee an increase in firm profits and that that copyright owners do not always benefit from making it harder to copy music illegally. By analyzing the competition among the traditional retailer, the digital retailer, and pirated sources of information goods, we get a better understanding of the competitive forces in the market and provide insights into the role of digital rights management.

Title: Noncompensatory Dyadic Choices
Abstract: Whereas literature in marketing shows that individuals often use noncompensatory decision rules, existing research on dyadic choice is based on compensatory models. In this paper we present a dyadic consider-then-choose model that investigates both compensatory and noncompensatory aspects of the joint decision process. The intersection of individual consideration sets at the dyad level gives rise to dyadic decision processes (DDPs) where dyad members are in concordance or discordance about alternatives to consider. We empirically investigate the implications of different DDPs on outcomes such as decision efficiency and dyadic welfare. The methodological approach merges choice experiments with Bayesian statistical models to uncover nuances of the dyadic choice process. Data were collected using a multiphase nationwide study of 265 husband-and-wife dyads. Results across three categories indicate that both concordant and discordant dyads exist. Among concordant dyads, the noncompensatory dyads make quicker decisions that result in higher dyadic welfare. Among discordant dyads, those that restrict their consideration set make quicker decisions that result in higher welfare than those that expand their consideration set. These findings have important implications for buyers looking to maximize dyadic welfare when making joint choices and for sellers making pricing and new product design decisions.

Title: Optimal Advertising When Envisioning a Product-Harm Crisis
Abstract: How should forward-looking managers plan advertising if they envision a product-harm crisis in the future? To address this question, we propose a dynamic model of brand advertising in which, at each instant, a nonzero probability exists for the occurrence of a crisis event that damages the brand's baseline sales and may enhance or erode marketing effectiveness when the crisis occurs. Because managers do not know when the crisis will occur, its random time of occurrence induces a stochastic control problem, which we solve analytically in closed form. More importantly, the envisioning of a possible crisis alters managers' rate of time preference: anticipation enhances impatience. That is, forward-looking managers discount the present--even when the crisis has not occurred--more than they would in the absence of crisis. Building on this insight, we then derive the optimal feedback advertising strategies and assess the effects of crisis likelihood and damage rate. We discover the crossover interaction: the optimal precrisis advertising decreases, but the postcrisis advertising increases as the crisis likelihood (or damage rate) increases. In addition, we develop a new continuous-time estimation method to simultaneously estimate sales dynamics and feedback strategies using discrete-time data. Applying the method to market data from the Ford Explorer's rollover recall, we furnish evidence to support the proposed model. We detect compensatory effects in parametric shift: ad effectiveness increases, but carryover effect decreases (or vice versa). We also characterize the crisis occurrence distribution that shows that Ford Explorer should anticipate a crisis in 2.1 years and within 6.3 years at the 95% confidence level. Finally, we find a remarkable correspondence between the observed and optimal advertising decisions.

Title: Competitive Strategy for Open Source Software
Abstract: Commercial open source software (COSS) products--privately developed software based on publicly available source code--represent a rapidly growing, multibillion-dollar market. A unique aspect of competition in the COSS market is that many open source licenses require firms to make certain enhancements public, creating an incentive for firms to free ride on the contributions of others. This practice raises a number of puzzling issues. First, why should a firm further develop a product if competitors can freely appropriate these contributions? Second, how does a market based on free riding produce high-quality products? Third, from a public policy perspective, does the mandatory sharing of enhancements raise or lower consumer surplus and industry profits?</p> <p>We develop a two-sided model of competition between COSS firms to address these issues. Our model consists of (1) two firms competing in a vertically differentiated market, in which product quality is a mix of public and private components, and (2) a market for developers that firms hire after observing signals of their contributions to open source. We demonstrate that free-riding behavior is supported in equilibrium, that a mandatory sharing setting can result in high-quality products, and that free riding can actually increase profits and consumer surplus.

Title: Identifying Causal Marketing Mix Effects Using a Regression Discontinuity Design
Abstract: We discuss how regression discontinuity designs arise naturally in settings where firms target marketing activity at consumers, and we illustrate how this aspect may be exploited for econometric inference of causal effects of marketing effort. Our main insight is to use commonly observed discontinuities and kinks in the heuristics by which firms target such marketing activity to consumers for nonparametric identification. Such kinks, along with continuity restrictions that are typically satisfied in marketing and industrial organization applications, are sufficient for identification of local treatment effects. We review the theory of regression discontinuity estimation in the context of targeting and explore its applicability to several marketing settings. We discuss identifiability of causal marketing effects using the design and show that consideration of an underlying model of strategic consumer behavior reveals how identification hinges on model features such as the specification and value of structural parameters as well as belief structures. We emphasize the role of selection for identification. We present two empirical applications: the first measures the effect of casino e-mail promotions targeted to customers based on ranges of their expected profitability, and the second measures the effect of direct mail targeted by a business-to-consumer company to zip codes based on cutoffs of expected response. In both cases, we illustrate that exploiting the regression discontinuity design reveals negative effects of the marketing campaigns that would not have been uncovered using other approaches. Our results are nonparametric, easy to compute, and control for the endogeneity induced by the targeting rule.

Title: Understanding Responses to Contradictory Information About Products
Abstract: Although prior literature has examined reactions to drastic negative news, we examine the situation in which decision makers receive contradictory information about products and they have to decide whether to persist with or abandon product usage. We investigate physician reactions to conflicting information concerning the cardiovascular risk of Avandia, a diabetes drug. We examine how beliefs about both drug <i>effectiveness</i> and drug <i>safety</i> are updated and speculate that experience, expertise, and self-efficacy impact how such information is integrated with current quality beliefs. Unlike previous Bayesian learning models, we consider that some signals, such as positive and negative news releases and the firm's marketing effort, may be biased in that they provide an opinionated point of view. The results show interesting differences in how physician types (specialists, hospital-based primary care physicians, heavy and light prescribers) update their beliefs and the information sources they use to do so. We find evidence that safety issues about Avandia resulted in spillover concern to close competitor Actos. The results have implication for determining who should be targeted and what vehicles should be used if a firm is faced with a situation where consumers are in a quandary because of receiving conflicting messages.

Title: The Sense and Non-Sense of Holdout Sample Validation in the Presence of Endogeneity
Abstract: Market response models based on field-generated data need to address potential endogeneity in the regressors to obtain consistent parameter estimates. Another requirement is that market response models predict well in a holdout sample. With both requirements combined, it may seem reasonable to subject an endogeneity-corrected model to a holdout prediction task, and this is quite common in the academic marketing literature. One may be inclined to expect that the consistent parameter estimates obtained via instrumental variables (IV) estimation predict better than the biased ordinary least squares (OLS) estimates. This paper shows that this expectation is incorrect. That is, if the holdout sample is similar to the estimation sample so that the regressors are endogenous in both samples, holdout sample validation favors regression estimates that are <i>not corrected</i> for endogeneity (i.e., OLS) over estimates that <i>are corrected</i> for endogeneity (i.e., IV estimation). We also discuss ways in which holdout samples may be used sensibly in the presence of endogeneity. A key takeaway is that if consistent parameter estimates are the primary model objective, the model should be validated with an exogenous (rather than endogenous) holdout sample.

Title: Measuring the Impact of Negative Demand Shocks on Car Dealer Networks
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to study the behavior of consumers, dealers, and manufacturers in the car sector and present an approach that can be used by managers and policy makers to investigate the impact of significant demand shocks on profits, prices, and dealer networks. More specifically, we investigate consumer demand, substitution patterns, and price decisions across different cars and dealer locations to identify dealerships with low margins or high fixed costs and measure the value of closing down dealerships for manufacturers. We apply our model empirically to the San Diego area using a transactional data set with information about the locations of dealers and consumers, as well as manufacturer and retail prices. We find strong consumer disutility for travel and find that dealers have local demand areas that are shared with a small set of competitors. We show that a reduction of market demand by 30% over two years, similar to the economic crisis of 2008-2009, results in an annual drop in prices of approximately 11%. We discuss this price drop in the context of the 2009 federal policy measure known as the Car Allowance Rebate System program. We compare predictions and actual dealership closings in the General Motors and Chrysler dealer networks as an application of our approach.

Title: Marketing of Vice Goods: A Strategic Analysis of the Package Size Decision
Abstract: Consumers are often unable to resist the temptation of overconsuming certain products such as cookies, crackers, soft drinks, alcohol, etc. To control their consumption, some consumers buy small packages or abstain from purchasing the product altogether. Other consumers, however, still purchase large packages and overconsume. From a strategic perspective, firms have the option of introducing small packages or only offering large packages. We use the literature on hyperbolic discounting to model consumers' self-control problems and examine conditions under which firms will offer small packages to help consumers combat their self-control problem, and how this offering in turn affects prices, profits, consumer, and social welfare. Our results show that introducing small packages can increase firms' profits only when a small fraction of consumers have overconsumption problems or when small packages can bring in new customers. Additionally, we find that competition can sometimes reduce the incentives for firms to introduce small packages. This is particularly true when a large fraction of consumers is attracted to small packages. We also find that firms' profits can sometimes decrease if they produce healthier alternatives of their goods. Our analysis of consumer welfare reveals that small packages enhance consumer and social welfare, even though they sometimes increase the consumption of vice goods.

Title: Ad Gist: Ad Communication in a Single Eye Fixation
Abstract: Most ads in practice receive no more than a single eye fixation. This study investigates the limits of what ads can communicate under such adverse exposure conditions. We find that consumers already know at maximum levels of accuracy and with high degree of certainty whether something is an ad or is editorial material after an exposure of less than 100 milliseconds and--if the ad is typical--which product is being advertised. Even after an extremely coarse visual presentation of 100 milliseconds, the product and brand in typical ads are identified well above chance levels, with atypical ads doing slightly better at the brand level. We propose a new metric that quantifies how effectively individual ads communicate their gist in adverse exposure conditions and that predicts the immediate interest that ads draw. Bayesian mediation analyses show that because of their better gist performance, typical ads rather than atypical ones raise immediate interest after very brief exposures. These findings challenge some of the received knowledge in advertising theory and practice, and they reveal the immediate communication benefits of typical ads.

Title: Cloak or Flaunt? The Fashion Dilemma
Abstract: There exists a dichotomy in the communication strategies of fashion firms--some firms purposefully cloak information on the tastefulness of their products, whereas others openly flaunt their tasteful or "it" products. This divide in communication strategies cannot be explained by existing wealth signaling models of fashion. In this paper, we offer a model of fashion that explains the above dichotomy. We model fashion as a social device that plays the dual role of allowing people to both fit in with their peers and differentiate themselves by signaling their good taste or access to information. In this context, we show that a fashion firm faces an interesting dilemma--if it restricts information, then only sophisticated consumers buy its products and use them to signal their taste. Cloaking thus preserves the signaling value of its products but reduces the number of social interactions enabled by them. In contrast, flaunting undermines the signaling value of its products but increases the interactions enabled by them. Given these trade-offs, we derive the conditions under which cloaking occurs. We also show that, in equilibrium, the most tasteful product endogenously emerges as the fashion hit or "it" product.

Title: Quantifying Transaction Costs in Online/Off-line Grocery Channel Choice
Abstract: Households incur transaction costs when choosing among off-line stores for grocery purchases. They may incur additional transaction costs when buying groceries online versus off-line. We integrate the various transaction costs into a channel choice framework and empirically quantify the relative transaction costs when households choose between the online and off-line channels of the same grocery chain. The key challenges in quantifying these costs are (i) the complexity of channel choice decision and (ii) that several of the costs depend on the items a household expects to buy in the store, and unobserved factors that influence channel choice also likely influence the items purchased. We use the unique features of our empirical context to address the first issue and the plausibly exogenous approach in a hierarchical Bayesian framework to account for the endogeneity of the channel choice drivers. We find that transaction costs for grocery shopping can be sizable and play an important role in the choice between online and off-line channels. We provide monetary metrics for several types of transaction costs, such as travel time and transportation costs, in-store shopping time, item-picking costs, basket-carrying costs, quality inspection costs, and inconvenience costs. We find considerable household heterogeneity in these costs and characterize their distributions. We discuss the implications of our findings for the retailer's channel strategy.

Title: Disentangling Preferences and Learning in Brand Choice Models
Abstract: In recent years there has been a growing stream of literature in marketing and economics that models consumers as Bayesian learners. Such learning behavior is often embedded within a discrete choice framework that is then calibrated on scanner panel data. At the same time, it is now accepted wisdom that disentangling preference heterogeneity and state dependence is critical in any attempt to understand either construct. We posit that this confounding between state dependence and heterogeneity often carries through to Bayesian learning models. That is, the failure to adequately account for preference heterogeneity may result in over- or underestimation of the learning process because this heterogeneity is also reflected in the initial conditions. Using a unique data set that contains stated preferences (survey) and actual purchase data (scanner panel) for the same group of consumers, we attempt to untangle the effects of preference heterogeneity and state dependence, where the latter arises from Bayesian learning. Our results are striking and suggest that measured brand beliefs can predict choices quite well and, moreover, that in the absence of such measured preference information, the Bayesian learning behavior for consumer packaged goods is vastly overstated. The inclusion of preference information significantly reduces evidence for aggregate-level learning and substantially changes the nature of individual-level learning. Using individual-level outcomes, we illustrate why the lack of preference information leads to faulty inferences.

Title: Measuring Consumer Preferences Using Conjoint Poker
Abstract: We develop and test an incentive-compatible Conjoint Poker (CP) game. The preference data collected in the context of this game are comparable to incentive-compatible choice-based conjoint (CBC) analysis data. We develop a statistical efficiency measure and an algorithm to construct efficient CP designs. We compare incentive-compatible CP to incentive-compatible CBC in a series of three experiments (one online study and two eye-tracking studies). Our results suggest that CP induces respondents to consider more of the profile-related information presented to them compared with CBC.

Title: Customer Bill of Rights Under No-Fault Service Failure: Confinement and Compensation
Abstract: Service providers and their customers are sometimes victims of failures caused by exogenous factors such as unexpected bad weather, power outages, or labor strikes. When such no-fault failures occur in confined zones, service providers may confine customers against their will if making arrangements for them to leave is very costly. Such confinements, however, can result in severe pain and suffering, and customer complaints put regulators under pressure to pass a customer bill of rights that allows captive customers to abort failed services. This paper shows that service providers are better off preempting such laws by voluntarily allowing customers to escape the service under failure. Moreover, service providers can profit by targeting compensation to customers based on whether they use or leave the service under failure.

Title: Exclusive Channels and Revenue Sharing in a Complementary Goods Market
Abstract: This paper evaluates the joint impact of exclusive channels and revenue sharing on suppliers and retailers in a hybrid duopoly common retailer and exclusive channel model. The model bridges the gap in the literature on hybrid multichannel supply chains with bilateral complementary products and services with or without revenue sharing. The analysis indicates that, without revenue sharing, the suppliers are reluctant to form exclusive deals with the retailers; thus, no equilibrium results. With revenue sharing from the retailers to the suppliers, it can be an equilibrium strategy for the suppliers and retailers to form exclusive deals. Bargaining solutions are provided to determine the revenue sharing rates. Our additional results suggest forming exclusive deals becomes less desirable for the suppliers if revenue sharing is also in place under nonexclusivity. In our extended discussion, we also study the impact of channel asymmetry, an alternative model with fencing, composite package competition, and enhanced price-dependent revenue sharing.

Title: Does Chatter Really Matter? Dynamics of User-Generated Content and Stock Performance
Abstract: This study examines whether user-generated content (UGC) is related to stock market performance, which metric of UGC has the strongest relationship, and what the dynamics of the relationship are. We aggregate UGC from multiple websites over a four-year period across 6 markets and 15 firms. We derive multiple metrics of UGC and use multivariate time-series models to assess the relationship between UGC and stock market performance.</p> <p>Volume of chatter significantly leads abnormal returns by a few days (supported by Granger causality tests). Of all the metrics of UGC, volume of chatter has the strongest positive effect on abnormal returns and trading volume. The effect of negative and positive metrics of UGC on abnormal returns is asymmetric. Whereas negative UGC has a significant negative effect on abnormal returns with a short "wear-in" and long "wear-out," positive UGC has no significant effect on these metrics. The volume of chatter and negative chatter have a significant positive effect on trading volume. Idiosyncratic risk increases significantly with negative information in UGC. Positive information does not have much influence on the risk of the firm. An increase in off-line advertising significantly increases the volume of chatter and decreases negative chatter. These results have important implications for managers and investors.

Title: The Joint Sales Impact of Frequency Reward and Customer Tier Components of Loyalty Programs
Abstract: We estimate the joint impact of the frequency reward and customer tier components of a loyalty program on customer behavior and resultant sales. We provide an integrated analysis of a loyalty program incorporating customers' purchase and cash-in decisions, points pressure and rewarded behavior effects, heterogeneity, and forward-looking behavior. We focus on four key research questions: (1) How important is it to combine both components in one model? (2) Does points pressure exist in the context of a two-component loyalty program? (3) How is the market segmented in its response to the combined program? (4) Do the programs complement each other in terms of the incremental sales they produce?</p> <p>Our most basic message is that the frequency reward and customer tier components of loyalty programs should be modeled jointly rather than in separate models. We find strong evidence for points pressure for both the customer tier and frequency reward components using both model-based and model-free evidence. We find a two-segment solution revealing a "service-oriented" segment that highly values cash-ins for room upgrades and staying in "luxury" hotels, and a "price-oriented" segment that is more price sensitive and highly values the frequency reward aspects of the loyalty program. Furthermore, we find that both components generate incremental sales. Also, there was slight synergy between the programs but not a huge amount. Overall, each component contributes to increased revenues and does not interfere with the other.

Title: Customer Influence Value and Purchase Acceleration in New Product Diffusion
Abstract: When social influence plays a key role in the diffusion of new product, the value of a customer often goes beyond her own product purchase. We posit that a customer's value (CV) comes not only from her purchase value (PV) but also from her influence value (IV) (i.e., CV = PV + IV). Therefore, a customer's value can be far greater than her purchase value if she exerts a considerable influence on others. Building on a two-segment influential-imitator asymmetric influence model, we develop a model framework to derive closed-form expressions for PV, IV, and CV by customer segment as well as time of adoption, and we examine their comparative statics with respect to the diffusion parameters. A key parameter of our model framework is the social apportioning parameter, delta, which determines the credit a customer receives by influencing other potential adopters. We develop an endogenous method for determining delta as a function of the new product diffusion parameters. Our model framework allows us to investigate how a firm might accelerate product purchases by providing introductory discount offers to a targeted group of potential adopters at product launch. We find that purchase acceleration frequently leads to a significant increase in total customer value.

Title: The Strategic Impact of References in Business Markets
Abstract: We investigate a business-to-business context and ask <i>when</i> and <i>why</i> a firm should announce a "reference program" that commits the firm to facilitating the flow of information about the efficacy of its products from early adopters to potential late adopters. We model a monopolist manufacturer with a new innovation that can be sold to two potential customers. We demonstrate here two benefits of a reference program that relate not to an increase in later adopters' willingness to pay but to an increase in the willingness to pay of the early adopters themselves. The impact on the early adopters' willingness to pay arises in two ways as a result of their observation of the firm's commitment to information transmission. First, in a model of symmetric uncertainty, we show that the announcement of a reference program facilitates dynamic pricing by the manufacturer in the sense that it allows the firm to provide temporary exclusive use of the technology to one of the customers. This creates more value, which the manufacturer can extract via a higher price. In this way, a reference program can serve as a partial substitute for an exclusive-use contract. In a model with asymmetric information, we demonstrate that under certain conditions, the firm is able to use the reference program as a signal--again, to the early adopting customer--that its technology is of high quality. However, such a signal requires significant discounts to early adopters to ensure separation. As a result, a pooling equilibrium dominates in which the manufacturer fosters references regardless of its quality. Finally, by allowing the firms' private information to be stochastic, we show that separation may be a dominant outcome.

Title: Hide and Seek: Costly Consumer Privacy in a Market with Repeat Purchases
Abstract: When a firm can recognize its previous customers, it may use information about their past purchases to price discriminate. We study a model with a monopolist and a continuum of heterogeneous consumers, where consumers have the ability to maintain their anonymity and avoid being identified as past customers, possibly at a cost. When consumers can freely maintain their anonymity, they all individually choose to do so, which results in the highest profit for the monopolist. Increasing the cost of anonymity can benefit consumers but only up to a point, after which the effect is reversed. We show that if the monopolist or an independent third party controls the cost of anonymity, it often works to the detriment of consumers.

Title: Demand Dynamics in the Seasonal Goods Industry: An Empirical Analysis
Abstract: This study develops and estimates a dynamic model of consumer choice behavior in markets for seasonal goods, where products are sold over a finite season and availability is limited. In these markets, retailers often use dynamic markdown policies in which an initial retail price is announced at the beginning of the season and the price is subsequently marked down as the season progresses. Strategic consumers face a trade-off between purchasing early in the season, when prices are higher but goods are available, and purchasing later, when prices are lower but the stockout risk is higher. If the good starts providing utility as soon as it is purchased (e.g., apparel), consumers purchasing earlier in the season can also get more use from the product compared to those purchasing later.</p> <p>Our structural model incorporates three features essential for modeling the demand for seasonal goods: changing prices, limited availability, and possible dependence of total consumption utility on the time of purchase. In this model, heterogeneous consumers have expectations about future prices and product availability, and they strategically time their purchases. We estimate the model using aggregate sales and inventory data from a fashion goods retailer.</p> <p>The results indicate that, in the fashion goods context, ignoring consumers' expectations about future availability or the change in total consumption utility over the season can lead to biased demand estimates. We find that strategic consumers delay their purchases to take advantage of markdowns and that these strategic delays hurt the retailer's revenues. Retailer revenues facing strategic consumers are 9% lower than they would have been facing myopic consumers. Limited availability, on the other hand, reduces the extent of strategic delays by motivating consumers to purchase earlier. We find that the impact of strategic delays on retailer revenues would have been as high as 35% if there were no stockout risk. By means of counterfactual experiments, we show that the highest retailer profits are achieved by offering small markdowns early in the season. On the other hand, given current markdown percentages, the retailer can improve profits by carrying less stock as consumers accelerate purchases and purchase at higher prices when they anticipate scarcity in future periods. As long as the reduction in availability is not great, the profit gain from earlier higher-priced sales can overcome the loss resulting from the reduction in overall sales.

Title: Procuring Commodities: First-Price Sealed-Bid or English Auctions?
Abstract: We use laboratory experiments to examine the relative performance of the English auction (EA) and the first-price sealed-bid auction (FPA) when procuring a commodity. The mean and variance of prices are lower in the FPA than in the EA. Bids and prices in the EA agree with game-theoretic predictions, but they do not agree in the FPA. To resolve these deviations found in the FPA, we introduce a mixture model with three bidding rules: constant absolute markup, constant percentage markup, and strategic best response. A dynamic specification in which bidders can switch strategies as they gain experience is estimated as a hidden Markov model. Initially, about three quarters of the subjects are strategic bidders, but over time, the number of strategic bidders falls to below 65%. There is a corresponding growth in those who use the constant absolute markup rule.

Title: A Conjoint Model of Quantity Discounts
Abstract: Quantity discount pricing is a common practice used by business-to-business and business-to-consumer companies. A key characteristic of quantity discount pricing is that the marginal price declines with higher purchase quantities. In this paper, we propose a choice-based conjoint model for estimating consumer-level willingness to pay (WTP) for varying quantities of a product and for designing optimal quantity discount pricing schemes. Our model can handle large quantity values and produces WTP estimates that are positive and increasing in quantity at a diminishing rate. In particular, we propose a tractable WTP function that depends on both product attributes and product quantity and that captures diminishing marginal WTP. We show how such a function embeds standard WTP functions in the quantity discount literature as special cases. We also demonstrate how to use the model to estimate the consumer value potential, which is the product of the premium a consumer is willing to pay and her volume potential. Finally, we propose a parsimonious experimental design approach for implementation.</p> <p>We illustrate the model using data from a conjoint study of online movie rental services. The empirical results show that the proposed model has good fit and predictive validity. In addition, we find that marginal WTP in this category decays rapidly with quantity. We also find that the standard choice-based conjoint model results in anomalous WTP distributions with negative WTP values and nondiminishing marginal willingness-to-pay curves. Finally, we identify four segments of consumers that differ in terms of magnitude of WTP and volume potential, and we derive optimal quantity discount schemes for a monopolist and a new entrant in a competitive market.

Title: Modeling Seasonality in New Product Diffusion
Abstract: We propose a method to include seasonality in any diffusion model that has a closed-form solution. The resulting diffusion model captures seasonality in a way that naturally matches the original diffusion model's pattern. The method assumes that additional sales at seasonal peaks are drawn from previous or future periods. This implies that the seasonal pattern does not influence the underlying diffusion pattern. The model is compared with alternative approaches through simulations and empirical examples. As alternatives, we consider the standard Generalized Bass Model (GBM) and the basic Bass Model, which ignores seasonality. One of the main findings is that modeling seasonality in a GBM generates good predictions but gives biased estimates. In particular, the market potential parameter is underestimated. Ignoring seasonality in cases where data of the entire diffusion period are available gives unbiased parameter estimates in most relevant scenarios. However, ignoring seasonality leads to biased parameter estimates and predictions when only part of the diffusion period is available. We demonstrate that our model gives correct estimates and predictions even if the full diffusion process is not yet available.

Title: Introduction to the Special Issue on the Emergence and Impact of User-Generated Content
Abstract: The growth of the "social" Web has resulted in the enormous growth of what is referred to as user-generated content, or UGC. UGC takes the form of product reviews, descriptions of product usage, "homemade advertising," blogs, and other consumer-initiated contributions. Following a research competition cosponsored by the Marketing Science Institute and the Wharton Interactive Media Initiative (now known as the Wharton Customer Analytics Initiative), a call for papers for a special issue of <i>Marketing Science</i> resulted in 69 submissions. Of these, eight papers were accepted, covering a range of issues such as how and why people make UGC contributions, the impact of UGC contributions, and new methods for analyzing UGC data.

Title: Online Product Opinions: Incidence, Evaluation, and Evolution
Abstract: Whereas recent research has demonstrated the impact of online product ratings and reviews on product sales, we still have a limited understanding of the individual's decision to contribute these opinions. In this research, we empirically model the individual's decision to provide a product rating and investigate factors that influence this decision. Specifically, we consider how previously posted ratings may affect an individual's posting behavior in terms of <i>whether</i> to contribute (incidence) and <i>what</i> to contribute (evaluation), and we identify <i>selection effects</i> that influence the incidence decision and <i>adjustment effects</i> that influence the evaluation decision.</p> <p>Across individuals, our results show that positive ratings environments increase posting incidence, whereas negative ratings environments discourage posting. Our results also indicate important differences across individuals in how they respond to previously posted ratings, with less frequent posters exhibiting bandwagon behavior and more active customers revealing differentiation behavior. These dynamics affect the evolution of online product opinions. Through simulations, we illustrate how the evolution of posted product opinions is shaped by the underlying customer base and show that customer bases with the same median opinion may evolve in substantially different ways because of the presence of a core group of "activists" posting increasingly negative opinions.

Title: Network Characteristics and the Value of Collaborative User-Generated Content
Abstract: User-generated content is increasingly created through the collaborative efforts of multiple individuals. In this paper, we argue that the value of collaborative user-generated content is a function both of the direct efforts of its contributors and of its embeddedness in the content-contributor network that creates it. An analysis of Wikipedia's WikiProject Medicine reveals a curvilinear relationship between the number of distinct contributors to user-generated content and viewership. A two-mode social network analysis demonstrates that the embeddedness of the content in the content-contributor network is positively related to viewership. Specifically, locally central content--characterized by greater intensity of work by contributors to multiple content sources--is associated with increased viewership. Globally central content--characterized by shorter paths to the other collaborative content in the overall network--also generates greater viewership. However, within these overall effects, there is considerable heterogeneity in how network characteristics relate to viewership. In addition, network effects are stronger for newer collaborative user-generated content. These findings have implications for fostering collaborative user-generated content.

Title: Evaluating Promotional Activities in an Online Two-Sided Market of User-Generated Content
Abstract: We measure the value of promotional activities and referrals by content creators to an online platform of user-generated content. To do so, we develop a modeling approach that explains individual-level choices of visiting the platform, creating, and purchasing content as a function of consumer characteristics and marketing activities, allowing for the possibility of interdependence of decisions within and across users. Empirically, we apply our model to Hewlett-Packard's (HP) print-on-demand service of user-created magazines, named MagCloud. We use two distinct data sets to show the applicability of our approach: an aggregate-level data set from Google Analytics, which is a widely available source of data to managers, and an individual-level data set from HP. Our results compare content creator activities, which include referrals and word-of-mouth efforts, with firm-based actions, such as price promotions and public relations. We show that price promotions have strong effects but are limited to the purchase decisions, whereas content creator referrals and public relations efforts have broader effects that impact all consumer decisions at the platform. We provide recommendations as to the level of a firm's investments when "free" promotional activities by content creators exist. These free marketing campaigns are likely to have a substantial presence in most online services of user-generated content.

Title: Content Contributor Management and Network Effects in a UGC Environment
Abstract: The success of any user-generated content website depends crucially on its asset of content contributors. How firms should invest in the acquisition and retention of content contributors represents a novel question that is particularly important for these websites. We develop a vector autoregressive (VAR) model to measure the financial values of the retention and acquisition of both contributors and content consumers. In our empirical application to a customer-to-customer marketplace, we find that contributor (seller) acquisition has the largest financial value because of their strong network effects on content consumers (buyers) and other contributors. However, the wear-in of contributors' financial values takes longer because the network effects need time to be fully realized. Our simulation-based studies (i) shed light on the value implications of "enhancing network effects" and (ii) quantify the revenue contributions of marketing newsletter campaigns. Our results indicate that enhancing network effects in complementary ways can further increase the marginal benefits of acquisition and retention. We also find that simply tracking click-throughs may vastly underestimate the values of marketing newsletters--in our case, by more than a factor of 5--which may lead to suboptimal marketing effort allocation.

Title: Sequential and Temporal Dynamics of Online Opinion
Abstract: We investigate the evolution of online ratings over time and sequence. We first establish that there exist two distinct dynamic processes, one as a function of the amount of time a book has been available for review and another as a function of the sequence of reviews themselves. We find that, once we control for calendar date, the residual average temporal pattern is increasing. This is counter to existing findings that suggest that without this calendar-date control, the pattern is decreasing. With respect to sequential dynamics, we find that ratings decrease: the <i>n</i>th rating is, on average, lower than the <i>n</i>-1th when controlling for time, reviewer effects, and book effects. We test and find some support for existing theories for this decline based on motivation. We then offer two additional explanations for this "order effect." We find support for the idea that one's ability to assess the diagnosticity of previous reviews decreases: when previous reviewers are very different, more reviews may thus lead to more purchase errors and lower ratings.

Title: User-Generated Open Source Products: Founder's Social Capital and Time to Product Release
Abstract: Volunteer users employ collaborative Internet technologies to develop open source products, a form of user-generated content, where time to product release is a crucial measure of project success. The open source community features two separate but related subcommunities: developer users who contribute time and effort to develop products and end users who act as collaborative testers and provide feedback. We develop hypotheses concerning how the location of the project's founders in the social network of developer users, the interplay of developer users and end users, and project and product characteristics affect time to product release. We use data on 817 development projects from SourceForge, a large open source community forum, to calibrate a split hazard model to test the hypotheses. That model supports the two-community conceptualization and most of the related hypotheses. The results have theoretical and managerial implications; for example, a pivotal position of founders in the developer user community can reduce time to product release by up to 31 and projects in which users are more engaged can experience an 11 time to product release compared with those projects in which they are not.

Title: Designing Ranking Systems for Hotels on Travel Search Engines by Mining User-Generated and Crowdsourced Content
Abstract: User-generated content on social media platforms and product search engines is changing the way consumers shop for goods online. However, current product search engines fail to effectively leverage information created across diverse social media platforms. Moreover, current ranking algorithms in these product search engines tend to induce consumers to focus on one single product characteristic dimension (e.g., price, star rating). This approach largely ignores consumers' multidimensional preferences for products. In this paper, we propose to generate a ranking system that recommends products that provide, on average, the best value for the consumer's money. The key idea is that products that provide a higher surplus should be ranked higher on the screen in response to consumer queries. We use a unique data set of U.S. hotel reservations made over a three-month period through Travelocity, which we supplement with data from various social media sources using techniques from text mining, image classification, social geotagging, human annotations, and geomapping. We propose a random coefficient hybrid structural model, taking into consideration the two sources of consumer heterogeneity the different travel occasions and different hotel characteristics introduce. Based on the estimates from the model, we infer the economic impact of various location and service characteristics of hotels. We then propose a new hotel ranking system based on the average utility gain a consumer receives from staying in a particular hotel. By doing so, we can provide customers with the "best-value" hotels early on. Our user studies, using ranking comparisons from several thousand users, validate the superiority of our ranking system relative to existing systems on several travel search engines. On a broader note, this paper illustrates how social media can be mined and incorporated into a demand estimation model in order to generate a new ranking system in product search engines. We thus highlight the tight linkages between user behavior on social media and search engines. Our interdisciplinary approach provides several insights for using machine learning techniques in economics and marketing research.

Title: Mine Your Own Business: Market-Structure Surveillance Through Text Mining
Abstract: Web 2.0 provides gathering places for Internet users in blogs, forums, and chat rooms. These gathering places leave footprints in the form of colossal amounts of data regarding consumers' thoughts, beliefs, experiences, and even interactions. In this paper, we propose an approach for firms to explore online user-generated content and "listen" to what customers write about their and their competitors' products. Our objective is to convert the user-generated content to market structures and competitive landscape insights. The difficulty in obtaining such market-structure insights from online user-generated content is that consumers' postings are often not easy to syndicate. To address these issues, we employ a text-mining approach and combine it with semantic network analysis tools. We demonstrate this approach using two cases--sedan cars and diabetes drugs--generating market-structure perceptual maps and meaningful insights without interviewing a single consumer. We compare a market structure based on user-generated content data with a market structure derived from more traditional sales and survey-based data to establish validity and highlight meaningful differences.

Title: Consumer Learning of New Binary Attribute Importance Accounting for Priors, Bias, and Order Effects
Abstract: This paper develops and calibrates a simple yet comprehensive set of models for the evolution of binary attribute importance weights, based on a cue-goal association framework. We argue that the utility a consumer ascribes to an attribute comes from its association with the achievement of a goal. We investigate how associations may be represented and then track back the relationship of these associations to the utility function. We explain why we believe this to be an important problem before providing an overview of the extensive literature on learning models. This literature identifies key phenomena and provides a foundation for our modeling of binary attribute importance learning, which can test for three departures from "rational" learning--bias, existence of priors, and the unequal weighting of sample observations (order effects). We apply our models in a laboratory setting under a number of different relationship strengths, and we find that, in our application, consumers' learning about attribute-goal associations exhibits bias and the effects of prior beliefs when the sample realizations occur with and without noise, and order effects when the sample realizations occur with noise. We provide an example of how our models can be extended to learning about more than one attribute.

Title: Handling Endogenous Regressors by Joint Estimation Using Copulas
Abstract: We propose a new statistical instrument-free method to tackle the endogeneity problem. The proposed method models the joint distribution of the endogenous regressor and the error term in the structural equation of interest (the structural error) using a copula method, and it makes inferences on the model parameters by maximizing the likelihood derived from the joint distribution. Similar to the "exclusion restriction" in instrumental variable methods, extant instrument-free methods require the assumption that the unobserved instruments are exogenous, a requirement that is difficult to meet. The proposed method does not require such an assumption. Other benefits of the proposed method are that it allows the modeling of discrete endogenous regressors and offers a new solution to the slope endogeneity problem. In addition to linear models, the method is applicable to the popular random coefficient logit model with either aggregate-level or individual-level data. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed method via a series of simulation studies and an empirical example.

Title: Intraconnectivity and Interconnectivity: When Value Creation May Reduce Profits
Abstract: This paper analyses firms' decisions to provide connectivity to their customers. We distinguish between intraconnectivity--the ability of one firm's customers to connect to each other--and interconnectivity--the ability of one firm's customers to connect with another firm's customers. The profitability implications of allowing connectivity are not a straightforward consequence of the consumer value of connectivity, because connectivity affects not only the customer value but also the intensity of competition by creating or changing network externality. We find that if sales are driven by brand switching rather than by category expansion, a firm may find it optimal not to provide intraconnectivity even if providing it is not costly and may find it optimal to provide interconnectivity even at a cost exceeding the consumer value of connectivity. On the other hand, if category expansion is possible, providing intraconnectivity may be profitable. In this case, either the equilibrium intraconnectivity provision may be asymmetric or both firms may find it (individually) optimal to provide intraconnectivity. Under certain conditions in the latter case, the firms' choice of intraconnectivity is a prisoner's dilemma game.

Title: Social Sharing of Information Goods: Implications for Pricing and Profits
Abstract: Social sharing of information goods--wherein a single good is purchased and shared through a network of acquaintances such as friends or coworkers--is a significant concern for the providers of these goods. The effect of social sharing on firm pricing and profits depends critically on two elements: the structure of the underlying consumer network and the mechanism used by groups to decide whether to purchase at a given price. We examine the effect of social sharing under different network structures (decentralized, centralized, and complete), which reflect a range of market conditions. Moreover, we draw from the mechanism design literature to examine several approaches to group decision making. Our results suggest that a firm can benefit from increased social sharing if the level of sharing is already high, enabling a pricing strategy targeted primarily at sharing groups rather than individuals. However, the point at which sharing becomes marginally beneficial for a firm depends on both the distribution of group sizes (which derives from the network structure) and the group decision mechanism. Additional insights are obtained when we extend the model to capture homophily in group formation and the potential that a subset of consumers will never share for ethical reasons.

Title: Optimal Admission and Scholarship Decisions: Choosing Customized Marketing Offers to Attract a Desirable Mix of Customers
Abstract: Each year in the postsecondary education industry, schools offer admission to nearly 3 million new students and scholarships totaling nearly $100 billion. This is a large, understudied targeted marketing and price discrimination problem. This problem falls into a broader class of configuration utility problems (CUPs), which typically require an approach tailored to exploit the particular setting. This paper provides such an approach for the admission and scholarship decisions problem. The approach accounts for the key distinguishing feature of this industry--schools value the average features of the matriculating students such as percent female, percent from different regions of the world, average test scores, and average grade point average. Thus, as in any CUP, the value of one object (i.e., student) cannot be separated from the composition of all of the objects (other students in the enrolling class). This goal of achieving a class with a desirable set of average characteristics greatly complicates the optimization problem and does not allow the application of standard approaches. We develop a new approach that solves this more complex optimization problem using an empirical system to estimate each student's choice and the focal school's utility function. We test the approach in a field study of an MBA scholarship process and implement adjusted scholarship decisions. Using a holdout sample, we provide evidence that the methodology can lead to improvements over current management decisions. Finally, by comparing our solution to what management would do on its own, we provide insight into how to improve management decisions in this setting.

Title: Periodic Advertising Pulsing in a Competitive Market
Abstract: The question as to the optimality of advertising pulsing has attracted many researchers over the last half-century. In this paper we specify a market share model in which there are two advertising-setting firms as well as a no-purchase option. The framework is that of a first-order Markov process with three states. The objective of both firms is to maximize profits. We are able to demonstrate, for a diminishing returns advertising function, that the optimal advertising strategy is pulsing. The frequency of the advertising pulse is shown to depend on the magnitude of the market share retention rate (state dependence); the higher it is, the less frequent the advertising. We further find that the optimal advertising budgets do not remain the same when the frequency of pulsing changes. Finally, we show that it is optimal for both firms to advertise in phase.

Title: Intertemporal Movie Distribution: Versioning When Customers Can Buy Both Versions
Abstract: We study a model of film distribution and consumption. The studio can release two goods, a theatrical version and a video version, and has to decide on its versioning and sequencing strategy. In contrast with the previous literature, we allow for the possibility that some consumers may watch both versions. This simple extension leads to novel results. It now becomes optimal to introduce versioning if the goods are not too substitute for one another, even when production costs are zero (pure information goods). We also demonstrate that the simultaneous release of the versions ("day-and-date" strategy) can be optimal when the studio is integrated with the exhibition and distribution channels. In contrast, a sequential release ("video window" strategy) is typically the outcome when the studio negotiates with independent distributors and exhibitors.

Title: Investigating the Drivers of Consumer Cross-Category Learning for New Products Using Multiple Data Sets
Abstract: Consumer new product adoption and preference evolution or learning may be influenced by intrinsic or internal factors (e.g., usage experiences, personal characteristics), external influences (e.g., social effects, media), and marketing activities of the firm. Moreover, the preference evolution in a certain category can spill over to other categories; i.e., consumers can exhibit cross-category learning. In this paper, we develop a multicategory framework to analyze the role of the above elements in the formation and evolution of consumer preferences across categories. We analyze these elements by employing multiple data sets, i.e., by combining revealed preference data (from scanner panel), stated data (from surveys measuring consumer lifestyle variables and demographics), and external influences (e.g., media mentions) in a completely heterogeneous framework while considering other facets of the learning process. By jointly estimating the model for organic purchases in six distinct food categories, we also explore the role of category differences. Results show that consumer new product adoption and learning is indeed impacted significantly and to various degrees by the aforementioned factors. We show how, by selectively encouraging purchases under various scenarios, firms can accelerate the learning process, not only for the focal category but also for other categories, thereby realizing considerable incremental profits. These results can be used by both manufacturers and retailers for more efficient allocation of marketing budgets across (new) products.

Title: Network Traces on Penetration: Uncovering Degree Distribution from Adoption Data
Abstract: We show how networks modify the diffusion curve by affecting its symmetry. We demonstrate that a network's degree distribution has a significant impact on the contagion properties of the subsequent adoption process, and we propose a method for uncovering the degree distribution of the adopter network underlying the dissemination process, based exclusively on limited early-stage penetration data. In this paper we propose and empirically validate a unified network-based growth model that links network structure and penetration patterns. Specifically, using external sources of information, we confirm that each network degree distribution identified by the model matches the actual social network that is underlying the dissemination process. We also show empirically that the same method can be used to forecast adoption using an estimation of the degree distribution and the diffusion parameters at an early stage (15%) of the penetration process. We confirm that these forecasts are significantly superior to those of three benchmark models of diffusion.</p> <p>Our empirical analysis indicates that under heavily right-skewed degree distribution conditions (such as scale-free networks), the majority of adopters (in some cases, up to 75%) join the process after the sales peak. This strong asymmetry is a result of the unique interaction between the dissemination process and the degree distribution of its underlying network.

Title: Unintended Nutrition Consequences: Firm Responses to the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act
Abstract: This paper investigates how firms responded to standardized nutrition labels on food products required by the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act (NLEA). Using a longitudinal quasi-experimental design, we test our predictions using two large-scale samples that span 30 product categories. Results indicate that the NLEA reduced brand nutritional quality relative to a control group of products not regulated by the NLEA. At the same time, among regulated products, brand taste increased. Although this reduction in nutrition represents an unintended consequence of regulation, there were a set of category, firm, and brand conditions under which the NLEA produced a positive effect on brand nutritional quality. We find that firms were more likely to improve brand nutrition when firm risk or firm power is low. Lower risk occurs when the firm is introducing a new brand rather than changing an existing brand, and weaker power in a category is reflected by lower market share in a category. Furthermore, firms competing in low-health categories (e.g., potato chips) or small-portion categories (e.g., peanut butter) improved nutrition more than firms competing in high-health categories (e.g., bread) or large-portion categories (e.g., frozen dinners). Recommendations for firm strategy and the design of consumer information policy are examined in light of these surprising firm responses.

Title: Can Brand Extension Signal Product Quality?
Abstract: This paper asks whether brand extension can serve as a signal of product quality given that it costs less than a new brand. (Existing literature has assumed either that brand extension is cost-neutral or that it costs more.) I show that it can as a perfect Bayesian equilibrium, but the argument is unconvincing. For one thing, the separating equilibrium is not unique; a pooling equilibrium also exists in which brand extension signals nothing. For another, the separating equilibrium relies on off-equilibrium beliefs that are poorly motivated in the model. I propose a refinement of the perfect Bayesian equilibrium that resolves both issues. Empirical off-equilibrium beliefs require that consumers' off-equilibrium beliefs be justifiable on the basis of their prior beliefs and product performance observations. With empirical off-equilibrium beliefs, two necessary conditions for brand extension to signal product quality are identified: (i) consumers must perceive old and new products of the firm to be positively correlated in quality, and (ii) at least some consumers must identify with brands and not the firm behind the brands. Even with these conditions in place, the signaling argument is fragile: firm observability of past performance diminishes brand extension's signaling capability; an arbitrarily small probability of failure for good products eliminates it. My results suggest that, going forward, the case for brand extension must rest on foundations other than signaling product quality.

Title: Bidding Behavior in Descending and Ascending Auctions
Abstract: This research examines how individual differences and institutional practices influence consumer bidding in auctions. Bidders may be motivated by different goals, e.g., <i>thrill</i> (of winning the item, with minimal attention to what they pay for it) versus <i>prudence</i> (winning the item at a price at or below its perceived value). Also, innate or auctioneer-induced differences may exist in the <i>precision</i> and <i>salience</i> of bidder cognitions about the item's value. We report two studies on how these motivational and cognitive factors influence bids in descending and ascending auctions, respectively. Each study also manipulated a situational variable (<i>wait time</i> at each price step). The two auctions realized different average prices for the same item set. Average bids were higher in the descending (versus ascending) auction in several study conditions. In both auction formats, bidders primed with thrill (versus prudence) bid higher, but more precise and/or salient values attenuated this goal effect. Among other results, in the descending auction, longer wait times elicited higher bids from bidders primed with thrill (but not prudence). In the ascending auction, longer wait times produced lower bids for bidders primed with prudence (but not thrill). These findings on consumer bidding behavior have practical implications for auction design.

Title: Consumer Mental Accounts and Implications to Selling Base Products and Add-ons
Abstract: Firms in a variety of industries offer add-on products to consumers who have previously purchased a base product. We posit that consumers, in making their decisions as to whether to purchase add-ons that complement the base products, find a greater need for the value offered by the add-ons when the "unrecovered" value (i.e., price paid minus the benefits obtained so far) associated with the base products is higher. We conduct experiments that test the proposed hypothesis and examine the strategic implications of such consumer decision making to a firm that sells base product add-on pairs.</p> <p>Consistent with our hypothesis, the experiments show that a consumer's unrecovered value associated with the base product is positively correlated to his likelihood of purchasing the add-on. Formal modeling of this bias shows that firms may find penetration pricing strategies (such as loss leader pricing) suboptimal. Furthermore, the identified bias leads the firm to spend more resources toward enhancing both the base product and the add-on quality, especially so when the add-on will be offered before the consumer has a chance to extensively use the base product. Finally, the effect of competition in the base product market is also considered.

Title: How Does the Use of Trademarks by Third-Party Sellers Affect Online Search?
Abstract: Firms that sell via a direct channel <i>and</i> via indirect channels have to decide whether to allow third-party sellers to use trademarked brand names of products in their advertising. This question has been particularly controversial for advertising on search engines. In June 2009, Google started allowing any third-party reseller of a product to use a trademark such as "DoubleTree" in the text of its ad, even if the reseller did not have the trademark holder's permission. We study the effects of this change empirically within the hotel industry. We find some evidence that allowing third-party sellers to use a trademark in their online search advertising weakly reduced the likelihood of a consumer clicking on a trademark holder's paid search ads. However, the decrease in paid clicks was outweighed by a large increase in consumers clicking on the unpaid links to the hotelier's website within the main search results. Our evidence shows that when a third-party seller focuses on a trademarked brand in its ads, the ads become less distinct, and customers are more likely to ignore the advertised offers and buy from the direct channel.

Title: State-Dependence Effects in Surveys
Abstract: In recent years academic research has focused on understanding and modeling the survey response process. This paper examines an understudied systematic response tendency in surveys: the extent to which observed responses are subject to state dependence, i.e., response carryover from one item to another independent of specific item content. We develop a statistical model that simultaneously accounts for state dependence, item content, and scale usage heterogeneity. The paper explores how state dependence varies by response category, item characteristics, item sequence, respondent characteristics, and whether it becomes stronger as the survey progresses. Two empirical applications provide evidence of substantial and significant state dependence. We find that the degree of state dependence depends on item characteristics and item sequence, and it varies across individuals and countries. The article demonstrates that ignoring state dependence may affect reliability and predictive validity, and it provides recommendations for survey researchers.

Title: Self-Control and Incentives: An Analysis of Multiperiod Quota Plans
Abstract: It is well known that individuals often fail to exert proper self-control. In organizational settings, this can lead to reduced productivity and profits. We use the literature on present-biased preferences to model employees' self-control problems and examine how firms can design compensation plans to reduce the negative consequences of their employees' self-control problems. Our results suggest that firms can mitigate self-control problems by delaying payment to the employees. This can be achieved by using multiperiod quotas (such as annual quotas) to compensate employees for their cumulative performance. Although such plans are prevalent in the market, there is little theoretical research that shows when multiperiod quota plans can be optimal. The paper provides one potential explanation for the widespread use of such quota plans. Interestingly, we find that such plans may be optimal despite the fact that they encourage more procrastination. We also find that such plans lead to higher effort by the employees and can sometimes improve the welfare of not only the firm but also the employees.

Title: A Satisficing Choice Model
Abstract: Although the assumption of utility-maximizing consumers has been challenged for decades, empirical applications of alternative choice rules are still very new. We add to this growing body of literature by proposing a model based on the idea of a "satisficing" decision maker. In contrast to previous models (including recent models implementing alternative choice rules), satisficing depends on the order in which alternatives are evaluated. We therefore conduct a visual conjoint experiment to collect search and choice data. We model search and product evaluation jointly and allow for interdependence between them. The choice rule incorporates a conjunctive rule for the evaluations and, contrary to most previous models, does not rely on compensatory trade-offs at all. The results strongly support the proposed model. For instance, we find that search is indeed influenced by product evaluations. More importantly, the model results strongly support the satisficing stopping rule. Finally, we perform a holdout prediction task and find that the proposed model outperforms a standard multinomial logit model.

Title: Peer Effects in the Diffusion of Solar Photovoltaic Panels
Abstract: Social interaction (peer) effects are recognized as a potentially important factor in the diffusion of new products. In the case of environmentally friendly goods or technologies, both marketers and policy makers are interested in the presence of causal peer effects as social spillovers can be used to expedite adoption. We provide a methodology for the simple, straightforward identification of peer effects with sufficiently rich data, avoiding the biases that occur with traditional fixed effects estimation when using the past installed base of consumers in the reference group. We study the diffusion of solar photovoltaic panels in California and find that at the average number of owner-occupied homes in a zip code, an additional installation increases the probability of an adoption in the zip code by 0.78 percentage points.

Title: Competition in Consumer Shopping Experience
Abstract: This paper analyzes the competitive role of retail shopping experience in markets with consumer search costs. We examine how a retailer's advantage in providing consumer shopping experience affects its equilibrium pricing and price advertising strategies. We find that if the consumer valuation of a shopping experience is sufficiently low, its effect on retailer strategy is similar to that of quality, and the retailer with the advantage in shopping experience then deploys higher levels of price advertising. On the other hand, when the shopping experience is valuable enough for consumers, it acts akin to price advertising in that it makes it optimal for the retailer with the advantage in shopping experience to eschew price advertising. The optimal competitive investments in consumer shopping experience can be higher than that of a monopoly. The profit impact of shopping experience for a retailer depends on the level of shopping experience: for low levels, the profit impact depends on the difference in the levels between the retailers, but for high enough levels, it depends only on whether the retailer's shopping experience level is higher than that of its competitor. In this case, even small differences in shopping experience levels can result in large differences in equilibrium profits.

Title: Firm Innovation and the Ratchet Effect Among Consumer Packaged Goods Firms
Abstract: We consider how public firms influence their stock market valuations by timing the introduction of innovative new products. Our focus is on <i>innovation ratchet strategy</i>--firms timing the introduction of innovations in order to demonstrate an improvement in the number of introductions over time. We document that public firms use an innovation ratchet strategy more often than do private firms and that the stock market rewards public firms for doing so. These rewards from the stock market, however, come at the expense of performance in product markets. Specifically, because firms using an innovation ratchet strategy delay some product introductions, they have significantly lower sales growth in the year they ratchet. Finally, we identify firm and market characteristics that influence the likelihood that a public firm will engage in an innovation ratchet strategy.

Title: An Empirical Study of Word-of-Mouth Generation and Consumption
Abstract: Word-of-mouth (WOM) plays an increasingly important role in shaping consumers' attitudes and buying behaviors. Prior work in marketing has mainly focused on the aggregate impact of WOM on product sales as well as the generation of WOM. Very little attention has been paid to the consumption or usage of WOM. In this paper, utilizing a unique data set that collects information from the automobile category on whether a consumer generates WOM to others and uses WOM for making purchase decisions, we build a discrete-choice model to study consumer WOM generation and WOM consumption decisions simultaneously and empirically answer questions that have not been explored previously. We are particularly interested in studying the key drivers of WOM generation/consumption and the synergy effect between the two WOM-related activities. We apply the proposed model to survey data collected on the automobile category. We find a strong synergy between WOM generation and WOM consumption. Although some consumers view WOM generation and WOM consumption as complementary to each other, others tend to perceive the two activities as competing with each other. We also find that consumer product experience and media exposure are positively correlated with their propensity to generate WOM. However, their effect on WOM consumption is mixed. Our empirical analysis also provides evidence of unobserved heterogeneity in the way consumer WOM activities are related to consumer product experience. Overall, these findings lead to important managerial implications on targeting for effective use of WOM as a marketing tool.

Title: Predicting the Path of Technological Innovation: SAW vs. Moore, Bass, Gompertz, and Kryder
Abstract: Competition is intense among rival technologies, and success depends on predicting their future trajectory of performance. To resolve this challenge, managers often follow popular heuristics, generalizations, or "laws" such as Moore's law. We propose a model, Step And Wait (SAW), for predicting the path of technological innovation, and we compare its performance against eight models for 25 technologies and 804 technologies-years across six markets. The estimates of the model provide four important results. First, Moore's law and Kryder's law do not generalize across markets; neither holds for all technologies even in a single market. Second, SAW produces superior predictions over traditional methods, such as the Bass model or Gompertz law, and can form predictions for a completely new technology by incorporating information from other categories on time-varying covariates. Third, analysis of the model parameters suggests that (i) recent technologies improve at a faster rate than old technologies; (ii) as the number of competitors increases, performance improves in smaller steps and longer waits; (iii) later entrants and technologies that have a number of prior steps tend to have smaller steps and shorter waits; but (iv) technologies with a long average wait time continue to have large steps. Fourth, technologies cluster in their performance by market.

Title: Contextual Advertising
Abstract: Contextual advertising entails the display of relevant ads based on the content that consumers view, exploiting the potential that consumers' content preferences are indicative of their product preferences. This paper studies the strategic aspects of such advertising, considering an intermediary who has access to a content base, sells advertising space to advertisers who compete in the product market, and provides the targeting technology. The results show that contextual targeting impacts advertiser profit in two ways: First, advertising through relevant content topics helps advertisers reach consumers with a strong preference for their product. Second, heterogeneity in consumers' <i>content</i> preferences can be leveraged to reduce <i>product</i> market competition, especially when competition is intense. The intermediary has incentives to strategically design its targeting technology, sometimes at the cost of the advertisers. When product market competition is moderate, the intermediary offers accurate targeting such that the consumers see the most relevant ads. When competition is high, the intermediary lowers the targeting accuracy such that the consumers see less relevant ads. Doing so intensifies competition and encourages advertisers to bid for multiple content topics in order to prevent their competitors from reaching consumers. In some cases, this may lead to an asymmetric equilibrium where one advertiser bids high even for the content topic that is more relevant to its competitor.

Title: Consumer Deliberation and Product Line Design
Abstract: This paper studies optimal product line design when consumers need to incur costly deliberation to uncover their valuations for quality. To induce deliberation, a firm must maintain quality dispersion and cut the price of the high-end product so that consumers are motivated to deliberate in the hope that high-end consumption fits their needs. To prevent deliberation, the firm may have to offer downgraded quality at a low price so that an impulsive purchase will not appear too wasteful. Whether the firm should induce deliberation depends on how much surplus it creates by aligning the supply of quality with heterogeneous demand for quality and how much surplus it captures during this process. Interestingly, equilibrium firm profit, consumer surplus, and social welfare can all increase with the cost of deliberation. We extend the model to accommodate consumers' heterogeneous prior beliefs of their valuations for quality. We also discuss how market research could benefit from taking into account the endogeneity of consumer deliberation.

Title: Database Submission--The ISMS Durable Goods Data Sets
Abstract: This paper describes two new data sets available to academic researchers (at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://www.informs.org/Community/ISMS">http://www.informs.org/Community/ISMS</ext-link>). The first is a panel data set containing the transactions of 19,936 households made over the period from December 1998 to November 2004 at a major U.S. consumer electronics retailer. There are a total of 173,262 transactions, including purchases and returns of products as well as extended warranties. There are 16 product categories and 292 subcategories, ranging from big-ticket items such as televisions to small-ticket items such as CDs and batteries. The second data set features a field experiment for a Christmas promotion that took place in December 2003 in the form of a direct mailing sent to a randomly selected group of households at the end of November 2003. We describe the data and the potential research issues that can be studied using these two durable goods data sets.

Title: Retailer-Driven Product Bundling in a Distribution Channel
Abstract: This paper studies product bundling in a distribution channel where a downstream retailer combines component goods produced by separate manufacturers acting independently. Past literature offers deep insights about bundling by a single firm whose unit costs are not impacted by choice of selling strategy. But when the retailer bundles goods from separate manufacturers, unit costs for the bundler (retailer) are, being the prices set by the manufacturers, no longer exogenous. This alters the economic balance with respect to bundling. I show that channel conflicts weaken the case for bundling. Although bundling is better than component selling for the integrated firm, it is no longer so in the decentralized channel. The culprit is a combination of vertical channel conflict (incentive misalignment with respect to bundle versus component sales) and horizontal conflict (each manufacturer wants a higher share of profits from bundle sales), with the latter playing a dominant role. They cause manufacturers to overprice component goods, weakening the retailer's incentives to bundle. The competitive interplay between firms when one (retailer) merges the prices of several (manufacturers) leads to lower profits for all. Price coordination between the firms could partially restore the role of bundling and improve the firms' profits as well as consumer surplus.
