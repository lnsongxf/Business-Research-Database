Title: Drug Detailing and Doctors’ Prescription Decisions: The Role of Information Content in the Face of Competitive Entry
Abstract: We study the effects of information content in 59,814 pharmaceutical sales calls on doctors’ prescription decisions for statins, in the face of entry of competing brands and generics, using a hierarchical Bayesian distributed lag model. We conclude that adding information content to the prescription response model improves the in- and out-of-sample performance of the model. In the first six months following generic entry, it is more effective for incumbent brands to detail on drug contraindications and indications, compared to other periods, to positively differentiate from generics. In the first six months following branded entry, it is less effective for incumbent brands to detail on drug indications and costs, given increased competitive clutter. We also document substantial heterogeneity among doctors in their response to information content. Our model is helpful for analysts to more accurately assess the effectiveness of detailing. Our empirical results are also informative for drug manufacturers as they set or change their messaging policies in response to entry and help firms to tailor their message content at the doctor level.Data, as supplemental material, are available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri"  href="https://doi.org/10.1287/mksc.2015.0971">https://doi.org/10.1287/mksc.2015.0971</ext-link>.

Title: Quantifying Cross and Direct Network Effects in Online Consumer-to-Consumer Platforms
Abstract: Consumer-to-consumer (C2C) platforms have become a major engine of growth in Internet commerce. This is especially true in countries such as China, which are experiencing a big rush toward e-commerce. The emergence of such platforms gives researchers the unique opportunity to investigate the evolution of such platforms by focusing on the growth of both buyers and sellers. In this research, we build a utility-based model to quantify both cross and direct network effects on Alibaba Group’s Taobao.com, the world’s largest online C2C platform (based in China). Specifically, we investigate the relative contributions of different factors that affect the growth of buyers and sellers on the platform. Our results suggest that the direct network effects do not play a big role in the platform’s growth (we detect a small positive direct network effect on buyer growth and no direct network effect on seller growth). More importantly, we find a significant, large and positive cross-network effect on both sides of the platform. In other words, the installed base of either side of the platform has propelled the growth of the other side (and thus the overall growth). Interestingly, this cross-network effect is asymmetric with the installed base of sellers having a much larger effect on the growth of buyers than vice versa. The growth in the number of buyers is driven primarily by the seller’s installed base and product variety with increasing importance of product variety. The growth in the number of sellers is driven by buyer’s installed base, buyer quality, and product price with increasing importance of buyer quality. We also investigate the nature of these cross-network effects over time. We find that the cross-network effect of sellers on buyers increases and then decreases to reach a stable level. By contrast, the cross-network effect of buyers on sellers is relatively stable. We discuss the policy implications of these findings for C2C platforms in general and Taobao in particular.Data, as supplemental material, are available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri"  href="https://doi.org/10.1287/mksc.2016.0976">https://doi.org/10.1287/mksc.2016.0976</ext-link>.

Title: Anticipated vs. Actual Synergy in Merger Partner Selection and Post-Merger Innovation
Abstract: Past research has primarily focused on what happens after a merger. This research attempts to determine whether anticipated benefits from the merger actually accrue. We characterize the effects of observed variables on whether pairs of firms merge, vis-à-vis roommate matching, and then link these factors to post-merger innovation (i.e., number of patents). We jointly estimate the two models using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods with a unique panel data set of 1,979 mergers between 4,444 firms across industries and countries from 1992 to 2008. We find that similarity in national culture and technical knowledge has a positive effect on partner selection and post-merger innovation. Anticipated synergy from subindustry similarity, however, is not realized in post-merger innovation. Furthermore, some key synergy sources are unanticipated when selecting a merger partner. For example, financial synergy from higher total assets and complementarity in total assets and debt leverage as well as knowledge synergy from breadth and depth of knowledge positively influence innovation but not partner selection. Furthermore, factors that dilute synergy (e.g., higher debt levels) are unanticipated, and firms merge with firms that detract from their innovation potential. Overall, the results reveal some incongruity between anticipated and realized synergy.Data, as supplemental material, are available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri"  href="https://doi.org/10.1287/mksc.2016.0978">https://doi.org/10.1287/mksc.2016.0978</ext-link>.

Title: Attribution Strategies and Return on Keyword Investment in Paid Search Advertising
Abstract: Firms use different attribution strategies such as last-click or first-click attribution to assign conversion credits to search keywords that appear in their consumers’ paths to purchase. These attributed credits impact a firm’s future bidding and budget allocations among keywords and, in turn, determine the overall return-on-investment of search campaigns. In this paper, we model the relationship among the advertiser’s bidding decision for keywords, the search engine’s ranking decision for these keywords, and the consumer’s click-through rate and conversion rate on each keyword, and analyze the impact of the attribution strategy on the overall return-on-investment of paid search advertising.We estimate our simultaneous equations model using a six-month panel data of several hundred keywords from an online jewelry retailer. The data comprises a quasi-experiment as the firm changed attribution strategy from last-click to first-click attribution halfway through the data window. Our results show that returns for keyword investments vary significantly under the different attribution strategies. For the focal firm, first-click attribution leads to lower revenue returns and a more pronounced decrease for more specific keywords. Our policy simulation exercise shows how the firm can increase its overall returns by better attributing the real contribution of keywords. We discuss how an appropriate attribution strategy can help firms to better target customers and lower acquisition costs in the context of paid search advertising.Data, as supplemental material, are available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri"  href="https://doi.org/10.1287/mksc.2016.0987">https://doi.org/10.1287/mksc.2016.0987</ext-link>.

Title: Do Sympathy Biases Induce Charitable Giving? The Effects of Advertising Content
Abstract: We randomize advertising content motivated by the psychology literature on sympathy generation and framing effects in mailings to about 185,000 prospective <i>new</i> donors in India. We find a significant impact on the number of donors and amounts donated consistent with sympathy biases such as the “identifiable victim,” “in-group,” and “reference dependence.” A monthly reframing of the ask amount increases donors and the amount donated relative to daily reframing. A second field experiment targeted to <i>past</i> donors, finds that the effect of sympathy bias on giving is smaller in percentage terms but statistically and economically highly significant in terms of the magnitude of additional dollars raised. Methodologically, the paper complements the work of behavioral scholars by adopting an empirical researchers’ lens of measuring <i>relative</i> effect sizes and economic relevance of multiple behavioral theoretical constructs in the sympathy bias and charity domain within one field setting. Beyond the benefit of conceptual replications, the effect sizes provide guidance to managers on which behavioral theories are most managerially and economically relevant when developing advertising content.Data, as supplemental material, are available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri"  href="https://doi.org/10.1287/mksc.2016.0989">https://doi.org/10.1287/mksc.2016.0989</ext-link>.

Title: Investigating Purchase Conversion by Uncovering Online Visit Patterns
Abstract: This research aims to understand and predict online customers’ store visit and purchase behaviors. To this end, we develop a model that accounts for different patterns of online store visits at the individual level. Given the latency of visit patterns, we employ a changepoint modeling framework and statistically infer them using a Bayesian approach. The inferences obtained are then used to examine the effects of visit patterns on purchase dynamics across store visits. Using Internet clickstream data at an online retailer, we find that online store visit patterns tend to be clustered with significant variation across customers in terms of the number and size of visit clusters as well as the visit frequencies, both within and between clusters. Furthermore, the conversion rates vary significantly, depending on store visit patterns, such that they tend to be higher at later visits within a visit cluster, compared with earlier visits. The proposed model thereby offers superior fit and predictive performance than benchmark models that ignore clustered visit patterns and their impact on purchase behavior. We demonstrate the model’s ability to better identify prospective customers by utilizing their visit patterns, which can assist marketers in scoring customers and making targeting decisions across individuals for marketing activity.Data, as supplemental material, are available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri"  href="https://doi.org/10.1287/mksc.2016.0990">https://doi.org/10.1287/mksc.2016.0990</ext-link>.

Title: When Random Assignment Is Not Enough: Accounting for Item Selectivity in Experimental Research
Abstract: Experimental methods are critical tools in marketing, psychology, and economics to isolate the effects of key variables from vagaries intrinsic to field data. As such, they are often considered exempt from the sort of sample selectivity artifacts widely documented in empirical research, in part because participants are randomly assigned to experimental conditions. To conserve time and resources, experiments often focus on items participants have chosen or are familiar with, for example, postchoice satisfaction ratings, certain free recall tasks, or specifying consideration sets preceding brand choice. When consumer input even partially influences the items about which researchers request subsequent data, the potential for <i>item selectivity</i> arises. In such situations, analyses are contingent on both the choice context(s) of the experiment and the alternatives participants elect to evaluate, potentially leading to substantial item selectivity overall and to differing degrees across conditions. We examine situations in which a nonignorable “choose one of many” (polytomous) selection process limits which items offer up subsequent information, and develop methods to allow substantive results to pertain to the full set of items, not only those selected. The framework is illustrated via two experiments in which participants choose and then evaluate a frequently purchased consumer good as well as data first examined by Ratner et al. [Ratner RK, Kahn BE, Kahneman D (1999) Choosing less-preferred experiences for the sake of variety. <i>J. Consumer Res.</i> 26(1):1–15]. Results indicate substantial item selectivity that, when corrected for, can lead to markedly different interpretations of focal variable effects, such as large effect size changes and even sign reversal. Moreover, failing to flexibly account for item selectivity <i>across experimental conditions</i>, even in well-designed experimental settings, can lead to inaccurate substantive inferences about consumers’ evaluative criteria. We further demonstrate robustness to theoretically driven (but not overtly misspecified) selection rules and provide researchers with a simple, “two-step” exploratory procedure akin to a “control function” approach—involving just one additional variable added to standard models—to determine whether and to what degree item selectivity may be affecting their substantive results.Data, as supplemental material, are available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri"  href="https://doi.org/10.1287/mksc.2016.0991">https://doi.org/10.1287/mksc.2016.0991</ext-link>.

Title: Modeling Multimodal Continuous Heterogeneity in Conjoint Analysis—A Sparse Learning Approach
Abstract: Consumers’ preferences can often be represented using a multimodal continuous heterogeneity distribution. One explanation for such a preference distribution is that consumers belong to a few distinct segments, with preferences of consumers in each segment being heterogeneous and unimodal. We propose an innovative approach for modeling such multimodal distributions that builds on recent advances in sparse learning and optimization. We apply the model to conjoint analysis where consumer heterogeneity plays a critical role in determining optimal marketing decisions. Our approach uses a two-stage divide-and-conquer framework, where we first divide the consumer population into segments by recovering a set of candidate segmentations using sparsity modeling, and then use each candidate segmentation to develop a set of individual-level heterogeneity representations. We select the optimal individual-level heterogeneity representation using cross-validation. Using extensive simulation experiments and three field data sets, we show the superior performance of our sparse learning model compared to benchmark models including the finite mixture model and the Bayesian normal component mixture model.Data, as supplemental material, are available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri"  href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mksc.2016.0992">http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mksc.2016.0992</ext-link>.

Title: Sentence-Based Text Analysis for Customer Reviews
Abstract: Firms collect an increasing amount of consumer feedback in the form of unstructured consumer reviews. These reviews contain text about consumer experiences with products and services that are different from surveys that query consumers for specific information. A challenge in analyzing unstructured consumer reviews is in making sense of the topics that are expressed in the words used to describe these experiences. We propose a new model for text analysis that makes use of the sentence structure contained in the reviews and show that it leads to improved inference and prediction of consumer ratings relative to existing models using data from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri"  href="http://www.expedia.com">www.expedia.com</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri"  href="http://www.we8there.com">www.we8there.com</ext-link>.

Title: Idea Generation, Creativity, and Prototypicality
Abstract: We explore the use of big data tools to shed new light on the idea generation process, automatically “read” ideas to identify promising ones, and help people be more creative. The literature suggests that creativity results from the optimal balance between novelty and familiarity, which can be measured based on the combinations of words in an idea. We build semantic networks where nodes represent word stems in a particular idea generation topic, and edge weights capture the degree of novelty versus familiarity of word stem combinations (i.e., the weight of an edge that connects two word stems measures their scaled co-occurrence in the relevant language). Each idea contains a set of word stems, which form a semantic subnetwork. The edge weight distribution in that subnetwork reflects how the idea balances novelty with familiarity. Based on the “beauty in averageness” effect, we hypothesize that ideas with semantic subnetworks that have a more prototypical edge weight distribution are judged as more creative. We show this effect in eight studies involving over 4,000 ideas across multiple domains. Practically, we demonstrate how our research can be used to automatically identify promising ideas and recommend words to users on the fly to help them improve their ideas.Data, as supplemental material, are available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri"  href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mksc.2016.0994">http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mksc.2016.0994</ext-link>.

Title: Simultaneous or Sequential? Search Strategies in the U.S. Auto Insurance Industry
Abstract: We study the identification of the search method consumers use when resolving uncertainty in the prices of alternatives. We show that the search method—simultaneous or sequential—is identified with data on consumers’ consideration sets (but not the sequence of searches), prices for the considered alternatives and marketwide price distributions. We show that identification comes from differences in the patterns of actual prices in consumers’ consideration sets across search methods. We also provide a new estimation approach for the sequential search model that uses such data. Using data on consumer shopping behavior in the U.S. auto insurance industry that contain information on consideration sets and choices, we find that the pattern of actual prices in consumers’ consideration sets is consistent with consumers searching simultaneously. Via counterfactuals we show that the consideration set and purchase market shares of the largest insurance companies are overpredicted under the incorrect assumption of sequential search. As the search method affects consumers’ consideration sets, which in turn influence brand choices, understanding the nature of consumer search and its implications for consideration and choice is important from a managerial perspective.Data, as supplemental material, are available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri"  href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mksc.2016.0995">http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mksc.2016.0995</ext-link>.

Title: When Less Is More: Data and Power in Advertising Experiments
Abstract: Yahoo! Research partnered with a nationwide retailer to study the effects of online display advertising on both online and in-store purchases. We use a randomized field experiment on 3 million Yahoo! users who are also past customers of the retailer. We find statistically significant evidence that the retailer ads increase sales 3.6% relative to the control group. We show that control ads boost measurement precision by identifying and removing the half of in-campaign sales data that are unaffected by the ads. Less data give us 31% more precision in our estimates—equivalent to increasing our sample to 5.3 million users. By contrast, we only improve precision by 5% when we include additional covariate data to reduce the residual variance in our experimental regression. The covariate-adjustment strategy disappoints despite exceptional consumer-level data including demographics, ad exposure levels, and two years’ worth of past purchase history.Data, as supplemental material, are available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri"  href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mksc.2016.0998">http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mksc.2016.0998</ext-link>.

Title: Cartel Formation Through Strategic Information Leakage in a Distribution Channel
Abstract: This paper studies the ability of competing retailers to form a cartel by sharing information with their mutual manufacturer. In a market characterized by demand uncertainty, colluding retailers wish to share information about the potential market demand to coordinate on the optimal collusive retail price. However, in light of potential exposure to antitrust investigations and possible sanctions, the retailers search for mechanisms to exchange information while avoiding the risks of scrutiny by the antitrust authorities. This paper examines such a mechanism: each retailer shares his private information with the mutual manufacturer; the wholesale price set by the latter is thereafter used by the retailers to infer the market condition and coordinate on the cartel’s price. Although a cartel at the retail level limits the manufacturer’s sold quantity, under certain conditions the manufacturer is better off accepting the retailers’ private information, thereby assisting the cartel formation. Moreover, vertical information sharing between the retailers and their mutual manufacturer can result in lower consumer surplus than that would have occurred had the retailers been permitted to collude directly.

Title: Spillover Effects in Seeded Word-of-Mouth Marketing Campaigns
Abstract: Seeded marketing campaigns (SMCs) involve firms sending products to selected customers and encouraging them to spread word of mouth (WOM). Prior research has examined certain aspects of this increasingly popular form of marketing communication, such as seeding strategies and their efficacy. Building on prior research, this study investigates the effects of SMCs that extend beyond the generation of WOM for a campaign’s focal product by considering how seeding can affect WOM spillover effects at the brand and category levels. The authors introduce a framework of SMC-related spillover effects, and empirically estimate these with a unique data set covering 390 SMCs for products from 192 different cosmetics brands. Multiple spillover effects are found, suggesting that while SMCs can be used primarily to stimulate WOM for a focal product, marketers must also account for brand- and category-level WOM spillover effects. Specifically, seeding increases conversations about that product among nonseed consumers, and, interestingly, decreases WOM about other products from the same brand and about competitors’ products in the same category as the focal product. These findings indicate that marketers can use SMCs to focus online WOM on a particular product by drawing consumers away from talking about other related, but off-topic, products.Data, as supplemental material, are available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri"  href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mksc.2016.1001">http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mksc.2016.1001</ext-link>.

Title: Television Advertising and Online Word-of-Mouth: An Empirical Investigation of Social TV Activity
Abstract: In this research, we investigate the relationship between television advertising and online word-of-mouth (WOM) by examining the joint consumption of television programming and production of social media by television viewers, termed social TV. We explore how television advertising impacts the volume of online WOM about advertised brands and about the programs in which the advertisements air. We also examine what encourages or discourages viewers to engage in this particular social TV activity. Using data containing television advertising instances and the volume of minute-by-minute social media mentions, our analyses reveal that television advertising impacts the volume of online WOM for both the brand advertised <i>and</i> the program in which the advertisement airs. We additionally find that the programs that receive the most online WOM are not necessarily the best programs for advertisers interested in online engagement for their brands. Finally, our results highlight the brand, advertisement, and program characteristics that can encourage or discourage social TV activity. We discuss the implications of our findings for media planning strategies and advertisement design strategies.Data, as supplemental material, are available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri"  href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mksc.2016.1002">http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mksc.2016.1002</ext-link>.

Title: Benefit-Based Conjoint Analysis
Abstract: Firms develop products by manipulating the attributes of offerings, and consumers derive utility from the benefits that the attributes afford. While the field of marketing has long been aware of the distinction between attributes and benefits, it has not developed methods for understanding how attributes and benefits are related. This paper develops a benefit-based model for conjoint analysis that assumes consumers satiate on attributes that are perceived to provide the same benefit. A latent-variable model is proposed that estimates the map between attributes and benefits, and is applied to data from two conjoint studies involving a durable product and a household consumable. The model is shown to fit the data better, provide improved predictions, and lead to different product design implications than the standard conjoint model.Data, as supplemental material, are available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri"  href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mksc.2016.1003">http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mksc.2016.1003</ext-link>.

Title: Product Line Bundling: Why Airlines Bundle High-End While Hotels Bundle Low-End
Abstract: Product lines are ubiquitous. For example, Marriott International manages high-end ultra-luxury hotels (e.g., Ritz-Carlton) and low-end economy hotels (e.g., Fairfield Inn). Firms often bundle core products with ancillary services (or add-ons). Interestingly, empirical observations reveal that industries with ostensibly similar characteristics (e.g., customer types, costs, competition, distribution channels, etc.) employ different bundling strategies. For example, airlines bundle high-end first class with ancillary services (e.g., breakfast, entertainment) while hotel chains bundle ancillary services (e.g., breakfast, entertainment) at the low-end. We observe, unlike hotel lines that are highly differentiated at different geographic locations, airlines suffer low core differentiation because all passengers (first-class and economy) are at the same location (i.e., same plane, weather, delays, cancellations, etc.). In general, we find product lines with low core differentiation (e.g., airlines, amusement parks) routinely bundle high-end while product lines with highly differentiated cores (e.g., hotels, restaurants) routinely bundle low-end. High-end bundling makes the high-end more attractive, increasing line differentiation (less intraline competition) while low-end bundling decreases line differentiation. Therefore, bundling allows optimal differentiation given a differentiation constraint (complex costs). Last, firms may use strategic bundling for targeting in their core products; e.g., low-end hotels bundle targeted add-ons unattractive to high-end consumers such as lower-quality breakfasts and slower Internet.Data, as supplemental material, are available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri"  href="https://doi.org/10.1287/mksc.2016.1004">https://doi.org/10.1287/mksc.2016.1004</ext-link>.
