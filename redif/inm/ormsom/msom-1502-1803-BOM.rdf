Title: The Role of Modular Upgradability as a Green Design Strategy
Abstract: Modular upgradability has been suggested as a strategy for improving environmental performance: as technology improves, it allows for independent replacement of improving subsystems, instead of replacing the entire product. This may extend the useful life of stable subsystems, reducing production and disposal impact. However, this argument ignores the effect of modular upgradability on a firm's development and introduction decisions and the environmental impact during the use phase. In this paper, we investigate when modular upgradability leads to lower environmental impact and higher profits. We do so by endogenizing a firm's development and introduction decisions and considering the product's environmental impact during its entire life cycle. Our results show that although modular upgradability may accelerate the replacement of some subsystems, it delays the replacement of others. We find that modular upgradability can increase the environmental impact for some product categories due to accelerated obsolescence arising from more frequent introduction and replacement. However, we also find that accelerated obsolescence, under some conditions, can actually make modular upgradability greener.

Title: Impact of Variety and Distribution System Characteristics on Inventory Levels at U.S. Retailers
Abstract: Over the past six decades, numerous analytical models have been developed to determine optimal inventory levels. These models predict that inventories carried by a retailer should be a function of the product variety carried by the retailer, distribution system characteristics, economies of scale, etc. A few recent empirical studies have explored the impact of some of these factors on aggregate inventories at U.S. retailers. Building on these works, this study empirically explores the role of key factors such as product variety, number of stores, and number of warehouses in explaining inventory levels at U.S. retailers using data obtained from both primary and secondary sources. We find that variety as measured by the number of stock-keeping units carried and number of stores is associated with higher inventories, whereas scale economies are associated with lower inventories. We do not find the number of warehouses to be significant in explaining inventory levels. Increased demand fluctuations are also associated with higher inventories, although the effects are less robust. The significant variables together with retailer segment identifiers explain a substantial fraction of the variance in inventory levels and can be potentially useful to managers in benchmarking their inventory levels.

Title: A Dispatching Model for Server-to-Customer Systems That Balances Efficiency and Equity
Abstract: The decision about which servers to dispatch to which customers is an important aspect of service systems. This decision is complicated when servers must be equitably&mdash;as well as efficiently&mdash;dispatched to customers. In this paper, we formulate a model for determining how to optimally dispatch distinguishable servers to prioritized customers given a set of equity constraints. These issues are examined through the lens of emergency medical service (EMS) dispatch, for which a Markov decision process model is developed that captures how to dispatch ambulances (servers) to prioritized patients (customers). It is assumed that customers arrive sequentially, with the priority and location of each customer becoming known upon arrival. Four types of equity constraints are considered&mdash;two of which reflect customer equity and two of which reflect server equity&mdash;all of which draw upon the decision analytic and social science literature to compare the effects of different notions of equity on the resulting dispatching policies. The Markov decision processes are formulated as equity-constrained linear programming models. A computational example is applied to an EMS system to compare the different equity models.

Title: Prioritizing Burn-Injured Patients During a Disaster
Abstract: The U.S. government has mandated that, in a catastrophic event, metropolitan areas need to be capable of caring for 50 burn-injured patients per million population. In New York City, this corresponds to 400 patients. There are currently 140 burn beds in the region, which can be surged up to 210. To care for additional patients, hospitals without burn centers will be used to stabilize patients until burn beds become available. In this work, we develop a new system for prioritizing patients for transfer to burn beds as they become available and demonstrate its superiority over several other triage methods. Based on data from previous burn catastrophes, we study the feasibility of being able to admit 400 patients to burn beds within the critical three- to five-day time frame. We find that this is unlikely and that the ability to do so is highly dependent on the type of event and the demographics of the patient population. This work has implications for how disaster plans in other metropolitan areas should be developed.

Title: Facility Location Decisions with Random Disruptions and Imperfect Estimation
Abstract: Supply chain disruptions come with catastrophic consequences in spite of their low probability of occurrence. In this paper, we consider a facility location problem in the presence of random facility disruptions where facilities can be protected with additional investments. Whereas most existing models in the literature implicitly assume that the disruption probability estimate is perfectly accurate, we investigate the impact of misestimating the disruption probability. Using a stylized continuous location model, we show that underestimation in disruption probability results in greater increase in the expected total cost than overestimation. In addition, we show that, when planned properly, the cost of mitigating the misestimation risk is not too high. Under a more generalized setting incorporating correlated disruptions and finite capacity, we numerically show that underestimation in both disruption probability and correlation degree result in greater increase in the expected total cost compared to overestimation. We, however, find that the impact of misestimating the correlation degree is much less significant relative to that of misestimating the disruption probability. Thus, managers should focus more on accurately estimating the disruption probability than the correlation.

Title: Efficient Distribution of Water Between Head-Reach and Tail-End Farms in Developing Countries
Abstract: The necessity of surface water for irrigation and its increasing scarcity in developing economies motivate the need for its efficient distribution. The inequity in the distribution of surface water arises because of the relative physical locations of the farms. Head-reach (primary) farms are close to the source, whereas tail-end (secondary) farms are relatively farther. The lack of physical infrastructure implies that water allocated to secondary farms must pass through primary farms. Left to their individual incentives, primary farmers use more than their fair share of water by denying its release to secondary farmers. Such an inequitable sharing results in significantly suboptimal productivity of the farming community as a whole. We propose decentralized, individually rational mechanisms to achieve socially optimal distribution of surface water for a farming community under uncertainty in rainfall, choice of multiple crops, and differing risk-bearing abilities of primary and secondary farmers. We show that the mechanisms can be efficiently computed and highlight the impact of the improved sharing of surface water. We also study the movement of the price of water with its scarcity. Ideas that can help administer the mechanisms in practice are briefly discussed.

Title: Multiresource Allocation Scheduling in Dynamic Environments
Abstract: Motivated by service capacity-management problems in healthcare contexts, we consider a multiresource allocation problem with two classes of jobs (elective and emergency) in a dynamic and nonstationary environment. Emergency jobs need to be served immediately, whereas elective jobs can wait. Distributional information about demand and resource availability is continually updated, and we allow jobs to renege. We prove that our formulation is convex, and the optimal amount of capacity reserved for emergency jobs in each period decreases with the number of elective jobs waiting for service. However, the optimal policy is difficult to compute exactly. We develop the idea of a <i>limit policy</i> starting at a particular time, and use this policy to obtain upper and lower bounds on the decisions of an optimal policy in each period, and also to develop several computationally efficient policies. We show in computational experiments that our best policy performs within 1.8&percnt; of an optimal policy on average.

Title: When Gray Markets Have Silver Linings: All-Unit Discounts, Gray Markets, and Channel Management
Abstract: Gray markets are unauthorized channels of distribution for a supplier's authentic products. We study a distribution channel that consists of a supplier who offers <i>all-unit</i> quantity discounts for batch orders to enjoy cost savings, and a reseller who may divert some goods to the gray markets. We show that the impact of gray markets depends on the reseller's inventory holding cost. When the reseller's inventory holding cost is high, diversion to the gray markets improves the channel performance by enabling the reseller to make batch orders. Because the reseller's order costs decrease through quantity discounts, diversion to the gray markets reduces the resale price and expands sales to the authorized channel. On the other hand, when the reseller's inventory holding cost is low, the reseller would make the batch orders even without the gray markets. In this case the diversion to the gray markets may improve the reseller's performance by shortening the order cycles and reducing the inventory holding costs. Interestingly, because diversion to the gray markets decreases the reseller's cycle inventory volume, the reseller has the reduced incentive to push its inventory, and, consequently, the resale price rises and sales volume decreases in the authorized channel. Moreover, there exists a range of reseller's inventory holding cost and supplier's cost of scale economy such that it is optimal for the supplier to induce reseller's gray market diversion through an all-unit discount. We show that these results are robust when the gray market overlaps with the authorized channel or when the gray market price is sensitive to reseller's diversion volume.

Title: Bounded Rationality in Service Systems
Abstract: The traditional operations management and queueing literature typically assumes that customers are fully rational. In contrast, in this paper we study canonical service models with boundedly rational customers. We capture bounded rationality using a model in which customers are incapable of accurately estimating their expected waiting time. We investigate the impact of bounded rationality from both a profit-maximizing firm's perspective and a social planner's perspective. For visible queues with the optimal price, bounded rationality results in revenue and welfare loss; with a fixed price, bounded rationality can lead to strict social welfare improvement. For invisible queues, bounded rationality benefits the firm when its level is sufficiently high. Ignoring bounded rationality, when present yet small, can result in significant revenue and welfare loss.

Title: Bayesian Dynamic Pricing in Queueing Systems with Unknown Delay Cost Characteristics
Abstract: The revenue management literature for queues typically assumes that providers know the distribution of customer demand attributes. We study an observable <i>M/M/1</i> queue that serves an <i>unknown</i> proportion of patient and impatient customers. The provider has a Bernoulli prior on this proportion, corresponding to an optimistic or pessimistic scenario. For every queue length, she chooses a low or a high price, or turns customers away. Only the high price is informative. The optimal Bayesian price for a queue state is belief-dependent if the optimal policies for the underlying scenarios disagree at that queue state; in this case the policy has a belief-threshold structure. The optimal Bayesian pricing policy as a function of queue length has a zone (or, nested-threshold) structure. Moreover, the price convergence under the optimal Bayesian policy is sensitive to the system size, i.e., the maximum queue length. We identify two cases: prices converge (1) almost surely to the optimal prices in either scenario or (2) with positive probability to suboptimal prices. Only Case 2 is consistent with the typical <i>incomplete learning</i> outcome observed in the literature.

Title: Engaging Supply Chains in Climate Change
Abstract: Suppliers are increasingly being asked to share information about their vulnerability to climate change and their strategies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Their responses vary widely. We theorize and empirically identify several factors associated with suppliers being especially willing to share this information with buyers, focusing on attributes of the buyers seeking this information and of the suppliers being asked to provide it. We test our hypotheses using data from the Carbon Disclosure Project's Supply Chain Program, a collaboration of multinational corporations requesting such information from thousands of suppliers in 49 countries. We find evidence that suppliers are more likely to share this information when requests from buyers are more prevalent, when buyers appear committed to using the information, when suppliers belong to more profitable industries, and when suppliers are located in countries with greenhouse gas regulations. We find evidence that these factors also influence the comprehensiveness of the information suppliers share and their willingness to share the information publicly.

Title: Advance Selling in a Supply Chain Under Uncertain Supply and Demand
Abstract: We examine three selling strategies of a manufacturer who produces and sells a seasonal product to a retailer under uncertain supply and demand: (1) advance selling&mdash;presells the product before observing uncertain supply and demand; (2) regular selling&mdash;sells the product after supply and demand are realized; and (3) dynamic selling&mdash;combines both advance and regular selling strategies. We model the first two strategies as single-period Stackelberg games, and we model the last strategy as a two-period dynamic Stackelberg game. By comparing the equilibria of these games, we formalize our understanding of several intuitive results. For example, from the manufacturer's perspective, dynamic selling dominates advance selling and regular selling: having more selling opportunities is beneficial to the manufacturer. However, from the retailer's perspective, we find two counterintuitive results: (a) postponing the ordering decision can be detrimental&mdash;the retailer can be worse off under regular selling than under advance selling; and (b) more ordering opportunities can be detrimental&mdash;the retailer can be worse off under dynamic selling than under advance selling. In addition, we analyze the impact of supply and demand uncertainties under these strategies and find that both types of uncertainties can be beneficial to the retailer.

Title: Salesforce Contracting Under Demand Censorship
Abstract: We study salesforce contracting in an environment where excess demand results in lost sales and the demand information is censored by the inventory level. In our model, a firm contracts with a risk-neutral sales agent with limited liability whose effort increases the demand stochastically. The firm designs the incentive contract and invests in inventory; the agent decides the sales effort. We find that the sales-quota-based bonus contract is optimal in such an environment, and the quota should be set equal to the inventory level when the first-best solution is not attainable. We further reveal that demand censorship can introduce peculiar effects on the optimal sales effort and service level that the firm implements. From our analysis of the additive and multiplicative effort cases, we find that in the additive effort case, it can be optimal, under demand censorship, for the firm to induce an effort and maintain a service level both greater than those under the first-best solution. Scenarios also exist where the firm should induce zero effort. For the multiplicative effort case, the optimal sales effort under demand censorship is lower than the first-best effort, whereas the optimal service level is higher than the first-best service level. The agent earns zero rent in the additive effort case but may earn a positive rent in the multiplicative effort case. Finally, our numerical analysis shows that demand censorship can have a significant negative impact on the value of contracting with the sales agent, especially when the sales margin is low and the market uncertainty is high.

Title: Fixed vs. Random Proportions Demand Models for the Assortment Planning Problem Under Stockout-Based Substitution
Abstract: We consider the problem of determining the optimal assortment of products to offer in a given product category when each customer is characterized by a type, which is a list of products he is willing to buy in decreasing order of preference. We assume consumer-driven, dynamic, stockout-based substitution and random proportions of each type. No efficient method to obtain the optimal solution for this problem is known to our knowledge. However, if the number of customers of each type is a fixed proportion of demand, there exists an efficient algorithm for solving for the optimal assortment. We show that the fixed proportions model gives an upper bound to the optimal expected profit for the random proportions model. This bound allows us to obtain a measure of the absolute performance of heuristic solutions. We also provide a bound for the component-wise absolute difference in expected sales between the two models, which is asymptotically tight as the inventory vector is made large, while keeping the number of products fixed. This result provides us with a lower bound to the optimal expected profit and a performance guarantee for the fixed proportions solution in the random proportions model.

Title: Resource-Based Patient Prioritization in Mass-Casualty Incidents
Abstract: The most widely used standard for mass-casualty triage, START, relies on a fixed-priority ordering among different classes of patients, and does not explicitly consider resource limitations or the changes in survival probabilities with respect to time. We construct a fluid model of patient triage in a mass-casualty incident that incorporates these factors and characterize its optimal policy. We use this characterization to obtain useful insights about the type of simple policies that have a good chance to perform well in practice, and we demonstrate how one could develop such a policy. Using a realistic simulation model and data from emergency medicine literature, we show that the policy we developed based on our fluid formulation outperforms START in all scenarios considered, sometimes substantially.

Title: <b>OM Forum</b>—Offered Load Analysis for Staffing
Abstract: This essay, based on my 2012 MSOM Fellow Lecture, discusses an idea that has been useful for developing effective methods to set staffing levels in service systems: offered load analysis. The main idea is to tackle a hard problem by first seeking an insightful simplification. For capacity planning to meet uncertain exogenous demand, offered load analysis looks at the amount of capacity that would be used if there were no constraints on its availability. This simplification is helpful because the stochastic model becomes much more tractable. Offered load analysis can be especially helpful when the demand is not only uncertain but also time varying, as in many service systems. Given the distribution of the stochastic offered load, we often can set staffing levels to stabilize performance at target levels, even in face of a strongly time-varying arrival rate, long service times, and network structure.

Title: Optimal Dynamic Assortment Planning with Demand Learning
Abstract: We study a family of stylized assortment planning problems, where arriving customers make purchase decisions among offered products based on maximizing their utility. Given limited display capacity and no a priori information on consumers' utility, the retailer must select which subset of products to offer. By offering different assortments and observing the resulting purchase behavior, the retailer learns about consumer preferences, but this experimentation should be balanced with the goal of maximizing revenues. We develop a family of dynamic policies that judiciously balance the aforementioned trade-off between exploration and exploitation, and prove that their performance cannot be improved upon in a precise mathematical sense. One salient feature of these policies is that they &ldquo;quickly&rdquo; recognize, and hence limit experimentation on, strictly suboptimal products.

Title: A Population-Growth Model for Multiple Generations of Technology Products
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the demand for multiple, successive generations of products and develop a population-growth model that allows demand transitions across multiple product generations and takes into consideration the effect of competition. We propose an iterative-descent method for obtaining the parameter estimates and the covariance matrix, and we show that the method is theoretically sound and overcomes the difficulty that the units-in-use population of each product is not observable. We test the model on both simulated sales data and Intel's high-end desktop processor sales data. We use two alternative specifications for product strength in this market: performance and performance/price ratio. The former demonstrates better fit and forecast accuracy, likely due to the low price sensitivity of this high-end market. In addition, the parameter estimate suggests that, for the <i>innovators</i> in the diffusion of product adoption, brand switchings are more strongly influenced by product strength than within-brand product upgrades in this market. Our results indicate that compared with the Bass model, Norton&ndash;Bass model, and Jun&ndash;Park choice-based diffusion model, our approach is a better fit for strategic forecasting that occurs many months or years before the actual product launch.

Title: Supply Streams
Abstract: A supply stream is a continuous version of a supply chain. It is like a series inventory system, but stock can be held at any point along a continuum, not just at discrete stages. We assume stationary parameters and aim to minimize the long-run average total cost. We show that a stationary continuous-stage echelon base-stock policy is optimal. That is, at each geographic point along the supply stream, there is a target echelon inventory level, and the optimal policy at all times is to order and dispatch material so as to move the echelon inventory position as close as possible to this target. We establish this result by showing that the solutions to certain discrete-stage systems converge monotonically to a limit, as the distances between the stages become small, and this limit solves the continuous-stage system. With demand approximated by a Brownian motion, we show that, in the continuous-stage limit, the supply stream model is equivalent to one describing first-passage times. This linkage leads to some interesting and useful results. Specifically, we obtain a partial differential equation that characterizes the optimal cost function, and we find a closed-form expression for the optimal echelon base-stock levels in a certain special case, the first in the inventory literature. These expressions demonstrate that the well-known square-root law for safety stock does not apply in this context.

Title: Linking Cyclicality and Product Quality
Abstract: This paper examines the impact of architectural decisions on the level of defects in a product. We view products as collections of components linked together to work as an integrated whole. Previous work has established <i>modularity</i> (how decoupled a component is from other product components) as a critical determinant of defects, and we confirm its importance. Yet our study also provides empirical evidence for a relationship between product quality and <i>cyclicality</i> (the extent to which a component depends on itself via other product components). We find cyclicality to be a determinant of quality that is distinct from, and no less important than, modularity. Extending this main result, we show how the cyclicality&ndash;quality relationship is affected by the centrality of a component in a cycle and the distribution of a cycle across product modules. These findings, which are based on an analysis of open source software development projects, have implications for the study and design of complex systems.

Title: Managing Storable Commodity Risks: The Role of Inventory and Financial Hedge
Abstract: We study how to manage commodity risks (price and consumption volume) via physical inventory and financial hedge in a multiperiod problem (with an interperiod utility function) for a risk-averse firm procuring a storable commodity from a spot market at a random price and a long-term supplier at a fixed price. The firm also has access to financial contracts written on the commodity price, such as futures contracts and call and put options. We examine different cases of financial hedging, for example, single-contract and multicontract hedges. For each case, we dynamically maximize the mean-variance utility of the firm's cash flow and characterize an optimal integrated policy of inventory and hedging, which is easy to compute and implement. We find that as long as futures are used in each period, alone or not, the optimal inventory policy is myopic. The optimal hedging policy, however, is never myopic, but depends on all the future optimal decisions. This is contrary to findings of the literature using intraperiod utility functions, which finds myopic hedging to be optimal. Moreover, we find that hedging may lead to inventory reduction in multiperiod problems. Thus the insights from the single-period studies in the literature&mdash;hedging leads to inventory increase&mdash;do not apply. Finally, insights are offered on the role and impact of inventory and financial hedge on profitability, variance control, and service level, using both analytical and numerical results.

Title: Pricing Time-Sensitive Services Based on Realized Performance
Abstract: Services such as FedEx charge up-front fees but reimburse customers for delays. However, lead-time pricing studies ignore such delay refunds. This paper contributes to filling this gap. It studies revenue-maximizing tariffs that depend on realized lead times for a provider serving multiple time-sensitive customer types. We relax two key assumptions of the standard model in the lead-time pricing literature. First, customers may be <i>risk averse</i> (RA) with respect to payoff uncertainty, where payoff equals valuation, minus delay cost, minus payment. Second, tariffs may be <i>arbitrary</i> functions of realized lead times. The standard model assumes risk-neutral (RN) customers and restricts attention to flat rates. We report three main findings: (1) With RN customers, flat-rate pricing maximizes revenues but leaves customers exposed to payoff variability. (2) With RA customers, flat-rate pricing is suboptimal. If types are distinguishable, the optimal lead-time-dependent tariffs fully insure delay cost risk and yield the same revenue as under optimal flat rates for RN customers. With indistinguishable RA types, the differentiated first-best tariffs may be incentive-compatible even for uniform service, yielding higher revenues than with RN customers. (3) Under price and capacity optimization, lead-time-dependent pricing yields higher profits with less capacity compared to flat-rate pricing.

Title: Horizontal Capacity Coordination for Risk Management and Flexibility: Pay Ex Ante or Commit a Fraction of Ex Post Demand?
Abstract: Motivated by the dual-sourcing and contracting practices in the semiconductor industry, we study two prevailing types of contracts that deal with horizontal-capacity-coordination issues between two possible sources: an integrated device manufacturer (IDM) and a foundry. IDMs both design and manufacture semiconductor devices, whereas foundries concentrate only on manufacturing. Because production capacity is capital intensive, IDMs often make decisions on whether to manufacture each device internally or subcontract to foundries. Two types of contracts are most frequently used in such settings. Under &alpha;-contracts, a fixed fraction &alpha; of ex post realized demand is committed to subcontract to the foundry and serves as an incentive for the foundry to build capacity. Under reservation contracts, an ex ante capacity reservation fee is paid to the foundry as an incentive to build capacity. Because of the different nature of incentives under these contracts, it is unclear which type of contract maximizes the IDM's expected profit. Furthermore, IDMs and their customers often prefer dual sourcing to sole sourcing for risk-management purposes. This paper studies the relationship between the two types of contracts, both with and without dual-sourcing constraints and shows the effect of a dual-sourcing preference on contract selection. Our analysis offers supporting rationale for the coexistence of &alpha;-contracts and reservation contracts in practice and provides insights on horizontal capacity coordination beyond the semiconductor industry.

Title: Plant Networks for Processing Recyclable Materials
Abstract: We use a modified optimal market area model to examine how links between material recycling and other aspects of operations strategy can shape plant networks for the processing of recyclable materials. We characterize the complementarity of the recyclate ratio, defined as the maximum recycled content, with material versatility and miniscaling of recycling plants. We also observe that it is beneficial to coordinate investments in recycling- and production-related competencies because colocated recycling and production plants (minimills) eliminate recyclate transport. We therefore consider versatile miniplants, defined as a competency that factors in both material versatility and coordinated miniscaling of recycling and production plants, and capture how it complements both the recyclate ratio and localization of production plants, a competency that takes advantage of local adaptation and customer proximity. In numerical examples for rolled aluminum and nylon resin plant networks in Europe, we find that the complementarity effects are large, as they are for nylon resins, if recycling is nascent and challenging economically and if the plant network is too centralized at first to benefit much from an increased recyclate ratio or increased localization. We find that, for the nylon resin network, considering an investment in the recyclate ratio as part of a coordinated investment plan drives the emergence of a decentralized and localized minimill network, even though an increased recyclate ratio does not link directly with either decentralization or localization. We conclude that material recycling, versatile miniplants, and localization can fit well together in a forward-looking, sustainable operations strategy.

Title: Dynamic Capacity Investment with Two Competing Technologies
Abstract: With the recent focus on sustainability, firms making adjustments to their production or distribution capacity levels often have the option of investing in newer technologies with lower carbon footprints and/or energy consumption. These more sustainable technologies typically require a higher up-front investment but have lower operating (fuel or energy) costs. What complicates this decision is the fact that the projected dollar savings from the more sustainable technologies fluctuate considerably due to uncertainty in fuel prices, and the total capacity may not be utilized at 100&percnt; because of fluctuations in the demand for the product. We consider the firm's capacity adjustments over time given a portfolio of technology options when the demand and the fuel costs are stochastic and possibly dependent. Our model also allows for usage-based capacity deterioration. We provide the analytical structure of the optimal policy, which assigns different control limits for investing, staying put, and disinvesting in the capacities of the competing technology choices for each realization of demand and fuel costs at each period. We also present an application of our model to the problem of designing a delivery truck fleet for a beverage distributor.

Title: Energy Efficiency in Small and Medium-Sized Manufacturing Firms: Order Effects and the Adoption of Process Improvement Recommendations
Abstract: In many manufacturing operations, profitable energy efficiency opportunities remain unexploited. Although previous studies have tried to explain the underinvestment, we focus on how the way in which a portfolio of opportunities is presented in a list affects adoption decisions. We use information on over 100,000 energy-saving recommendations made to more than 13,000 small and medium-sized manufacturing firms under the Industrial Assessment Centers program of the U.S. Department of Energy. We find that adoption rates are higher for initiatives appearing early in a list of recommendations. This sequence effect is consistent and large: simply moving a recommendation one position lower has the same effect on average as increasing up-front implementation cost by at least 17&percnt; from the average value. Given this impact of sequence on adoption of individual recommendations, we utilize variations within our data to examine how various sequencing approaches affect adoption at the portfolio level. Sequences in which recommendations are listed from best to worst payback achieve higher potential energy savings given the investments in energy efficiency made by the firms. We also observe a choice overload effect at the portfolio level, but the magnitude of this effect is small.

Title: The NGO's Dilemma: How to Influence Firms to Replace a Potentially Hazardous Substance
Abstract: We study a nongovernmental organization's (NGO's) decisions when it attempts to remove a potentially hazardous substance from commercial use in a market with competing firms. Specifically, we determine under what market and regulatory conditions an NGO should target the industry versus the regulatory body to influence firms to replace the substance. We examine how the NGO's strategy changes as the NGO's pragmatism (i.e., the extent to which the NGO incorporates firms' profits into its decision making) increases. Our results demonstrate that when the NGO is less pragmatic, it should examine the existing market structure to determine whether to target the industry or the regulatory body. However, as the pragmatism of the NGO increases, the NGO should increasingly leverage the competition between firms to ensure that a replacement is available to consumers. We examine multiple extensions including varying the competition dynamics, the NGO targeting both the industry <i>and</i> the regulatory body, the time discounting of replacement costs, and a firm potentially lobbying to counteract an NGO's activism. We show that the potential for a firm to lobby can benefit consumers by motivating the NGO to exert more effort and increase the market sensitivity to a substance, thereby forcing the firm to replace.

Abstract: Carbon footprinting is a tool for firms to determine the total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with their supply chain or with a unit of final product or service. Carbon footprinting typically aims to identify where best to invest in emission reduction efforts, and/or to determine the proportion of total emissions that an individual firm is accountable for, whether financially and/or operationally. A major and underrecognized challenge in determining the appropriate allocation stems from the high degree to which GHG emissions are the result of joint efforts by multiple firms. We introduce a simple but general model of joint production of GHG emissions in general supply chains, decomposing the total footprint into processes, each of which can be influenced by any combination of firms. We analyze two main scenarios. In the first scenario, the social planner allocates emissions to individual firms and imposes a cost on them (such as a carbon tax) in proportion to the emissions allocated. In the second scenario, a carbon leader voluntarily agrees to offset all emissions in the entire supply chain and then contracts with individual firms to recoup (part of) the costs of those offsets. In both cases, we find that, to induce the optimal effort levels, the emissions need to be overallocated, even if the carbon tax is the true social cost of carbon. This is in contrast to the usual focus in the life-cycle assessment (LCA) and carbon footprinting literatures on avoiding double counting. Our work aims to lay the foundation for a framework to integrate the economics- and LCA-based perspectives on supply chain carbon footprinting.

Title: On the Value of Input Efficiency, Capacity Efficiency, and the Flexibility to Rebalance Them
Abstract: A common characteristic of basic material manufacturers (which account for 85&percnt; of all industrial energy use) and of cleantech manufacturers is that they are price takers in their input and output markets. Variability in those prices has implications for how much a manufacturer should invest in three fundamental types of process improvement. Input price variability reduces the value of improving <i>input efficiency</i> (output produced per unit input) but increases that of <i>capacity efficiency</i> (the rate at which a production facility can convert input into output). Output price variability increases the value of capacity efficiency, but it increases the value of input efficiency if and only if the expected margin is small. Moreover, as the expected input cost rises, the value of input efficiency decreases. A third type of process improvement is to develop <i>flexibility in input efficiency versus capacity efficiency</i> (the ability to respond to a rise in input cost or fall in output price by increasing input-efficiency at the expense of capacity efficiency). The value of this flexibility decreases with variability in input and output prices if and only if the expected margin is thin. Together, these results suggest that a carbon tax or cap-and-trade system may reduce investment by basic material manufacturers in improving energy efficiency.

Title: Optimal Capacity Conversion for Product Transitions Under High Service Requirements
Abstract: We consider the capacity planning problem during a product transition in which demand for a new-generation product gradually replaces that for the old product. Capacity for the new product can be acquired both by purchasing new production lines and by converting existing production lines for the old product. Furthermore, in either case, the new product capacity is &ldquo;retrofitted&rdquo; to be flexible, i.e., to be able to also produce the old product. This capacity planning problem arises regularly at Intel, which served as the motivating context for this research. We formulate a two-product capacity planning model to determine the equipment purchase and conversion schedule, considering (i) time-varying and uncertain demand, (ii) dedicated and flexible capacity, (iii) inventory and equipment costs, and (iv) a chance-constrained service-level requirement. We develop a solution approach that accounts for the risk-pooling benefit of flexible capacity (a closed-loop planning approach) and compare it with a solution that is similar to Intel's current practice (an open-loop planning approach). We evaluate both approaches with a realistic but disguised example and show that the closed-loop planning solution leads to savings in both equipment and inventory costs and matches more closely the service-level targets for the two products. Our numerical experiments illuminate the cost trade-offs between purchasing new capacity and converting old capacity and between a level capacity plan versus a chase capacity plan.

Title: Curtailing Intermittent Generation in Electrical Systems
Abstract: Energy generation from intermittent renewable sources introduces additional variability into electrical systems, resulting in a higher cost of balancing against the increased variabilities. Ways to balance demand and supply for electricity include using flexible generation resources, storage operations, and curtailing intermittent generation. This paper focuses on the operational and environmental impact of curtailing intermittent generation. We construct a stochastic dynamic optimization model that captures the critical components of the system operating cost and analyze how various generation resources should operate with and without curtailing intermittent generation. We find that the system cost reduction per unit of curtailed energy is consistently significant and the presence of storage may increase the cost saving per unit of curtailed energy. We also find that curtailing intermittent generation often leads to system emission reductions.

Title: Optimal Pricing, Production, and Inventory for New Product Diffusion Under Supply Constraints
Abstract: Management of new product introductions is critical for nearly all firms, and one of its most important dimensions is the management of demand during the introduction. Research analyzing this area predominantly uses versions of the diffusion model to capture the demand trajectory of a new product with a fixed potential market. The classic Bass model assumes that demand for innovative products is influenced both by &ldquo;external&rdquo; media influence and &ldquo;internal&rdquo; word-of-mouth effect, but it excludes price and assumes that capacity is unlimited. In reality, both factors critically influence firms' strategies. Price fluctuations for a new product are common, and price is often a critical lever that helps to shape the demand. Also, firms often have significant capacity constraints, which influence the feasibility of their strategies. In this paper, we consider how a capacity-constrained firm prices products during new product introductions. Thus, the demand rate is influenced by price and, when capacity is insufficient, we allow some customers to be either lost or backlogged, which slows down the word-of-mouth effect. To understand the effect of both pricing and capacity, we consider the integrated optimal pricing, production, and inventory decisions, using control-theory framework (a generalization of the classic Bass model). Most of our results are fairly robust and apply under the assumption of lost sales and partial backlogging, as well as make-to-order and make-to-stock environments. We show that in most cases, the optimal trajectory of demand is unimodal, as in the Bass model, but the optimal price trajectory and the corresponding pricing policy are more complicated when capacity is limited. Using a numerical study, we explore when pricing flexibility is most valuable and whether simple pricing policies may be effective. We find that benefits of pricing flexibility are highest when capacity is neither unlimited (very large) nor very small and when word-of-mouth effect dominates direct impact from media. The ability to adjust prices is significantly more important than the option of producing in advance and holding inventory. We also find that simple pricing policies, appropriately chosen for given capacity, perform very well. In a numerical study, we show that demand uncertainty and increases in capacity over time do not affect our main insights.

Title: Can Financial Markets Inform Operational Improvement Efforts? Evidence from the Airline Industry
Abstract: We investigate whether stock price movements can inform operations managers as to where they should focus improvement efforts. We examine how unexpected performance along several dimensions of service quality&mdash;on-time performance, long delays and cancellations, lost bags, and denied boardings&mdash;impacts contemporaneous stock returns. Prior research suggests that airlines buffer their flight schedules and engage in expensive employee incentive programs to increase the likelihood of on-time arrival. We find that only long delays are penalized by the market, and we identify a number of carrier-specific factors that alter the financial impact of long delays. We find that the penalty a carrier faces for long delays is significantly higher if it operates a high percentage of short-haul or connecting flights, or if its competitors incur fewer long delays in the same time period. Our findings suggest that developing ways to curtail long delays is a useful future research area.

Title: Incentive-Compatible Revenue Management in Queueing Systems: Optimal Strategic Delay
Abstract: How should a firm design a price/lead-time menu and scheduling policy to maximize revenues from heterogeneous time-sensitive customers with private information about their preferences? We consider this question for a queueing system with two customer types and provide the following results. First, we develop a novel problem formulation and solution method that combines the achievable region approach with mechanism design. This approach extends to menu design problems for other systems. Second, the work conserving <i>c</i>&mu; priority rule, known to be delay cost minimizing, incentive-compatible, and socially optimal, need not be revenue maximizing. A <i>strategic delay</i> policy may be optimal: It prioritizes impatient customers, but artificially inflates the lead times of patient customers. This suggests a broader guideline: Revenue-maximizing firms that lack customer-level demand information should also consider customer incentives, not only operational constraints, in their scheduling policies. Third, we identify general necessary and sufficient conditions for optimal strategic delay: a <i>price</i>, a <i>lead-time</i>, and a <i>segment-size</i> condition. We translate these into demand and capacity parameter conditions for cases with homogeneous and heterogeneous valuations for each type. In some cases strategic delay is optimal if capacity is relatively abundant, in others if it is relatively scarce.

Title: Inventory Control with Multiple Setup Costs
Abstract: We consider an infinite-horizon, periodic-review, single-item production/inventory system with random demand and backordering, where multiple setups are allowed in any period and a separate fixed cost is associated for each setup. Contrary to the majority of the literature on this topic, we do not restrict the order quantities to be integer multiples of the exogenously given batch size and instead allow the possibility of partial batches, in which case the fixed cost for ordering the batch is still fully charged. We build a model that particularly takes the batch-ordering cost structure into account. We introduce an alternative cost-accounting scheme to analyze the problem, which we use to develop a computationally efficient optimal solution method and several properties of the optimal solution. In addition, we propose two heuristic policies, both of which perform extremely well computationally.

Title: <b>OM Forum</b>&mdash;Business Model Innovation for Sustainability
Abstract: A systematic approach to innovating business models can help identify new business models that encourage sustainable use of products and services, or facilitate wider adoption of new environmentally friendly technologies. This paper provides a brief summary of a conceptual framework that we have developed to systematize the study and identification of new business models. Our approach advocates that the key to identifying new business models is understanding the context of decision making in existing models and the associated inefficiencies. We propose a three-step approach: First, existing business models must be audited for identifying information and incentive misalignment inefficiencies that destroy value. Next, new business models can be identified by changing the context of the decision associated with the most consequential of these inefficiencies. We conjecture that four elements of the decision context are most significant: WHAT decisions are made, WHEN they are made, WHO makes them, and WHY they are made. We provide a set of idea triggers to stimulate brainstorming of new business models by changing one of these four Ws. Finally, we advise that generated business models should be analyzed and experimented with to identify the most promising ones. We close the paper by describing the design of a pedagogical program based on this framework.

Title: The Impact of the Manufacturer-Hired Sales Agent on a Supply Chain with Information Asymmetry
Abstract: This paper studies the impact of a manufacturer-hired sales agent on a supply chain comprising a manufacturer and a retailer. The sales agent is working mainly at the retailer's location to boost demand. We focus on a wholesale price contract, under which the retailer decides how much to order from the manufacturer. The information structure within the supply chain and the efficiency of the sales agent affect the supply chain members' expected profits. We show that, because of the agency issue between the sales agent and the manufacturer, when the retailer's demand forecast accuracy is similar to the manufacturer's and the wholesale price is fixed, the retailer's profit decreases as his demand forecast accuracy improves. We also illustrate that when the retailer's forecast accuracy is much better than the manufacturer's and the wholesale price is endogenous, his expected profit decreases as his forecast accuracy improves. Moreover, we demonstrate that having a more efficient sales agent is beneficial for the retailer when the wholesale price is fixed, whereas this is not always the case when the wholesale price depends on the efficiency of the sales agent.

Title: Ordering Behavior Under Supply Risk:An Experimental Investigation
Abstract: As supply chains become increasingly complex and global in their scale, supplier selection and management in the face of disruption risk has become one of the most challenging tasks for modern managers. Several novel model-based approaches to managing such risks have been developed in the academic literature, but how behavioral tendencies may affect procurement decisions under such conditions has received relatively less attention. In this paper, we present results from a study where paid subjects were asked to place orders from two suppliers who differ in their costs and risks to satisfy a fixed amount of end-customer demand. We show that under such a scenario, it is theoretically optimal to <i>sole source</i> either from the more reliable (and more costly) supplier or from the more risky but cheaper supplier, depending on cost and risk parameters. Subjects in our experiment, however, show a systematic tendency to <i>diversify</i> their orders between the two sources. We document this diversification tendency in procurement decisions and its possible impact on profits under various cost and risk settings as well as comment on various ordering behavior observed during the experiments. We also establish that bounded rationality of subjects can provide a possible rationale for the above phenomenon.

Title: Contracts for Changing Times: Sourcing with Raw Material Price Volatility and Information Asymmetry
Abstract: We analyze and compare five contract schemes used in a supply chain: fixed price (FP), cost reimbursement (CR), procurement control (PC), index-linked payment (IL), and relational (RL) contracts. From interviews, we learned that (1) FP and RL are the two most popular schemes; (2) PC is less popular, but it is used more often than CR and IL; and (3) a couple of firms are considering CR and IL and will probably use them in the future. By presenting a two-stage contracting model that incorporates a risk-neutral buyer and a risk-averse supplier under raw material price uncertainty and information asymmetry, we show that overhedging the supplier's risk with an IL contract can be optimal for the buyer in many cases. Using the model to study the effects of price trends, risk attitudes, information asymmetry, and constraints on purchase time, we find that each contract can be optimal in certain situations from certain standpoints. In particular, when a long-term relationship is considered, RL is equivalent to IL as long as the contract is self-enforcing, and RL can replace IL when no index is available. Connecting the analytical results to the interviews, we find that firms' choices and considerations can be well understood.

Title: <b>OM Forum</b>&mdash;Sustainable Operations Management: An Enduring Stream or a Passing Fancy?
Abstract: Paul Kleindorfer was among the first to weigh in on and nurture the stream of sustainable operations management. The thoughts laid out here are based on conversations we had with Paul relating to the drivers underlying sustainability as a management issue: population and per capita consumption growth, the limited nature of resources and sinks, and the responsibility and exposure of firms to ensuing ecological risks and costs. We then discuss how an operations management lens contributes to the issue and criteria to help the sustainable operations management perspective endure. This paper relates to a presentation delivered by Morris Cohen for Paul's Manufacturing and Service Operations Management Distinguished Fellows Award, given at Columbia University, June 18, 2012. We wrote this paper at Paul's request.

Title: Introduction to the Special Issue on the Environment
Abstract: Human population growth and increasing consumption per capita are causing environmental impacts that threaten the survival and well-being of humans and other species on Earth. To sustain natural ecosystems and human populations with a high standard of living, humanity must now reinvent our systems for the production and delivery of goods and services to dramatically reduce the environmental impacts associated with consumption. The operations management community can contribute critical know-how to do so, as demonstrated by the papers in this special issue.

Title: Speed&ndash;Quality Trade-Offs in a Dynamic Model
Abstract: An important trade-off organizations face in many environments is one between quality and speed. Working faster may result in greater output and less delay, but may result in lower quality and dissatisfied customers. In this work, we consider dynamic models in a monopoly setting to explore the optimal balance among the multiple dimensions of speed, price, and wait time. The impact of quality is captured via the market demand potential, which is a function of the speed (quality) in the previous period. We obtain several results and insights. First, in scenarios where speed may be difficult to change over time (e.g., some automated production lines) but price can be changed, we show that the optimal price charged is such that the demand rate remains constant over time, even though the price and market potential are changing. Furthermore, we identify conditions when the firm will work at a speed that is higher or lower than a benchmark speed and characterize the behavior of prices over time. Second, in scenarios where a firm may not be able to change prices but can adjust the speed each period, the firm starts at a speed that may be faster or slower than a benchmark speed but converges to it over time. In this constant price case, as the benchmark speed increases, the initial speed adopted by the firm is actually lower but increases more quickly thereafter. We also characterize the behavior of price and speed in settings where both can be changed over time. Interestingly, a firm typically starts at a slow speed and increases the speed, price, and demand over time. Although our main model assumes that the firm internalizes the congestion cost, several of our results extend to a scenario where the demand rate is impacted by the congestion level.

Title: Dynamic Inventory&ndash;Pricing Control Under Backorder: Demand Estimation and Policy Optimization
Abstract: Inventory-based dynamic pricing has become a common operations strategy in practice and has received considerable attention from the research community. From an implementation perspective, it is desirable to design a simple policy like a base-stock list-price (BSLP) policy. The existing research on this problem often imposes restrictive conditions to ensure the optimality of a BSLP policy, which limits its applicability in practice. In this paper, we analyze the dynamic inventory and pricing control problem in which the demand follows a generalized additive model (GAM). The GAM overcomes the limitations of several demand models commonly used in the literature, but introduces analytical challenges in analyzing the dynamic program. Via a variable transformation approach, we identify a new set of technical conditions under which a BSLP policy is optimal. These conditions are easy to verify because they depend only on the location and scale parameters of demand as functions of price and are independent of the cost parameters or the distribution of the random demand component. Moreover, although a BSLP policy is optimal under these conditions, the optimal price may not be monotone decreasing in the inventory level. We further demonstrate our results by applying a constrained maximum likelihood estimation procedure to simultaneously estimate the demand function and verify the optimality of a BSLP policy on a retail data set.

Title: Modeling Influenza Pandemic and Planning Food Distribution
Abstract: Based on the recent incidents of H5N1, H1N1, and influenza pandemics in history (1918, 1957, and 1968) experts believe that a future influenza pandemic is inevitable and likely imminent. Although the severity of influenza pandemics vary, evidence suggests that an efficient and rapid response is crucial for mitigating morbidity, mortality, and costs to society. Hence, preparing for a potential influenza pandemic is a high priority of governments at all levels (local, state, federal), nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), and companies. In a severe pandemic, when a large number of people are ill, infected persons and their families may have difficulty purchasing and preparing meals. Various government agencies and NGOs plan to provide meals to these households. In this paper, in collaboration with the American Red Cross, we study food distribution planning during an influenza pandemic. We develop a disease spread model to estimate the spread pattern of the disease geographically and over time, combine it with a facility location and resource allocation network model for food distribution, and develop heuristics to find near-optimal solutions for large instances. We run our combined disease spread and facility location model for the state of Georgia and present the estimated number of infections and the number of meals needed in each census tract for a one-year period along with a design of the supply chain network. Moreover, we investigate the impact of voluntary quarantine on the food demand and the food distribution network and show that its effects on food distribution can be significant. Our results could help decision makers prepare for a pandemic, including how to allocate limited resources and respond dynamically.

Title: The Sourcing Hub and Upstream Supplier Networks
Abstract: In this paper, we explore how firms can better manage their sourcing by developing relationships not only with their suppliers but also with their suppliers' suppliers. We detail an empirical case study explaining how the firm developed relationships with its suppliers and raw material suppliers via a collaborative center, the sourcing hub. We then analytically model the scenarios encountered in our empirical work and examine two facets of upstream sourcing under uncertain demand scenarios: (a) firms can supply raw material directly to their suppliers, and this may be beneficial for the firm and its suppliers; and (b) firms can bring their suppliers together at the sourcing hub, and the resulting cooperation between suppliers is beneficial for the suppliers and the raw material suppliers. Overall, our work explores the market and economic conditions under which active management of upstream sourcing can add value to supply chains.

Title: Time-Based Competition with Benchmark Effects
Abstract: We consider a duopoly where firms compete on waiting times in the presence of an industry benchmark. The demand captured by a firm depends on the gap between the firm's offer and the benchmark. We refer to the benchmark effect as the impact of this gap on demand. The formation of the benchmark is endogenous and depends on both firms' choices. When the benchmark is equal to the shorter of the two offered delays, we characterize the unique Pareto optimal Nash equilibrium. Our analysis reveals a <i>stickiness effect</i> in which firms equate their delays at the equilibrium when the benchmark effect is sufficiently strong. When the benchmark corresponds to a weighted average of the two offered delays, we show the existence of a pure Nash equilibrium. In this case, we reveal a <i>reversal effect</i>, in which the market leader, i.e., the firm that offers a shorter delay, becomes the follower when the benchmark effect is sufficiently strong. In both cases, we show that customers' equilibrium waiting times are shorter with the benchmark effect than without it. Our models also capture customers' loss aversion, which, in our setting, states that demand is more sensitive to the gap between the delay and the benchmark when the delay is longer than the benchmark (loss) than when it is shorter (gain). We characterize the impact of this loss aversion on the equilibrium in both settings. Finally, we show numerically that the stickiness and reversal effects still exist when firms also compete on price.

Title: Threshold Routing to Trade Off Waiting and Call Resolution in Call Centers
Abstract: In a call center, agents may handle calls at different speeds, and also may be more or less successful at resolving customers' inquiries, even when only considering customers calling with similar requests. One common measure of successful call resolution is whether or not the call results in the customer calling back. This presents a natural trade-off between speed and quality, where speed is defined as the average time before an incoming call is answered (the average waiting time) and quality is defined as the percentage of all arriving calls that do not result in callbacks (the call resolution). The relevant control is the routing, that is, the decision concerning which agent should handle an arriving call when more than one agent is available. In an inverted-V model setting, we formulate an optimization problem with the dual performance objective of minimizing average customer waiting time and maximizing the call resolution. We solve this optimization problem asymptotically in the Halfin&ndash;Whitt many-server limit regime, interpret its solution as a routing control for the discrete-event system, and show via simulation that the interpreted routing control is on the efficient frontier. In particular, any routing control that has a lower average waiting time (higher call resolution) must also have a lower call resolution (higher average waiting time).

Title: Does Multitasking Improve Performance? Evidence from the Emergency Department
Abstract: This paper examines the effect of multitasking on overall worker performance, as measured by processing time, throughput rate, and output quality using microlevel operational data from the field. Specifically, we study the multitasking behavior of physicians in a busy hospital emergency department (ED). By drawing on recent findings in the experimental psychology literature and the nascent work in cognitive neuroscience, we develop several hypotheses for the effect of multitasking on worker performance. We first examine how multitasking affects a physician's processing time. We find that the total time taken to discharge a given number of patients has a U-shaped response to the level of physician multitasking; that is, multitasking initially helps to reduce the time taken, but only up to a certain threshold level, after which it increases in the level of multitasking. In addition, multitasking significantly impacts quality of care. Although lower levels of multitasking are associated with improved quality of care, at higher levels, additional multitasking leads to a smaller number of detected diagnoses and an increased likelihood of a 24-hour revisit rate to the ED. These findings have important implications for the design and organization of work in general and for the delivery of critical care in particular.

Title: <b>Data Set</b>&mdash;Online Pricing Data for Multiple U.S. Carriers
Abstract: In this paper we describe a database of online airline prices collected from a major online travel agent and a low-cost carrier. The database provides detailed pricing data for all nonstop flights offered in a market. Data are provided for 42 domestic U.S. markets across a 28-day booking horizon for 21 departure dates. Each of the 42 markets is served by one or more low-cost carriers. These data can be used to investigate the evolution of prices and price dispersion for monopoly, duopoly, and oligopoly markets. The data can be used to create simulated data sets for benchmarking the performance of revenue management algorithms that consider competitors' prices. Analysis of the data may enable researchers to observe general patterns that would be useful to motivate research and/or teaching in revenue management.Data, as supplemental material, are available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri"  href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/msom.2013.0466">http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/msom.2013.0466</ext-link>.

Title: Pooling and Dependence of Demand and Yield in Multiple-Location Inventory Systems
Abstract: The benefits of inventory risk pooling are well known and documented. It has been proven in the literature that the expected costs of a centralized system are increasing in the degree of (positive) dependence of demand in an idealized newsvendor setting. Using the supermodular stochastic order to characterize dependence, we study a general two-tiered supply chain structure, in which both demand and supply yields are random, and prove that the expected costs are increasing in the degrees of positive dependence between demand and supply yield loss factors. Furthermore, using a distributionally robust optimization framework, we prove an analogous result for the case where demand and yield distributions are not precisely known.

Title: Sequencing Appointments for Service Systems Using Inventory Approximations
Abstract: Managing appointments for service systems with random job durations is a challenging task. We consider a class of appointment planning problems that involve two sets of decisions: <i>job sequencing</i>, i.e., determining the order in which a list of jobs should be performed by the server, and <i>appointment scheduling</i>, i.e., planning the starting times for jobs. These decisions are interconnected because their joint goal is to minimize the expected server idle time and job late-start penalty costs incurred because of randomness in job durations. In this paper, we design new heuristics for sequencing appointments. The idea behind the development of these heuristics is the structural connection between such appointment scheduling problems and stochastic inventory control in serial supply chains. In particular, the decision of determining time allowances as <i>buffers</i> against random job durations is analogous to that of selecting inventory levels as <i>buffers</i> to accommodate random demand in a supply chain; having excess buffers in appointment scheduling and supply chain settings incurs idle time and excess inventory holding costs, respectively, and having inadequate buffers leads to delays of subsequent jobs and backorders, respectively. Recognizing this connection, we propose tractable approximations for the job sequencing problem, obtain several insights, and further develop a very simple sequencing rule of ordering jobs by duration variance to late-start penalty cost ratio. Computational results show that our proposed heuristics produce close-to-optimal job sequences with significantly reduced computation times compared with those produced using an exact mixed-integer stochastic programming formulation based on the sample-average approximation approach.

Title: Strategic Safety Stock Placement in Supply Networks with Static Dual Supply
Abstract: Many real-world supply networks source required materials from multiple suppliers. Existing multiechelon inventory optimization approaches either restrict their scope to multiple supply sources in two-echelon systems or single suppliers in multiechelon systems. We develop an exact mathematical model for static dual supply in a general acyclic <i>N</i>-echelon network structure, which builds on the guaranteed-service framework for safety stock optimization. It is assumed that the suppliers are allocated static fractions of demand. We prove that for normally distributed demand an extreme point property holds. We present a real example from the industrial electronics industry consisting of five echelons and three dual-sourced materials. This example forms the basis for a numerical analysis. Compared with the only previously published approximate solution, our exact approach results in considerable cost savings because the exact model captures inventory pooling in a way that the approximation is unable to do. For a set of test problems, total safety stock cost savings are 9.1&percnt;, on average.

Title: Optimal Energy Procurement in Spot and Forward Markets
Abstract: Spot and forward purchases for delivery on the usage date play an important role in matching the supply and the uncertain demand of energy because storage capacity for energy, such as electricity, natural gas, and oil, is limited. Transaction costs tend to be larger in spot than forward energy markets near maturity. Partially procuring supply in the forward market, rather than entirely in the spot market, is thus a potentially valuable real option, which we call the <i>forward procurement option</i>. We investigate the optimal value and management of this real option as well as their sensitivities to parameters of interest. Our research quantifies the value of the forward procurement option on realistic natural gas instances, also suggesting that procuring the demand forecast in the forward market is nearly optimal. This policy greatly simplifies the management of this real option without an appreciable loss of value. We provide some theoretical support for this numerical finding. Beyond energy, our research has potential relevance for the procurement of other commodities, such as metals and agricultural products.

Title: Erlang-R: A Time-Varying Queue with Reentrant Customers, in Support of Healthcare Staffing
Abstract: We analyze a queueing model that we call Erlang-R, where the &ldquo;R&rdquo; stands for reentrant customers. Erlang-R accommodates customers who return to service several times during their sojourn within the system, and its modeling power is most pronounced in time-varying environments. Indeed, it was motivated by healthcare systems, in which offered-loads vary over time and patients often go through a repetitive service process. Erlang-R helps answer questions such as how many servers (physicians/nurses) are required to achieve predetermined service levels. Formally, it is merely a two-station open queueing network, which, in a steady state, evolves like an Erlang-C (<i>M</i>/<i>M</i>/<i>s</i>) model. In time-varying environments, on the other hand, the situation differs: here one must account for the reentrant nature of service to avoid excessive staffing costs or undesirable service levels. We validate Erlang-R against an emergency ward (EW) operating under normal conditions as well as during a mass casualty event (MCE). In both scenarios, we apply time-varying fluid and diffusion approximations: the EW is critically loaded and the MCE is overloaded. In particular, for the EW we propose a time-varying square-root staffing policy, based on the modified offered-load, which is proved to perform well over small-to-large systems.

Title: Estimation of Choice-Based Models Using Sales Data from a Single Firm
Abstract: We develop a parameter estimation routine for multinomial logit discrete choice models in which one alternative is completely censored, i.e., when one alternative is never observed to have been chosen in the estimation data set. Our method is based on decomposing the log-likelihood function into marginal and conditional components. Our method is computationally efficient, provides consistent parameter estimates, and can easily incorporate price and other product attributes. Simulations based on industry hotel data demonstrate the superior computational performance of our method over alternative estimation methods that are capable of estimating price effects. Because most existing revenue management choice-based optimization algorithms do not include price as a decision variable, our estimation procedure provides the inputs needed for more advanced product portfolio availability and price optimization models.

Title: On the Downs&ndash;Thomson Paradox in a Self-Financing Two-Tier Queuing System
Abstract: We model a two-tier queuing system with free and toll service options as two parallel <i>M</i>/<i>M</i>/1 servers. We solve for the welfare-maximizing toll service capacity and toll subject to the constraint that the toll service cover its costs. If the free and toll services are both used in equilibrium, a larger free-service capacity implies longer expected waiting time for the free service and lower welfare: an analogue to the Downs&ndash;Thomson paradox in transportation economics. The paradox is caused by the presence of scale economies in the toll service combined with the requirement that it be self-financing.

Title: Bid-Taker Power and Supply Base Diversification
Abstract: We study a buyer who periodically auctions off short-term supply contracts among her supply base. To mitigate significant cost shocks to procurement, the buyer can diversify her supply base by selecting suppliers from different regions. We find that the buyer's decision to diversify depends on her bid-taker power&mdash;that is, her ability to choose the auction mechanism. At one extreme, when the buyer has full bid-taker power and thus can dictatorially implement the optimal mechanism, she always prefers to diversify. At the other extreme, when the buyer uses a reverse English auction with no reserve price due to her lack of bid-taker power, she generally prefers to protect herself against potential price escalation from cost-advantaged suppliers by diversifying less. The managerial insight is that the more bid-taker power the buyer has to control price escalation from cost-advantaged suppliers the more she prefers a diversified supply base. This insight is shown to be robust to correlation between regional costs, ex ante asymmetry between regions, and intermediate levels of bid-taker power.

Title: Transparency of Information Acquisition in a Supply Chain
Abstract: A firm hires a consultant to acquire demand information. The outcome of information acquisition may turn out to be successful such that the firm learns much about the market demand, thus becoming &ldquo;informed,&rdquo; or unsuccessful such that it learns very little about the market demand, thus remaining &ldquo;uninformed.&rdquo; After the outcome becomes clear, the firm knows its information status, informed or uninformed, and the information content if informed. The client firm usually requires strict confidentiality that forbids the consultant to make any disclosure about the information acquisition, believing that greater informational advantage will surely be to its own benefits. As a result, neither the information content nor the information status is known to any third party. But should the firm always care so much about strict confidentiality? Will it be beneficial if the firm's information status, but not the information content, is known to its partners or any other firms? We investigate this issue in the context of a two-tier supply chain. A manufacturer offers a menu of contracts for supplying a product to a retailer who sells it in a market with random demand that has a known continuous distribution. The retailer hires a consultant to acquire demand information, with uncertain outcome. With probability <i>t</i>, the retailer becomes informed about the market demand, and with probability 1 &minus; <i>t</i>, he remains uninformed, where the probability <i>t</i> can be regarded as representing the retailer's information acquisition capability. We find that disclosing its information status benefits the retailer if its information acquisition capability is less than stellar and the market variability is intermediate. Our investigation shows that there are benefits that are foregone by following strict confidentiality but can potentially be recovered by switching to a policy of partial confidentiality.

Title: Pricing in Queues Without Demand Information
Abstract: We consider revenue optimization in an <i>M</i>/<i>M</i>/1 queue with price and delay sensitive customers, and we study the performance of demand-independent pricing that does not require any arrival rate information. We formally characterize the optimal demand-independent price and its performance relative to pricing with precise arrival rate knowledge. We find that demand-independent pricing can perform remarkably well and its performance improves as customers become more delay sensitive. In particular, for uniformly distributed customer valuations, under a large set of parameters, we find that demand-independent prices can capture more than 99&percnt; of the optimal revenue. We also study social optimization and find that demand-independent pricing can perform quite well; however, the performance is better under revenue optimization.

Title: Purchasing Scarce Products Under Dynamic Pricing: An Experimental Investigation
Abstract: Whereas theoretical studies on dynamic pricing typically assume that consumers are either fully strategic or fully myopic, systematic empirical investigations into how consumers behave under dynamic pricing contexts are relatively rare. Focusing on scarce products, we constructed and experimentally tested a two-stage model in which a firm sells a seasonal good under exogenous inventory constraints to a market of strategic buyers. In our experiment, subjects assigned the role of buyers made purchase decisions in response to prices set by an automated seller. We find that equilibrium predictions assuming fully strategic buyers largely accounted for aggregate behavior in the experiment, and the ex post optimal decisions for subjects were overwhelmingly consistent with equilibrium prescriptions. Moreover, subjects tended to become individually more strategic as the session progressed. However, there were also nuanced systematic patterns of deviations from equilibrium that had profit and pricing implications for the seller. First, a nonnegligible minority of subjects exhibited completely myopic buying behavior even with practice. Second, when the product was relatively more scarce, myopic buying had a stronger impact on demand at higher prices; the upshot is that the seller's season-profit-maximizing price could be considerably higher than what would be optimal with fully strategic buyers.

Title: Service Systems with Finite and Heterogeneous Customer Arrivals
Abstract: We consider service systems with a finite number of customer arrivals, where customer interarrival times and service times are both stochastic and heterogeneous. Applications of such systems are numerous and include systems where arrivals are driven by events or service completions in serial processes as well as systems where servers are subject to learning or fatigue. Using an embedded Markov chain approach, we characterize the waiting time distribution for each customer, from which we obtain various performance measures of interest, including the expected waiting time of a specific customer, the expected waiting time of an arbitrary customer, and the expected completion time of all customers. We carry out extensive numerical experiments to examine the effect of heterogeneity in interarrival and service times. In particular, we examine cases where interarrival and service times increase with each subsequent arrival or service completion, decrease, increase and then decrease, or decrease and then increase. We derive several managerial insights and discuss implications for settings where such features can be induced. We validate the numerical results using a fluid approximation that yields closed-form expressions.

Title: Optimizing Colonoscopy Screening for Colorectal Cancer Prevention and Surveillance
Abstract: Millions of Americans undergo colonoscopy screening for colorectal cancer (CRC) prevention and surveillance every year. The efficiency of colonoscopy operations depends on how often patients are screened, which is a complex and controversial decision, as reflected by the discrepancy between clinical practice and guidelines. We develop a partially observable Markov decision process to optimize colonoscopy screening policies for the objective of maximizing total quality-adjusted life years. Our model incorporates age, gender, and risk of having CRC into the screening decisions and therefore provides a novel framework for personalized CRC screening. In addition to deriving the maximum attainable benefit from colonoscopy screening, which reflects the opportunity cost of following current guidelines, our results have several policy implications. Using clinical data, we show that the optimal colonoscopy screening policies may be more aggressive than the guidelines under some conditions. Optimal screening policies recommend that females with CRC history undergo colonoscopy more frequently than males. In contrast, females without CRC history should be screened less frequently than males. This result, which was not recognized before, signifies the role of gender in optimal CRC screening decisions.

Title: An Empirical Analysis of Price, Quality, and Incumbency in Procurement Auctions
Abstract: The use of multiattribute auctions for procurement of products and services when both price and quality matter is becoming more frequent. Such auctions often employ scoring rules and are open ended in winner determination. Yet there is a significant gap in the literature on the efficiency of these procurement mechanisms. In this paper, providing a theoretical model and utilizing data from legal service procurement auctions, we study how open-ended scoring auctions can be used effectively in procurement and demonstrate the roles supplier quality and incumbency play in this process. We demonstrate that open-ended auctions can generate substantial savings to a buyer without compromising quality. We study the underlying mechanism and show how the auction format can work to achieve such performance. We find that the buyer's revealed preferences significantly differ from her stated preferences. Finally, we contribute to the understanding of the role of incumbency in procurement auctions by providing evidence that what may be perceived as incumbency bias can in fact be a revelation of preference for quality.

Title: Nurse Absenteeism and Staffing Strategies for Hospital Inpatient Units
Abstract: Inpatient staffing costs are significantly affected by nurse absenteeism, which is typically high in U.S. hospitals. We use data from multiple inpatient units of two hospitals to study which factors, including unit culture, short-term workload, and shift type, explain nurse absenteeism. The analysis highlights the importance of paying attention to heterogeneous absentee rates among individual nurses. We then develop models to investigate the impact of demand and absentee rate variability on the performance of staffing plans and obtain some structural results. Utilizing these results, we propose and test three easy-to-use heuristics to identify near-optimal staffing strategies. Such strategies could be useful to hospitals that periodically reassign nurses with similar qualifications to inpatient units in order to balance workload and accommodate changes in patient flow. Although motivated by staffing of hospital inpatient units, the approach developed in this paper is also applicable to other team-based and labor-intensive service environments.

Title: Complexity-Augmented Triage: A Tool for Improving Patient Safety and Operational Efficiency
Abstract: Hospital emergency departments (EDs) typically use triage systems that classify and prioritize patients almost exclusively in terms of their need for timely care. Using a combination of analytic and simulation models, we demonstrate that adding an up-front estimate of patient complexity to conventional urgency-based classification can substantially improve both patient safety (by reducing the risk of adverse events) and operational efficiency (by shortening the average length of stay). Moreover, we find that EDs with high resource (physician and/or examination room) utilization, high heterogeneity in the treatment time between simple and complex patients, and a relatively equal number of simple and complex patients benefit most from complexity-augmented triage. Finally, we find that (1) although misclassification of a complex patient as simple is slightly more harmful than vice versa, complexity-augmented triage is relatively robust to misclassification error rates as high as 25&percnt;; (2) streaming patients based on complexity information and prioritizing them based on urgency is better than doing the reverse; and (3) separating simple and complex patients via streaming facilitates the application of lean methods that can further amplify the benefit of complexity-augmented triage.

Title: Multimodularity and Its Applications in Three Stochastic Dynamic Inventory Problems
Abstract: We apply the concept of multimodularity in three stochastic dynamic inventory problems in which state and decision variables are economic substitutes. The first is clearance sales of perishable goods. The second is sourcing from multiple suppliers with different lead times. The third is transshipment under capacity constraints. In all three problems, we establish monotone optimal polices with bounded sensitivity. Multimodularity proves to be an effective tool for these problems because it implies substitutability, it is preserved under minimization, and it leads directly to monotone optimal policies with bounded sensitivity.

Title: Dynamic Pricing Strategies in the Presence of Demand Shifts
Abstract: Many factors introduce the prospect of changes in the demand environment that a firm faces, with the specifics of such changes not necessarily known in advance. If and when realized, such changes affect the delicate balance between demand and supply and thus current prices should account for these future possibilities. We study the dynamic pricing problem of a retailer facing the prospect of a change in the <i>demand function</i> during a finite selling season with no inventory replenishment opportunity. In particular, the time of the change and the postchange demand function are unknown upfront, and we focus on the fundamental trade-off between collecting revenues from current demand and doing so for postchange demand, with the capacity constraint introducing the main tension. We develop a formulation that allows for isolating the role of dynamic pricing in balancing inventory consumption throughout the horizon. We establish that, in many settings, optimal pricing policies follow a monotone path up to the change in demand. We show how one may compare upfront the attractiveness of pre- and postchange demand conditions and how such a comparison depends on the problem primitives. We further analyze the impact of the model inputs on the optimal policy and its structure, ranging from the impact of model parameter changes to the impact of different representations of uncertainty about future demand.

Title: Are Call Center and Hospital Arrivals Well Modeled by Nonhomogeneous Poisson Processes?
Abstract: Service systems such as call centers and hospitals typically have strongly time-varying arrivals. A natural model for such an arrival process is a nonhomogeneous Poisson process (NHPP), but that should be tested by applying appropriate statistical tests to arrival data. Assuming that the NHPP has a rate that can be regarded as approximately piecewise-constant, a Kolmogorov&ndash;Smirnov (KS) statistical test of a Poisson process (PP) can be applied to test for a NHPP by combining data from separate subintervals, exploiting the classical conditional-uniform property. In this paper, we apply KS tests to banking call center and hospital emergency department arrival data and show that they are consistent with the NHPP property, but only if that data is analyzed carefully. Initial testing rejected the NHPP null hypothesis because it failed to account for three common features of arrival data: (i) data rounding, e.g., to seconds; (ii) choosing subintervals over which the rate varies too much; and (iii) overdispersion caused by combining data from fixed hours on a fixed day of the week over multiple weeks that do not have the same arrival rate. In this paper, we investigate how to address each of these three problems.

Title: Cost-per-Click Pricing for Display Advertising
Abstract: Display advertising is a &dollar;25 billion business with a promising upward revenue trend. In this paper, we consider an online display advertising setting in which a web publisher posts display ads on its website and charges based on the cost-per-click pricing scheme while promising to deliver a certain number of clicks to the ads posted. The publisher is faced with uncertain demand for advertising slots and uncertain traffic to its website as well as uncertain click behavior of visitors. We formulate the problem as a novel queueing system, where the slots correspond to service channels with the service rate of each server inversely related to the number of active servers. We obtain the closed-form solution for the steady-state probabilities of the number of ads in the publisher's system. We determine the publisher's optimal price to charge per click and show that it can increase in the number of advertising slots and the number of promised clicks. We show that the common heuristic used by many web publishers to convert between the cost-per-click and cost-per-impression pricing schemes using the so-called click-through-rate can be misleading because it may incur substantial revenue loss to web publishers. We provide an alternative explanation for the phenomenon observed by several publishers that the click-through-rate tends to drop when they switch from the cost-per-click to cost-per-impression pricing scheme.

Title: Joint Pricing and Production Decisions in an Assemble-to-Order System
Abstract: This paper studies coordinated pricing and production decisions in an assemble-to-order system. We first show that unlike in make-to-stock systems, a state-dependent base-stock list-price policy is optimal. The optimal state-dependent base-stock levels and list prices may increase or decrease as demand backlogs increase, whereas demand backlogs always improve the optimal expected profit. Because the problem easily becomes intractable under general system settings, we next develop a simple heuristic policy. The heuristic policy decouples inventory replenishment, pricing, and component allocation decisions in a coordinated way. We provide a sufficient condition that ensures the optimality of the heuristic policy, and present a numerical study to demonstrate its performance when the condition is not met. The numerical study also shows how the performance of the heuristic policy is affected by various market and operational conditions, and by the structure of the assemble-to-order system. By focusing on the simple W-model, we show how the heuristic pricing decisions are made in response to changes in inventory levels and various cost parameters.

Title: Dynamic Call Center Routing Policies Using Call Waiting and Agent Idle Times
Abstract: We study call routing policies for call centers with multiple call types and multiple agent groups. We introduce new weight-based routing policies where each pair (call type, agent group) is given a matching priority defined as an affine combination of the longest waiting time for that call type and the longest idle time or the number of idle agents in that agent group. The coefficients in this combination are parameters to be optimized. This type of policy is more flexible than traditional ones found in practice, and it performs better in many situations. We consider objective functions that account for the service levels, the abandonment ratios, and the fairness of occupancy across agent groups. We select the parameters of all considered policies via simulation-based optimization heuristics. This requires only the availability of a simulation model of the call center, which can be much more detailed and realistic than the models used elsewhere in the literature to study the optimality of certain types of routing rules. We offer a first numerical study of realistic routing rules that takes into account the complexity of real-life call centers.

Title: Exact Analysis of Capacitated Two-Echelon Inventory Systems with Priorities
Abstract: We consider a two-echelon inventory system with a capacitated centralized production facility and several distribution centers (DCs). Both production and transportation times are stochastic with general distributions. Demand arrives at each DC according to an independent Poisson process and is backlogged if the DC is out of stock. We allow different holding and backlog costs at the different DCs. We assume that inventory at DCs is managed using the one-for-one replenishment policy. The main objective of this paper is to investigate the control of the multiechelon <i>M</i>/<i>G</i>/1 setting with general transportation times. To achieve this objective, we analyze several decentralized allocation policies including the first-come, first-served (FCFS), strict priority (SP), and multilevel rationing (MR) policies. For our analytic results, we assume no order crossing. We derive the cost function for a capacitated two-echelon inventory system with general transportation times under these policies. Our numerical examples show that the FCFS policy may outperform the MR policy, even though the latter has been shown to be better in the centralized setting. This suggests that in decentralized settings there is a need to focus on policies that prioritize customers when there is backlog. This focus is in contrast to the centralized settings, where inventory rationing policies that focus on prioritization when there is available inventory are effective. We therefore introduce and analyze the generalized multilevel rationing (GMR) priority policy. We compare the GMR policy with other policies and show that the GMR policy outperforms the three policies used in the centralized setting. We also compare the GMR policy with the myopic (T), longest queue first (LQF), and the optimal (when order crossing is allowed during the transportation time) policies. Our results show that when the uncertainty of the transportation times is low, the GMR policy outperforms the myopic (T) and LQF policies and that the gap between the optimal policy and the GMR policy is not high.

Title: Optimal Design of Coproductive Services: Interaction and Work Allocation
Abstract: In services, customers provide significant inputs into the production process. In particular, these inputs may be the customers themselves participating in the service delivery. Although many service firms have explored different ways of involving customers in their production process, there is no clear guideline for the design of such coproductive systems. In this paper, we develop an analytical model of joint production between a service provider and a customer and characterize how a service firm should design its coproductive system. We show that, as a task becomes more standard, it is desirable to decrease the degree of interaction between the provider and the customer by making their efforts more substitutable and to allocate most of the work to whoever is the most efficient. Conversely, as a task becomes less standard, it is optimal to increase interaction by making efforts more complementary and to balance the work allocation. Our analysis gives rise to a service-process framework with three archetypes of coproductive services: collaborative services, service factories, and self-services. We discuss the implications of our results for service process reengineering.

Title: Kidney Exchange with Long Chains: An Efficient Pricing Algorithm for Clearing Barter Exchanges with Branch-and-Price
Abstract: Barter exchange markets are markets in which agents seek to directly trade their goods with each other. Exchanges occur in cycles or in chains in which each agent gives a good to the next agent. Kidney exchange is an important type of barter exchange market that allows incompatible patient&ndash;donor pairs to exchange kidneys so the involved patients can receive a transplant. The clearing problem is to find an allocation of donors to patients that is optimal with respect to multiple criteria. To achieve the best possible score on all criteria, long cycles and chains are often needed, particularly when there are many hard-to-match patients. In this paper we show why this may pose difficulties for existing approaches to the optimization of kidney exchanges. We then present a generic iterative branch-and-price algorithm that can deal effectively with multiple criteria, and we show how the pricing problem may be solved in polynomial time for a general class of criteria. Our algorithm is effective even for large, realistic patient&ndash;donor pools. Our approach and its effects are demonstrated by using simulations with kidney exchange data from the Netherlands and the United States.

Title: Inventory Management in Humanitarian Operations: Impact of Amount, Schedule, and Uncertainty in Funding
Abstract: Funding for humanitarian operations in the global health sector is highly variable and unpredictable. We study the problem of managing inventory in the presence of funding constraints over a finite planning period. Our goal is to determine the optimal procurement policy given the complexities associated with funding and also to analyze the impact of funding amount, funding schedule, and uncertainty around the funding timing on operations. We use a multiperiod stochastic inventory model with financial constraints and demonstrate that despite the funding complexities, the optimal replenishment policy is a state-independent policy that can be easily implemented. We also provide analytical results and several insights based on our computational study regarding the effect of funding timing uncertainty and variability on the operating costs and fill rates. Among other results, we find that receiving funding early is beneficial in underfinanced systems while avoiding funding delays is critical in fully financed systems. Our analysis also indicates that receiving less overall funding in a timely manner might actually be better than delayed full funding.

Title: Collaboration and Multitasking in Networks: Architectures, Bottlenecks, and Capacity
Abstract: Motivated by the trend toward more collaboration in work flows, we study networks where some activities require the simultaneous processing by multiple types of multitasking human resources. Collaboration imposes constraints on the capacity of the process because multitasking resources have to be simultaneously at the right place. We introduce the notions of collaboration architecture and unavoidable bottleneck idleness to study the maximal throughput or capacity of such networks. Collaboration and multitasking introduce synchronization requirements that may inflict unavoidable idleness of the bottleneck resources: even when the network is continuously busy (processing at capacity), bottleneck resources can never be fully utilized. The conventional approach that equates network capacity with bottleneck capacity is then incorrect because the network capacity is below that of the bottlenecks. In fact, the gap between the two can grow linearly with the number of collaborative activities. Our main result is that networks with nested collaboration architectures have no unavoidable bottleneck idleness. Then, regardless of the processing times of the various activities, the standard bottleneck procedure correctly identifies the network capacity. We also prove necessity in the sense that, for any nonnested architecture, there are values of processing times for which unavoidable idleness persists. The fundamental trade-off between collaboration and capacity does not disappear in multiserver networks and has important ramifications to service-system staffing. Yet, even in multiserver networks, a nested collaboration architecture still guarantees that the bottleneck capacity is achievable. Finally, simultaneous collaboration, as a process constraint, may limit the benefits of flexibility. We study the interplay of flexibility and unavoidable idleness and offer remedies derived from collaboration architectures.

Title: Demand Uncertainty and the Bayesian Effect in Markdown Pricing with Strategic Customers
Abstract: This paper studies the role of demand uncertainty in temporal discrimination when the retailer applies markdown pricing facing strategic customers. We consider a model in which a retail firm announces a pair of declining prices for two selling periods, and customers with heterogeneous valuations each decide whether to buy a unit early, later or never. In this model, if the demand function is linear and its parameters are common knowledge, there <i>never</i> exist any markdown prices that achieve temporal discrimination for any feasible model parameters. Either all buying customers wait, or all buy early. By contrast, if the demand level is unknown, there always exists a temporally discriminating markdown pricing scheme for all feasible model parameters. We derive qualitative insights to the way demand uncertainty and Bayesian updating contribute to temporal discrimination, which broadly apply to nonlinear demand functions as well. We also show that in case of demand uncertainty, there always exists a temporally discriminating pricing scheme that yields a strictly higher profit to the retailer than the optimal static pricing scheme. Ironically, however, the retailer cannot implement the optimal scheme due to the same demand uncertainty.

Title: The Impact of a Target on Newsvendor Decisions
Abstract: Goal achieving is a commonly observed phenomenon in practice, and it plays an important role in decision making. In this paper, we investigate the impact of a target on newsvendor decisions. We take into account the risk and model the effect of a target by maximizing the satisficing measure of a newsvendor’s profit with respect to that target. We study two satisficing measures: (i) conditional value at risk (CVaR) satisficing measure that evaluates the highest confidence level of CVaR achieving the target; (ii) entropic satisficing measure that assesses the smallest risk tolerance level under which the certainty equivalent for exponential utility function achieves the target. For both satisficing measures, we find that the optimal ordering quantity increases with the target level. We determine an optimal order quantity for a target-based newsvendor and characterize its properties with respect to, for example, product’s profit margin.

Title: No Claim? Your Gain: Design of Residual Value Extended Warranties Under Risk Aversion and Strategic Claim Behavior
Abstract: Traditional one-price-for-all extended warranties do not differentiate customers according to their risk attitudes, usage rates, or operating environment. These warranties are priced to cover the cost of high-usage customers who have more failures and are willing to pay a risk premium for their risk aversion. That makes traditional warranties economically unattractive to low-usage customers and those who are less risk averse. These issues can be addressed by residual value warranties, which refund part of the up-front price to customers who have zero or few claims according to a predetermined refund schedule. Residual value warranties may induce strategic claim behavior, since customers may prefer to pay for small failures out of pocket rather than claim failures now and give up potential refunds later.We design and price residual value warranties to maximize expected profits, taking into account strategic claim behavior and risk attitudes. For the constant absolute risk aversion model, we characterize customers’ optimal claim strategy as well as the net value and support cost for residual value warranties. Surprisingly, the total support cost to the service provider, including repair costs and refunds, is lower for more risk-averse customers under the residual value warranties, whereas their willingness to pay is higher. As contingent contracts, residual value warranties can better price discriminate customers than traditional warranties. We identify conditions under which residual value warranties are strictly more profitable than traditional warranties in a homogeneous market, as well as in heterogeneous markets that differ in various dimensions, such as risk attitude, failure rate, and repair cost.

Title: Advance Demand Information in a Multiproduct System
Abstract: In this paper we examine the impact of different types of advance demand information on firm profit and on the benefits of resource flexibility. Specifically, we consider a firm that must choose capacities of resources that will be used to satisfy stochastic demand for multiple products, where demands follow a multivariate normal distribution. Prior to the capacity decision, the firm receives information revealing either the total volume of demand across products or the mix of demand between products. We examine two different scenarios: a <i>dedicated resource</i> setting with product-specific resources and a <i>common resource</i> scenario with one flexible resource. For both scenarios we derive the distribution of the (possibly imperfect) volume or mix demand signal, as well as the conditional distributions of demand given the particular signal. We explore the impact of either type of information on optimal capacities and profit. We find that commonality and volume information are strategic complements—so that it is more valuable to obtain volume information in settings with a common resource. On the other hand, commonality and mix information are strategic substitutes. Moreover, we find that mix and volume information themselves are complements in systems with dedicated resources. Having either type of information is valuable in reducing uncertainty for each individual product demand, but having both of them together provides information on two different dimensions, allowing for a much greater reduction in demand uncertainty. In systems with a common resource, however, the two types of information are substitutes. Because volume information is well aligned with commonality (both focus on total demand), such information already provides much of the value that can be obtained—having mix information adds limited additional value.

Title: Toward Mass Adoption of Electric Vehicles: Impact of the Range and Resale Anxieties
Abstract: Key to the mass adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) is the establishment of successful business models based on sound understanding of consumer behavior in adopting this new technology. In this paper, we study the impact of two major barriers to mass adoption of EVs: (i) range anxiety, the concern that the driving range of EVs may be insufficient to meet the driving needs, and (ii) resale anxiety, the concern that used values of EVs may deteriorate quickly. Using a stylized model calibrated to a data set based on the San Francisco Bay Area, we show that although both types of consumer anxieties typically harm the firm’s profit, they often improve consumer surplus. In addition, we show that a business model that requires consumers to lease the EV batteries (rather than purchase them) may lead to a greater level of adoption and emission savings when the level of resale anxiety is high. Further, a business model that offers EV range improvement through enhanced charging infrastructure typically yields greater adoption and consumer surplus, but lowers the firm’s profit, compared with one that offers enlarged batteries. Overall, we find that the combinations of battery owning/leasing with enhanced charging service, referred to as the (O, E) and (L, E) models in our paper, typically yield the best balance among the objectives of EV adoption, emission savings, profitability, and consumer surplus, when the degree of resale anxiety is low and high, respectively.

Title: Making Better Fulfillment Decisions on the Fly in an Online Retail Environment
Abstract: Relative to brick-and-mortar retailers, online retailers have the potential to offer more options to their customers, with respect to both inventory as well as delivery times. To do this entails the management of a distribution network with more decision options than a traditional retailer. The online retailer, not the customer, decides from where items will ship, by what shipping method, and how or whether multiple-item orders will be broken up into multiple shipments. What is the best way to fulfill each customer’s order to minimize average outbound shipping cost? We partner with an online retailer to examine this question. We develop a heuristic that makes fulfillment decisions by minimizing the immediate outbound shipping cost plus an estimate of future expected outbound shipping costs. These estimates are derived from the dual values of a transportation linear program (LP). In our experiments on industry data, we capture 36% of the opportunity gap assuming clairvoyance, leading to reductions in outbound shipping costs on the order of 1%. These cost savings are achieved without any deterioration in customer service levels or any increase in holding costs. The transportation LP also serves as the basis for a metric that provides information on the quality of the inventory position. Based on initial successful piloting, our industrial partner has implemented the metric as well as a version of the heuristic that it is applying to every fulfillment decision for each of its stock keeping units in North America.

Title: Determining Optimal Parameters for Expediting Policies
Abstract: We consider an inventory policy that expedites delivery times of open orders if the inventory level drops below a certain threshold. By expediting open orders, back orders can be reduced. Order expediting is costly, and we include various types of expediting costs in the model. We prove structural properties of the model and show how the optimal parameters of the expediting policy can be computed efficiently. The expediting policy is easy to implement and, for situations with variable expediting cost only, the structure of the policy is optimal. For situations with nonvariable expediting costs, the expediting policy that we consider is generally not optimal. The optimal policy can be computed by dynamic programming, but this approach is computationally feasible only for small-problem instances. We conduct numerical experiments that are based on data from the service division of a global equipment manufacturer to evaluate the performances of the expediting policy and the optimal policy. The results show that substantial cost savings can be achieved by order expediting and that the expediting policy realizes a great share of the cost-saving potential offered by order expediting.

Title: Dynamic Knowledge Transfer and Knowledge Development for Product and Process Design Teams
Abstract: We consider a manager who invests in knowledge development of a product and a process design team as well as knowledge transfer between teams throughout a new product development (NPD) project. Knowledge development at a particular time (e.g., prototyping and experimentation) increases a team’s level of knowledge at that time. In contrast, the recipient’s benefits from knowledge transfer may be lagged because of the difficulties in articulating and documenting knowledge as well as the challenges regarding its interpretation and application. Over time, as each team embeds knowledge in the NPD project, the levels of product and process performance increase, thereby increasing the net revenue earned at the product launch time. In a key contribution to the literature, analytic conditions are given that characterize the dynamic rates at which knowledge development and knowledge transfer occur throughout the project. We show that the investment in knowledge development for each team and knowledge transfer between teams may be constant, front-loaded, back-loaded, U-shaped, or the peak rate may be delayed over time. As such, we show how concurrent engineering is optimally pursued throughout the NPD project.

Title: Inventory Control in a Spare Parts Distribution System with Emergency Stocks and Pipeline Information
Abstract: Motivated by collaboration with a global spare parts service provider, we consider a two-echelon inventory system with multiple local warehouses, a so-called support warehouse, and a central warehouse with ample capacity. In case of stock-outs, the local warehouses can receive emergency shipments from the support warehouse or the central warehouse at an extra cost. Our focus is on using information on orders in the replenishment pipeline, i.e., pipeline information, to achieve cost-efficient policies for requesting emergency shipments. We introduce a policy where the request for an emergency shipment is based on the time until an outstanding order will reach the stock point considered. The goal is to determine how long one should wait for stock in the replenishment pipeline before requesting an emergency shipment, and the cost effects of using pipeline information in this manner. The analysis utilizes results from queuing theory and provides a decomposition technique for optimizing the policy parameters that reduces the complex multiechelon problem to more manageable single-echelon problems. The performance of our policy indicates that there can be a significant benefit in using pipeline information.

Title: OM Forum—Operations and Finance Interactions
Abstract: This paper, based on my remarks at the 2013 MSOM Distinguished Fellow Award ceremony, describes my views on the interface between operations and finance and the lessons that each field can gain from considering their interactions. The key points are that, whereas operational models often avoid financial considerations such as the role of investors and other market participants, both firm and market financial activity can have a significant effect on the impact of operational decisions. Some of these considerations, such as the implications of market arbitrage, can void the relevance of operational models that ignore financial issues. The paper discusses such operational areas where financial activity has significant potential for impact on operations, as well as points where operational considerations provide new perspectives on financial decisions. In particular, I review basic concepts, provide examples, and give some empirical observations in my work about the implications of the absence of arbitrage, the differences between systematic and idiosyncratic risk, the valuation of limited production resources, and the inclusion of imperfect market assumptions.

Title: Optimal Decentralization of Early Infant Diagnosis of HIV in Resource-Limited Settings
Abstract: Early infant diagnosis (EID) programs in many resource-limited settings are aimed at diagnosing infants born to HIV-infected mothers. Because of the complexity of the diagnostic technology, EID programs are often highly centralized with few laboratories testing blood samples from a large network of health facilities. This leads to long diagnostic delays and consequent failure of patients to collect results in a timely manner. Several point-of-care (POC) devices that provide rapid diagnosis within the health facilities are being developed to mitigate these drawbacks of centralized EID networks. We study the decision of which facilities should receive the POC device (the placement plan) using the EID program in Mozambique as a case study. We argue that the choice of an appropriate plan is critical to maximizing the public health impact of POC devices in the presence of tight budget constraints. To formalize this argument, we develop a detailed simulation model to evaluate the impact of a placement plan. It comprises two parts: an operational model that quantifies the impact of a POC placement plan on the diagnostic delay and a behavioral part that quantifies the impact of diagnostic delay on the likelihood of result collection by infants’ caregivers. We also develop an approximate version of these operational and patient behavior dynamics and embed them in an optimization model to generate candidate POC placement plans. We find that the optimization-based plan can result in up to 30% more patients collecting their results compared to rules of thumb that have practical appeal. Finally, we show that the effectiveness of POC devices is much higher than other operational improvements to the EID network such as increased laboratory capacity, reduced transportation delay, and more regularized transport.

Title: Production Smoothing and the Bullwhip Effect
Abstract: The bullwhip effect and production smoothing appear antithetical because their empirical tests oppose one another: production variability exceeding sales variability for bullwhip, and vice versa for smoothing. But this is a false dichotomy. We distinguish between the phenomena with a new production smoothing measure, which estimates how much more variable production would be absent production volatility costs. We apply our metric to an automotive manufacturing sample comprising 162 car models and find 75% smooth production by at least 5%, despite the fact that 99% exhibit the bullwhip effect. Indeed, we estimate both a strong bullwhip (on average, production is 220% as variable as sales) and robust smoothing (on average, production would be 22% more variable without deliberate stabilization). We find firms smooth both production variability and production uncertainty. We measure production smoothing with a structural econometric production scheduling model, based on the generalized order-up-to policy.

Title: Hedging Commodity Procurement in a Bilateral Supply Chain
Abstract: This paper explores the merits of hedging stochastic input costs (i.e., reducing the risk of adverse changes in costs) in a decentralized, risk-neutral supply chain. Specifically, we consider a generalized version of the well-known “selling-to-the-newsvendor” model in which both the upstream and the downstream firms face stochastic input costs. The firms’ operations are intertwined—i.e., the downstream buyer depends on the upstream supplier for delivery and the supplier depends on the buyer for purchase. We show that if left unmanaged, the stochastic costs that reverberate through the supply chain can lead to significant financial losses. The situation could deteriorate to the point of a supply disruption if at least one of the supply chain members cannot profitably make its product. To the extent that hedging can ensure continuation in supply, hedging can have value to at least some of the members of the supply chain. We identify conditions under which the risk of the supply chain breakdown will cause the supply chain members to hedge their input costs: (i) the downstream buyer’s market power exceeds a critical threshold; or (ii) the upstream firm operates on a large margin, there is a high baseline demand for downstream firm’s final product, and the downstream firm’s market power is below a critical threshold. In absence of these conditions there are equilibria in which neither firm hedges. To sustain hedging in equilibrium, both firms must hedge and supply chain breakdown must be costly. The equilibrium hedging policy will (in general) be a partial hedging policy. There are also situations when firms hedge in equilibrium although hedging reduces their expected payoff.

Title: Priority Allocation in a Rental Model with Decreasing Demand
Abstract: We analyze a model of rental and return process where limited inventory of a product is rented to two customer classes that differ in their return behavior and penalty costs. The rental demand is a decreasing function of time. We consider two cases: where a demand that is not met is lost and where an unmet demand returns. We show that to minimize penalty cost, the optimal allocation policy may give priority to different classes at different points in time and may decline lower-class demand for some time. Computational results show the benefit of the optimal allocation policy over a priority scheme reportedly used in practice.

Title: Managing Hospital Inpatient Bed Capacity Through Partitioning Care into Focused Wings
Abstract: We consider the partitioning of care types into wings from the perspective of a hospital administrator who wishes to optimize the use of a fixed number of beds that provide services for heterogeneous care types. The hospital administrator decides on the number of wings to form, the number of beds to allocate to each wing, and the set of care types to assign to each wing to maximize the total utility to the hospital. The administrator faces an inherent trade-off between forming large wings to pool demand and bed capacity, and forming specialized wings to focus on narrow ranges of care types. Specialized wings not only provide advantages from focused care but also allow the protection of beds for high-utility care types. We provide an optimization model for the wing formation decision and address the advantages of focus endogenously in our model. Using data from a large urban teaching hospital in the United States along with a national database, we report on a number of managerial insights. In particular, as the overall demand increases across all care types, wings are formed to reserve more beds for higher-utility types, which leads to higher overall hospital utility but also some disparity across types, such as increased hospital access for some and decreased access for others. Furthermore, overall bed occupancy decreases as the hospital is split into wings. However, if sufficient focus is attained, shorter lengths-of-stay associated with focused care may increase overall patient throughput. We also observe that when patients are willing to wait longer for admission, the hospital tends to form more wings. This implies that hospitals that garner longer waits can form more specialized wings and thereby benefit from focused care, whereas hospitals that cannot will tend to form fewer, if any, wings, choosing to pool demand and bed capacity.

Title: Bundled Procurement for Technology Acquisition and Future Competition
Abstract: Consider a buyer who would like to procure certain products for the current period and the underlying technologies so that he can become a supplier and compete with current suppliers in the future market. One potential procurement mechanism for such a buyer is to bundle the procurement project with technology acquisition. We propose a dynamic stochastic game-theoretic model that analyzes the optimal technology offer strategies of the asymmetric suppliers and highlights how the size of the current project, relative to the size of the future market, and supplier competition determine the effectiveness of the bundled procurement mechanism for the buyer. For the two-supplier case, we find that each supplier has a dominant technology offer strategy that is independent of the opponent’s strategy. When the relative size of the project is small, suppliers only offer obsolete technologies even if their technologies are perfect substitutes. While suppliers offer better technologies as the project size increases, their responses in technology offers are not continuous with respect to the project size—once the project size reaches some threshold, suppliers’ optimal responses jump to their best technologies. We also observe that the premium needed for technology acquisition under the bundled procurement mechanism can be negligible compared to the expected profit from the future market.

Title: Merchant Commodity Storage and Term-Structure Model Error
Abstract: Merchant operations involves valuing and hedging the cash flows of commodity- and energy-conversion assets as real options based on stochastic models that inevitably embed model error. In this paper we quantify how empirically calibrated model errors concerning the futures term structure affect the valuation and hedging of natural gas storage. We find that even small model errors—on the order of 1%–2% of the empirical futures price variance—can have a disproportionate impact on storage valuation and hedging. In particular, theoretically equivalent hedging strategies have very different sensitivities to model error, with one natural strategy exhibiting potentially catastrophic performance in the presence of small model errors. We propose effective approaches to mitigate the negative effect of futures term-structure model error on hedging, also taking into account futures contract illiquidity, and provide theoretical justification for some of these approaches. Beyond commodity storage, our analysis has relevance for other real and financial options that depend on futures term-structure dynamics, as well as for inventory, production, and capacity investment policies that rely on demand-forecast term structures.

Title: Dynamic Pricing and Inventory Management Under Fluctuating Procurement Costs
Abstract: We consider a periodic review joint pricing and inventory control model in which a firm faces both stochastic demand and fluctuating procurement costs. To address procurement cost fluctuation, the firm adopts a dual-sourcing strategy, under which it procures from a spot market with immediate delivery and through a forward-buying contract with postponed delivery. Our analysis offers the unique insight that a risk-neutral firm may earn higher expected profit under a more volatile procurement cost process. This is because the firm makes its pricing and sourcing decisions in response to the realized cost in each period. Moreover, we characterize how the firm should dynamically adjust its pricing and sourcing decisions in accordance to cost evolution. For example, if sourcing through the forward-buying contract is less expensive than sourcing directly from the spot market, the optimal safety stock is decreasing in the current spot market purchasing cost. However, the optimal order quantity through the forward-buying contract is, in general, not monotone in the current spot-purchasing cost. Finally, we conduct extensive numerical experiments to show that dynamic pricing and dual sourcing may be either strategic complements or substitutes in the presence of fluctuating procurement costs and uncertain demand. This is because dynamic pricing mitigates demand uncertainty risk and exploits procurement cost fluctuation, whereas dual sourcing may either intensify or dampen demand risk.

Title: Demand Estimation from Censored Observations with Inventory Record Inaccuracy
Abstract: A retailer cannot sell more than it has in stock; therefore, its sales observations are a censored representation of the underlying demand process. When a retailer forecasts demand based on past sales observations, it requires an estimation approach that accounts for this censoring. Several authors have analyzed inventory management with demand learning in environments with censored observations, but the authors assume that inventory levels are known and hence that stockouts are observed. However, firms often do not know how many units of inventory are available to meet demand, a phenomenon known as inventory record inaccuracy. We investigate the impact of this unknown on demand estimation in an environment with censored observations. When the firm does not account for inventory uncertainty when estimating demand, we discover and characterize a systematic downward bias in demand estimation under typical assumptions on the distribution of inventory record inaccuracies. We propose and test a heuristic prescription that relies on a single error statistic and that sharply reduces this bias.

Title: Does Organizational Forgetting Affect Vendor Quality Performance? An Empirical Investigation
Abstract: The development of organizational knowledge and the depreciation of knowledge within organizations are processes that invariably occur concurrently. In the quality domain, many researchers have examined how the development of organizational knowledge (organizational learning) enhances quality performance. We build on this literature and investigate how the depreciation of organizational knowledge (organizational forgetting) affects quality performance. We analyze information on 2,732 quality improvement initiatives implemented by 295 vendors of a car manufacturer and find that organizational forgetting affects quality gains obtained from both learning-by-doing (autonomous learning) and quality improvement initiatives (induced learning); more than 16% of quality gains from autonomous learning and 13% of quality gains from induced learning depreciate every year. Furthermore, the impact of organizational forgetting (i) differs across the types of quality improvement efforts (quality gains from process improvement initiatives depreciate, whereas those from quality assurance initiatives do not), and (ii) depends on where quality knowledge was embedded (depreciation is lower for knowledge embedded in technology than for knowledge embedded in organizational routines or organizational members). Our results highlight the ubiquity of organizational forgetting and suggest the need for continued attention to sustain and enhance quality performance in supply chains.

Title: An Information Stock Model of Customer Behavior in Multichannel Customer Support Services
Abstract: We develop a model to understand and predict customers’ observed multichannel behavior in a customer support setting. Using individual-level data from a U.S.-based health insurance firm, we model a customer’s query frequency and choice of using the telephone or web channel for resolving queries as a stochastic function of her latent “information stock.” The information stock is a function of the customer’s “information needs” (which arise when customers file health insurance claims) and “information gains” (which customers obtain when they resolve their queries through the telephone and web support channels), and other factors such as seasonal effects (for instance, queries that arise at the time of annual contract renewal). We find that average information gain from a telephone call is twice as much as that from visiting the web portal; customers prefer the telephone channel for health event-related information but prefer the web portal for structured seasonal information; and customers are polarized in their propensities of using the web channel and can be broadly classified into “web avoiders” and “web seekers.” Our model provides superior in-sample and out-of-sample fit than multiple benchmark models for aggregate and individual-level customer activity and has several managerial uses, such as capacity planning.

Title: Combating Strategic Counterfeiters in Licit and Illicit Supply Chains
Abstract: Counterfeit goods are becoming more sophisticated, from shoes to infant milk powder to aircraft parts, creating problems for consumers, firms, and governments. By comparing two types of counterfeiters—deceptive, so infiltrating a licit (but complicit) distributor, or nondeceptive in an illicit channel—we provide insights into the impact of anticounterfeiting strategies on a brand-name company, a counterfeiter, and consumers. Our analysis highlights that the effectiveness of these strategies depends critically on whether a brand-name company faces a nondeceptive or deceptive counterfeiter. For example, by improving quality, the brand-name company can improve her expected profit against a nondeceptive counterfeiter when the counterfeiter steals an insignificant amount of brand value. However, the same strategy does not work well against the deceptive counterfeiter unless high quality facilitates the seizure of deceptive counterfeits significantly. Similarly, reducing price works well in combating the nondeceptive counterfeiter, but it could be ineffective against the deceptive counterfeiter. Moreover, the strategies that improve the profit of the brand-name company may benefit the counterfeiter inadvertently and even hurt consumer welfare. Therefore, firms and governments should carefully consider a trade-off among different objectives in implementing an anticounterfeiting strategy.

Title: OM Forum—The Service and Information Economy: Research Opportunities
Abstract: The U.S. economy is already dominated by service and information-intensive industries in terms of both gross national product and jobs, and these trends are visible in all major world economies. These economic shifts are driven by productivity changes, which today often depend on new information and communication technologies. These changes can be thought of as service industrialization, which underlies productivity improvements. Industrialization is, in turn, closely related to the design and operation of service processes at the level of firms and sectors. Some of the implications for process economics, operations strategy, and process management are outlined, and the opportunities for research in operations and technology management related to these trends are discussed.

Title: Manufacturing Capacity Decisions with Demand Uncertainty and Tax Cross-Crediting
Abstract: The U.S. tax law taxes the global income of multinational firms (MNFs) at their home country tax rate. To avoid double taxation, it permits <i>tax cross-crediting</i>. Through this strategy, global firms can use excess foreign tax credits (FTCs), the portion of foreign tax payments that exceed their home country tax liabilities, generated from a subsidiary located in a high-tax country to offset the tax liabilities of their low-tax divisions. This paper studies manufacturing capacity decisions in the subsidiary of an MNF with tax cross-crediting. Casting the problem on a newsvendor model, and assuming the objective of maximizing the global firm’s worldwide after-tax profits, we show that the optimal capacity decision under the effects of tax cross-crediting can behave very differently from that of the traditional newsvendor model. In particular, we show that an improvement in the firm’s after-tax profitability (through tax cross-crediting, an increased profit margin, or a reduced tax rate) might reduce the optimal capacity and that the optimal capacity decision under certain circumstances can be made without the knowledge of the demand distribution. We also discuss the issue of motivating the division manager to use an after-tax performance measure with a managerial tax rate.

Title: Price Commitments with Strategic Consumers: Why It Can Be Optimal to Discount More Frequently … Than Optimal
Abstract: In many markets consumers incur search costs, and firms choose a long-run pricing strategy that determines how they respond to market conditions. A pricing strategy may involve commitments to take actions that do not optimize short-term revenue given the information the firm learns about demand. For example, as already suggested in the literature, the firm could commit to a single price no matter whether demand is strong or weak. We introduce a new strategy—charge a “high” price only if demand is indeed “high,” otherwise offer a discount. This strategy discounts more frequently than would maximize revenue conditional on demand. Nevertheless, the frequent discounts attract consumers. We show that (i) the discount-frequently strategy is optimal (whether capacity is adjustable or not), (ii) discount-frequently is often much better than other pricing strategies, especially if no price commitment is made, and (iii) “overbuying” capacity (e.g., inventory) to attract consumers (by signaling availability and the likelihood of discounts) is a poor strategy. Contrary to some recommendations in the literature to limit markdowns and to purchase ample capacity, our results provide support for a strategy that embraces frequent discounts and moderate capacity.

Title: Incentive Contracts in Serial Stochastic Projects
Abstract: In this paper we propose an incentive payment contract for stochastic projects defined by a series of stages or tasks that are outsourced to independent subcontractors. Projects defined by sequentially completed independent stages are common in new product development and other high-risk projects. Our goal is to maximize the client’s expected discounted profit. Our proposed contract reflects the convex time-cost trade-off that is well known in the project scheduling literature. We show that this type of contract dominates a fixed price contract with respect to expected client’s profit and schedule performance, regardless of payment timing considerations. Using a piecewise linear approximation, we show that our contract is a generalization of an incentive/disincentive contract that is frequently used in practice. We show how our contract can be used to find the optimal due date and penalties/bonuses in an incentive/disincentive contract. We compare this contract with several variations and discuss implications for both the client and subcontractors.

Title: Wine Futures and Advance Selling Under Quality Uncertainty
Abstract: This study examines the use of wine futures (i.e., advance selling of wine before it is bottled) as a form of operational flexibility to mitigate quality rating risk. At the end of a harvest season, the winemaker obtains a certain number of barrels of wine that can be produced for a particular vintage. While the wine is aging in the barrel, expert reviewers taste the wine and create a <i>barrel score</i>, indicating the potential quality of the wine and offering clues as to whether, when bottled, it will be superior wine. Based on the barrel score, the wine producer determines (1) the percentage of its wine to be sold as futures and (2) the price of the wine futures. After one more year of aging, the wine is bottled, and the reviewers provide a second review of the wine and assign a <i>bottle score</i> that influences the market price of the wine. Our study makes three contributions. First, we develop an analytical model that incorporates uncertain consumer valuations of wine futures and bottled wine and the uncertain bottle rating that is assigned to the wine at the end of the production process. Our analysis provides insights into how the barrel score, consumer preference (through a conditional-value-at-risk perspective) and the winemaker’s preference influence the winemaker’s allocation and pricing decisions. Our second contribution relates to the impact of consumer heterogeneity on the optimal allocation and pricing decisions. Contrary to common belief that the winemaker may be better off when consumers are more homogeneous, our results demonstrate that the winemaker can achieve a higher level of profitability when the market is filled with consumers that are heterogeneous. Third, we test our findings using data collected from Bordeaux wineries engaging in wine futures. Our empirical analysis demonstrates that (1) barrel scores play a significant role in the two decisions regarding the quantity and price of wine futures, and (2) the wine futures market provides a sizable financial benefit to the winemakers. Our analysis yields recommendations for artisanal and boutique wineries that have limited or no experience selling wine futures.

Title: Newsvendor Selling to Loss-Averse Consumers with Stochastic Reference Points
Abstract: We study a newsvendor who sells a perishable asset over repeated periods to consumers with a given consumption valuation for the product. The market size in each period is random, following a stationary distribution. Consumers are loss averse with <i>stochastic</i> reference points that represent their beliefs about possible <i>price</i> and <i>product availability</i>. Given the distribution of reference points, they choose purchase plans to maximize their expected total utility, including gain-loss utility, before visiting the store, and follow the plans in the store. In anticipation of consumers' purchase plans, in each period, before demand uncertainty resolves, the firm chooses an initial order quantity. After the uncertainty resolves, the firm chooses a contingent price depending on the demand realization, with the option of clearing inventory by charging a sale price, and otherwise, posting a full price. Over repeated periods, the interaction of the firm’s operational decisions about ordering and contingent pricing and the consumers' purchase actions results in a distribution of reference points, and, in equilibrium, this distribution is consistent with consumers' beliefs. Under this framework of <i>endogenized</i> reference points, we fully characterize the firm’s optimal inventory and contingent pricing policies. We identify conditions under which the firm’s expected price and profit are increasing in the consumer loss aversion level. We also show that the firm can prefer demand variability over no-demand uncertainty. We obtain a set of insights into how consumers' loss aversion affects the firm’s optimal operational policies that are in stark contrast to those obtained in classic newsvendor models. As examples, the optimal full price increases in the initial order quantity; and the optimal full price decreases, while the optimal sales frequency increases, in the procurement cost.

Title: Joint Selling of Complementary Components Under Brand and Retail Competition
Abstract: Suppliers of complementary goods often package their items together when selling to downstream retailers. One motivation behind this behavior is to reduce double marginalization through coordinated pricing so that system efficiency is improved and individual members can also benefit. The objective of this paper is to understand how competition in supply chains would impact such joint selling partnerships among complementary suppliers. We first model competition at the supply level, which is generated from the existence of multiple partially substitutable brands (or suppliers) for a particular component. We then extend the analysis to a model that also involves retail competition caused by decentralization among retailers who assemble suppliers' components into final products and sell to customers. The analysis of a model with two complementary components, one of which has multiple brands, indicates that the supply-level competition discourages joint selling of complementary goods. That is, when competing brands become more alike (or substitutable), complementary suppliers act more independently in pricing and selling their items. However, retail competition leads to an opposite effect: Competition among retailers would actually encourage complementary suppliers to package their goods together and act jointly.

Title: Pricing and Production Flexibility: An Empirical Analysis of the U.S. Automotive Industry
Abstract: We use a detailed data set from the U.S. auto industry spanning from 2002 to 2009 and a variety of econometric methods to characterize the relationship between the availability of production mix flexibility and firms’ use of responsive pricing. We find that production mix flexibility is associated with reductions in observed manufacturer discounts, resulting from the increased ability to match supply and demand. Under the observed market conditions, mix flexibility accounts for substantial average savings by reducing price discounting by approximately 10% of the average industry discount. We test three supplementary hypotheses and find that the reduction in discounts for vehicles manufactured at flexible plants is (1) higher for higher demand uncertainty, (2) higher for vehicles coproduced with vehicles that belong to a different segment, and (3) lower in situations with higher local competition.

Title: Capacity Investment in Renewable Energy Technology with Supply Intermittency: Data Granularity Matters!
Abstract: We study an organization’s one-time capacity investment in a renewable energy-producing technology with supply intermittency and net metering compensation. The renewable technology can be coupled with conventional technologies to form a capacity portfolio that is used to meet stochastic demand for energy. The technologies have different initial investments and operating costs, and the operating costs follow different stochastic processes. We show how to reduce this problem to a single-period decision problem and how to estimate the joint distribution of the stochastic factors using historical data. Importantly, we show that data granularity for renewable yield and electricity demand at a fine level, such as hourly, matters: Without energy storage, coarse data that does not reflect the intermittency of renewable generation may lead to an overinvestment in renewable capacity. We obtain solutions that are simple to compute, intuitive, and provide managers with a framework for evaluating the trade-offs of investing in renewable and conventional technologies. We illustrate our model using two case studies: one for investing in a solar rooftop system for a bank branch and another for investing in a solar thermal system for water heating in a hotel, along with a conventional natural gas heating system.

Title: Sales Force Behavior, Pricing Information, and Pricing Decisions
Abstract: This paper focuses on salespeople behavior in business-to-business transactions. The paper investigates how salespeople use the information provided to them to set prices; of particular interest is how salespeople use price recommendations from a decision support tool. The investigation builds reduced-form models and tests them on a data set obtained by a grocery products distributor. The analysis shows that salespeople’s decisions are explained well by a two-stage decision model whereby salespeople make an initial decision on whether or not to change the price (a binary decision) and then decide on the magnitude of change (a continuous response). We find that salespeople in our data set do not blindly adopt the recommended price change generated by the pricing tool. Rather, our two-stage model allows for us to uncover a nuanced association between the recommended price and the actual price change by identifying customer-specific and salesperson-specific market factors that moderate the influence of price recommendations.

Title: Reliable Facility Location Design Under Uncertain Correlated Disruptions
Abstract: Most previous studies on reliable facility location design assume that disruptions at different locations are independent. In this paper, we present a model that allows disruptions to be correlated with an uncertain joint distribution, and we apply distributionally robust optimization to minimize the expected cost under the worst-case distribution with given marginal disruption probabilities. The worst-case distribution has a practical interpretation with disruption propagation, and its sparse structure allows solving the problem efficiently. Our numerical results show that ignoring disruption correlation could lead to significant loss that increases dramatically in key factors such as source disaster probability, disruption propagation effect, and service interruption penalty. On the other hand, the robust model results in very low regret, even when disruptions are independent, and starts to outperform the model assuming independence when disruptions are mildly correlated. Most of the benefit of the robust model can be captured with a very low additional cost, which makes it easy to implement. Given these advantages, we believe that the robust model can serve as a promising alternative approach for solving reliable facility location problems.

Title: PBM Competition in Pharmaceutical Supply Chain: Formulary Design and Drug Pricing
Abstract: We model the competition among multiple pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) for the patronage of a client organization. Each PBM selects a list of prices to be charged to the client organization for each of the branded and generic drugs within a therapeutic class (price decision) and a formulary list that assigns branded drugs to preferred or nonpreferred tiers (formulary decision). Drug manufacturers offer rebates to PBMs for drugs on preferred tier of formularies. The individuals participating in the client’s pharmacy benefit plan are the ones consuming the drugs and making purchasing decisions, whereas the client organization is paying the majority of drug cost. The choices of the individuals and the client organization are governed by different utility measures. For this complex drug distribution setting and for competing PBMs, we show the existence and uniqueness of a pure Nash equilibrium on aggregate formulary and price decisions, which represent the welfare-adjusted cost and welfare-adjusted price of each PBM’s plan, respectively. We characterize each PBM’s optimal formulary and equilibrium price decisions and discuss the impact of various model primitives. We apply our model to gain insights on the impact of mergers in the PBM industry.

Title: Consignment Contracts with Revenue Sharing for a Capacitated Retailer and Multiple Manufacturers
Abstract: We consider a retailer with limited storage capacity selling <i>n</i> independent products. Each product is produced by a distinct manufacturer, who is offered a consignment contract with revenue sharing by the retailer. The retailer first sets a common revenue share for all products, and each manufacturer then determines the retail price and production quantity for his product. Under certain conditions on price elasticities and cost fractions, we find a unique optimal revenue share for all products. Surprisingly, it is optimal for the retailer not to charge any storage fee in many situations even if she is allowed to do so. Both the retailer’s and manufacturers’ profits first increase and then remain constant as the capacity increases, which implies that an optimal capacity exists. We also find that the decentralized system requires no larger storage space than the centralized system at the expense of channel profit. If products are complementary, as the degree of complementarity increases, the retailer will decrease her revenue share to encourage the manufacturers to lower their prices.

Title: Dynamic Assortment Customization with Limited Inventories
Abstract: We consider a retailer with limited inventory of identically priced, substitutable products. The retailer faces a market with multiple segments of customers that are heterogeneous with respect to their product preferences. Customers arrive sequentially, and the firm decides which subset of products to offer to each arriving customer depending on the customer’s preferences, the inventory levels, and the remaining time in the season. We show that it is optimal to limit the choice set of some customers (even when the products are in stock), reserving products with low inventory levels for future customers who may have a stronger preference for those products. In certain settings, we prove that it is optimal to follow a threshold policy under which a product is offered to a customer segment if its inventory level is higher than a threshold value. The thresholds are decreasing in time and increasing in the inventory levels of other products. We introduce two heuristics derived by approximating the future marginal expected revenue by the marginal value of a newsvendor function that captures the substitution dynamics between products. We test the impact of assortment customization using data from a fashion retailer. We find that the potential revenue impact of assortment customization can be significant, especially when customer heterogeneity is high and when the products’ inventory-to-demand ratios are asymmetric. Our findings suggest that assortment customization can be used as another lever for revenue maximization in addition to pricing.

Title: The Price of Nonabandonment: HIV in Resource-Limited Settings
Abstract: The global fight against HIV/AIDS is hindered by a lack of drugs in the developing world. When patients in these countries initiate treatment, they typically remain on it until death; thus, policy makers and physicians follow <i>nonabandonment</i> policies. However, treated patients develop resistance to treatment, so in many cases untreated patients might benefit more from the drugs. In this paper we quantify the opportunity cost associated with restricting attention to nonabandonment policies. For this, we use an approximate dynamic programming framework to bound the benefit from allowing premature treatment termination. Our results indicate that in sub-Saharan Africa, the price associated with restricting attention to nonabandonment policies lies between 4.4% and 8.1% of the total treatment benefit. We also derive superior treatment allocation policies, which shed light on the role behavior and health progression play in prioritizing treatment initiation and termination.

Title: Parametric Forecasting and Stochastic Programming Models for Call-Center Workforce Scheduling
Abstract: We develop and test an integrated forecasting and stochastic programming approach to workforce management in call centers. We first demonstrate that parametric forecasts, discretized using Gaussian quadrature, can be used to drive stochastic programs whose results are stable with relatively small numbers of scenarios. We then extend our approach to include forecast updates and two-stage stochastic programs with recourse and provide a general modeling framework for which recent, related models are special cases. In our formulations, the inclusion of multiple arrival-rate scenarios allows call centers to meet long-run average quality-of-service targets, and the use of recourse actions helps them to lower long-run average costs. Experiments with two large sets of call-center data highlight the complementary nature of these elements.

Title: Multicommodity Production Planning: Qualitative Analysis and Applications
Abstract: We develop a qualitative analysis theory for the convex-cost dynamic multicommodity production planning problem, which can be used, without performing any computational work, to provide invaluable insight to managers when faced with the task of deciding how to respond to changes in problem environment. We first formulate the problem as a multicommodity flow problem with parameters associated with each arc–commodity pair. We then reduce the problem to an equivalent single-commodity flow problem and develop a complete characterization of conformality among production, sales, and inventory activities in various instances of the problem. By combining the conformality characterizations with the monotonicity theory of Granot and Veinott [Granot F, Veinott AF Jr (1985) Substitutes, complements and ripples in network flow. <i>Math. Oper. Res.</i> 10:471–497] for single-commodity problems, we study the effects of changes in problem environment on optimal production, sales, and inventory schedules in the multicommodity problem. Numerous applications are presented and analyzed.

Title: Supplier Evasion of a Buyer’s Audit: Implications for Motivating Supplier Social and Environmental Responsibility
Abstract: Prominent buyers’ brands have been damaged because their suppliers caused major harm to workers or the environment, e.g., through a deadly factory fire or release of toxic chemicals. How can buyers motivate suppliers to exert greater care to prevent such harm? This paper characterizes a “backfiring condition” under which actions taken by prominent buyers (increasing auditing, publicizing negative audit reports, providing loans to suppliers) motivate a supplier to exert greater effort to pass the buyer’s audit by hiding information and <i>less</i> care to prevent harm. Intuitively appealing actions for a buyer (penalizing a supplier for harming workers or the environment, or for trying to deceive an auditor) may be similarly counterproductive. Contrary to conventional wisdom, squeezing a supplier’s margin (by reducing the price paid to the supplier or increasing wages for workers) motivates the supplier to exert greater care to prevent harm—under the backfiring condition. Whereas the necessary and sufficient condition depends on the relative convexity of the supplier’s hiding cost function, a simple sufficient condition is that the supplier is likely to successfully hide information from the auditor, in equilibrium. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the backfiring condition is prevalent or becoming increasingly so. Similar insights apply to mitigation of unauthorized subcontracting.

Title: Optimal Vascular Access Choice for Patients on Hemodialysis
Abstract: Which vascular access to use is considered one of the most important questions in the care of patients on hemodialysis (HD). An arteriovenous fistula (AVF) is often considered the gold standard for delivering HD due to better patient survival, higher quality of life, and fewer complications. However, AVFs have some limitations: they require surgery, it takes approximately three months to know whether the surgery was successful, and a majority of these surgeries end in failure. Conversely, another common vascular access, the central venous catheter, can be inserted via a simple procedure and used immediately after placement. In this research, we address the question of whether and when to perform AVF surgery on incident and established HD patients, with the aim of finding individualized policies that maximize a patient’s probability of survival and remaining quality-adjusted life expectancy. Using a continuous-time dynamic programming model and under certain data-driven assumptions, we establish structural properties of the optimal policy for each objective. We provide further insights for policy makers through our numerical experiments.

Title: The Limits of Planned Obsolescence for Conspicuous Durable Goods
Abstract: An extensive body of literature argues for the benefits of planned obsolescence, the strategy of designing products with low durability to induce repeat purchases from the consumers and allow the firm to sell a larger volume. Yet, several firms avoid planned obsolescence and instead offer products with high durability. In this paper, we offer a demand-side rationale for a high-durability product design strategy: the exclusivity-seeking consumer behavior associated with conspicuous consumption. In the presence of consumers who value exclusivity, we find that firms benefit from designing products with higher durability in conjunction with a high-price, low-volume introduction strategy. A higher durability in such a context leads to greater resale value, allowing the firm to charge a higher price and lower the sales volume to achieve the product exclusivity valued by the consumers. This contrasts with the planned obsolescence strategy that capitalizes on the high sales volume achieved by setting a low new product price. We also show that offering higher durability and charging a higher price are complementary levers to respond to consumers who value exclusivity. Our analysis unearths insights regarding the effect of exclusivity-seeking behavior on a firm’s demand and pricing. We show that firms’ durability choice may explain the joint increase in price and demand for conspicuous goods.

Title: The Vehicle Mix Decision in Emergency Medical Service Systems
Abstract: We consider the problem of selecting the number of advanced life support (ALS) and basic life support (BLS) ambulances—the <i>vehicle mix</i>—to deploy in an emergency medical service (EMS) system, given a budget constraint. ALS ambulances can treat a wider range of emergencies, whereas BLS ambulances are less expensive to operate. To this end, we develop a framework under which the performance of a system operating under a given vehicle mix can be evaluated. Because the choice of vehicle mix affects how ambulances are dispatched to incoming calls, as well as how they are deployed to base locations, we adopt an optimization-based approach. We construct two models—one a Markov decision process, the other an integer program—to study the problems of dispatching and deployment in a tiered system, respectively. In each case, the objective function value attained by an optimal decision serves as our performance measure. Numerical experiments performed with both models suggest that, under reasonable choices of inputs, a wide range of tiered systems perform comparably to all-ALS fleets.

Title: A Modeling Framework for Control of Preventive Services
Abstract: We present a modeling framework for facilities that provide both screening (preventive) and diagnostic (repair) services. The facility operates in a random environment that represents the condition of the population that needs screening and diagnostic services, such as the disease prevalence level. We model the environment as a partially endogenous process: the population’s health can be improved by providing screening services, which reduces future demand for diagnostic services. We use event-based dynamic programming to build a framework for modeling different kinds of these facilities. This framework contains a number of service priority policies that are concerned with prioritizing screening versus diagnostic services. The main trade-off is between serving urgent diagnostic needs and providing screening services that may decrease future diagnostic needs. Under certain conditions, this trade-off reverses the famous <i>cμ</i> rule; i.e., the patients with lower waiting cost are given priority over the others. We define appropriate event operators and specify the properties preserved by these operators. These characterize the structure of optimal policies for all models that can be built within this framework. A numerical study on colonoscopy services illustrates how the framework can be used to gain insights on developing good screening policies.

Title: A Scenario-Based Approach for Operating Theater Scheduling Under Uncertainty
Abstract: Elective operation scheduling significantly affects the financial health of a hospital and additional metrics important to stakeholders in an operating theater (OT) environment. In this research, we develop a novel scheduling formulation that explicitly considers the uncertainty in elective operation durations and also plans for potential randomly arriving urgent demands. Using a scenario-based modeling approach, the objective of this formulation is to maximize the expected profit associated with the OT schedule. Since the complexity of the problem is NP-hard, we develop a two-step, heuristic solution approach that allows us to solve practical-sized instances in reasonable time. Experimentation shows that incorporating uncertainty via scenarios increases profit and OT utilization when compared to deterministic scheduling methods. Moreover, explicitly considering urgent arrivals results in a significant reduction in the time that patients of this type wait to receive service, with little impact on other key metrics.

Title: Coil Batching to Improve Productivity and Energy Utilization in Steel Production
Abstract: This paper investigates a practical batching decision problem that arises in the batch annealing operations in the cold rolling stage of steel production faced by most large iron and steel companies in the world. The problem is to select steel coils from a set of waiting coils to form batches to be annealed in available batch annealing furnaces and choose a median coil for each furnace. The objective is to maximize the total reward of the selected coils less the total coil–coil and coil–furnace mismatching cost. For a special case of the problem that arises frequently in practical settings where the coils are all similar and there is only one type of furnace available, we develop a polynomial-time dynamic programming algorithm to obtain an optimal solution. For the general case of the problem, which is strongly NP-hard, an exact branch-and-price-and-cut solution algorithm is developed using a column and row generation framework. A variable reduction strategy is also proposed to accelerate the algorithm. The algorithm is capable of solving medium-size instances to optimality within a reasonable computation time. In addition, a tabu search heuristic is proposed for solving larger instances. Three simple search neighborhoods, as well as a sophisticated variable-depth neighborhood, are developed. This heuristic can generate near-optimal solutions for large instances within a short computation time. Using both randomly generated and real-world production data sets, we show that our algorithms are superior to the typical rule-based planning approach used by many steel plants. A decision support system that embeds our algorithms was developed and implemented at Baosteel to replace their rule-based planning method. The use of the system brings significant benefits to Baosteel, including an annual net profit increase of at least 1.76 million U.S. dollars and a large reduction of standard coal consumption and carbon dioxide emissions.

Title: Quality in Supply Chain Encroachment
Abstract: We study a supply chain with manufacturer encroachment in which product quality is endogenous and customers have heterogeneous preferences for quality. It is known that, when quality is exogenous, encroachment could make the retailer better off. Yet, when quality is endogenous and the manufacturer has enough flexibility in adjusting quality, we find that encroachment always makes the retailer worse off in a large variety of scenarios. We also establish that, while a higher manufacturer’s cost of quality hurts the retailer in absence of encroachment, it could benefit the retailer with encroachment. In addition, we show that a manufacturer offering differentiated products through two channels prefers to sell its high-quality product through the direct channel. Contrary to conventional wisdom, quality differentiation does not always benefit either manufacturer or retailer. Our results may explain why, despite extant theoretical predictions, retailers almost always resent encroachment. These findings also suggest that firms must be cautious when adopting quality differentiation as a strategy to ease channel conflict caused by encroachment.

Title: OM Forum—Supply Chain Contracting: Doughnuts to Bubbles
Abstract: This paper discusses the origins of the supply chain contracting literature as well as its current state. It argues that its origins go back further than many scholars realize. It also makes the case that the field expanded rapidly, creating a bubble that has largely burst. However, there have been lasting implications that affect both how we teach supply chain management and the kind of research that is done under the heading of operations management.

Title: Optimal Time Allocation for Process Improvement for Growth-Focused Entrepreneurs
Abstract: For many entrepreneurs, time is a key constraint. They need to invest time to achieve growth, but also lose time because of recurring crises. We develop a simple stochastic dynamic program to model how an entrepreneur should prioritize between improving processes to reduce crises versus harvesting revenue or ensuring future growth. We show that it is initially optimal to prioritize process improvement: an entrepreneur should strive for high process quality early in the venture’s growth process. We numerically analyze a simple heuristic derived from this optimal policy and identify the conditions under which it is (or is not) effective. It performs near optimally except when process quality or revenue rate may deteriorate too fast or when the cost of process improvement or revenue enhancement is too high. Our work provides a theoretical foundation for the advice found in the popular entrepreneurship and time management literature to invest time now to save time later.

Title: Counteracting Strategic Purchase Deferrals: The Impact of Online Retailers’ Return Policy Decisions
Abstract: Online shoppers value lenient return policies as they are unable to assess whether products match their expectations. We study how consumers’ discount-seeking purchase deferrals affect online retailers’ return policy choices. Lenient returns may induce higher full-price sales by limiting consumer regret, while signaling clearance unavailability risk. Contrasting earlier research that concluded a monopolist must set the refund at the clearance price when strategic consumers were overlooked, we find that an optimal refund bounded by the clearance price can mitigate purchase deferrals only when a monopolist salvages at mild discounts. To explore conditions under which a monopolist permits “full-refund returns,” we consider three scenarios: we permit clearing inventory without a loss; we assume lenient returns stimulate aggregate demand; we consider consumers’ transaction costs. We also derive a unique rational expectations equilibrium for competing retailers, wherein each retailer’s equilibrium refund is nondecreasing in its clearance price. Furthermore, retailers with clearance prices below a threshold should not allow returns, and those who do, higher clearance revenues imply higher full prices, higher quantities, and higher profits. We conclude that a credible clearance partner salvaging at higher prices than those at competing clearance mediums helps retailers gain competitive advantage when selling to strategic consumers.

Title: Do High and Low Inventory Turnover Retailers Respond Differently to Demand Shocks?
Abstract: This paper examines the differences in the behaviors of high (HIT) and low inventory turnover (LIT) retailers in responding to demand shocks. We identify quantity and price responsiveness as two mediating mechanisms that distinguish how high and low inventory turnover retailers manage demand shocks. Using quarterly firm-level data of 183 U.S. retailers between 1985 and 2012, we find that HIT retailers are able to respond quickly by changing their purchase quantities in response to demand shocks, whereas LIT retailers primarily rely on price changes to manage demand shocks. In addition, we examine the differential implications of these mechanisms on the financial performance of HIT and LIT retailers. We find price responsiveness to be a less effective strategy, compared to quantity responsiveness, in reducing excesses and shortages of inventory. Finally, the negative financial impact of a given amount of excess and shortage of inventory is eight times more severe for LIT retailers compared to HIT retailers.

Title: Allocating Emissions Among Co-Products: Implications for Procurement and Climate Policy
Abstract: Co-production (simultaneous production of multiple outputs) occurs in some emission-intensive basic material and agricultural industries. This paper is motivated by ones in which a supplier sells its primary product to a buyer that incurs an emissions cost (voluntarily, or due to government-imposed climate policy) and sells co-products into markets without emissions costs. Emission-accounting standards provide three candidate rules for allocating the supplier’s emissions among its products. This paper shows that under the value-based allocation, imposing an emissions tax on the primary product can increase emissions, by motivating the supplier to lower the price and sell a larger quantity. In contrast, with the socially optimal choice of allocation rule characterized in this paper, imposing the emissions tax on the primary product can greatly reduce emissions and increase welfare. In the absence of climate policy, under value-based allocation, a buyer might achieve greater profit by paying to offset its supply chain emissions. That can motivate supplier innovation to reduce its production cost. In numerical examples, considering the rare earth cerium oxide (co-produced with iron) and palm oil (co-produced with palm meal), the choice of allocation rule has a large impact on emissions, a buyer’s profit, and social welfare.

Title: Using Future Information to Reduce Waiting Times in the Emergency Department via Diversion
Abstract: The development of predictive models in healthcare settings has been growing; one such area is the prediction of patient arrivals to the emergency department (ED). The general premise behind these works is that such models may be used to help manage an ED that consistently faces high congestion. In this work, we propose a class of <i>proactive</i> policies that utilize future information of potential patient arrivals to effectively manage admissions into an ED while reducing waiting times for patients who are eventually treated. Instead of the standard strategy of waiting for queues to build before diverting patients, the proposed policy utilizes the predictions to identify when congestion is going to increase and proactively diverts patients before things get “too bad.” We demonstrate that the proposed policy provides delay improvements over standard policies used in practice. We also consider the impact of errors in the information provided by the predictive models and find that even with noisy predictions, our proposed policies can still outperform (achieving shorter delays while serving the same number of patients) standard diversion policies. If the quality of the predictive model is insufficient, then it is better to ignore the future information and simply rely on real-time, current information for the basis of decision making. Using simulation, we find that our proposed policy can reduce delays by up to 15%.

Title: Contracting for On-Time Delivery in the U.S. Influenza Vaccine Supply Chain
Abstract: Although influenza vaccine shortage is often attributed to low supply, it has been observed that even with abundant supply, a major shortage can still occur because of late delivery. In this paper, motivated by the influenza vaccine industry, we study a supply chain contracting problem in the presence of uncertainties surrounding design, delivery, and demand of the influenza vaccine. In this supply chain, a manufacturer has insufficient incentive to initiate at-risk early production prior to the design freeze because it is a retailer who reaps the most benefits from selling more vaccines delivered on time. Anticipating that late delivery will lead to potential loss in demand, the retailer tends to reduce the order size, which further discourages the manufacturer from making an effort to improve its delivery performance. To break this negative feedback loop, a supply contract needs to achieve two objectives: incentivize at-risk early production and eliminate double marginalization. We find that two commonly observed supply contracts in practice, the delivery-time-dependent quantity flexibility (D-QF) contract and the late-rebate (LR) contract, may fail to coordinate the supply chain because of the tension between these two objectives. To resolve such a tension, we construct a buyback-and-late-rebate (BLR) contract and show that a properly designed BLR contract can not only coordinate the supply chain but also can provide full flexibility of profit division between members of the supply chain. Numerical experiments further demonstrate that the BLR contract significantly improves supply chain efficiency compared to the contracts used in the industry.

Title: Incentive-Driven Information Dissemination in Two-Tier Supply Chains
Abstract: We investigate information flow in two-tier supply chains, where retailers order from suppliers and sell in a market with uncertain demand. The retailers each have access to a demand signal and can exchange signals (horizontal information sharing). The suppliers can offer the retailers differential payments to gain access to their signals (vertical information acquisition). We demonstrate that retailer competition is a necessary condition to sustain information flow, whereas supplier competition precludes vertical information acquisition. Facing horizontal competition, the retailers can have an incentive to exchange signals if competition is less intense; and this incentive is stronger when they order from independent suppliers than when they order from a monopolist supplier. In the setting where two retailers order from a monopolist supplier, once the retailers exchange signals, the supplier will acquire signals from them both; otherwise, it will have an incentive to acquire signals if the signals are sufficiently correlated. It can be incentive compatible for horizontal information sharing and vertical information acquisition to coexist so that the retailers’ signals are available to all parties. Under this circumstance, the supplier will profit from information flow and the retailers can earn profit gains as well, whereas the consumers will be worse off.

Title: Managing Rentals with Usage-Based Loss
Abstract: Motivated by innovative rental business models, we study a rental system with random loss of inventory due to use. We utilize a discrete-time model in which the inventory level is chosen before the start of a finite rental season, and customers not immediately served are lost. Demand, rental durations, and rental unit lifetimes are stochastic; sample path coupling allows us to derive structural results that hold under limited distributional assumptions. Considering different “recirculation” rules (i.e., which unit to select to meet a demand), we prove the concavity of the expected profit function and identify the optimal recirculation rule under two different models of a rental unit’s state: the number of times rented out or its condition. We develop two upper bounds on the number of lost rental units and two heuristics for the inventory decision. Numerical study shows the following: (1) accounting for rental unit loss can increase the expected profit by 7% for a single season; (2) the optimal inventory level in response to increasing loss probability is nonmonotonic; (3) both heuristics perform well; and (4) choosing the optimal recirculation rule over a commonly used policy can increase the profit-maximizing service level by up to six percentage points.

Title: Strategic Safety-Stock Placement in Supply Chains with Capacity Constraints
Abstract: We generalize the guaranteed-service (GS) model for safety-stock placement in supply chains to include capacity constraints. We first examine the guaranteed-service model for a capacitated single-stage system with bounded demand. We characterize the optimal inventory policy, which depends on the entire demand history. Due to this complexity, we develop a heuristic, namely a constant base-stock policy with censored ordering. This is an order-up-to policy but with its replenishment orders censored by the capacity constraint. We refer to this heuristic as the modified constant base-stock policy (MCBS). We use a numerical experiment to compare the performance of the heuristic policy to the optimal policy. We find that the performance of the heuristic relative to the optimal policy improves with a tighter capacity constraint. We also observe that the performance of the heuristic itself can sometimes be improved by tightening the capacity constraint. We then use the results for a single-stage system to model a multistage serial system that operates with a constant base-stock policy with censored ordering, i.e., an MCBS policy. We show how to adapt the existing dynamic programming algorithm for the unconstrained case to solve for the safety-stock locations and base-stock levels in a capacitated serial system. We describe how to extend this model to other supply chain topologies. We report on numerical tests for serial systems and find that the best MCBS policy in a capacitated system can outperform the best constant base-stock policy in an identical but uncapacitated system.

Title: Improving Store Liquidation
Abstract: Store liquidation is the time-constrained divestment of retail outlets through an in-store sale of inventory. The retail industry depends extensively on store liquidation, both to allow managers of going concerns to divest stores in efforts to enhance performance and as a means for investors to recover capital from failed ventures. Retailers sell billions of dollars of inventory annually during store liquidations. This paper introduces the store liquidation problem to the literature and presents a technique for optimizing key store liquidation decisions, including markdowns, inventory transfers, and the timing of store closings. We propose a heuristic for solving the store liquidation problem and evaluate the performance of this method. Through applications, we show that our approach could improve net recovery on cost (i.e., the profit obtained during a liquidation stated as a percentage of the cost value of liquidated inventory) by two to five percentage points in the cases we examined. Further, we discuss ways in which current practice in store liquidation differs from the decisions identified by our method, and we trace the consequences of these differences.

Title: Proactive Customer Education, Customer Retention, and Demand for Technology Support: Evidence from a Field Experiment
Abstract: Do service provider efforts to educate customers influence customer outcomes? We analyze the outcome of a field experiment executed by a major public cloud infrastructure services provider in 2011. Out of 2,673 customers who adopted the service during the experiment, 366 received a service intervention: an engagement through which the provider offered initial guidance on how to use basic features of the service. Before execution, it was unclear if this proactive customer education would have positive or negative effects on customer retention and demand for technology support. We show the treatment reduces by half the number of customers who churn from the service during the first week. Further, treated customers ask 19.55% fewer questions during the first week of their tenure than the controls. Although the treatment’s effects decay within one week, we show that such proactive customer education can have significant economic benefits for the provider. In particular, we find that treated customers increase their accumulated usage of the service by 46.57% in the eight months after sign-up. Finally, we provide evidence that the effects of the treatment are strongest among customers who have less experience with the provider.

Title: Optimization in Online Content Recommendation Services: Beyond Click-Through Rates
Abstract: A new class of online services allows Internet media sites to direct users from articles they are currently reading to other content they may be interested in. This process creates a “browsing path” along which there is potential for repeated interaction between the user and the provider, giving rise to a dynamic optimization problem. A key metric that often underlies this recommendation process is the click-through rate (CTR) of candidate articles. Whereas CTR is a measure of instantaneous click likelihood, we analyze the performance improvement that one may achieve by some lookahead that accounts for the potential future path of users. To that end, by using some data of user path history at major media sites, we introduce and derive a representation of content along two key dimensions: clickability, the likelihood to click to an article when it is recommended; and engageability, the likelihood to click from an article when it hosts a recommendation. We then propose a class of heuristics that leverage both clickability and engageability, and provide theoretical support for favoring such path-focused heuristics over myopic heuristics that focus only on clickability (no lookahead). We conduct a live pilot experiment that measures the performance of a practical proxy of our proposed class, when integrated into the operating system of a worldwide leading provider of content recommendations, allowing us to estimate the aggregate improvement in clicks per visit relative to the CTR-driven current practice. The documented improvement highlights the importance and the practicality of efficiently incorporating the future path of users in real time.

Title: Stockout-Based Substitution and Inventory Planning in Textbook Retailing
Abstract: We demonstrate the value of utility-based choice models to estimate demand and plan inventory for new and used textbooks in the presence of consumer choice and stockout-based substitution at a university textbook retailer. Demand information is censored, the exact time of stockout is not observed, and the short selling season often does not allow for replenishment. Using data for 26,749 book titles from 2007 to 2011 and a simulation experiment calibrated on real data, we show that an attribute-based choice model generates accurate demand estimates (mean absolute percentage error less than 1%) even when nearly 90% of the textbooks in the fit sample experience stockout. This performance is driven by the heterogeneity of product attributes and is robust to the occurrence of product returns. We implement this model at the bookstore in a controlled field experiment and obtain over 10% increase in profit. The results show that accounting for asymmetric and stockout-based substitution in demand estimation and inventory planning enables us to make systematic corrections in inventory mix and inventory level compared to the existing process.

Title: Accurate Emergency Department Wait Time Prediction
Abstract: This paper proposes the Q-Lasso method for wait time prediction, which combines statistical learning with fluid model estimators. In historical data from four remarkably different hospitals, Q-Lasso predicts the emergency department (ED) wait time for low-acuity patients with greater accuracy than rolling average methods (currently used by hospitals), fluid model estimators (from the service operations management literature), and quantile regression methods (from the emergency medicine literature). Q-Lasso achieves greater accuracy largely by correcting errors of underestimation in which a patient waits for longer than predicted. Implemented on the external website and in the triage room of the San Mateo Medical Center (SMMC), Q-Lasso achieves over 30% lower mean squared prediction error than would occur with the best rolling average method. The paper describes challenges and insights from the implementation at SMMC.

Title: Analytics for an Online Retailer: Demand Forecasting and Price Optimization
Abstract: We present our work with an online retailer, Rue La La, as an example of how a retailer can use its wealth of data to optimize pricing decisions on a daily basis. Rue La La is in the online fashion sample sales industry, where they offer extremely limited-time discounts on designer apparel and accessories. One of the retailer’s main challenges is pricing and predicting demand for products that it has never sold before, which account for the majority of sales and revenue. To tackle this challenge, we use machine learning techniques to estimate historical lost sales and predict future demand of new products. The nonparametric structure of our demand prediction model, along with the dependence of a product’s demand on the price of competing products, pose new challenges on translating the demand forecasts into a pricing policy. We develop an algorithm to efficiently solve the subsequent multiproduct price optimization that incorporates reference price effects, and we create and implement this algorithm into a pricing decision support tool for Rue La La’s daily use. We conduct a field experiment and find that sales does not decrease because of implementing tool recommended price increases for medium and high price point products. Finally, we estimate an increase in revenue of the test group by approximately 9.7% with an associated 90% confidence interval of [2.3%, 17.8%].

Title: Pricing Personalized Bundles: A New Approach and An Empirical Study
Abstract: This paper studies the pricing strategies for personalized product bundles. In such problems, a seller provides a variety of products for which customers can construct a personalized bundle and send a request for quote (RFQ) to the seller. The seller, after reviewing the RFQ, has to determine a price based on which the customer either purchases the whole bundle or nothing. Such problems are faced by many companies in practice, and they are very difficult because of the potential unlimited possible configurations of the bundle and the correlations among the individual products. In this paper, we propose a novel top-down and bottom-up approach to solve this problem. In the top-down step, we decompose the bundle into each component and calibrate a value score for each component. In the bottom-up step, we aggregate the components back to the bundle, define important features of the bundle, and segment different RFQs by those bundle features as well as customer attributes. Then we estimate a utility function for each segment based on historical sales data and derive an optimal price for each incoming RFQ. We show that such a model overcomes the aforementioned difficulties and can be implemented efficiently. We test our approach using empirical data from a major information technology service provider and the test result shows that the proposed approach can improve the effectiveness of pricing significantly.

Title: Optimization and Simulation of Orthopedic Spine Surgery Cases at Mayo Clinic
Abstract: Spine surgeries tend to be lengthy (mean time of 4 hours) and highly variable (with some surgeries lasting 18 hours or more). This variability along with patient preferences driving scheduling decisions resulted in both low operating room (OR) utilization and significant overtime for surgical teams at Mayo Clinic. In this paper we discuss the development of an improved scheduling approach for spine surgeries over a rolling planning horizon. First, data mining and statistical analysis was performed using a large data set to identify categories of surgeries that could be grouped together based on surgical time distributions and could be categorized at the time of case scheduling. These surgical categories are then used in a hierarchical optimization approach with the objective of maximizing a weighted combination of OR utilization and net profit. The optimization model is explored to consider trade-offs and relationships among utilization levels, financial performance, overtime allowance, and case mix. The new scheduling approach was implemented via a custom Web-based application that allowed the surgeons and schedulers to interactively identify best surgical days with patients. A pilot implementation resulted in a utilization increase of 19% and a reduction in overtime by 10%.

Title: Setting Planned Leadtimes in Customer-Order-Driven Assembly Systems
Abstract: We study an assembly system with a number of parallel multistage processes feeding a multistage final assembly process. Each stage has a stochastic throughput time. We assume that the system is controlled by planned leadtimes at each stage. From these planned leadtimes the start and due times of all stages can be derived. If a job finishes at a particular stage and has to wait before the start of the next job(s), a holding cost proportional to the waiting time is incurred. A penalty cost proportional to the lateness is incurred when the last stage of the final assembly process finishes after its due time. The objective is to determine planned leadtimes for each individual stage, such that the expected cost of a customer order is minimized.We derive the recursive equations for the tardiness and earliness at all stages and an exact expression for the expected cost. We discuss the similarity between these expressions and those for serial inventory systems. Based on this observation and a conjecture related to the generalized Newsvendor equations, we develop an iterative heuristic procedure. Comparison with a numerical optimization method confirms the accuracy of the heuristic. Finally, we discuss an application of the model to a real-life case, showing the added value of a system-wide optimization of planned leadtimes compared to current practice.

Title: OM Forum—Practice-Based Research in Operations Management: What It Is, Why Do It, Related Challenges, and How to Overcome Them
Abstract: Practice-based research—research performed with the intent of improving the operation of a collaborating practitioner—is an important endeavor for our field: such work may reveal new problems, interesting phenomena, and may also generate data, educational material, and solutions to important practical problems. We argue that the practical relevance of any operations management (OM) research is driven by the two dimensions of generalizability and validity, which together offer a framework for contrasting the potential strengths and weaknesses of theory-based and practice-based research. We review challenges and strategies for successfully engaging in practice-based research, including: choosing a good problem; establishing and managing a relationship with a practitioner; validation; and impact estimation. Finally, we discuss possible ways to encourage more practice-based research in OM. In particular, we argue that our field should, in general, put more emphasis on research validity.
