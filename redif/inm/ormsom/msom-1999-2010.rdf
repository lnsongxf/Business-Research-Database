Title: Industry Clockspeed: Measurement and Operational Implications
Abstract: We argue that industries and industry segments are characterized by a clockspeed that gauges the velocity of change in the external business environment and sets the pace of their firms' internal operations. Using data from the electronics industry, we develop and validate an integrated metric for clockspeed that takes into account both demand- and supply-side factors. We show that after controlling for product complexity and other factors, higher industry clockspeed is associated with faster execution in product development and manufacturing (e.g., shorter development time, quicker stabilization of production) and more frequent changes in organizational structure. Our findings on the effects of clockspeed can help researchers studying other industries, and our results provide benchmarks against which practitioners can compare and classify their own organizations.

Title: Allocating Fibers in Cable Manufacturing
Abstract: We study the problem of allocating stocked fibers to made-to-order cables with the goals of satisfying due dates and reducing the costs of scrap, setup, and fiber circulation. These goals are achieved by generating remnant fibers either long enough to satisfy future orders or short enough to scrap with little waste. They are also achieved by manufacturing concatenations, in which multiple cable orders are satisfied by the production of a single cable that is afterwards cut into the constituent cables ordered. We use a function that values fibers according to length, and which can be viewed as an approximation to the optimal value function of an underlying dynamic programming problem. The daily policy that arises under this approximation is an integer program with a simple linear objective function that uses changes in fiber value to take into account the multi-period consequences of decisions. We describe our successful implementation of this integer program in the factory, summarizing our computational experience as well as realized operational improvements.

Title: Improving Quality via Matching: A Case Study Integrating Supplier and Manufacturer Quality Performance
Abstract: The relentless pursuit of increased product quality via continuous improvement is an important long-term strategy for achieving competitive advantage. However, manufacturers must still achieve high product quality in the short run. Hence, short-run quality improvement strategies are necessary, and, if possible, should complement (rather than substitute for) a longer run continuous improvement strategy with suppliers. We propose a novel short-run quality improvement strategy with suppliers which is based on a combinatorial optimization model for determining the optimal matching of raw material batches (from suppliers) with process variable parameters (of the manufacturer) by exploiting their interaction effects. Although the model can be difficult to solve, we develop sufficient conditions for a special case where the attainment of an optimal solution is straightforward. We demonstrate the use of the proposed approach in an actual pharmaceutical process. Using data from the pharmaceutical case, we develop several simulation scenarios where matching is shown (predicted) to greatly improve process yield. We also discuss the use of matching to illuminate various strategies for long-term continuous improvement of supplier and manufacturer processes in general.

Title: A Single-Item Inventory Model for a Nonstationary Demand Process
Abstract: In this paper, we consider an adaptive base-stock policy for a single-item inventory system, where the demand process is nonstationary. In particular, the demand process is an integrated moving average process of order (0, 1, 1), for which an exponential-weighted moving average provides the optimal forecast. For the assumed control policy we characterize the inventory random variable and use this to find the safety stock requirements for the system. From this characterization, we see that the required inventory, both in absolute terms and as it depends on the replenishment lead-time, behaves much differently for this case of nonstationary demand compared with stationary demand. We then show how the single-item model extends to a multi-stage, or supply-chain context; in particular we see that the demand process for the upstream stage is not only nonstationary but also more variable than that for the downstream stage. We also show that for this model there is no value from letting the upstream stages see the exogenous demand. The paper concludes with some observations about the practical implications of this work.

Title: Fill-Rate Bottlenecks in Production-Inventory Networks
Abstract: The bottleneck in a production-inventory network is commonly taken to be the facility that most limits flow through the network and thus the most highly utilized facility. A further connotation of "bottleneck," however, is the facility that most constrains system-wide performance or the facility at which additional resources would have the greatest impact. Adopting this broader sense of the term, we look for fill-rate bottlenecks: facilities in a production-inventory network that most constrain the system-wide fill rate (the proportion of demands filled within a fixed delivery leadtime) or facilities at which either additional production capacity or additional inventory would have the greatest impact on the fill rate. We consider systems in which various components are produced through a series of stages holding intermediate inventories and are then assembled into finished goods to meet external demands. With each station in the network we associate precise measures of the station's propensity to constrain the fill rate. We call a station with a minimal measure a fill-rate bottleneck and justify this label both theoretically and numerically. Examples show that even the least utilized facility can be a fill-rate bottleneck. Unlike utilization, our bottleneck criteria capture information about process variability.

Title: Stock Positioning and Performance Estimation in Serial Production-Transportation Systems
Abstract: This paper considers serial production-transportation systems. In recent years, researchers have developed a fairly simple functional equation that characterizes optimal system behavior, under the assumption of constant leadtimes. We show that the equation covers a variety of stochastic-leadtime systems as well. Still, many basic managerial issues remain obscure: When should stock be held at upstream stages? Which system attributes drive overall performance, and how? To address these questions, we develop and analyze several heuristic methods, inspired by observation of common practice and numerical experiments. One of these heuristics yields a bound on the optimal average cost. We also study a set of numerical examples, to gain insight into the nature of the optimal solution and to evaluate the heuristics.

Title: Quantity Flexibility Contracts and Supply Chain Performance
Abstract: The Quantity Flexibility (QF) contract is a method for coordinating materials and information flows in supply chains operating under rolling-horizon planning. It stipulates a maximum percentage revision each element of the period-by-period replenishment schedule is allowed per planning iteration. The supplier is obligated to cover any requests that remain within the upside limits. The bounds on reductions are a form of minimum purchase commitment which discourages the customer from overstating its needs. While QF contracts are being implemented in industrial practice, the academic literature has thus far had little guidance to offer a firm interested in structuring its supply relationships in this way. This paper seeks to address this need, by developing rigorous conclusions about the behavioral consequences of QF contracts, and hence about the implications for the performance and design of supply chains with linkages possessing this structure. Issues explored include the impact of system flexibility on inventory characteristics and the patterns by which forecast and order variability propagate along the supply chain. The ultimate goal is to provide insights as to where to position flexibility for the greatest benefit, and how much to pay for it.

Title: Worker Cross-Training in Paced Assembly Lines
Abstract: Paced or Synchronous assembly lines are a popular class of assembly systems consisting of a series of assembly stations arranged in tandem. Every job (or order) visits all assembly stations in the same sequence and spends the same amount of time (known as the production cycle) at each station. Industries such as aircraft, fire-engine, and automobile assembly have production cycles of a few hours and are labor intensive. In spite of increased automation in such industries, human capital remains the most expensive and important contributor to a flexible production system. In this article we formulate the cross-training problem on a paced assembly line with m stations (mCT). We assume that each worker possesses a number of skills referred to as a skill vector. Our objective is to schedule a set of work orders through the assembly system so as to minimize the size of the required workforce and/or the workforce cross-training costs. We analyze the complexity of mCT and identify polynomially solvable cases. A variety of lower bounds is developed based on optimization techniques. These lower bounds are used to develop a branch and bound algorithm as well as to evaluate our heuristics. A computational experiment reports the performance of all algorithms. Using these algorithms, we examine how the formation of skill vectors affects the workforce size and draw guidelines for cross-training programs in organizations with labor intensive assembly operations.

Title: A Model-Based Approach for Planning and Developing a Family of Technology-Based Products
Abstract: In this paper, we address the product-family design problem of a firm in a market in which customers choose products based on some measure of product performance. By developing products as a family, the firm can reduce the cost of developing individual product variants due to the reuse of a common product platform. Such a platform, designed in an aggregate-planning phase that precedes the development of individual product variants, is itself expensive to develop. Hence, its costs must be weighted against the benefits of its reuse in a family. We offer a model for capturing costs of product development when the family consists of variants based on a common platform. It is shown that the model can be converted into a network-optimization problem, and the optimal product-family can be identified under fairly general conditions by determining the shortest path of its network formulation. We also analytically examine the effect of alternative product designs on product-family composition, and discuss the implications of investing in new-product technology. Finally, we illustrate our model and managerial insights with an application from the electronics industry.

Title: Managing a Customer Following a Target Reverting Policy
Abstract: We consider a stochastic, capacitated production-inventory model in which the customer provides information about the expected timing of future orders to the supplier. We allow for randomness in customer order arrivals as well as the quantity demanded, but work under the assumption that the customer is making every effort to follow the schedule provided. We term this as a target reverting policy. This gives rise to an interesting nonstationary inventory control model at the supplier. After characterizing the optimal policy, we develop solution procedures to compute the optimal parameters. An extensive computational study provides insights into the behavior of this model at optimality. Further, comparing the cost of the optimal policy to the cost of simple policies that either ignore the customer's information or the capacity constraint, we are able to provide insights as to when these simplifications could be costly.

Title: Addendum to "A Single-Item Inventory Model for a Nonstationary Demand Process"
Abstract: In preparing a review I recently discovered an important reference for a key result in Graves (1999). Wecker (1979) had previously derived the variance for demand over a deterministic lead-time for an IMA (0, 1, 1) demand process. I develop effectively the same result, given as Equation (8) in Graves (1999). I state this as the variance of the inventory random variable for an inventory system that is subject to an IMA (0, 1, 1) demand process, a deterministic replenishment lead-time and an adaptive base-stock control policy given by (7). But given these assumptions, the variance of the inventory is the same as the variance of the demand over the lead-time. Although the Wecker manuscript has not been published, Eppen and Martin (1988) reference it and use the key result as part of their research.

Title: Sustaining Technology Leadership Can Require Both Cost Competence and Innovative Competence
Abstract: Some firms, particularly in high-tech, appear to view technology leadership and cost leadership as separate and distinct ways of achieving high profits within a given product market. In contrast, we develop a model of technology competition suggesting that a firm's success in sustaining its technology leadership may hinge on its ability to produce the new product (resulting from the new technology) at lower cost, an ability we call the firm's "cost competence." In our model, cost competence, above a critical hurdle level, is essential to the incumbent firm in its bid to retain technology leadership. The model also clarifies the role of "innovative competence," which characterizes a firm's ability to turn an investment in new technology into a marketable product. We present an example of a standard product market model (for determining prices and production quantities for two competing products in the aftermath of the technology competition) in which the assumptions of our technology competition model hold. An additional key finding is that there can be discontinuities in the returns that accrue from enhanced cost competence. If a firm is on the right side of a "jump point," its expected profits can be dramatically more than if it were only slightly less competent. These jump points arise where the firm's cost competence becomes sufficient to cause a competitor to decide against competing in the new technology, or to significantly drop its investment amount. When a potential competitor backs down, the prospect of high returns for the incumbent opens up.

Title: Option Methods for Incorporating Risk into Linear Capacity Planning Models
Abstract: Manufacturing and service operations decisions depend critically on capacity and resource limits. These limits directly affect the risk inherent in those decisions. While risk consideration is well developed in finance through efficient market theory and the capital asset pricing model, operations management models do not generally adopt these principles. One reason for this apparent inconsistency may be that analysis of an operational model does not reveal the level of risk until the model is solved. Using results from option pricing theory, we show that this inconsistency can be avoided in a wide range of planning models. By assuming the availability of market hedges, we show that risk can be incorporated into planning models by adjusting capacity and resource levels. The result resolves some possible inconsistencies between finance and operations and provides a financial basis for many planning problems. We illustrate the proposed approach using a capacity-planning example.

Title: The Efficiency-Quality Trade-Off of Cross-Trained Workers
Abstract: Does cross-training workers allow a firm to achieve economies of scale when there is variability in the content of work, or does it create a workforce that performs many tasks with consistent mediocrity? To address this question we integrate a model of a stochastic service system with models for tenure- and experience-based service quality. When examined in isolation, the service system model confirms a well-known "rule of thumb" from the queueing literature: Flexible or cross-trained servers provide more throughput with fewer workers than specialized servers. However, in the integrated model these economies of scale are tempered by a loss in quality. Given multiple tasks, flexible workers may not gain sufficient experience to provide high-quality service to any one customer, and what is gained in efficiency is lost in quality. Through a series of numerical experiments we find that low utilization in an all-specialist system can also reduce quality, and therefore the optimal staff mix combines flexible and specialized workers. We also investigate when the performance of the system is sensitive to the staffing configuration choice. For small systems with high learning rates, the optimal staff mix provides significant benefits over either extreme case (a completely specialized or completely flexible workforce). If the system is small and the rate of learning is slow, flexible servers are preferred. For large systems with high learning rates, the model leans toward specialized servers. In a final set of experiments, the model analyzes the design options for an actual call center.

Title: Management of Worksharing Systems
Abstract: Worksharing occurs in serial manufacturing when machines are not uniquely assigned to workers. For example, two workers can operate three machines by alternating usage of the middle one. In some other worksharing systems operators move down the line carrying an item (or batch) with them, working on it at each machine until they are met by another worker who is coming back upstream. The work is then handed off even if the operation is underway. "Bucket Brigade" and "TSS" are worksharing systems based on this idea. This paper examines worksharing in a variety of situations, including unequal work content across machines, uncertain processing times, unequal workers, handoffs with and without preemption, and a range of machine-to-worker ratios. Some systems restrict workers to "zones" of machines. Work zones must overlap if sharing is to occur. The appropriate size of the overlapis shown to depend on the circumstances. Inventory-based rules to control access to shared machines are demonstrated to increase productivity when processing times vary. Worker sequence is found to be quite important; Slowest-to-Fastest is recommended for some situations, but is shown to perform poorly in others. Finally, the issue of whether or not to allow preemption is shown to have a large impact on productivity if inventory is not allowed, and to strongly affect the choice of designs when inventory is allowed. With and without preemption, proper combinations of worker sequence, zone size, and production control rules are shown to nearly eliminate idle time.

Title: Optimizing Strategic Safety Stock Placement in Supply Chains
Abstract: Manufacturing managers face increasing pressure to reduce inventories across the supply chain. However, in complex supply chains, it is not always obvious where to hold safety stock to minimize inventory costs and provide a high level of service to the final customer. In this paper we develop a framework for modeling strategic safety stock in a supply chain that is subject to demand or forecast uncertainty. Key assumptions are that we can model the supply chain as a network, that each stage in the supply chain operates with a periodic-review base-stock policy, that demand is bounded, and that there is a guaranteed service time between every stage and its customers. We develop an optimization algorithm for the placement of strategic safety stock for supply chains that can be modeled as spanning trees. Our assumptions allow us to capture the stochastic nature of the problem and formulate it as a deterministic optimization. As a partial validation of the model, we describe its successful application by product flow teams at Eastman Kodak. We discuss how these flow teams have used the model to reduce finished goods inventory, target cycle time reduction efforts, and determine component inventories. We conclude with a list of needs to enhance the utility of the model.

Title: Properties of Optimal-Weighted Flowtime Policies with a Makespan Constraint and Set-up Times
Abstract: We characterize optimal policies for the problem of allocating a single server to a set of jobs from N families. Each job is an instance of demand for an item and is associated with a family, a holding cost rate, and a mean processing time. Set-up times are required to switch from one family to another, but are not required to switch within a family. We consider the case in which the order of jobs within the family is unconstrained, and a variation in which the order is fixed. The optimization is with respect to the weighted flowtime, and we treat problems both with and without a makespan-constraint. Practical examples based on this model are described. We partially characterize an optimal policy by means of a Gittins rewardrate index and a similar switching index derived from multi-armed bandit theory. For deterministic problems with a makespan constraint, we present an optimization algorithm for the special case of two families and at most three set-ups . Without a makespan constraint and without preemption, we prove that our analysis of a deterministic model extends to stochastic set-up and processing times without loss of optimality. Managerial insights based on our technical results are provided.

Title: A Risk-free Perishable Item Returns Policy
Abstract: A returns policy, which specifies a schedule of rebates from manufacturer to retailer for product left over at the end of the selling season, encourages larger order quantities and can increase manufacturer profit. One downside from a manufacturer's perspective is the possibility of very low profit due to high rebate expense when demand is lower than expected. We take the viewpoint of a manufacturer selling a short life-cycle product to a single risk-neutral retailer and describe returns policies that, when compared to no returns, satisfy two conditions: (1) the retailer's expected profit is increased and (2) the manufacturer's profit is at least as large as when no returns are allowed. We call such a returns policy risk-free.

Title: Why Are Forecast Updates Often Disappointing?
Abstract: Demand forecasts do not become consistently more accurate as they are updated. We present examples demonstrating this counterintuitive phenomenon and some theoretical results to explain its occurrence. Specifically, we analyze the effect of demand randomness on forecast-update performance. A surprising result is that under various theoretical models involving demand randomness alone, updated forecasts will be less accurate between 30% and 50% of the time.

Title: Assessing the Value of Information Sharing in a Promotional Retail Environment
Abstract: We focus on a logistics system where inventory is held at three levels: the customers, the retail store, and the warehouse. Retail customer segments are heterogeneous and differ in their reservation prices for product as well as their holding costs. They purchase product from a retail store managed by a retailer. The retailer chooses a retail pricing scheme to maximize his expected profit given a model of customer temporal response to retail pricing. This retailer is supplied product from a warehouse managed by a manufacturer. The manufacturer is responsible for maintaining inventory level at the warehouse and providing 100% service level for retailer orders. The manufacturer uses all available information to generate an inventory policy that maximizes expected profit subject to the service-level requirement. We evaluate the manufacturer's optimal expected profit under two possible schemes: (1) no information regarding the timing of retail promotion plans, and (2) full information regarding the timing of retail promotion plans. We show: (1) as the predictability of the sales impact of a promotion decreases, it may be optimal for the retailer to eliminate retail promotions; (2) increased stockpiling tendency of customers increases retailer profits and decreases manufacturer profits; and (3) retail-promotion information sharing can make retail promotions change from being less profitable than no promotions to being more profitable than no promotions for the manufacturer. We show the impact of fitting the model to a grocery store data set that provided data regarding retail sales (and associated prices) of canned tomato soup over two years. We also explore managerial insights suggested by the model.

Title: Customer Service Competition in Capacitated Systems
Abstract: We investigate a simple dynamic model of firm behavior in which firms compete by investing in capacity that is used to provide a good or service to their customers. There is a fixed total market of customers whose demands for the good or service are random and who divide their patronage between the firms in each period. Periodically, the market shares of the two firms can change based on the realized level of customer service provided in the prior period. We assume that the expected level of customer service can be expressed as a function of the (per customer) capacity of the firms' service delivery systems, and that service declines as the capacity decreases. The firms differ in their customers' willingness to defect when confronted by service failure. The primary issue we address is the firms' capacity decisions in response to customer service concerns and competitive pressure. We provide conditions under which the firms' optimal (i.e., equilibrium) capacity levels in a period are proportional to the size of their respective customer bases in that period. Further, we develop expressions for the value of a firm's customers and the implicit cost of service failure. Results for both single-period and finite-horizon problems are investigated and applied to two examples: (1) competition between Internet service providers who operate systems that we approximate by simple loss-type queueing models, and (2) competition between make-to-stock producers who operate systems that we approximate by newsvendor inventory models. For both examples, solutions are derived and interpreted.

Title: Requirements Planning with Substitutions: Exploiting Bill-of-Materials Flexibility in Production Planning
Abstract: Designing product lines with substitutable components and subassemblies permits companies to offer a broader variety of products while continuing to exploit economies of scale in production and inventory costs. Past research on models incorporating component substitutions focuses on the benefits from reduced safety-stock requirements. This paper addresses a dynamic requirements-planning problem for two-stage multi product manufacturing systems with bill-of-materials flexibility, i.e., with options to use substitute components or subassemblies produced by an upstream stage to meet demand in each period at the downstream stage. We model the problem as an integer program, and describe a dynamic-programming solution method to find the production and substitution quantities that satisfy given multi period downstream demands at minimum total setup, production, conversion, and holding cost. This methodology can serve as a module in requirements-planning systems to plan opportunistic component substitutions based on relative future demands and production costs. Computational results using real data from an aluminum-tube manufacturer show that substitution can save, on average, 8.7% of manufacturing cost. We also apply the model to random problems with a simple product structure to develop insights regarding substitution behavior and impacts.

Title: Sales-Force Incentives and Inventory Management
Abstract: This article studies the problem of sales-force compensation by considering the impact of sales-force behavior on a firm's production and inventory system. The sales force's compensation package affects how the salespeople are going to exert their effort, which in turn determines the sales pattern for the firm's product and ultimately drives the performance of the firm's production and inventory system. In general, a smooth demand process facilitates production/inventory planning. Therefore, it is beneficial for a firm to induce its salespeople to exert effort in a way that actually smoothes the demand process. The article proposes a compensation package to induce such behavior. It evaluates and compensates the sales force on a moving-time-window basis, where the length of the time window is determined by the production lead time. Numerical examples show that the proposed package is beneficial to the firm relative to a widely used compensation plan based on annual quotas.

Title: Responsibility Tokens in Supply Chain Management
Abstract: The decentralized supply chain management scheme of Lee and Whang (1999) can be viewed as operationalizing the decentralized management scheme implicit in Clark and Scarf (1960). This paper proposes the use of what are called responsibility tokens (RTs) to further facilitate that operationalization. The proposal assumes that a management information system, presumably electronic, is established to monitor inventories and shipment quantities, and to carry out transfer payments between players. As in Lee and Whang(1999), the incentives of the system are aligned, so if each player is brilliantly self-serving, the system optimal solution will result. While the system administrator need not know how the system should be managed, the most upstream player must know how to manage the system optimally for the system optimal solution to be achieved. RTs endow the system with an attractive self-correcting property: An example illustrates that upstream players are given a mechanism and the incentive to correct for downstream overordering. The downstream players who over-order are penalized, but system performance is not degraded much. Extensions and further research are also discussed.

Title: Congestion and Complexity Costs in a Plant with Fixed Resources that Strives to Make Schedule
Abstract: In a firm that makes schedule, orders are always processed within a fixed time frame. In a congested facility, such a situation would be impossible using conventional queuing logic. We propose a conceptual model of a firm in which workers make schedule by rushing jobs, if necessary, with potential quality consequences. Hence, time and quality are substitutes, a feature that we recognize explicitly in our definition of the firm's capacity. Production yields are not exogenous parameters but endogenously determined by workers responding to schedule pressures. The plant manager can authorize overtime to relieve this pressure or live with the quality consequences of rushing. The model reveals the close relationships among the firm's workforce policies, the integrity of the inspection system, and the cost performance of the firmas its volume and/or product line expands. We consider pure congestion (driven by volume) and pure complexity (driven by product line breadth) effects in the context of our plant performance model. We consider two root causes of complexity costs: time and quality. The time effects of complexity will only have cost consequences in congested facilities, but quality effects are always present. Also in contrast to time effects, quality effects of complexity can be present in nonbottleneck workstations. Hence, the quality consequences of complexity can be as, or more important than the time consequences.

Title: Performance-Based Incentives in a Dynamic Principal-Agent Model
Abstract: The principal-agent paradigm, in which a principal has a primary stake in the performance of some system but delegates operational control of that system to an agent, has many natural applications in operations management (OM). However, existing principal-agent models are of limited use to OM researchers because they cannot represent the rich dynamic structure required of OM models. This paper formulates a novel dynamic model that overcomes these limitations by combining the principal-agent framework with the physical structure of a Markov decision process. In this model one has a system moving from state to state as time passes, with transition probabilities depending on actions chosen by an agent, and a principal who pays the agent based on state transitions observed. The principal seeks an optimal payment scheme, striving to induce the actions that will maximize her expected discounted profits over a finite planning horizon. Although dynamic principal-agent models similar to the one proposed here are considered intractable, a set of assumptions are introduced that enable a systematic analysis. These assumptions involve the "economic structure" of the model but not its "physical structure." Under these assumptions, the paper establishes that one can use a dynamic-programming recursion to derive an optimal payment scheme. This scheme is memoryless and satisfies a generalization of Bellman's principle of optimality. Important managerial insights are highlighted in the context of a two-state example called "the maintenance problem".

Title: A Robust Optimization Approach for Improving Service Quality
Abstract: Delivering high quality service during the service encounter is central to competitive advantage in service organizations. However, achieving such high quality while controlling for costs is a major challenge for service managers. The purpose of this paper is to present an approach for addressing this challenge. The approach entails developing a model linking service process operational variables to service quality metrics to provide guidelines for service resource allocation. The approach enables the service operations manager to take specific actions toward service quality improvement, in light of the costs involved. A novel feature of the approach is the development of robust optimization models, which provide optimal operational guidelines while accounting for uncertainty in the model's parameters. We demonstrate the applicability of the approach in a large health care facility.

Title: Contract Assembly: Dealing with Combined Supply Lead Time and Demand Quantity Uncertainty
Abstract: We consider a problem faced by a contract assembler that both assembles finished goods and procures the associated component parts for one of its major customers. Because of rapid changes in technology and ongoing engineering changes, all parts subject to obsolescence are purchased only for the current customer order. The procurement lead times of the components are random. Moreover, although the order for the finished product has a defined due date, the contract allows the customer to change the order quantity. Consequently, the assembler also faces a random demand. The assembler must determine how much to order and when to order each component part. The objective is to minimize the total expected cost, including the cost of holding components prior to their assembly, penalties for tardiness visa-vis the assembly due date, and overage and underage costs in satisfying the demand quantity. We present some structural results and discuss insights regarding optimal policies. We also present several simple heuristic policies and compare them to optimal policies. Computational results indicate that ignoring lead time variability can be costly, but relatively simple heuristics that consider lead time variability perform quite well.

Title: Optimizing Delivery Fees for a Network of Distributors
Abstract: The third-party logistics industry has grown rapidly in recent years, accounting for $46 billion of the total $921 billion in logistics spending in the United States during 1999. This figure is expected to grow by 15 to 20% annually as manufacturing firms increasingly partner with third-party logistics providers to cost effectively distribute their products, while meeting increasingly stringent service expectations of customers. These logistics partnerships have introduced a new set of decision requirements to negotiate compensation for distribution services. Based on a collaborative project with a leading building products manufacturer, this paper describes the development and implementation of a novel linear programming model to decide the delivery fees paid to distributors. The model applies to manufacturer-distributor partnerships where distributors are compensated using fee values that depend on delivery weights and distances. It ensures that the expected compensation, considering stochastic demands, is adequate to cover the aggregate distribution costs for each distributor, and permits imposing various consistency conditions to ensure that fee values are credible. The model proved effective in helping the manufacturer develop a new fee table that generated considerable economic savings and provided more equitable compensation to distributors.

Title: The Impact of an Integrated Marketing and Manufacturing Innovation
Abstract: Suppose you are a Marketing Manager envisioning a new product, or an Operations Manager contemplating a process improvement, or a CEO who commissioned an integrated new product development team. If our assumptions hold, our model offers you a single numerical measure, called the degree of product/process innovation, to determine your initiative's impact on potential sales, prices, market segments, and profits. Our simple, single-period model is a variation of the existing vertically differentiated products model: There are two competing substitute products, and customers will buy at most one of them. Our contribution is to allow new relationships between the valuations of the two products by potential customers, and to allow differing unit production costs. We identify equilibrium results when two competing firms each offer one product, and find the profit maximizing result when one (monopolistic) firm offers both products. The new product infringes on the market in one of two ways: High-end encroachment results when the new product attracts the best customers (those with the highest reservation prices), while low-end encroachment identifies a situation where the new product attracts fringe (lower-end) customers. Low-end encroachment may help explain why an incumbent sometimes fails to recognize the threat of an entrant's product, as we illustrate with an example from the disk drive industry. In short, we offer insight into the value of both a marketing objective (enhancing the product design attributes) and a manufacturing goal (lowering the production cost) in a product and/or process improvement project.

Title: An Analysis of Several New Product Performance Metrics
Abstract: For most firms, new product development is the engine for growth and profitability. A firm's new product success depends on its ability to manage the product development process in a way that employs scarce resources to achieve the goal of the firm as well as the specific project's objectives. Simple and measurable performance metrics have been proposed and applied to monitor and compensate the development teams. In this paper, we develop a modeling frame work to analyze the implications of setting managerial priorities for three commonly used new product performance metrics: (1) time-to-market, (2) product performance, and (3) total development cost. We model new product development as a "product performance production" process that requires scarce development resources. Setting a target for development teams for each of these performance metrics can constrain this performance production process and, thereby, affect the other performance metrics. We model the constrained process as a restricted case of a general process that does not have such constraints. We benchmark each constrained process against the optimal, unrestricted process with respect to the level of the resource intensity employed during the development process, the time-to-market, and the performance level of the new product at launch. We show that an overly ambitious time-to-market target leads to an upward bias in resource intensity usage and a downward bias in product performance (i.e., evolutionary product innovation). In addition, our results suggest that the target time-to-market approach may ignore the effect of cannibalization and, thus, can perform suboptimally if a significant degree of cannibalization in the existing product market is expected. Given a target product performance, we show that the coordination between marketing and R&D is easier because the resulting development resource intensity and time-to-market decisions becomes separable. However, an overly ambitious product performance target leads to an upward bias in the development resource intensity and a delayed product launch that misses the window of opportunity. Finally, we show that the target development cost approach can lead a downward bias in product performance and a premature product launch. The above analyses are performed for a monopolistic firm, and they are extended to passive and active competitive environment.

Title: Supply Contract Competition and Sourcing Policies
Abstract: Advances in information technology have opened new venues for companies to create flexible supply chains by offering high-speed communication and tight connectivity. A growing number of companies are taking advantage of new opportunities to outsource portions of their production and other operations. Given the importance of the supplier selection process in the ultimate success of a product, a purchasing manager must understand the different sourcing strategies that she or he can use and the suitability of each sourcing arrangements for her or him. This paper provides an overview of the research that has been done in the fields of operations research and economics on the topic of sourcing strategies. In aggregate, this paper provides a blueprint of what market characteristics can heavily influence a buyer-supplier relationship and, hence, are important to identify and incorporate into the supplier selection process.

Title: Channel Dynamics Under Price and Service Competition
Abstract: This paper studies a distribution system in which a manufacturer supplies a common product to two independent retailers, who in turn use service as well as retail price to directly compete for end customers. We examine the drivers of each firm's strategy, and the consequences for total sales, market share, and profitability. We show that the relative intensity of competition with respect to each competitive dimension plays a key role, as does the degree of cooperation between the retailers. We discover a number of insights concerning the preferences of each party regarding competition. For instance, there will be circumstances under which both retailers would prefer an increase in competitive intensity. Our analysis generalizes existing knowledge about manufacturer wholesale pricing strategies, and rationalizes behaviors that would not be evident without both price and service competition. Finally, we characterize the structure of wholesale pricing mechanisms that can coordinate the system, and show that the most commonly used formats (those that are linear in the order quantity) can achieve coordination only under very limiting conditions.

Title: Price and Time Competition for Service Delivery
Abstract: Many service firms use delivery time guarantees to compete for customers in the marketplace. In this research we develop a stylized model to analyze the impact of using time guarantees on competition. Demands are assumed to be sensitive to both the price and delivery time guarantees, and the objective of each firm is to select the best price and time guarantee to maximize its operating profit. We first analyze the optimization problem for the individual firms and then study the equilibrium solution in a multiple-firm competition. Using a numerical study, we further illustrate how the different firm and market characteristics would affect the price and delivery time competition in the market. Our results suggest that the equilibrium price and time guarantee decisions in an oligopolistic market with identical firms behave in a similar fashion as the optimal solution in a monopolistic situation from a previous study. However, when there are heterogeneous firms in the market, these firms will exploit their distinctive firm characteristics to differentiate their services. Assuming all other factors being equal, the high capacity firms provide better time guarantees, while firms with lower operating costs offer lower prices, and the differentiation becomes more acute as demands become more time-sensitive. Furthermore, as time-attractiveness of the market increases, firms compete less on price, and the equilibrium prices of the firms increase as a result. Our findings provide important implications about firm behaviour under price and time competition.

Title: Impact of Uncertainty and Risk Aversion on Price and Order Quantity in the Newsvendor Problem
Abstract: We consider a single-period inventory model in which a risk-averse retailer faces uncertain customer demand and makes a purchasing-order-quantity and a selling-price decision with the objective of maximizing expected utility. This problem is similar to the classic newsvendor problem, except: (a) the distribution of demand is a function of the selling price, which is determined by the retailer; and (b) the objective of the retailer is to maximize his/her expected utility. We consider two different ways in which price affects the distribution of demand. In the first model, we assume that a change in price affects the scale of the distribution. In the second model, a change in price only affects the location of the distribution. We present methodology by which this problem with two decision variables can be simplified by reducing it to a problem in a single variable. We show that in comparison to a risk-neutral retailer, a risk-averse retailer in the first model will charge a higher price and order less; where as, in the second model a risk-averse retailer will charge a lower price. The implications of these findings for supply-chain strategy and channel design are discussed. Our research provides a better understanding of retailers' pricing behavior that could lead to improved price contracts and channel-management policies.

Title: Have U.S. Manufacturing Inventories Really Decreased? An Empirical Study
Abstract: Numerous normative models have been developed to determine optimal inventory levels, and several articles and case studies have been written about the concerted efforts and practices adopted by manufacturing firms in the United States to reduce inventories. But little is known about whether inventories have indeed decreased in U.S. manufacturing and whether such a decrease has been restricted to a few well-publicized firms or is true at an industry level. Using data published by the U.S. Census Bureau, the authors study trends in materials, work-in-process, and finished-goods inventory ratios during the period 1961 to 1994 in 20 manufacturing industry sectors and the total U.S. manufacturing sector to determine whether a significant decrease was seen in these ratios. Further, since a great deal of momentum for inventory reduction began in the early 1980s, the authors investigate whether greater improvement was seen in the post-1980 period as compared with the pre-1980 period. We find that material and work-in-process inventories did decrease in a majority of the two-digit industry sectors from 1961 to 1994 and showed greater improvement in about half the sectors in the post-1980 period relative to the pre-1980 period. Finished-goods inventories did decrease in some industry sectors and increase in a few others but did not show a significant trend in more than half the sectors. Total manufacturing inventory ratios decreased from 1961 to 1994 at all three stages---material, work-in-process, and finished goods. However, total manufacturing inventory ratios did not improve at a higher rate during the post-1980 period as compared with the pre-1980 period in any of the three stages. Overall, the analysis provides an encouraging but somewhat mixed picture about the results of U.S. manufacturing inventory-reduction efforts.

Title: Work-Team Implementation and Trajectories of Manufacturing Quality: A Longitudinal Field Study
Abstract: The study examines the sustainability of manufacturing quality improvements following the implementation of work teams on production lines. We posit that the impact on manufacturing quality, measured as the defect rate trajectory, is monotonically nonincreasing over time and may, more specifically, assume the shape of an inverted S-curve. Employing a longitudinal research design, we investigate four work teams over a 28-month period in a field setting. Each team corresponds to one of the four interconnected production lines in an electromechanical assembly plant operated by a Fortune 500 firm. Results of our empirical analysis support the sustainability of quality improvements associated with work team implementation and partially support the S-shaped trajectory as the particular form of sustainability. However, variations in the manufacturing quality trajectories reflect the characteristics of the work team and the production line on which each the team is instituted. From the standpoint of practice, this study highlights the importance of work-team design and implementation decisions, especially the need to be proactive in identifying and resolving initial implementation difficulties.

Title: Serial Production/Distribution Systems Under Service Constraints
Abstract: We analyze the problem of minimizing average inventory costs subject to fill-rate type of service-level constraints in serial and assembly production/distribution systems. We propose optimal and heuristic procedures to solve this problem. Our model and solution procedures can be used to manage the fill rate or fill rate within a "time window" service measures. We also relate our service-constrained model to the traditional model with back-order costs and show that it is possible to prespecify backorder cost rates to achieve desired service levels. We explore the inventory cost impact of such a practice, and we find that the cost penalty can be very high.

Title: Market Segmentation, Advanced Demand Information, and Supply Chain Performance
Abstract: A monopolist sells a single product to a market where the customers may be enticed to accept a delay as to when their orders are shipped. The enticement is a discounted price for the product. The market consists of several segments with different degrees of aversion to delays. The firm offers a price schedule under which the customers each self-select the price they pay and when their orders are to be shipped. When a customer agrees to wait, the firm gains advanced demand information that can be used to reduce its supply chain costs. This article shows how an optimal pricing-replenishment strategy that balances the costs due to discounted prices and the benefits due to advanced demand information can be determined.

Title: Utilizing Forecast Band Refinement for Capacitated Production Planning
Abstract: We present a model for forecast evolution that captures two notions related to forecasts: (1) forecasts are not exact; (2) forecasts over longer horizons are less certain than those over shorter horizons. We model the forecast of discrete demand as a band defined by the lower and upper bounds on demand, such that future forecasts lie within the current band. We develop a capacitated production planning model for a single product with terminal demand. We develop four heuristics for the problem and characterize their performance. In particular, two of the heuristics are optimal for the no holding-cost case. In our computational study, we analyze the performance of our heuristics and compare them to the optimal solution and to a simple heuristic that simulates common industrial practice using point forecasts. We find that two of our heuristics are very close to the optimal solution (less than 0.5% away from optimal on average under the conditions studied). Further, we consider forecast update patterns with primarily early, intermediate, and late information updates and provide insights on the effect of information update patterns on optimal costs.

Title: Supply Chain Coordination when Demand Is Shelf-Space Dependent
Abstract: Consider a manufacturer or wholesaler who supplies some item to retailers facing demand rates that depend on the shelf or display space that is devoted to that product by themselves and their competitors. The manufacturer, via the use of financial levers at her disposal, wishes to coordinate this decentralized chain while making a profit. We model the physical scenario as one of constant displayed inventory level (on which demand rate depends positively) and continuous replenishment. With a single retailer, we show that to coordinate the channel and make a profit the manufacturer needs to augment the wholesale price lever by another-an inventory holding costs subsidy offered to the retailer. When multiple retailers compete in that product's market, there are two ways to envision and model the demand and market split. One assumes that market demand depends on aggregate inventory displayed, and then splits according to individual display levels. The other "assigns" customers to retailers according to their display levels, and then assumes that purchases are a function of the display level at the retailer selected. We characterize retailers' Nash equilibria in these models, and we explore whether the manufacturer can coordinate such channels.

Title: Quality and Time-to-Market Trade-offs when There Are Multiple Product Generations
Abstract: We extend previous work evaluating the quality versus time-to-market trade-off for a single product generation to the case of multiple generations. While a single generation framework is appropriate when either the technology is not extendable or when additional launch costs outweigh benefits, we find that it is important to recognize whether a technology is extendable and explicitly consider the potential for multiple generations. We evaluate the factors determining optimal development-cycle length and intensity using a forward-looking model that allows for multiple product generations. Comparisons are made with restricted versions of the model that reflect pure single generation and sequential single generation approaches. Against an active competitor, the multiple generation approach is much more profitable, with the greatest differences in fast-moving industries. More total time is spent in development when a multiple generation model is used. Further, this time is dedicated to the more frequent introduction of improved product generations---a "rapid inch-up" strategy---resulting in more, higher quality products over time. Factors affecting optimal time-to-market differ substantially for the single versus multiple generation approaches. A key difference is that faster rates of quality improvement lead to longer development cycles for the single and sequential single generation models, but shorter cycles with the forward-looking multiple generation model. With a single generation, variable costs have the biggest impact on cycle length (higher costs shorten cycles), but with multiple generations, fixed costs have the biggest impact on cycle length (higher costs lead to longer cycles).

Title: Assessing the Benefits of Different Stock-Allocation Policies for a Make-to-Stock Production System
Abstract: We consider a manufacturing facility that produces a single item that is demanded by several different classes of customers. The inventory-related cost performance of such a system can be improved by effective allocation of production and inventories. We obtain the optimal parameters for three easily implementable allocation policies. Our results cover the case of linear backorder costs as well as fill-rate constraints. We compare the optimal performance of these control policies to gain insights into the benefits of different production and stock-allocation rules.

Title: Matching Supply and Demand: The Value of a Second Chance in Producing Hybrid Seed Corn
Abstract: This paper considers a production-scheduling problem arising when there are random yields and demands as well as two sequential production periods before demand occurs. A typical instance is the production of seed corn. The paper makes three contributions. First, we verify that the objective function for the problem is smooth and concave so that optimal solutions are easily computed. Second, by examining data that represents actual costs, prices, and yields encountered in the seed corn industry, we gain some insight into the value that the second production period provides. Third, for a representative sample of hybrids from a major seed corn producer, we show that margins could be enhanced considerably by using the model. The results of this paper will assist seed corn producers in making production-scheduling decisions.

Title: A Comparison of U-Line and Straight-Line Performances Under Stochastic Task Times
Abstract: Traditionally, assembly lines are laid out in a straight-line configuration where a worker covers only adjacent stations. In a U-line layout, on the other hand, two or more non-adjacent stations can be physically close to each other, making it possible for a worker to cover nonadjacent stations. This added flexibility increases the decision space for U-line layouts and can result in better balanced lines. This paper examines the impact of stochastic task times on the relative performance of U-line and straight-line layouts. Several analytical and simulation results are presented, and insights are provided to explain the difference in the performance of U-line and straight-line layouts. To summarize our main results, although balanced U-line layouts are at least as productive as balanced straight-line layouts given deterministic task times, they can be less productive given stochastic task times if they are balanced deterministically using mean times.

Title: Coordinating Production and Delivery Under a (z, Z)-Type Vendor-Managed Inventory Contract
Abstract: This paper models a type of vendor-managed inventory (VMI) agreement that occurs in practice called a (z, Z) contract. We investigate the savings due to better coordination of production and delivery facilitated by such an agreement. The optimal behavior of both the supplier and the retailer are characterized. The optimal replenishment and production policies for a supplier are found to be up-to policies, which are shown to be easily computed by decoupling the periods when the supplier outsources from those when the supplier does not outsource. A simple application of the newsvendor relation is used to define the retailer's optimal policy. Numerical analysis is conducted to compare the performance of a single supplier and a single retailer operating under a (z, Z) VMI contract with the performance of those operating under traditional retailer-managed inventory (RMI) with information sharing. Our results verify some observations made in industry about VMI and show that the (z, Z) type of VMI agreement performs significantly better than RMI in many settings, but can perform worse in others.

Title: Consequences of Order Crossover Under Order-Up-To Inventory Policies
Abstract: Order crossover occurs whenever replenishment orders do not arrive in the sequence in which they were placed. This paper argues that order crossover is becoming more prevalent and analyzes the dangers of ignoring it. We present an exact iterative algorithm for computing the distribution of the number of orders outstanding, and formulae for the inventory shortfall distribution (the quantity of inventory in replenishment at the start of a period) and the more common lead-time demand distribution, which are different when order crossover is possible. The lead-time demand distribution can have much higher variability than the shortfall distribution. We show that basing inventory policies on the lead-time demand distribution---rather than the shortfall distribution---can lead to significantly higher inventory cost, even if the probability of order crossover is small. We give an alternative proof to that of Zalkind (1976), which shows that the variance of shortfall is less than the variance of the standard lead-time demand.

Title: A Modeling Framework for Category Assortment Planning
Abstract: The complexity of managing a category assortment has grown tremendously in recent years due to the increased product turnover and proliferation rates in most categories. It is an increasingly difficult task for managers to find an effective assortment due to uncertain consumer preferences and the exponential number of possible assortments. This paper presents an empirically based modeling framework for managers to assess the revenue and lost sales implication of alternative category assortments. Coupled with a local improvement heuristic, the modeling framework generates an alternative category assortment with higher revenue. This framework, which consists of a category-purchase-incidence model and a brand-share model, is calibrated and validated using 60,000 shopping trips and purchase records. Specifically, the purchase-incidence model predicts the probability of an individual customer who purchases (and who does not purchase) from a given product category during a shopping trip. The no-purchase probability enables us to estimate lost sales due to assortment changes in the category. The brand-share model predicts which brand the customer chooses if a purchase incidence occurs in the category. Our brand-share model extends the classical Guadagni and Little model (1983) by utilizing three new brand-width measures that quantify the similarities among products of different brands within the same category. We illustrate how our modeling framework is used to reconfigure the category assortment in eight food categories for five stores in our data set. This reconfiguration exercise shows that a reconfigured category assortment can have a profit improvement of up to 25.1% with 32 products replaced. We also demonstrate how our modeling framework can be used to gauge lost sales due to assortment changes. We find the level of lost sales could range from 0.9% to 10.2% for a period of 26 weeks.

Title: Managing a Retailer's Shelf Space, Inventory, and Transportation
Abstract: Retailers must constantly strive for excellence in operations; extremely narrow profit margins leave little room for waste and inefficiency. This article reports a retailer's challenge to balance transportation, shelf space, and inventory costs. A retailer sells multiple products with stochastic demand. Trucks are dispatched from a warehouse and arrive at a store with a constant lead time. Each truck has a finite capacity and incurs a fixed shipping cost, no matter the number of units shipped. There is a per unit shelf-space cost as well as holding and backorder penalty costs. Three policies are considered for dispatching trucks: a minimum quantity continuous review policy, a full service periodic review policy, and a minimum quantity periodic review policy. The first policy ships a truck when demand since the previous shipment equals a fixed fraction of a truck's capacity, i.e., a minimum truck utilization. The exact analysis of that policy is the same as the analysis of reorder point policies for the multiechelon problem with one-warehouse, multiple retailers, and stochastic demand. That analysis is not computationally prohibitive, but the minimum quantity level can be chosen with a simple economic order quantity (EOQ) heuristic. An extensive numerical study finds the following: Either of the two periodic review policies may have substantially higher costs than the continuous review policy, in particular when the warehouse to store lead time is short; the EOQ heuristic performs quite well; the minimum quantity policy's total cost is relatively insensitive to the chosen transportation utilization, and its total cost is close to a lower bound developed for this problem.

Title: Optimizing Inventory Replenishment of Retail Fashion Products
Abstract: We consider the problem of determining (for a short lifecycle) retail product initial and replenishment order quantities that minimize the cost of lost sales, back orders, and obsolete inventory. We model this problem as a two-stage stochastic dynamic program, propose a heuristic, establish conditions under which the heuristic finds an optimal solution, and report results of the application of our procedure at a catalog retailer. Our procedure improves on the existing method by enough to double profits. In addition, our method can be used to choose the optimal reorder time, to quantify the benefit of leadtime reduction, and to choose the best replenishment contract.

Title: Information and Inventory Recourse for a Two-Market, Price-Setting Retailer
Abstract: We analyze the problem of determining inventory and pricing decisions in a two-period retail setting when an opportunity to refine information about uncertain demand is available. The model extends the newsvendor problem with pricing by allowing for multiple suppliers, the pooling of procurement resources, and more general informational dynamics. One contribution is the solution procedure: We show that all decisions (up to 7 in all, including recourse decisions) can be determined uniquely as a function of a surrogate first-period decision called the stocking factor. Hence, the two-period decision problem with recourse reduces to a search for one decision variable. A second contribution is the policy implications: We find that the cost of learning is (1) a consequence of censored information because, on the margin, learning is free if full information is guaranteed; (2) measured in the form of an increased stocking factor; and (3) shared with the consumer in the form of a higher selling price when demand uncertainty is additive. A third contribution is the application of the results to three motivating examples: a market research problem in which a product is introduced in a test market prior to a widespread launch; a global newsvendor problem in which a seasonal product is sold in two different countries with nonoverlapping selling seasons; and a minimum-quantity commitment problem in which procurement resources for multiple purchases may be pooled.

Title: Operational Drivers of Customer Loyalty in Electronic Retailing: An Empirical Analysis of Electronic Food Retailers
Abstract: The relationship between customer loyalty and the order procurement and order fulfillment processes of electronic retailers is empirically examined in this paper. The study sample contains data from 52 electronic food retailers. After controlling for the retailers' product categories based on design flexibility, our regression analysis results indicate that three order procurement variables---website navigation, product information, and price; and three order fulfillment variables---product availability, timeliness of delivery, and ease of return have significant association with customer loyalty. In terms of their relative contributions toward improving customer loyalty, these variables can be ordered in a descending order as follows: ease of return, timeliness of delivery, website navigation, product availability, price, and product information.

Title: Agility in Retail Banking: A Numerical Taxonomy of Strategic Service Groups
Abstract: This research demonstrates that operations agility---defined as the ability to excel simultaneously on operations capabilities of quality, delivery, flexibility, and cost in a coordinated fashion---is a viable option for retail banks encountering increasing environmental change. The question of whether there is empirical evidence that services, specifically retail banks, display the characteristics of agility like their manufacturing counterparts is open to debate. Conventional wisdom in operations management posits that most successful services trade off one capability for another. Drawing from the resource-based view of the firm, combinative capabilities view, and the cybernetics work of Ashby (1958), theoretical arguments suggest the contrary. The agility paradigm is viable in environments calling for a mix of strategic responses. Applying cluster analytic techniques to a sample of retail banks, using capabilities as taxons, we identify four strategic service groups: agile, traditionalists, niche, and straddlers. Our empirical results provide thematic explanations consistent with theory that account for how the agile strategic group offers a unique configuration of service concept, resource competencies, strategic choices, and business orientation. Profiles of the operations strategies of each strategic service group suggest that each group has found a fit between what certain segments of the market may want and what they have to offer. In particular, we found that the agile group exhibited greater resource competencies than its counterparts, requiring greater investments in infrastructure and technology. Consistent with theory, agile banks performed better over time on an absolute measure of return on assets.

Title: Selling to the Newsvendor: An Analysis of Price-Only Contracts
Abstract: We consider a simple supply-chain contract in which a manufacturer sells to a retailer facing a newsvendor problem and the lone contract parameter is a wholesale price. We develop a mild restriction satisfied by many common distributions that assures that the manufacturer's problem is readily amenable to analysis. The manufacturer's profit and sales quantity increase with market size, but the resulting wholesale price depends on how the market grows. For the cases we consider, we identify relative variability (i.e., the coefficient of variation) as key: As relative variability decreases, the retailer's price sensitivity decreases, the wholesale price increases, the decentralized system becomes more efficient (i.e., captures a greater share of potential profit), and the manufacturer's share of realized profit increases. Decreasing relative variability, however, may leave the retailer severely disadvantaged as the higher wholesale price reduces his profitability. We explore factors that may lead the manufacturer to set a wholesale price below that which would maximize her profit, concentrating on retailer participation in forecasting and retailer power. As these and other considerations can result in a wholesale price below what we initially suggest, our base model represents a worst-case analysis of supply-chain performance.

Title: Creating an Inventory Hedge for Markov-Modulated Poisson Demand: An Application and Model
Abstract: Many firms face environments with long manufacturing leadtimes, great product variety, and uncertain, nonstationary demand. A challenge is how to plan production and inventories to provide the best customer service at the least cost. In this paper, we first describe an application at Teradyne in which we implemented an inventory hedge to protect against cyclic demand variability. Based on this experience, we develop a model to better understand the efficacy of this hedging policy. We consider an inventory system for a single aggregate product with a Markov-modulated Poisson demand process. We provide approximate performance measures for this system and develop an optimization problem for determining the size and location of an intermediate-decoupling inventory. We use this optimization to show the value of an intermediate-decoupling inventory as a hedge for cyclic demand environments.

Title: A Simple, Robust Leadtime-Quoting Policy
Abstract: We examine leadtime-quoting polices for minimizing average lead time subject to customer service constraints on fill rate, tardiness, or relative tardiness in simple systems with exponential and normal processing times. By studying the resulting safety leadtimes implied by each policy we gain insight into why some policies perform more robustly with respect to different measures of customer service than do others. This analysis suggests that a simple constant safety leadtime policy should work reasonably well under most conditions. A series of simulation experiments of more complex production environments indicates that the constant safety leadtime policy does indeed exhibit robust performance. This, plus the fact that it is extremely simple to adapt to a wide range of production environments, makes it an attractive basis for real-world leadtime-quoting systems.

Title: Coordinating Independent Buyers in a Distribution System to Increase a Vendor's Profits
Abstract: We study the coordination of a two-echelon distribution system where a vendor distributes a single product to a set of independent buyers. The problem is analyzed as a Stackelberg game in which the vendor acts as the leader and buyers act as followers. A simple strategy is developed for the vendor to employ a uniform quantity-discount policy to coordinate buyers' replenishment times by the power-of-two policy. Solution procedures are developed for the equilibrium strategy. It is shown that time coordination generally has a substantial benefit for the vendor, although the benefit to the buyers may be limited. Furthermore, uniform quantity discounts to all buyers are normally feasible but not sufficient to achieve perfect channel coordination when buyers act independently. The proposed strategy obtains a high proportion of the maximum benefit under perfect channel coordination.

Title: A General Framework for the Study of Decentralized Distribution Systems
Abstract: We develop a general framework for the analysis of decentralized distribution systems. We carry the analysis in terms of a simplified model which entails N retailers who face stochastic demands and hold stocks locally and/or at one or more central locations. An exogenously specified fraction of any unsatisfied demand (demand greater than locally available stock) at a retailer could be satisfied using excess stocks at other retailers and/or stocks held at a central location. We consider inventory ordering and allocation decisions. The operational decisions of inventory and allocation of stocks and the financial decision of allocation of revenues/costs must be made in a way consistent with the individual incentives of the various independent retailers. We develop a "coopetitive" framework for the sequential decisions of inventory and allocation. We introduce the notion of claims that allows us to separate the ownership (with decision rights) and the location of inventories in the system. For the cooperative shipping and allocation decision, we use the concept of core and develop sufficient conditions for the existence of the core. For the inventory decision, we develop conditions for the existence of a pure strategy Nash Equilibrium. For this decentralized system, we show that there exists an allocation mechanism that achieves the first-best solution for inventory deployment and allocation. We develop conditions under which the first-best equilibrium will be unique. Our model can be easily generalized to include complicated ownership structures such as "super dealers," partnerships, "inventory speculators," and situations in retail e-commerce settings such as "click-through arrangements," separation of "demand generators," and "fulfillment houses," etc. It can also be applied to situations involving capacity allocations and product substitutions.

Title: Play It Again, Sam? Optimal Replacement Policies for a Motion Picture Exhibitor
Abstract: Every week, motion picture exhibitors must decide whether to keep or replace the movies playing in their theaters in light of the past week's sales data. This decision is complex because of the dynamic decision environment, the uncertainty of demand, the complex revenue-sharing terms between the retailer and the distributor, the need to commit to new movies for several weeks, and the competitive release patterns of movies. We formulate this problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) model, using it to obtain replacement policies for the exhibitor. We examine the effect of differences in quality and quantity of available movies, and their respective release dates on the returns from model-based normative solutions. We also show that two practical heuristics are significantly outperformed by the optimal policy for the MDP model. We conclude by applying the model to industry data.

Title: Forecast, Solution, and Rolling Horizons in Operations Management Problems: A Classified Bibliography
Abstract: We present a classified bibliography of the literature in the area of forecast, solution, and rolling horizons primarily in operations management problems. Each one of over 200 selected papers is categorized on five dimensions that identify the horizon type, the model type (deterministic or stochastic), the sources of the horizon, the methods used to obtain horizon results, and the subject area of the paper. The majority of the papers treat dynamic problems in inventory management, production planning, capacity expansion, machine replacement, and warehousing. We discuss the relationship of the horizon results with the theory and practice of rolling-horizon procedures and future research directions.

Title: Dynamic Capacity Expansion Problem with Deferred Expansion and Age-Dependent Shortage Cost
Abstract: Deferring capacity expansion may be a cost effective decision when there is anticipation of cheaper capacity in the near future and/or the current demand is too low to justify an immediate expansion. This paper studies a finite-horizon capacity expansion problem (CEP) with deferred capacity expansion. The operating cost and the cost of holding unused capacity in each period depend on the time when the capacity is acquired, and the shortage cost depends on the time when the shortage occurred. Our model is a generalization of the Wagner-Whitin formulation of the CEP and an extension (with deferred expansion) of two other polynomially solvable CEPs in the literature. We explore structural properties of the problem and develop an efficient dynamic programming algorithm to solve the problem in polynomial time.

Title: Gaining Benefits from Joint Forecasting and Replenishment Processes: The Case of Auto-Correlated Demand
Abstract: In this paper we consider a cooperative, two-level supply chain consisting of a retailer and a supplier. As in many practical settings, the supply chain members progressively observe market signals that enable them to explain future demand. The demand itself evolves according to an auto-regressive time series. We examine three types of supply chain configurations. In the first setting, the retailer and the supplier coordinate their policy parameters in an attempt to minimize systemwide costs, but they do not share their observations of market signals. In the second setting, resembling many original vendor-managed inventory (VMI) programs, the supplier takes the full responsibility of managing the supply chain's inventory, but the retailer's observations of market signals are not transferred to him. In our third setting, reminiscent of collaborative forecasting and replenishment partnerships, inventory is managed centrally, and all demand related information is shared. We propose a set of stylized models to study the three settings and use them to provide managerial insights into the value of information sharing, VMI, and collaborative forecasting.

Title: Heuristic Methods for Centralized Control of One-Warehouse, N-Retailer Inventory Systems
Abstract: This paper considers a periodic-review, two-echelon inventory system with one central warehouse and several retailers facing stochastic demand. The retailers replenish their stock from the warehouse, which in turn places orders at an outside supplier with infinite capacity. Transportation times and costs are constant. No ordering costs are considered, but warehouse replenishments must be multiples of a given batch quantity. The objective is to find policies that minimize holding and backorder costs. The standard approach to approximately solve this problem is to use a "balance" assumption, meaning that negative stock allocations to the retailers are possible. This approach may lead to considerable errors for problems with large differences between the retailers in terms of service requirements and demand characteristics. To handle such situations we suggest and evaluate two computationally tractable heuristics: the Virtual Assignment ordering rule for warehouse replenishments and the Two-step Allocation rule for allocating stock from the warehouse to the retailers. Numerical evidence shows that, especially when combining these heuristics, we obtain considerable improvements for many problems over the standard approach. Savings of up to 50% have been recorded.

Title: On the Complementary Value of Accurate Demand Information and Production and Supplier Flexibility
Abstract: We study the value of information, production flexibility, and supplier flexibility for a good for which an initial and a subsequent order may be placed. We consider a Bayesian model of demand in which the unknown mean demand rate is assumed to have a prior, which is a mixture of two normal distributions corresponding to the demand forecast for an innovative (fashion) good. We develop three models of production flexibility: a static model requiring initial placement of both orders, a partially dynamic model requiring a fixing of the time that the second order will be made, and a fully dynamic model with no restrictions on ordering. Supplier flexibility is modeled through supply lead times. We observe that the magnitude of the savings from the static to the fully flexible model, corresponding to the sum of the values of information and production flexibility, reflects all sources of variability: differences between demand means of the prior mixture, variability within each prior, and variability about the observed mean. We observe that as the difference between high and low demand cases increases, the value of information increases, though for long lead times, production flexibility is required to take advantage of the updated information. Further, we observe that the greater the uncertainty within each prior distribution, the greater the value of information relative to the value of production flexibility, particularly for long lead times. However, the greater the uncertainty around the mean demand, which is the uncertainty that cannot be resolved through observation, the lower the value of information. Finally, we observe that the value of supply flexibility grows initially in a concave then convex manner as a function of the supply lead times.

Title: Inventory-Service Optimization in Configure-to-Order Systems
Abstract: This study is motivated by a process-reengineering problem in personal computer (PC) manufacturing, i.e., to move from a build-to-stock operation that is centered around end-product inventory towards a configure-to-order (CTO) operation that eliminates endproduct inventory. In fact, CTO has made irrelevant the notion of preconfigured machine types and focuses instead on maintaining the right amount of inventory at the components. CTO appears to be the ideal operational model that provides both mass customization and a quick response time to order fulfillment. To quantify the inventory-service trade-off in the CTO environment, we develop a nonlinear optimization model with multiple constraints, reflecting the service levels offered to different market segments. To solve the optimization problem, we develop an exact algorithm for the important case of demand in each market segment having (at least) one unique component, and a greedy heuristic for the general (nonunique component) case. Furthermore, we show how to use sensitivity analysis, along with simulation, to fine-tune the solutions. The performance of the model and the solution approach is examined by extensive numerical studies on realistic problem data. We present the major findings in applying our model to study the inventory-service impacts in the reengineering of a PC manufacturing process.

Title: Optimal and Hierarchical Controls in Dynamic Stochastic Manufacturing Systems: A Survey
Abstract: Most manufacturing systems are large and complex and operate in an uncertain environment. One approach to managing such systems is that of hierarchical decomposition. This paper reviews the research devoted to proving that a hierarchy based on the frequencies of occurrence of different types of events in the systems results in decisions that are asymptotically optimal as the rates of some events become large compared to those of others. The paper also reviews the research on stochastic optimal control problems associated with manufacturing systems, their dynamic programming equations, existence of solutions of these equations, and verification theorems of optimality for the systems. Manufacturing systems that are addressed include single-machine systems, dynamic flowshops, and dynamic jobshops producing multiple products. These systems may also incorporate random production capacity and demands, and decisions such as production rates, capacity expansion, and promotional campaigns. Related computational results and areas of applications are also presented. A more detailed survey is available at www.utdallas.edu/~sethi/ITORMS/index.html.

Title: Coordination and Flexibility in Supply Contracts with Options
Abstract: We investigate the role of options (contingent claims) in a buyer-supplier system. Specifically using a two-period model with correlated demand, we illustrate how options provide flexibility to a buyer to respond to market changes in the second period. We also study the implications of such arrangements between a buyer and a supplier for coordination of the channel. We show that, in general, channel coordination can be achieved only if we allow the exercise price to be piecewise linear. We develop sufficient conditions on the cost parameters such that linear prices coordinate the channel. We derive the appropriate prices for channel coordination which, however, violate the individual rationality constraint for the supplier. Contrary to popular belief (based on simpler models) we show that credit for returns offered by the supplier does not always coordinate the channel and alleviate the individual rationality constraint. Credit for returns are useful only on a subset of the feasibility region under which channel coordination is achievable with linear prices. Finally, we demonstrate (numerically) the benefits of options in improving channel performance and evaluate the magnitude of loss due to lack of coordination.

Title: Designing a Call Center with Impatient Customers
Abstract: The most common model to support workforce management of telephone call centers is the M/M/N/B model, in particular its special cases M/M/N (Erlang C, which models out busy signals) and M/M/N/N (Erlang B, disallowing waiting). All of these models lack a central prevalent feature, namely, that impatient customers might decide to leave (abandon) before their service begins. In this paper, we analyze the simplest abandonment model, in which customers' patience is exponentially distributed and the system's waiting capacity is unlimited (M/M/N + M). Such a model is both rich and analyzable enough to provide information that is practically important for call-center managers. We first outline a method for exact analysis of the M/M/N + M model, that while numerically tractable is not very insightful. We then proceed with an asymptotic analysis of the M/M/N + M model, in a regime that is appropriate for large call centers (many agents, high efficiency, high service level). Guided by the asymptotic behavior, we derive approximations for performance measures and propose "rules of thumb" for the design of large call centers. We thus add support to the growing acknowledgment that insights from diffusion approximations are directly applicable to management practice.

Title: The Supply Chain Impact of Smart Customers in a Promotional Environment
Abstract: Increasing product variety through the use of alternate package sizes is a commonly observed mechanism in the grocery industry. Under such a scheme, however, the response to pricing decisions for each of the different package sizes is affected by how customers make demand choices. We build a demand model in which customers react smart to retail promotions through stockpiling and package size switching. The demand model combines a customer choice model with a model in which customers differ in their stockpiling and reservation price levels. We utilize data from the German grocery industry for an empirical fitting of the model. We then develop a store-level inventory model for each SKU and optimize price promotions to maximize expected profit. We show the benefit of capturing the smart customer response to price promotions by demonstrating its impact on the reduced inventory costs. We use the model to generate a number of managerial implications of the model for the German grocery environment.

Title: Coordinating Replenishment and Pricing in a Firm
Abstract: Replenishment and pricing strategies are traditionally determined by entirely separate units of a firm, the former by production and the latter by marketing. In a large organization production and marketing are traditionally measured in terms of performance criteria appropriate and relevant within the world in which they operate, rather than in terms of overall company performance. We consider a situation where the headquarters uses a simple linear transfer price between the two functions to govern the transactions. The misaligned incentives among these functional managers are caused by a transfer price between them that distorts the marginal production cost and revenue, as well as by a misallocation of cost: Marketing's pricing strategy influences expected leftover inventory, but only production incurs the cost. The misalignment can be mitigated through the following two ways. First, if production commits to a service level instead of an inventory level, both production and marketing, and hence the firm as a whole, are better off. Second, the same improvement can be achieved through organizational changes so that marketing becomes the dominant function. We also propose a mechanism that aligns the functional managers' incentives to be compatible to the firm.

Title: Performance Analysis of Split-Case Sorting Systems
Abstract: Split-case sorting systems are used in many retail supply chains where items must be distributed in less-than-case quantities, such as orders shipped directly to customers by catalogers and e-tailers or shipments made in less-than-case quantities from a distribution center to a retail store. These systems are particularly effective in order-packing systems where the same item is needed for multiple orders. Items are inducted into a circular sorting conveyor system one unit at a time and then delivered to an order-packing bin designated for a particular customer or retail store. We develop analytical performance models that incorporate the stochastic operating conditions faced by these systems. Our model allows system designers to predict the sorting capacity for different system configurations. More importantly, we use the model to develop insight into the system design and operation.

Title: Multilocation Combined Pricing and Inventory Control
Abstract: We consider the problem of managing inventories and dynamically adjusting retailer prices in distribution systems with geographically dispersed retailers. More specifically, we analyze the following single item, periodic review model. The distribution of demand in each period, at a given retailer, depends on the item's price according to a stochastic demand function. These stochastic demand functions may vary by retailer and by period. The replenishment process consists of two phases: In some or all periods, a distribution center may place an order with an outside supplier. This order arrives at the distribution center after an order leadtime and is then, in the second phase, allocated to the retailers. Allocations arrive after a second allocation leadtime. We develop an approximate model that is tractable and in which an optimal policy of simple structure exists. The approximate model thus provides analytically computable approximations for systemwide profits and other performance measures. Moreover, the approximate model allows us to prove how various components of the optimal strategy (i.e., prices and order-up-to levels) respond to shifts in the model parameters, e.g., to shifts in the retailers' demand functions. In addition, we develop combined pricing, ordering, and allocation strategies and show that the system's performance under these strategies is well gauged by the above approximations. We use this model to assess the impact of different types of geographic dispersion on systems with dynamically varying prices and how different system parameters (e.g., leadtimes, coefficients of variation of individual retailers' demand, price elasticities) contribute to this impact. Similarly, we use the model to gauge the benefits of coordinated replenishments under dynamic pricing, and how these benefits increase as the allocation decisions of the systemwide orders to individual retailers are postponed to a later point in the overall replenishment leadtime. We report on a comprehensive numerical study based on data obtained from a nationwide department store chain.

Title: On Throughput Maximization in Constant Travel-Time Robotic Cells
Abstract: We consider the problem of scheduling operations in bufferless robotic cells that produce identical parts. The objective is to find a cyclic sequence of robot moves that minimizes the long-run average time to produce a part or, equivalently, maximizes the throughput rate. The robot can be moved in simple cycles that produce one unit or, in more complicated cycles, that produce multiple units. Because one-unit cycles are the easiest to understand, implement, and control, they are widely used in industry. We analyze one-unit cycles for a class of robotic cells called constant travel-time robotic cells. We complete a structural analysis of the class of one-unit cycles and obtain a polynomial time algorithm for finding an optimal one-unit cycle. Constant travel-time robotic cells are used in real manufacturing operations that the authors have encountered during their interactions with companies. The results and the analysis in this paper offer practitioners (i) a tool to experiment with and study the design of a proposed robotic cell during a prototyping exercise, (ii) a lower bound on the throughput of a robotic cell to help them make an informed assessment of the ultimate productivity level, and (iii) a benchmark throughput level (for comparison purposes) for robotic cells whose operations differ slightly from those discussed in this paper.

Title: Newsvendor Networks: Inventory Management and Capacity Investment with Discretionary Activities
Abstract: We introduce a class of models, called newsvendor networks, that allow for multiple products and multiple processing and storage points and investigate how their single-period properties extend to dynamic settings. Such models provide a parsimonious framework to study various problems of stochastic capacity investment and inventory management, including assembly, commonality, distribution, flexibility, substitution and transshipment. Newsvendor networks are stochastic models with recourse that are characterized by linear revenue and cost structures and a linear input-output transformation. While capacity and inventory decisions are locked in before uncertainty is resolved, some managerial discretion remains via ex-post input-output activity decisions. Ex-post decisions involve both the choice of activities and their levels and can result in subtle benefits. This discretion in choice is captured through alternate or nonbasic activities that can redeploy inputs and resources to best respond to resolved uncertain events. Nonbasic activities are never used in a deterministic environment; their value stems from discretionary flexibility to meet stochastic demand deviations from the operating point. The optimal capacity and inventory decisions balance overages with underages. Continuing the classic newsvendor analogy, the optimal balancing conditions can be interpreted as specifying multiple critical fractiles of the multivariate demand distribution; they also suggest appropriate measures for and trade-offs between product service levels. This paper shows that the properties of optimal newsvendor network solutions extend to a dynamic setting under plausible conditions. Indeed, we establish dynamic optimality of inventory and capacity policies for the lost sales case. Depending on the nonbasic activities, this also extends to the backordering case. Analytic- and simulation-based solution techniques and graphical interpretations are presented and illustrated by a comprehensive example that features discretionary input commonality and a flexible processing resource.

Title: Analysis of a Decentralized Production-Inventory System
Abstract: We model an isolated portion of a competitive supply chain as a M/M/1 make-to-stock queue. The retailer carries finished goods inventory to service a Poisson demand process, and specifies a policy for replenishing his inventory from an upstream supplier. The supplier chooses the service rate, i.e., the capacity of his manufacturing facility, which behaves as a single-server queue with exponential service times. Demand is backlogged and both agents share the backorder cost. In addition, a linear inventory holding cost is charged to the retailer, and a linear cost for building production capacity is incurred by the supplier. The inventory level, demand rate, and cost parameters are common knowledge to both agents. Under the continuous-state approximation where the M/M/1 queue has an exponential rather than geometric steady-state distribution, we characterize the optimal centralized and Nash solutions, and show that a contract with linear transfer payments replicates a cost-sharing agreement and coordinates the system. We also compare the total system costs, the agents' decision variables, and the customer service levels of the centralized versus Nash versus Stackelberg solutions.

Title: Product Differentiation and Capacity Cost Interaction in Time and Price Sensitive Markets
Abstract: In this paper, we study a profit-maximizing firm selling two substitutable products in a price and time sensitive market. The products differ only in their prices and delivery times. We assume that there are dedicated capacities for each product and that there is a standard industry delivery time for the regular (slower) product. The objective of the firm is to determine the delivery time of the express (faster) product and appropriately price the two products, taking into consideration the impact of delivery time reduction on capacity requirements and costs. We develop a model that integrates pricing and delivery time decisions with capacity requirements and costs, and study scenarios where the firm is constrained in capacity for none, one, or both product(s). We show how product differentiation decisions are influenced by capacity costs, and how the firm should adapt its differentiation strategy in response to a change in its operating dynamics. We first identify a market characteristic that governs the optimal pricing structure. We then show that the degree of product differentiation depends on both the absolute, as well as the relative values of the capacity costs. Provided that the capacity cost differential remains the same, higher capacity costs induce less time differentiation and less price differentiation. An increase in capacity cost differential increases price differentiation, but decreases time differentiation. The optimal prices depend, in addition to the above, on the market characteristic. We find that prices can actually decrease when the firm incurs capacity-related costs. We also explore the impact of substitutability on product differentiation, and illustrate our results in a numerical study.

Title: Properties of the Periodic Review (R, T) Inventory Control Policy for Stationary, Stochastic Demand
Abstract: This paper compares the commonly used periodic review, replenishment interval, order-up-to (R, T ) policy to the continuous review, reorder point, order quantity, (Q, r) model. We show that long-run average cost function for the single-product (R, T ) policy has a structure similar to that of the (Q, r) model. Consequently, many of the useful properties of the latter model are applicable. In particular, the optimal cost is insensitive to the choice of the replenishment interval, T, provided the optimal order-up-to level, R, corresponding to T is used. For instance, a suboptimal T obtained from a deterministic analysis increases costs by no more than 6.125%. For continuous demand, we analytically prove that use of a (R, T)policy instead of the optimal policy increases costs by at most 41.42% in the worst case. Computational experiments on Poisson demand demonstrate that the average-case relative error of using a (R,T)policy is under 7.5%. This relative error is lower when the demand rate and leadtime are high and the fixed order costs are either very low or very high. When coordination of order placement epochs is desirable, the (R,T) policy may sometimes be preferred to the (Q, r) policy. In this context, we illustrate application of our single-product results to more complex systems. In particular, we show that a simple power-of-two, (R,T) based heuristic for the stochastic multiproduct joint replenishment problem has a worst-case performance guarantee of 1.5. A similar result is explored for a special case of a two-echelon serial inventory system

Title: Telephone Call Centers: Tutorial, Review, and Research Prospects
Abstract: Telephone call centers are an integral part of many businesses, and their economic role is significant and growing. They are also fascinating sociotechnical systems in which the behavior of customers and employees is closely intertwined with physical performance measures. In these environments traditional operational models are of great value---and at the same time fundamentally limited---in their ability to characterize system performance. We review the state of research on telephone call centers. We begin with a tutorial on how call centers function and proceed to survey academic research devoted to the management of their operations. We then outline important problems that have not been addressed and identify promising directions for future research.

Title: Managing Variety for Assembled Products: Modeling Component Systems Sharing
Abstract: Component sharingusing the same version of a component across multiple productsis an approach adopted by many assembled-product manufacturers to achieve high final product variety with lower component variety and cost. This paper presents a methodology for determining which versions of a set of related components should be offered to optimally support a defined finished product portfolio. We develop optimization models that determine which versions of each component should be introduced and which of these versions each product should use to minimize design and production costs. This approach is appropriate for components with a relatively low impact on consumers perceptions about product differentiation, which can be shared across a set of products if they meet the most stringent performance requirements in the set. We illustrate our procedure on automotive braking systems, but also discuss its applicability to other components and industries. We identify three conceptually different organizational approaches to component sharing: a coordinated projects approach that requires higher-level organizational echelons above the individual project, a project-by-project approach that does not, and a hybrid partially coordinated approach. We use our model to examine how the gain from the coordinated projects approach relative to the project-by-project approach varies with the number of component versions in consideration, warranty costs, complexity costs, and demand variability. Further, we use our model to highlight the risk of using simplistic heuristics to determine design sequence within a component system in a partially coordinated approach.

Title: Optimal Replenishment Policies for Multiechelon Inventory Problems Under Advance Demand Information
Abstract: Customers and downstream supply chain partners often place, or can be induced to place, orders in advance of future requirements. We show how to optimally incorporate advance demand information into periodic-review, multiechelon, inventory systems in series. While the state space for series systems appears to be formidably large, we decompose the problem across locations, as in Clark and Scarf (1960), and reduce the state space at each location by using modified echelon inventory positions (that nets known requirements). We prove the optimality of state-dependent, echelon base-stock policies for finite and infinite horizon problems. We also show that myopic policies are optimal and very easy to compute when costs and demands are stationary. We provide managerial insights into the value of advance demand information through a numerical study.

Title: On the Interface Between Operations and Human Resources Management
Abstract: Operations management (OM) and human resources management (HRM) historically have been very separate fields. In practice, operations managers and human resource managers interact primarily on administrative issues regarding payroll and other matters. In academia, the two subjects are studied by separate communities of scholars publishing in disjoint sets of journals, drawing on mostly separate disciplinary foundations. Yet, operations and human resources are intimately related at a fundamental level. Operations are the context that often explains or moderates the effects of human resource activities such as pay, training, communications, and staffing. Human responses to OM systems often explain variations or anomalies that would otherwise be treated as randomness or error variance in traditional operations research models. In this paper, we probe the interface between operations and human resources by examining how human considerations affect classical OM results and how operational considerations affect classical HRM results. We then propose a unifying framework for identifying new research opportunities at the intersection of the two fields.

Title: An Overview of Pricing Models for Revenue Management
Abstract: In this paper, we examine the research and results of dynamic pricing policies and their relation to revenue management. The survey is based on a generic revenue management problem in which a perishable and nonrenewable set of resources satisfy stochastic price sensitive demand processes over a finite period of time. In this class of problems, the owner (or the seller) of these resources uses them to produce and offer a menu of final products to the end customers. Within this context, we formulate the stochastic control problem of capacity that the seller faces: How to dynamically set the menu and the quantity of products and their corresponding prices to maximize the total revenue over the selling horizon.

Title: The Effectiveness of Several Performance Bounds for Capacitated Production, Partial-Order-Service, Assemble-to-Order Systems
Abstract: We consider an assemble-to-order (ATO) system: Components are made to stock by production facilities with finite capacities, and final products are assembled only in response to customers' orders. The key performance measures in this system, such as order fill rates, involve evaluation of multivariate probability distributions, which is computationally demanding if not intractable. The purpose of this paper is to develop computationally efficient performance estimates. We examine several ideas scattered in diverse literatures on approximations for multivariate probability distributions, and determine which approach is most effective in the ATO application. To do so, we first tailor different approximation ideas to the ATO setting to derive performance bounds, and then compare these bounds theoretically and numerically. The bounds also allow us to make connections between capacitated and uncapacitated ATO systems and gain various insights.

Title: Capacity Games in Assembly Systems with Uncertain Demand
Abstract: An assembler needs sets of components, each produced by a different supplier. To produce the components and assemble the final product, the firms involved need to construct their individual production capacities before observing the actual demand. The firms have an incentive scheme (contract) to induce a "proper" capacity build-up. The key parameters of the contract are the set of transfer prices the assembler pays each supplier for a unit of its component. We consider two game settings as to how the terms of the contract are determined. The first is one where the assembler sets the prices, and the second is for the suppliers to simultaneously select the prices each wants to charge for its component. We first characterize the optimal capacity decision when the system is centralized, and then derive the decentralized equilibrium capacities under each of the two game settings. We show that the decentralized channel performances depend heavily on system structure/parameters. In particular, under the first setting, the performance improves as the assembler's share of the systemwide capacity cost increases and it is not affected by the number of suppliers in the system, while under the second setting, the performance degrades both in the assembler's share of capacity cost and in the number of suppliers. We show that the first setting dominates the second in terms of system performance if and only if the assembler's share of capacity cost is larger than the reciprocal of the number of firms involved.

Title: Commissioned Paper: Capacity Management, Investment, and Hedging: Review and Recent Developments
Abstract: This paper reviews the literature on strategic capacity management concerned with determining the sizes, types, and timing of capacity investments and adjustments under uncertainty. Specific attention is given to recent developments to incorporate multiple decision makers, multiple capacity types, hedging, and risk aversion. Capacity is a measure of processing abilities and limitations and is represented as a vector of stocks of various processing resources, while investment is the change of capacity and includes expansion and contraction. After discussing general issues in capacity investment problems, the paper reviews models of capacity investment under uncertainty in three settings: The first reviews optimal capacity investment by single and multiple risk-neutral decision makers in a stationary environment where capacity remains constant. Allowing for multiple capacity types, the associated optimal capacity portfolio specifies the amounts and locations of safety capacity in a processing network. Its key feature is that it is unbalanced; i.e., regardless of how uncertainties are realized, one typically will never fully utilize all capacities. The second setting reviews the adjustment of capacity over time and the structure of optimal investment dynamics. The paper ends by reviewing how to incorporate risk aversion in capacity investment and contrasts hedging strategies involving financial versus operational means.

Title: Matching Demand and Supply to Maximize Profits from Remanufacturing
Abstract: The profitability of remanufacturing depends on the quantity and quality of product returns and on the demand for remanufactured products. The quantity and quality of product returns can be influenced by varying quality-dependent acquisition prices, i.e., by using product acquisition management. Demand can be influenced by varying the selling price. We develop a simple framework for determining the optimal prices and the corresponding profitability. We motivate and illustrate our framework using an application from the cellular telephone industry.

Title: Capacity Investments in Supply Chains: Sharing the Gain Rather Than Sharing the Pain
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate price-only contracts in supply chain capacity procurement games. For a two-party supply chain, comprising a manufacturer and a supplier that both invest in capacity, we prove the existence of a class of coordinating price-only contracts that arbitrarily allocate the supply chain profit. Moreover, if the supplier's reservation profit is below a certain threshold, the manufacturer's optimal contract is a quantity-premium price-only schedule, that is, the average wholesale price per unit increases in the order size. We prove that the manufacturer prefers simple piecewise-linear quantity-premium contracts to linear contracts and show numerically that such contracts are highly efficient. We extend our results for piecewise-linear price schedules to N-supplier assembly systems. We also enrich the voluntary compliance regime of Cachon and Lariviere (2001). With this enrichment, we prove that share-the-pain contracts, such as firm commitment and options contracts, increase supplier capacity in the full information case, a result that contrasts with that of Cachon and Lariviere. Finally, we investigate when a manufacturer prefers single-breakpoint quantity premiums to firm commitments.

Title: Interactive Multicriteria Optimization for Multiple-Response Product and Process Design
Abstract: We consider product and process design problems (hereafter collectively called process design problems) that address issues associated with the assessment of optimum levels for process inputs that influence multiple-process performance measures. While this problem context encompasses many possible applications, we focus primarily on multiple-response design problems that have been widely studied in the quality improvement and quality management literature. For such problems, several optimization criteria have been proposed, including maximization of process yield, maximization of process capability, minimization of process costs, etc. In this research, we propose a method that accounts for many of these criteria via a procedure that interacts with and relies on the preferences of a decision maker (DM). The interactive procedure evolves from the convergence of three areas of research: notably, the research in multiple-response design, the research in multicriteria optimization, and recent developments in global optimization. The proposed interactive method is illustrated and comparatively assessed via two well-known problems in multiple-response design. Although the interactive procedure is developed for application in multiple-response design, it is not limited to this problem context. The concepts and methods developed in this research have applicability to problems that can be characterized by process inputs and process performance, such as supply chain management and multidisciplinary design optimization.

Title: Price-Directed Replenishment of Subsets: Methodology and Its Application to Inventory Routing
Abstract: The idea of price-directed control is to use an operating policy that exploits optimal dual prices from a mathematical programming relaxation of the underlying control problem. We apply it to the problem of replenishing inventory to subsets of products/locations, such as in the distribution of industrial gases, so as to minimize long-run time average replenishment costs. Given a marginal value for each product/location, whenever there is a stockout the dispatcher compares the total value of each feasible replenishment with its cost, and chooses one that maximizes the surplus. We derive this operating policy using a linear functional approximation to the optimal value function of a semi-Markov decision process on continuous spaces. This approximation also leads to a math program whose optimal dual prices yield values and whose optimal objective value gives a lower bound on system performance. We use duality theory to show that optimal prices satisfy several structural properties and can be interpreted as estimates of lowest achievable marginal costs. On real-world instances, the price-directed policy achieves superior, near optimal performance as compared with other approaches.

Title: Airline Schedule Planning: Accomplishments and Opportunities
Abstract: Plagued by high labor costs, low profitability margins, airspace and airport congestion, high capital and operating costs, security and safety concerns, and complex and large-scale management and operations decisions, the airline industry has armed its planners with sophisticated optimization tools to improve decision making and increase airline profits. In this paper, we describe optimization approaches for airline schedule planning, demonstrating how optimization can facilitate the management of a diverse and finite set of expensive, highly constrained resources. We focus on the art and science of modeling and solving these problems, providing illustrative examples of the associated impacts and challenges, and highlighting effective techniques that might be applicable to problems arising in other industries.

Title: Strategically Seeking Service: How Competition Can Generate Poisson Arrivals
Abstract: We consider a simple game in which strategic agents select arrival times to a service facility. Agents find congestion costly and, hence, try to arrive when the system is underutilized. Working in discrete time, we characterize pure-strategy Nash equilibria for the case of ample service capacity. In this case, agents try to spread themselves out as much as possible and their self-interested actions will lead to a socially optimal outcome if all agents have the same well-behaved delay cost function. For even modest sized problems, the set of possible pure-strategy Nash equilibria is quite large, making implementation potentially cumbersome. We consequently examine mixed-strategy Nash equilibria and show that there is a unique symmetric Nash equilibrium. Not only is this equilibrium independent of the number of agents and their individual delay cost functions, the arrival pattern it generates approaches a discrete-time Poisson process as the number of agents and arrival points gets large. Our results extend to the case of time varying preferences. With an appropriate initialization, the results also extend to a system with limited capacity. Our model lends support to the traditional literature on managing service systems. This work has generally ignored customers strategically choosing arrival times. Rather it is commonly assumed that customers seek service according to some well-behaved process (e.g., that interarrival times follow a renewal process). We show that assuming Poisson arrivals is an acceptable assumption even with strategic customers if the population is large and the horizon is long.

Title: Fill Rates of Single-Stage and Multistage Supply Systems
Abstract: A supply system's fill rate is the fraction of demand that is met from on-hand inventory. This paper presents formulas for the fill rate of periodic review supply systems that use base-stock-level policies. The first part of the paper contains fill-rate formulas for a single-stage system and general distributions of demand. When demand is normally distributed, an exact expression uses only the standard normal distribution and density functions, and a good approximation uses only the standard normal distribution function. The second part of the paper derives the probability distribution of the finished goods inventory level for serial systems with buffer inventories between stages. This distribution leads to fill-rate formulas and the conclusion that shorter supply chains have higher fill rates.

Title: On Measuring Supplier Performance Under Vendor-Managed-Inventory Programs in Capacitated Supply Chains
Abstract: As widely accepted performance measures in supply chain management practice, frequency-based service levels such as fill rate and stockout rate are often considered in supply contracts under vendor-managed-inventory (VMI) programs. Using a decentralized two-party capacitated supply chain model consisting of one manufacturer and one supplier in a VMI environment, we demonstrate that supplier's service level is in general insufficient for the manufacturer to warrant the desired service level at the customer end. The method by which the supplier achieves her service level to the manufacturer also affects customer service level. By developing bounds on the customer service level, we show that the expected backorders at the supplier should also be taken into account. We suggest a supply contract that offers a menu of different combinations of supplier's service level and expected backorders according to a linear function. Under this contract, the manufacturer can control the end customer service regardless of how the supplier manages her inventory. The supplier has complete flexibility on which combination of the two quantities on the menu to choose according to her own cost functions. Because it does not require any detailed information on supplier's operational characteristics nor her costs, this kind of contract is expected to be easily implementable. In addition, we derive an estimate of the customer service level in terms of the new measures. Our findings have direct implications to supply chain metrics in general: The local service levels are insufficient measures to guarantee the system wide performance. Alternative local measures and/or coordination mechanisms should be employed to achieve desired system performance. Our analysis illustrates a possible way to explore such alternative measures.

Title: The Dynamic Pricing Problem from a Newsvendor's Perspective
Abstract: The dynamic pricing problem concerns the determination of selling prices over time for a product whose demand is random and whose supply is fixed. We approach this problem in a novel way by formulating a dynamic optimization model in which the demand function is isoelastic but the random demand process is quite general. Ultimately, what we find is a strong parallel between the dynamic pricing problem and dynamic inventory models. This parallel leads to a reinterpretation of the dynamic pricing problem as a price-setting newsvendor problem with recourse, which is useful not only because it yields insights into the optimal solution, but also because it leads to additional insights into how pricing recourse affects the actions and profits of a price-setting newsvendor. We make contributions in three areas: First, we develop structural properties that define an optimal pricing strategy over a finite horizon and investigate how that policy impacts a newsvendor's optimal procurement policy and optimal expected profit. Second, we establish a practical and efficient algorithm for computing the optimal prices. Third, we examine how market parameters affect the optimal solution through a series of numerical experiments that utilize the algorithm.

Title: Organic Production Systems: What the Biological Cell Can Teach Us About Manufacturing
Abstract: Biological cells run complicated and sophisticated production systems. The study of the cell's production technology provides us with insights that are potentially useful in industrial manufacturing. When comparing cell metabolism with manufacturing techniques in industry, we find some striking commonalities, but also some important differences. Like today's well-run factories, the cell operates a very lean production system, assures quality at the source, and uses component commonality to simplify production. While we can certainly learn from how the cell accomplishes these parallels, it is even more interesting to look at how the cell operates differently. In biological cells, all products and machines are built from a small set of common building blocks that circulate in local recycling loops. Production equipment is added, removed, or renewed instantly when needed. The cell's manufacturing unit is highly autonomous and reacts quickly to a wide range of changes in the local environment. Although this "organic production system" is very different from existing manufacturing systems, some of its principles are applicable to manufacturing, and indeed, a few can even be seen emerging today. Thus, the organic production system can be viewed as a possible scenario for the future of manufacturing.

Title: To Pull or Not to Pull: What Is the Question?
Abstract: The terms pull and lean production have become cornerstones of modern manufacturing practice. However, although they are widely used, they are less widely understood. In this paper, we argue that while the academic literature has steadily revealed the richness of the pull/lean concepts, the practitioner literature has progressively simplified these terms to the point that serious misunderstandings now exist. In hopes of reducing confusion, we offer general, but precise definitions of pull and lean. Specifically, we argue that pull is essentially a mechanism for limiting WIP, and lean is fundamentally about minimizing the cost of buffering variability.

Title: How a Base Stock Policy Using "Stale" Forecasts Provides Supply Chain Benefits
Abstract: Managers often engage in forecast updating with the expectation that forecast updating reduces expected shortage and inventory costs. One undesirable effect of forecast updating is that it may lead to the bullwhip effect, a phenomenon where the variability of demand increases as one moves up the supply chain. The bullwhip effect can be undesirable for the supplier because more volatile orders from the downstream stage can be very costly to the supplier. It can make it more difficult for the supplier to forecast demand, and it can lead to large fluctuations in supplier production levels from period to period. Using "stale" or old forecasts may sound foolish, but their judicious use in a two-stage supply chain can improve fulfillment from the upstream stage to the downstream stage and reduce the fluctuations in production levels. We study a two-stage supply chain where the demand process is nonstationary and both stages use an adaptive base stock policy. We propose a policy that uses old forecasts to set base stock levels at the downstream stage while using current forecasts to communicate upcoming orders from the downstream stage to the upstream stage. We study a decentralized supply chain setting, and we find that our policy can reduce the expected supply chain inventory and shortage costs and significantly reduce the fluctuations in production levels compared to that of using current information. We also study a cooperative supply chain setting and, surprisingly, we find in numerical examples that our proposed policy results in very small increases in the expected systemwide inventory and shortage costs compared to a systemwide optimal policy, while reducing the fluctuations in production levels.

Title: Coordinating Supply Chains by Controlling Upstream Variability Propagation
Abstract: Effective distribution using collaborative fulfillment networks requires coordination among the multiple participating firms at different stages of the supply chain. Acting independently, supply chain partners fail to weigh the cost burden they impose on upstream suppliers when their replenishment order quantities vary from period to period. This paper explores a new approach to coordinate multiple stages in the supply chain by controlling, through appropriate downstream inventory management, the demand variability that is propagated to upstream stages. We propose and analyze a coordinated inventory replenishment policy that uses "order smoothing" to reduce order-size variability and thus reduce overall system costs, including both inventory and transportation costs. We characterize the optimal parameter values for smoothing alternatives (such as exponential smoothing and moving weighted average policies), assess their economic benefits, and develop insights regarding supply chain contexts that might benefit most significantly from reducing the variability of orders to upstream stages. Using the distribution network for specialty brand appliances as an illustrative example, we demonstrate the potential cost savings that order-smoothing strategies can yield compared to the uncoordinated case when individual firms separately minimize their costs. The magnitude of savings depends on several factors, including the variability in consumer demand, level of product variety, and degree of inventory aggregation in the distribution system. Based on our analytical results, we develop a framework to assess cost reduction opportunities through variability control for different supply chain scenarios.

Title: Effective Heuristics for Capacitated Production Planning with Multiperiod Production and Demand with Forecast Band Refinement
Abstract: In this paper we extend forecast band evolution and capacitated production modelling to the multiperiod demand case. In this model, forecasts of discrete demand for any period are modelled as bands and defined by lower and upper bounds on demand, such that future forecasts lie within the current band. We develop heuristics that utilize knowledge of demand forecast evolution to make production decisions in capacitated production planning environments. In our computational study we explore the efficiency of our heuristics, and also explore the impact of seasonality on demand and availability of information updates.

Title: Evolution of ARMA Demand in Supply Chains
Abstract: This paper shows that an ARMA demand generates an ARMA order history when ordering decisions are made based on an order-up-to policy. The order history preserves the autoregressive structure of the demand and transforms its moving average structure according to a simple algorithm. We apply this ARMA-in-ARMA-out property to examine the evolution of the demand signal in supply chains. Its practical implications are discussed in the context of quantifying the bullwhip effect, coordinating forecasting, and evaluating information sharing.

Title: Decision Technologies for Agribusiness Problems: A Brief Review of Selected Literature and a Call for Research
Abstract: The supply chain in the food and agribusiness sector is characterized by long supply lead times combined with significant supply and demand uncertainties, and relatively thin margins. These challenges generate a need for management efficiency and the use of modern decision technology tools. We review some of the literature on applications of decision technology tools for a selected set of agribusiness problems and conclude by outlining what we see as some of the significant new problems facing the industry. It is our hope that we will stimulate interest in these problems and encourage researchers to work on solving them.

Title: Production Planning Under Yield and Demand Uncertainty with Yield-Dependent Cost and Price
Abstract: This paper studies production planning with random yield and demand. It is a departure from previous studies of random yield in that it defines the sale price and the purchasing cost as exogenous and increasing with decreasing yield. While this behavior can be observed in various industries (e.g., citrus), the paper focuses on the olive oil industry as its application. Production of olive oil is a challenging business as olives grow every other year; thus, a risky investment is involved. A new practice among olive oil producers involves leasing farm space from farmers to grow olives. When the yield of olives is low (because of weather, disease, etc.), the oil producer gets a second chance to buy olives from other farmers at a unit cost varying with the yield. In this case, the sale price of olive oil increases in the market place because of the reduced supply. When the yield is high, the company uses some of its olives for olive oil production and some are salvaged. After olives are pressed and olive oil is produced, the company experiences an uncertain demand. The paper makes four contributions: First, it is shown that the objective function is concave in the amount of farm space leased, so that the first-order conditions provide the globally optimal solution. Second, it illustrates how the total production of olive oil changes with the yield. Third, it proves that the optimal amount of farm space leased decreases under the presence of a second (and reliable) source of supply. Finally, unlike traditional yield papers, the fourth result shows that increased yield variance does not necessarily increase the optimal amount of farm space to be leased when there is a second chance to obtain supplies.

Title: Controlling the Risk for an Agricultural Harvest
Abstract: Gathering the harvest represents a complex managerial problem for agricultural cooperatives involved in harvesting and processing operations: balancing the risk of overinvestment with the risk of underproduction. The rate to harvest crops and the corresponding capital investment are critical strategic decisions in situations where poor weather conditions present a risk of crop loss. In this article, we discuss a case study of the Concord grape harvest and develop a mathematical model to control harvest risk. The model involves differentiation of a joint probability distribution that represents risks associated with the length of the harvest season and the size of the crop. This approach is becoming popular as a means of dealing with complex problems involving operational and supply chain risk. Significant cost avoidance, in the millions of dollars, results from practical implementation of the Harvest Model. Using real data, we found that the Harvest Model provides lower-cost solutions in situations involving moderate variability in both the length of season and the crop size as compared to solutions based on imposed risk policies determined by management.

Title: Efficiency Analysis of Agricultural Market Advisory Services: A Nonlinear Mixed-Integer Programming Approach
Abstract: Professional market advisory services provide specific advice (advisory programs) to grain producers on how to market their commodities, and assist them in their efforts to manage price risk. Previous studies analyzed the effectiveness of individual services and could find only weak evidence that these services help farmers improve their returns beyond market prices. The present study applies portfolio theory to determine an efficient combination of advisory programs using a nonlinear integer programming framework. The optimization results provide some evidence that an efficient portfolio provides significantly greater risk and return benefits compared to individual programs and external benchmarks. In a holdout period analysis, efficient portfolios have superior average return performance, but they fail to dominate the relevant benchmarks in terms of mean and variance. However, these out-of-sample results should be considered cautiously, given the small number of observations available.

Title: Campaign Planning and Scheduling for Multiproduct Batch Operations with Applications to the Food-Processing Industry
Abstract: We analyze planning and scheduling of multiproduct batch operations in the food-processing industry. Such operations are encountered in many applications including manufacturing of sorbitol, modified starches, and specialty sugars. Unlike discrete manufacturing, batch sizes in these operations cannot be set arbitrarily, but are often determined by equipment size. Multiple batches of the same product are often run sequentially in campaigns to minimize setup and quality costs. We consider a multiproduct, single-stage, single-equipment batch-processing scheme and address the problem of determining the timing and duration of product campaigns to minimize average setup, quality, and inventory holding costs over a horizon. We formulate the deterministic, static version of this problem over an infinite horizon. We show that, in general, a feasible, finite, cyclic solution may not exist. We provide sufficient conditions for the existence of a finite cycle, use single-product problems to provide lower bounds on the costs for the multiproduct problem, and use them to test heuristics developed for this problem. Next, we modify this formulation to incorporate fixed cycles that may be necessary due to factors such as product obsolescence, perishability, or contracts with customers. We do this by allowing for disposal of excess stock so that finite cycles are always feasible, though they might not be optimal; we also develop bounds and heuristic solution procedures for this case. These methods are applied to data from a leading food-processing company. Our results suggest that our methods could potentially reduce total annual costs by about 7.7% translating to an annual savings of around $7 million.

Title: Process Management Instead of Operations Management
Abstract: In this article a challenge is provided to the operations management community to broaden our perspective from the traditional, functional one to the cross-functional (interdisciplinary) view of process management. At the same time, the challenge is to de-emphasize mathematical optimization and instead seek improvements through better representations of problems or situations of real interest to management. I believe that adoption of these suggestions will enhance the opportunities and reputation of our research and educational activities.

Title: Patient Choice in Kidney Allocation: The Role of the Queueing Discipline
Abstract: This paper develops and analyzes a queueing model to examine the role of patient choice on the high rate of organ refusals in the kidney transplant waiting system. The model is an M/M/1 queue with homogeneous patients and exponential reneging. Patients join the waiting system and organ transplants are reflected by the service process. In addition, unlike the standard M/M/1 model, each service instance is associated with a variable reward that reflects the quality of the transplant organ, and patients have the option to refuse an organ (service) offer if they expect future offers to be better. Under an assumption of perfect and complete information, it is demonstrated that the queueing discipline is a potent instrument that can be used to maximize social welfare. In particular, first-come-first-serve (FCFS) amplifies patients' desire to refuse offers of marginal quality, and generates excessive organ wastage. By contrast, last-come-first-serve (LCFS) contains the inefficiencies engendered by patient choice and achieves optimal organ utilization. A numerical example calibrated using data from the U.S. transplantation system demonstrates that the welfare improvements possible from a better control of patient choice are equivalent to a 25% increase in the supply of organs.

Title: New Product Introduction: Timing, Design, and Pricing
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the case when two profit-maximizing firms enter a new market with a competing product that has a finite (and known) life cycle. Both firms make design decisions simultaneously without information about the other firm's decisions. The order of entry is a function of the two firms' product design levels and design capabilities. The first firm entering the market sets a monopoly price for its product and enjoys a monopoly situation until the second firm enters the market. When the second firm enters the market, both firms simultaneously set (or reset) their product prices knowing the design of both products at that time (and we assume those prices are fixed for the remainder of the product's life). We develop a game-theoretic model that represents the new product introduction process and show that a subgame-perfect Nash equilibrium occurs under certain conditions defined by the expected product life span, product cost, development time, and customer preferences. Our model shows that product differentiation always arises at equilibrium due to the joint effects of resource utilization, price competition, and product life cycle. A critical parameter for our model is a product-specific index B that we define; we show how it can be easily calculated from existing data. We then use a numerical example to illustrate managerial implications for a new product development process when the product life span is finite. We show that the strategy of time-based competition is the natural result of firms' improving development capability, reducing product cost, and increasing customer preference. In other words, it is not wise for profit-maximizing firms to arbitrarily shorten product life cycle for the sake of competition, because all firms are worse off. Our results also indicate that the first entrant into the market does not necessarily earn the greatest profit, and that a firm with low-cost advantage or fast design capability might not choose to come to market first to maximize its profit in the product life cycle.

Title: Revenue Management of Flexible Products
Abstract: A flexible product is a menu of two or more alternative, typically substitute, products offered by a constrained supplier using a sales or booking process. The supplier reserves the right to assign customers who purchase a flexible product to one of the alternatives at a time near the end of the booking process. An example would be an airline offering a morning flight consisting of specific flights serving the same market. Flexible products are currently offered by a number of industries including air cargo, tour operators, and Internet advertising. Flexible products have the advantage of increasing overall demand and enabling better capacity utilization at the cost of potentially cannibalizing high-fare demand for specific products. This paper introduces the concept of flexible products and derives conditions and algorithms for the management of a single flexible product consisting of two specific products. We use numerical simulation to illustrate the benefits from offering flexible products and discuss extension of the approach to more general settings.

Title: Value Creation in Service Delivery: Relating Market Segmentation, Incentives, and Operational Performance
Abstract: This paper studies service-delivery design in settings where firms engage in value-creation activities that have the objective of generating additional revenue from customer interactions. The paper provides a general modelling framework to analyze the ties between market segmentation decisions, incentives, and process performance in such service-delivery systems. The firm is modelled as a single-server queue, in a principal-agent framework. Customers have different value-generation potentials whose realizations are observed by the server but not by the manager of the firm. The manager determines a market segmentation scheme given an overall customer value-generation profile, which divides customers into two groups (high and low), and also determines a service level for each segment. The server decides which of the two available service levels (high and low) to provide for each customer, given a compensation scheme offered by the manager. The optimal market segmentation decision, optimal service-level choice, and a set of optimal linear incentive contracts that enable their implementation are characterized. The robustness of these strategies is explored with respect to model parameters and assumptions. It is shown that a market segmentation scheme that combines revenue generation concerns with their process implications is essential for success. Characteristics of appropriate incentive schemes are identified.

Title: The Cost Effects of Component Commonality: A Literature Review Through a Management-Accounting Lens
Abstract: In this paper I review the component commonality literature through a management-accounting lens, focusing on the cost effects of an increase in the use of the same version of a component across multiple products. The bulk of this literature is of a theoretical nature, for example, analytical models, programming models, or conjectures based on casual observations of practice. Some of this literature purports, especially in introductions to the topic, that cost generally decreases with increasing commonality. However, based on a review of the theoretical literature using an activity-based costing framework and distinguishing between cost-driver and cost-rate effects, I conclude that the cost picture is more subtle. In other words, it is too early to make any general statement about the effect of increasing commonality on total costs. Moving to the limited empirical literature on the topic, consisting of case studies (sometimes combined with simulation) and empirical research on larger data sets, the conclusion that there is even more room for future research becomes evident.

Title: Evaluating Operations Management--Related Journals via the Author Affiliation Index
Abstract: We evaluate operations management--related journals based on a novel indicator of journal quality---the Author Affiliation Index (AAI). We explain the basic rationale behind the AAI, as well as its advantages and disadvantages with respect to other such indicators of journal quality. We provide a specific recipe for its calculation and apply it to 27 journals in which researchers in the field of operations management might wish to publish. We compare the resulting journal rankings to those from published survey reports and citation analyses and test AAI for sensitivity to its inputs. We find the rankings from AAI to be consistent with other studies and to be robust with respect to changes in inputs.

Title: A Method for Staffing Large Call Centers Based on Stochastic Fluid Models
Abstract: We consider a call center model with m input flows and r pools of agents; the m-vector \lambda  of instantaneous arrival rates is allowed to be time dependent and to vary stochastically. Seeking to optimize the trade-off between personnel costs and abandonment penalties, we develop and illustrate a practical method for sizing the r agent pools. Using stochastic fluid models, this method reduces the staffing problem to a multidimensional newsvendor problem, which can be solved numerically by a combination of linear programming and Monte Carlo simulation. Numerical examples are presented, and in all cases the pool sizes derived by means of the proposed method are very close to optimal.

Title: On the Value of Mix Flexibility and Dual Sourcing in Unreliable Newsvendor Networks
Abstract: We connect the mix-flexibility and dual-sourcing literatures by studying unreliable supply chains that produce multiple products. We consider a firm that can invest in product-dedicated resources and totally flexible resources. Product demands are uncertain at the time of resource investment, and the products can differ in their contribution margins. Resource investments can fail, and the firm may choose to invest in multiple resources for a given product to mitigate such failures. In comparing a single-source dedicated strategy with a single-source flexible strategy, we refine the common intuition that a flexible strategy is strictly preferred to a dedicated strategy when the dedicated resources are costlier than the flexible resource. We prove that this intuition is correct if the firm is risk neutral or if the resource investments are perfectly reliable. The intuition can be wrong, however, if both of these conditions fail to hold, because there is a resource-aggregation disadvantage to the flexible strategy that can dominate the demand pooling and contribution-margin benefits of the flexible strategy when resource investments are unreliable and the firm is risk averse. We investigate the influence that resource attributes, firm attributes, and product-portfolio attributes have on the attractiveness of various supply-chain structures that differ in their levels of mix flexibility and diversification, and we investigate the influence these attributes have on the optimal resource investments within a given supply-chain structure. Our results indicate that the appropriate levels of diversification and flexibility are very sensitive to the resource costs and reliabilities, the firm's downside risk tolerance, the number of products, the product demand correlations and the spread in product contribution margins.

Title: Positive vs. Negative Externalities in Inventory Management: Implications for Supply Chain Design
Abstract: In this paper we analyze the impact of supply-side externalities existing among downstream retailers on supply chain performance. Namely, multiple retail firms face stochastic demand, purchase the product from the upstream wholesaler, and make stocking decisions that affect all other retailers in the same echelon. Two sources of inefficiencies exist in such a supply chain: One is double marginalization and the other is externalities among retailers. Whereas double marginalization always leads to inventory understocking at the retail echelon, we find that the implications of externalities are more complex, because different externalities can improve or deteriorate supply chain performance, relative to the situation without externalities. We show that the effect of externalities depends critically on whether the stocking decisions of retailers exhibit positive (complementarity) or negative (substitutability) externalities, and whether retailers are managed centrally or competitively. Under complementarity, competing retailers tend to understock the product (compared with the centralized inventory management at the retail level), thus aggravating the double-marginalization effect. This is the opposite of what happens under substitutability, where competing retailers tend to overstock the product, thus compensating for the double-marginalization effect. Hence, we conclude that supply chain coordination between retailers and the wholesaler is most important when there is downstream competition that exhibits complementarity. From the wholesaler's point of view, competition among retailers is preferable over centralization of retailers when externalities are negative, and vice versa when externalities are positive. Moreover, with competition on complements, both retailers and the wholesaler have incentives to coordinate the supply chain.

Title: Measuring Item Fill-Rate Performance in a Finite Horizon
Abstract: The standard treatment of fill rate relies on stationary and serially independent demand over an infinite horizon. Even if demand is stationary, managers are held accountable for performance over a finite horizon. In a finite horizon, the fill rate is a random variable. Studying the distribution is relevant because a vendor may be subject to financial penalty if she fails to achieve her target fill rate over a specified finite period. It is known that for a zero lead time, base-stock model, the expected value of a finite-horizon fill rate exceeds the long-run fill rate. In this paper, I investigate the behavior of the distribution of the finite-horizon fill rate when a stationary base-stock policy is used to control inventory. For a vendor facing a finite-horizon, fill-rate-level contract and using a stationary stocking policy, I examine how the the length of the review horizon (i.e., monthly or quarterly), the demand distribution, and the cost of failing to meet the target affect the stocking decision.

Title: Hedging Inventory Risk Through Market Instruments
Abstract: We address the problem of hedging inventory risk for a short life cycle or seasonal item when its demand is correlated with the price of a financial asset. We show how to construct optimal hedging transactions that minimize the variance of profit and increase the expected utility for a risk-averse decision maker. We show that for a wide range of hedging strategies and utility functions, a risk-averse decision maker orders more inventory when he or she hedges the inventory risk. Our results are useful to both risk-neutral and risk-averse decision makers because (1) the price information of the financial asset is used to determine both the optimal inventory level and the hedge, (2) this enables the decision maker to update the demand forecast and the financial hedge as more information becomes available, and (3) hedging leads to lower risk and higher return on inventory investment. We illustrate these benefits using data from a retailing firm.

Title: Using Bucket Brigades to Migrate from Craft Manufacturing to Assembly Lines
Abstract: One way to organize workers that lies between traditional assembly lines, where workers are specialists, and craft assembly, where workers are generalists, are "bucket brigades." We describe how one firm used bucket brigades as an intermediate strategy to migrate from craft assembly to assembly lines. The adoption of bucket brigades led to a narrowing of tasks for each worker and thus accelerated learning. The increased production more than compensated for the time lost when workers walk back to get more work, which was significant in this implementation. To understand the trade-offs in migrating from craft to assembly lines, we extend the standard model of bucket brigades to capture hand-off and walk-back times.

Title: An Optimal Production and Shutdown Strategy when a Supplier Offers an Incentive Program
Abstract: Motivated by the incentive programs that have been offered by energy companies under tight market conditions in the past few years, we consider a production control problem in which time alternates randomly between peak and nonpeak periods. During peak periods, the energy supplier offers the manufacturing firm---the energy user---an incentive program to reduce its energy usage by shutting down its production facility. Participation in the incentive program, however, is totally voluntary, and the user firm is rewarded for each unit of time that it participates in the program. We consider two problems that face the manufacturing firm. The first is whether it is worth shutting down production to participate in the incentive program when it is offered, and in which part (portion) of the peak period the firm should participate. The second problem is how the firm should decide on its production policy in both the peak and nonpeak periods in the presence of such an incentive program. In this paper, we provide simple models to give insight into the nature of these problems. Two cases are studied. In the first case, the peak duration is assumed to be exponentially distributed, and in the second, its length becomes known at the beginning of a peak period. In both cases, the occurrence times of the peak periods are uncertain. We characterize the optimal production and shutdown policy for both the peak and nonpeak periods. We also study the effect of seasonality on the optimal control policies.

Title: Quantifying the Value of Leadtime Information in a Single-Location Inventory System
Abstract: This article studies a single-location inventory model with random leadtimes. Inventory is replenished by a single supplier who, at the time a replenishment order is received, knows exactly when the order will be delivered. In other words, the supplier knows the leadtime for every replenishment order. Suppose the single-location inventory system is managed by a retailer. The objective of this article is to quantify the value of the information about leadtimes to the retailer. This is achieved by considering and comparing the performances of two scenarios whether or not the supplier shares his leadtime information with the retailer. Numerical evidence suggests that the value of leadtime information can be significant.

Title: Decentralized Serial Supply Chains Subject to Order Delays and Information Distortion: Exploiting Real-Time Sales Data
Abstract: Decentralized supply chains are traditionally order focused: stage managers focus on meeting replenishment orders of downstream stages; market demand information is relayed up through these orders, and therefore is subject to costly delay and distortion. This paper shows that sharing real-time sales data across all stages and a change in focus to meeting customer demand can mitigate performance impairment caused by the order focus. We show that a change of managerial focus in a decentralized chain can be made by measuring stages' performance based on their respective echelon stocks, which only depends on how well they respond to the market demand. A demand-focused measurement scheme can be made incentive compatible with the knowledge of the demand distribution; a heuristic scheme independent of the demand distribution can be used to achieve near incentive compatibility.

Title: Product Line Selection and Pricing with Modularity in Design
Abstract: This paper addresses the strategic impact of modular design on the optimal length and price of a differentiated product line. We represent consumer demand with a Bayesian logit model. We also break operations costs into product design and production components. Our analysis shows that reducing product development costs via modular design always makes it attractive to offer greater product variety. However, reducing production costs can sometimes motivate a reduction in variety for a risk-averse producer in a multiple-segment market. We also characterize the impacts of degree of modularity and production cost on price markup and market share. Finally, we show that the optimal product line length is monotonic in risk attitude and the monotonic weak majorization, partial order on product assortment.

Title: Trade-offs Between Customer Service and Cost in Integrated Supply Chain Design
Abstract: When designing supply chains, firms are often faced with the competing demands of improved customer service and reduced cost. We extend a cost-based location-inventory model (Shen et al. 2003) to include a customer service element and develop practical methods for quick and meaningful evaluation of cost/service trade-offs. Service is measured by the fraction of all demands that are located within an exogenously specified distance of the assigned distribution center. The nonlinear model simultaneously determines distribution center locations and the assignment of demand nodes to distribution centers to optimize the cost and service objectives. We use a weighting method to find all supported points on the trade-off curve. We also propose a heuristic solution approach based on genetic algorithms that can generate optimal or close-to-optimal solutions in a much shorter time compared to the weighting method. Our results suggest that significant service improvements can be achieved relative to the minimum cost solution at a relatively small incremental cost.

Title: Optimal Prices and Trade-in Rebates for Durable, Remanufacturable Products
Abstract: Most durable products have two distinct types of customers: first-time buyers and customers who already own the product, but are willing to replace it with a new one or purchase a second one. Firms usually adopt a price-discrimination policy by offering a trade-in rebate only to the replacement customers to hasten their purchase decisions. Any return flow of products induced by trade-in rebates has the potential to generate revenues through remanufacturing operations. In this paper, we study the optimal pricing/trade-in strategies for such durable, remanufacturable products. We focus on the scenario where the replacement customers are only interested in trade-ins. In this setting, we study three pricing schemes: (i) uniform price for all customers, (ii) age-independent price differentiation between new and replacement customers (i.e., constant rebate for replacement customers), and (iii) age-dependent price differentiation between new and replacement customers (i.e., age-dependent rebates for replacement customers). We characterize the roles that the durability of the product, the extent of return revenues, the age profile of existing products in the market, and the relative size of the two customer segments play in shaping the optimal prices and the amount of trade-in rebates offered. Throughout the paper we highlight the operational decisions that might influence the above factors, and we support our findings with real-life practices. In an extensive numerical study, we compare the profit potential of different pricing schemes and quantify the reward (penalty) associated with taking into account (ignoring) customer segmentation, the price-discrimination option, return revenues, and the age profile of existing products. On the basis of these results, we are able to identify the most favorable pricing strategy for the firm when faced with a particular market condition and discuss implications on the life-cycle pricing of durable, remanufacturable products.

Title: Analysis of a Decentralized Supply Chain Under Partial Cooperation
Abstract: In this article, we analyze a decentralized supply chain consisting of a supplier and two independent retailers. In each order cycle, retailers place their orders at the supplier to minimize inventory-related expected costs at the end of their respective response times. There are two types of lead times involved. At the end of the supplier lead time, retailers are given an opportunity to readjust their initial orders (without changing the total order size), so that both retailers can improve their expected costs at the end of respective retailer lead times (the time it takes for items to be shipped from the supplier to the retailers). Because of the possibility of cooperation at the end of supplier lead time, each retailer will consider the other's order-up-to level in making the ordering decision. Under mild conditions, we prove the existence of a unique Nash equilibrium for the retailer order-up-to levels, and show that they can be obtained by solving a set of newsboy-like equations. We also present computational analysis that provides valuable managerial insight for design and operation of decentralized systems under the possibility of partial cooperation.

Title: Retailer-Supplier Flexible Commitments Contracts: A Robust Optimization Approach
Abstract: We propose the use of robust optimization (RO) as a powerful methodology for multiperiod stochastic operations management problems. In particular, we study a two-echelon multiperiod supply chain problem, known as the retailer-supplier flexible commitment (RSFC) problem with uncertain demand that is only known to reside in some uncertainty set. We adopt a min-max criterion, whereby the cost function is minimized against the worst case demand occurrence. To solve the min-max RSFC problem we employ a recent extension of the RO method adapted to dynamic decision problems and known as the affinely adjustable robust counterpart (AARC) methodology. The AARC solution is tested by a large simulation study and found to provide excellent results.

Title: A Staffing Algorithm for Call Centers with Skill-Based Routing
Abstract: Call centers usually handle several types of calls, but it is usually not possible or cost effective to have every agent be able to handle every type of call. Thus, the agents tend to have different skills, in different combinations. In such an environment, it is challenging to route calls effectively and determine the staff requirements. This paper addresses both of these routing and staffing problems by exploiting limited cross-training. Consistent with the literature on flexible manufacturing, we find that minimal flexibility can provide great benefits: Simulation experiments show that when (1) the service-time distribution does not depend on the call type or the agent and (2) each agent has only two skills, in appropriate combinations, the performance is almost as good as when each agent has all skills. We apply this flexibility property to develop an algorithm for both routing and staffing, aiming to minimize the total staff subject to per-class performance constraints. With appropriate flexibility, it suffices to use a suboptimal routing algorithm. Simulation experiments show that the overall procedure can be remarkably effective: The required staff with limited cross-training can be nearly the same as if all agents had all skills. Hence, the overall algorithm is nearly optimal for that scenario.

Title: Safety Stock Positioning in Supply Chains with Stochastic Lead Times
Abstract: We study the safety stock positioning problem in single-product multistage supply chains with tree network structures, where each stage controls its inventory using an installation continuous-time base-stock policy. External demands follow independent Poisson processes, and unsatisfied demands at each stage are fully backordered. The processing (e.g., production) cycle times and transportation lead times are assumed to be stochastic, sequential, and exogenously determined. We derive recursive equations for the backorder delays (because of stockout) at all stages in the supply chain. Based on the recursive equations, we characterize the dependencies of the backorder delays across different stages in the network, and develop insights into the impact of safety stock positioning in various supply chain topologies. We present approximations and algorithms to coordinate the base-stock levels in these supply chains, so as to minimize systemwide inventory cost subject to meeting certain service-level requirements of the external customers.

Title: Improved Base-Stock Approximations for Independent Stochastic Lead Times with Order Crossover
Abstract: Order crossovers occur when replenishment orders arrive in a sequence that is different than the one in which they were placed. Order crossovers require that optimal reorder levels be set with regard to the inventory shortfall distribution rather than the lead-time demand distribution. Assuming periodic review and independent lead times, this paper suggests simple approximations of the shortfall distribution by showing that the variance of the number of orders outstanding is bounded above by the standard deviation of lead time divided by \root 3. Using this bound in a normal approximation improves significantly upon the common practice of basing policies on the lead-time demand distribution. A negative binomial approximation of the shortfall, based on its exact variance, offers even greater improvement, at the cost of some additional informational and computational requirements.

Title: Retail Assortment Planning in the Presence of Consumer Search
Abstract: Consumers often know what kind of product they wish to purchase, but do not know which specific variant best fits their needs. As a result, a consumer may find an acceptable product in one retailer but nevertheless purchase nothing, opting to search other retailers for an even better product. We study several models of retail assortment planning, some of which explicitly account for consumer search and one that does not, which we call the "no-search" model. Even though the no-search model never includes an unprofitable variant in the assortment, in the presence of consumer search, it may indeed be optimal to include an unprofitable variant. Furthermore, we find that the no-search model can lead to an assortment with an expected total profit that is significantly less than optimal. In the extreme, the no-search model may recommend closing down a category (i.e., carry no variants) even if a profitable assortment exists (a 100% profit loss). We conclude that failing to incorporate consumer search into an assortment planning process may cause a retailer to underestimate the substantial value a broad assortment has in preventing consumer search. We discuss how the insights from our stylized models may apply to actual assortment planning processes.

Title: Biform Analysis of Inventory Competition
Abstract: This paper provides a model of the competitive newsvendor problem in which there is price competition following the inventory decisions. Using the biform game formalism of Brandenburger and Stuart (2004), the price competition is modeled by considering the core of the induced cooperative game. Such an analysis allows price competition to be modeled without a priori assumptions about price-setting power or pricing procedures. The paper shows that with no uncertainty, the inventory decision is equivalent to the capacity decision in Cournot competition. With uncertainty, the analysis again reduces to Cournot competition if the demand uncertainty is characterized by an appropriately constructed, expected demand curve. The results highlight the critical role of the fixed-price assumption in newsvendor models.

Title: A Supply Chain Model with Reverse Information Exchange
Abstract: We develop a model and analyze reverse information sharing, a growing business practice in supply chain management in which a manufacturer shares information about supply with a retailer. We model the manufacturer as a production queue with finished goods warehouse, the retailer as an inventory location, and other customers as an external demand stream. In our model, the manufacturer allows the retailer access to inventory status at the warehouse. To take advantage of this new information, the retailer changes from a single-level base-stock policy to a two-level, state-dependent base-stock policy. We provide an exact method for computing performance and develop a procedure for evaluating optimal policy. We demonstrate the impact of the new policy on the manufacturer and other customers. Numerical computations lead to insights about the value of information to the retailer, and to guidelines for the manufacturer on sharing information.

Title: Extending the Horizons: Environmental Excellence as Key to Improving Operations
Abstract: The view that adopting an environmental perspective on operations can lead to improved operations is in itself not novel; phrases such as "lean is green" are increasingly commonplace. The implication is that any operational system that has minimized inefficiencies is also more environmentally sustainable. However, in this paper we argue that the underlying mechanism is one of extending the horizons of analysis and that this applies to both theory and practice of operations management. We illustrate this through two principal areas of lean operations, where we identify how successive extensions of the prevailing research horizon in each area have led to major advances in theory and practice. First, in quality management, the initial emphasis on statistical quality control of individual operations was extended through total quality management to include a broader process encompassing customer requirements and suppliers' operations. More recently, the environmental perspective extended the definition of customers to stakeholders and defects to any form of waste. Second, in supply chain management, the horizon first expanded from the initial focus on optimizing inventory control with a single planner to including multiple organizations with conflicting objectives and private information. The environmental perspective draws attention to aspects such as reverse flows and end-of-life product disposal, again potentially improving the performance of the overall supply chain. In both cases, these developments were initially driven by practice, where many of the benefits of adopting an environmental perspective were unexpected. Given that these unexpected side benefits seem to recur so frequently, we refer to this phenomenon as the "law of the expected unexpected side benefits." We conclude by extrapolating from the developmental paths of total quality management and supply chain management to speculate about the future of environmental research in operations management.

Title: Sale Timing in a Supply Chain: When to Sell to the Retailer
Abstract: A fundamental decision for any manufacturer is when to sell to a downstream retailer. A manufacturer can sell either early, i.e., well in advance of the selling season, or late, i.e., close to the selling season. This paper examines the impact of information asymmetry, retailer sales effort, and contract type on the manufacturer's sale-timing decision. We find that if information is symmetric, demand is not influenced by sales effort, and the contract specifies that the price paid is linear in the order quantity, the manufacturer prefers to sell late. This result extends to the case where the retailer exerts sales effort during the selling season. However, if the retailer exerts sales effort prior to the selling season or has superior information about market demand, the manufacturer may prefer to sell early. We characterize the manufacturer's sale-timing preference in these settings, providing clear conditions under which the manufacturer prefers to sell either early or late. We show that the retailer, manufacturer, and total system may be hurt by the retailer's having higher-quality information.

Title: Supply Auctions and Relational Contracts for Procurement
Abstract: We examine the competition between procurement auctions and long-term relational contracts that emerges from the increased usage of electronic marketplaces. Procurement auctions create supply chain efficiencies by selecting the least costly bidder, and long-term relational contracts ensure the quality of the procured products or services when these have nonverifiable attributes. The following two-layer supply chain model is analyzed: Suppliers of an industrial part with nonverifiable quality trade with several manufacturers that utilize that part in the production of an end product. A price-based reverse auction is used for the procurement of low-quality parts, and a relational long-term contract is used for high-quality parts. A formal model of the competition between the two procurement models identifies conditions under which the two coexist, and conditions under which one will push the other out of the market. Market and product parameters that increase the relative economic appeal of the relational contract are determined. It is demonstrated that the competition from the auction market can either facilitate or undermine the relational contract compared with a benchmark case of a monopolist supplier. This implies that competition between the two procurement models plays an important role in the supply of high-quality products.

Title: Analyzing the Simultaneous Use of Auctions and Posted Prices for Online Selling
Abstract: Many firms in the business-to-consumer market sell identical products online using auctions and posted prices at the same time. In this paper, we develop and analyze a model of the key trade-offs sellers face in such a dual-channel setting built around the optimal choice of three design parameters: the posted price, the auction lot size, and the auction duration. Our results show how a monopolist seller can increase his revenues by offering auctions and a fixed price concurrently, and we identify when either a posted price only or a dual-channel strategy is optimal for the seller. We model consumer choice of channels, and thus market segmentation, and find a unique (symmetric) auction-participation equilibrium exists in which consumers who value the item for more than its posted price use a threshold policy to choose between the two channels. The threshold defines an upper bound on the remaining time of the auction. We explain how optimizing the design parameters enables the seller to segment the market so that the two channels reinforce each other and cannibalization is mitigated. Our findings also demonstrate that there are two dominant auction design strategies in this setting: one-unit auctions that tend to be short and long multiunit auctions. The optimal strategy for the seller depends on the consumer arrival rate and the disutility of delivery delay incurred by high-valuation consumers. In either case, the optimal design of the dual channel can significantly outperform a single posted-price channel. We show even greater benefits over a naive approach to managing the two channels that optimizes each independently. Our results suggest that unless firms jointly manage these online channels, they may find that adding auctions actually reduces their revenues.

Title: Service System Design with Immobile Servers, Stochastic Demand, and Congestion
Abstract: The service system design problem seeks to locate a set of service facilities, allocate enough capacity, and assign stochastic customer demand to each of them, so as to minimize the fixed costs of opening facilities and acquiring service capacity, as well as the variable access and waiting costs. This problem is commonly known in the location literature as the facility location problem with immobile servers, stochastic demand, and congestion. It is often set up as a network of M/M/1 queues and modeled as a nonlinear mixed-integer program (MIP). Because of the complexity of the resulting model, the current literature focuses on approximate and/or heuristic solution methods. This paper proposes a linearization based on a simple transformation and piecewise linear approximations and an exact solution method based on cutting planes. This leads to the exact solution of models with up to 100 customers, 20 potential service facilities, and 3 capacity levels.

Title: Timing Successive Product Introductions with Demand Diffusion and Stochastic Technology Improvement
Abstract: This paper considers a firm's decisions on the introduction timing for successive product generations. We examine the case where a firm introduces multiple generations of a durable product for which demand is characterized by a demand diffusion process. Under fixed introduction costs, we consider the case where available product technology improves stochastically. As such, delaying introduction to a later date may lead to the capture of further technology improvements, potentially at the cost of slowing sales for the existing product (and a decline in market potential for the product to be introduced, given our focus on durable products). We specify a state-based model of demand diffusion and construct a decision model to solve the firm's introduction timing problem. By incorporating technology improvement in our model, we prove the optimality of a state-dependent threshold policy governing the firm's product-introduction decisions. Numerical analysis reveals the influence of key model parameters on the pace of product introduction. Our model helps to explain the product-introduction behavior of firms and provides an alternative to previous explanations of IBM's introduction timing decisions for successive generations of its mainframe computers.

Title: Dynamic Pricing Strategies for Multiproduct Revenue Management Problems
Abstract: Consider a firm that owns a fixed capacity of a resource that is consumed in the production or delivery of multiple products. The firm strives to maximize its total expected revenues over a finite horizon, either by choosing a dynamic pricing strategy for each product or, if prices are fixed, by selecting a dynamic rule that controls the allocation of capacity to requests for the different products. This paper shows how these well-studied revenue management problems can be reduced to a common formulation in which the firm controls the aggregate rate at which all products jointly consume resource capacity, highlighting their common structure, and in some cases leading to algorithmic simplifications through the reduction in the control dimension of the associated optimization problems. In the context of their associated deterministic (fluid) formulations, this reduction leads to a closed-form characterization of the optimal controls, and suggests several natural static and dynamic pricing heuristics. These are analyzed asymptotically and through an extensive numerical study. In the context of the former, we show that "resolving" the fluid heuristic achieves asymptotically optimal performance under fluid scaling.

Title: Pricing, Production, and Inventory Policies for Manufacturing with Stochastic Demand and Discretionary Sales
Abstract: We study determining prices and production jointly in a multiple period horizon under a general, nonstationary stochastic demand function with a discrete menu of prices. We assume that the available production capacity is limited and that unmet demand is lost. We incorporate discretionary sales, when inventory may be set aside to satisfy future demand even if some present demand is lost. We analyze and compare partial planning or delayed strategies. In delayed strategies, one decision may be planned in advance, whereas a second decision is delayed until the beginning of each time period, after observing the results of previous decisions. For example, in delayed production (delayed pricing), pricing (production) is determined at the beginning of the horizon, and the production (pricing) decision is made at the beginning of each period before new customer orders are received. A special case is where a single price is chosen over the horizon. We describe policies and heuristics for the strategies based on deterministic approximations and analyze their performances. Computational analysis yields additional insights about the strategies, such as that delayed production is usually better than delayed pricing except sometimes when capacity is tight. On average, the delayed production (pricing) heuristic achieved 99.3% (99.8%) of the corresponding optimal strategy.

Title: Performance Evaluation and Stock Allocation in Capacitated Serial Supply Systems
Abstract: We develop an approximation scheme for performance evaluation of serial supply systems when each stage operates like a single-server queue, and its planned inventories are managed according to a base-stock policy. We also present a near-exact matrix-geometric procedure for benchmarking our approximation relative to two other methods proposed in the literature. Through numerical tests, we demonstrate that our method is superior, both for performance estimation and for policy parameter optimization. Using this technique, we then perform experiments that address the following issues. What proportion of the optimal total inventory should managers allocate to upstream production stages to minimize the sum of inventory and backorder costs? If managerial action could lower holding cost rate or add capacity, which stages of the supply system should be targeted for maximum net benefit? Such concerns have been the subject of several recent studies relating to supply networks with constant and random independent lead times. We shine light on optimal actions for serial supply systems that experience congestion.

Title: Impact of Partial Manufacturing Flexibility on Production Variability
Abstract: As manufacturers in various industries evolve toward predominantly make-to-order production to better serve their customers' needs, increasing product mix flexibility emerges as a necessary strategy to provide adequate market responsiveness. However, the implications of increased flexibility on overall system performance are widely unknown. We develop analytical models and an optimization-based simulation tool to study the impact of increasing flexibility on shortages, production variability, component inventories, and order variability induced at upstream suppliers in general multiplant multiproduct make-to-order manufacturing systems. Our results show that (1) Partial flexibility leads to a considerable increase in production variability, and consequently in higher component inventory levels and upstream order variability. Although a modest increase in flexibility yields most of the sales benefits, production variability is reduced as more flexibility is added to the system. Consequently, investments in additional flexibility may be justified when component inventories are expensive, or simply by the benefits associated with the smoother production. (2) The performance of flexible systems is highly dependent on the capacity allocation policies implemented. Policies that evenly distribute product demands to the available plants lead to consistently better performance because they avoid the misplacement of inventories by replicating the performance of a single-plant system. These insights and the simulation tool can be used by practitioners to guide the design of their flexible production systems, trading off the initial capital outlay versus the sales benefits and the expected operational costs.

Title: Product Line Design with Component Commonality and Cost-Reduction Effort
Abstract: Market pressure for low prices paired with customer demand for high product variety presents a considerable dilemma for many manufacturers. Industry practice and research to date suggest that approaches based on component commonality can substantially lower the costs of proliferated product lines, but at the cost of reducing product differentiation and revenues. We analyze a stylized model of a manufacturer who designs a product line consisting of two products for sale to two market segments with different valuations of quality. The manufacturer determines the component quality levels, the amount of effort to reduce production costs, and whether to use common or different components for the two products. Explicitly considering potential interdependencies between cost-reduction effort and quality decisions, we characterize environments where the optimal product line involving component commonality features products of higher quality and yields higher revenues. Counter to earlier research we show that it can be preferable to make those components common that, relative to their production cost, are attributed a higher importance by customers. Disregarding the interactions between commonality, production cost, quality, and effort decisions can lead manufacturers to offer product lines with excessive differentiation and inefficiently low quality.

Title: Stochastic Comparisons in Airline Revenue Management
Abstract: Consider two markets of different sizes but similar costs and fare structure. All other things being equal, is an airline's expected revenue larger in the market with larger demand? If not, under what circumstances is it possible to compare expected revenues without carrying out a detailed analysis? In this article, we provide answers to these questions by studying the relationship between the optimal expected revenue and the demand distributions when the latter are comparable according to various stochastic orders. For the two-fare class problem with dependent demand we obtain three results. We show that airlines should prefer lesser positive dependence between fare classes when marginal demand distributions are the same. We also describe particular dependence structures under which stochastically larger marginal demand distributions improve optimal expected revenue. Finally, when the dependence between effective demands in the two fare classes arises due to "sell ups," we show that stochastically larger marginal demand distributions should be preferred. (Sell ups occur when some lower-fare-class customers buy higher-fare tickets upon finding that the former tickets are sold out.) For a problem with an arbitrary number of fare classes and independent demands, we show that stochastically larger demand distributions should be preferred. Numerical examples demonstrating the effect of parameterized demand distributions (with appropriate stochastic ordering) and dependence structures are also presented.

Title: The Impact of Increased Employee Retention on Performance in a Customer Contact Center
Abstract: Amathematical model is developed to help analyze the benefit in contact-center performance obtained from increasing employee (agent) retention, which is in turn obtained by increasing agent job satisfaction. The contact-center performance may be restricted to a traditional productivity measure such as the number of calls answered per hour, or it may include a broader measure of the quality of service, e.g., revenue earned per hour or the number of problems successfully resolved per hour. The analysis is based on an idealized model of a contact center in which the number of employed agents is constant over time, assuming that a new agent is immediately hired to replace each departing agent. The agent employment periods are assumed to be independent and identically distributed random variables with a general agent-retention probability distribution, which depends on management policy and actions. The steady-state staff-experience distribution is obtained from the agent-retention distribution by applying renewal theory. An increasing real-valued function specifies the average performance as a function of agent experience. Convenient closed-form expressions for the overall performance as a function of model elements are derived when either the agent-retention distribution or the performance function has exponential structure. Management actions may cause the agent-retention distribution to change. The model describes the consequences of such changes on the long-run average staff experience and the long-run average performance.

Title: On the Interactions Between Routing and Inventory-Management Policies in a One-Warehouse N-Retailer Distribution System
Abstract: This paper examines the interactions between routing and inventory-management decisions in a two-level supply chain consisting of a cross-docking warehouse and N retailers. Retailer demand is normally distributed and independent across retailers and over time. Travel times are fixed between pairs of system sites. Every m time periods, system inventory is replenished at the warehouse, whereupon an uncapacitated vehicle departs on a route that visits each retailer once and only once, allocating all of its inventory based on the status of inventory at the retailers who have not yet received allocations. The retailers experience newsvendor-type inventory-holding and backorder-penalty costs each period; the vehicle experiences in-transit inventory-holding costs each period. Our goal is to determine a combined system inventory-replenishment, routing, and inventory-allocation policy that minimizes the total expected cost/period of the system over an infinite time horizon. Our analysis begins by examining the determination of the optimal static route, i.e., the best route if the vehicle must travel the same route every replenishment-allocation cycle. Here we demonstrate that the optimal static route is not the shortest-total-distance (TSP) route, but depends on the variance of customer demands, and, if in-transit inventory-holding costs are charged, also on mean customer demands. We then examine dynamic-routing policies, i.e., policies that can change the route from one system-replenishment-allocation cycle to another, based on the status of the retailers' inventories. Here we argue that in the absence of transportation-related cost, the optimal dynamic-routing policy should be viewed as balancing management's ability to respond to system uncertainties (by changing routes) against system uncertainties that are induced by changing routes. We then examine the performance of a change-revert heuristic policy. Although its routing decisions are not fully dynamic, but determined and fixed for a given cycle at the time of each system replenishment, simulation tests with N = 2 and N = 6 retailers indicate that its use can substantially reduce system inventory-related costs even if most of the time the chosen route is the optimal static route.

Title: Competition, Cooperation, and Information Sharing in a Two-Echelon Assembly System
Abstract: This paper studies a two-echelon assembly system and explores several important issues in managing decentralized supply chains. First, we investigate the behavior of the assembly system under decentralized control. It is shown that the Nash equilibrium of the competitive assembly system exists but is never system optimal. Next, we examine the role of information in the assembly system. We consider horizontal information sharing on the inventory status between the suppliers and demonstrate when information is valuable from the perspectives of the system and the individual player. We find that information sharing mitigates the system's competition penalty in some cases, but there are also instances in which information sharing can hurt a decentralized system. Although the manufacturer always prefers information sharing, it is sometimes in the interest of the suppliers to refuse to share information. Finally, we propose a demand-independent coordination scheme for managing decentralized supply chains with either a serial or an assembly structure. The coordination scheme has practical value because very often the firm's head (or the owner of the supply chain) does not have the accurate demand information that the local managers have. Alternatively, the demand varies over time, and the coordination contracts have to be modified. Under the transfer payment contract, the system optimal policy is the unique Nash equilibrium in the decentralized supply chain. Discussion on the relationship between our coordination scheme and existing methods in the literature is also provided.

Title: Integrated Real-Time Capacity and Inventory Allocation for Reparable Service Parts in a Two-Echelon Supply System
Abstract: Two critical decisions must be made daily when managing multiechelon repair and distribution systems for service parts: (1) allocating available repair capacity among different items and (2) allocating available inventories to field stocking locations to support service operations. In many such systems, procurement lead times for service parts are lengthy and variable, repair capacity is limited, and operational requirements change frequently--resulting in demand processes that are highly uncertain and nonstationary. As a consequence, it is common to have many items in short supply while others are abundant. In such environments, integrated real-time decision-support tools can provide significant value by reducing the impact of inventory imbalances and responding appropriately to the volatile nature of the demand processes. By "integrated" and "real-time," we mean (respectively) tools that simultaneously consider key aspects of the current state of the operating environment in deciding what items to repair, where to ship available units, and by what mode to ship them. In this paper, we develop an integrated real-time model for making repair and inventory allocation decisions in a two-echelon reparable service parts system. We formulate the decision problem as a finite-horizon, periodic-review mathematical program, we show it can be formulated as a large-scale linear program, and we develop a practical heuristic method for solving the problem approximately. By simulating the operation of a service parts supply chain, we demonstrate the value of employing integrated decision models over using separate repair and inventory allocation rules for a range of environments where inventory imbalances exist. We also show that our heuristic approach is highly effective and that its inventory allocation subroutine, used as a stand-alone tool for making distribution decisions, outperforms a commonly used inventory allocation rule in most circumstances tested.

Title: OM ForumThe Best Things in Life Were Free: On the Technology of Transactions
Abstract: Radio-frequency identification (RFID) technology will reduce the costs of transactions to both customers and providers. This is a good thing, mostly. But it will be harder than people suppose, and it may have some adverse consequences. There are numerous technical and policy problems, including privacy and security issues. All these likely will be resolved, but only with time, experience, and money. Thus, it is unclear just how RFID will be used, just when various applications will become feasible. Also, as transaction costs decline, providers will be inclined to charge for things that are now free, such as public parks and congested roads. We may wait less at each transaction point, but such points may proliferate. Rather than obsess about this one technology, we should aim to think creatively about transactions and ways to improve them. Transactions affect our lives in many ways. A transaction is a process, not just an event. When people are involved, the process becomes intertwined with other intricate processes--product choice, social interaction, and the expression of power relations. RFID certainly offers the potential for improvement, but there are some lower-tech methods worth considering. This is not a systematic survey, but rather an essay, a sketch in broad strokes of an immense and varied landscape. Many topics are touched on lightly. The goal is to stimulate thought and discussion. More questions are raised than answered. In places the tone is personal, some might say eccentric.

Title: Global Diffusion of ISO 9000 Certification Through Supply Chains
Abstract: The ISO 9000 series of quality management systems standards is widely diffused, with more than 560,000 sites certified in 152 countries as of December 2003. Anecdotal evidence suggests that global supply chains contributed to this diffusion, in the following sense. Firms in Europe were the first to seek ISO 9000 certification in large numbers. They then required their suppliers, including those abroad, to do likewise. Once the standard had thus entered other countries, it spread beyond those firms immediately exporting to Europe to be adopted by many other firms in those same countries. This paper empirically examines the validity of this view of the role of supply chains in global diffusion of ISO 9000. To do so, we decompose the statement "supply chains contributed to the global diffusion of ISO 9000" into a series of four requirements that must be met for the original statement to be supported. We then use firm-level data from a global survey of more than 5,000 firms in nine countries to test the hypotheses that correspond to these requirements. Our findings are consistent with the view that part of the global diffusion of ISO 9000 did move upstream in global supply chains. In short, this means that firms that export goods or services to a particular country may simultaneously be importing that country's management practices. We conclude by suggesting how these findings might form the basis for future research on the environmental management systems standard ISO 14000.

Title: A Generalization of the Inventory Pooling Effect to Nonnormal Dependent Demand
Abstract: Eppen (1979) showed that inventory costs in a centralized system increase with the correlation between multivariate normal product demands. Using multivariate stochastic orders, we generalize this statement to arbitrary distributions. We then describe methods to construct models with arbitrary dependence structure, using the copula of a multivariate distribution to capture the dependence between the components of a random vector. For broad classes of distributions with arbitrary marginals, we confirm that centralization or pooling of inventories is more valuable when demands are less positively dependent.

Abstract: We show the existence of Nash equilibria in a Bertrand oligopoly price competition game using a possibly asymmetric attraction demand model with convex costs under mild assumptions. We show that the equilibrium is unique and globally stable. To our knowledge, this is the first paper to show the existence of a unique equilibrium with both nonlinear demand and nonlinear costs. In addition, we guarantee the linear convergence rate of tatnnement. We illustrate the applicability of this approach with several examples arising from operational considerations that are often ignored in the economics literature.

Title: Supply Chain Coordination for False Failure Returns
Abstract: False failure returns are products that are returned by consumers to retailers with no functional or cosmetic defect. The cost of a false failure return includes the processing actions of testing, refurbishing (if necessary), repackaging, the loss in value during the time the product spends in the reverse supply chain (a time that can exceed several months for many firms), and the loss in revenue because the product is sold at a discounted price. This cost is significant and is incurred primarily by the manufacturer. Reducing false failure returns, however, requires effort primarily from the retailer, for example informing consumers about the exact product that best fits their needs. We address the problem of reducing false failure returns via supply chain coordination methods. Specifically, we propose a target rebate contract that pays the retailer a specific dollar amount per each unit of false failure returns below a target. This target rebate provides an incentive to the retailer to increase her effort, thus decreasing the number of false failures and (potentially) increasing net sales. We show that this contract is Pareto improving in the majority of cases. Our results also indicate that the profit improvement to both parties, and the supply chain, is substantial.

Title: A Closed-Form Approximation for Serial Inventory Systems and Its Application to System Design
Abstract: We analyze a serial base-stock inventory model with Poisson demand and a fill-rate constraint. Our objective is to gain insights into the linkage between the stages to facilitate optimal system design and decentralized system control. To this end, we develop a closed-form approximation for the optimal base-stock levels. The development consists of two key steps: (1) convert the service-constrained model into a backorder cost model by imputing an appropriate backorder cost rate, and then adapt the single-stage approximation developed for the latter, and (2) use a logistic distribution to approximate the lead-time demand distribution in the single-stage approximation obtained in (1) to yield closed-form expressions. We then use the closed-form expressions to conduct sensitivity analyses and establish qualitative properties on system design issues, such as optimal total system stock, stock positioning, and internal fill rates. The closed-form approximation and most of the qualitative properties apply equally to the model with a backorder cost, although some differences do exist. Other results of this study include a bottom-up recursive procedure to evaluate any given echelon base-stock policy and lower bounds on the optimal echelon base-stock levels.

Title: Approximate Solutions of a Dynamic Forecast-Inventory Model
Abstract: In this paper we consider a dynamic forecast-inventory model with forecast updates, based on the martingale model of forecast evolution. Two types of updates are considered, additive and multiplicative. The formulation of the model results in a dynamic program with multidimensional state space. We derive some characteristics of optimal policies and also develop a computational approach to obtain approximate solutions. The approach is based on simulation and function approximation.

Title: Note--A Mathematical Model for Evaluating Cross-Sales Policies in Telephone Service Centers
Abstract: Cross-selling in telephone service centers is seen by industry as a useful means to generate profits from an existing customer base. Introducing cross-sales to a service center, however, needs to be properly managed as it could degrade customer service quality. Real-time customer and system information can be used to set the appropriate control policy for cross-sales to enhance profitability without causing undesirable service degradation for calling customers. The objective of this paper is to illustrate the value of using real-time information in selecting optimal control policies for cross-sales in telephone service centers. Specifically, we develop an introductory mathematical model to incorporate the use of two types of information, system status (queuing congestion) and customer profile (likelihood of purchase) in determining the optimal control policy to maximize the expected operating profit of the system. We hope to stimulate further research in this area by providing a groundwork for further modeling. We show that using more information increases a call center's operating profit. Improvements were dramatic for environments with intermediate utilization and high customer heterogeneity.

Title: A Newsvendor's Procurement Problem when Suppliers Are Unreliable
Abstract: We consider the problem of a newsvendor that is served by multiple suppliers, where any given supplier is defined to be either perfectly reliable or unreliable. By perfectly reliable we mean a supplier that delivers an amount identically equal to the amount desired, as is the case in the most basic variant of the newsvendor problem. By unreliable, we mean a supplier that with some probability delivers an amount strictly less than the amount desired. Our results indicate the following effects of unreliability: From the perspective of the newsvendor, the aggregate quantity ordered is higher than otherwise would be ordered if the newsvendor's suppliers were completely reliable. From the perspective of end customers, however, the service level provided is lower than otherwise would be provided if the newsvendor's suppliers were completely reliable. From the perspective of the suppliers, although reliability affects how much is ordered from a selected supplier, cost generally takes precedence over reliability when it comes to selecting suppliers in the first place. Even perfect reliability is no guarantee for qualification since, in an optimal solution, a given supplier will be selected only if all less-expensive suppliers are selected, regardless of the given supplier's reliability level. Nevertheless, the relative size of a selected supplier's order depends on its reliability.

Title: Call-Routing Schemes for Call-Center Outsourcing
Abstract: Companies may choose to outsource parts, but not all, of their call-center operations. In some cases, they classify customers as high or low value, serving the former with their in-house operations and routing the latter to an outsourcer. Typically, they impose service-level constraints on the time each type of customer waits on hold. This paper considers four schemes for routing low-value calls between the client company and the outsourcer. These schemes vary in the complexity of their routing algorithms, as well as the sophistication of the telephone and information technology infrastructure they require of the two operations. For three of these schemes, this paper provides a direct characterization of system performance. For the fourth, most complex, scheme the paper provides performance bounds for the important special case in which the service requirements of high- and low-value callers are the same. These results allow the systematic comparison of the performance of the various routing schemes. The results suggest that, for clients with large outsourcing requirements, the simpler schemes that require little client-outsourcer coordination can perform very well.

Title: Note--"OM Forum: Evaluating Operations Management-Related Journals via the Author Affiliation Index"--Do Professors at Top U.S. Business Schools Do What They Say?
Abstract: In Gorman and Kanet (2005) we introduced the Author Affiliation Index (AAI) and how it could be used to rate the quality of operations management-related journals. Since then, Olson (2005) surveyed operations management professors from top U.S. universities and reported their assessment of the quality of various operations management-related journals. This paper compares the results of these two studies and concludes that patterns of research publications match the surveyed opinions from top U.S. universities, or that researchers publish in journals they rate as top. We confirm our earlier finding that the AAI is comparable to surveys for assessing journal quality.

Title: Performance Evaluation of an Automatic Transfer Line with WIP Scrapping During Long Failures
Abstract: We develop a model of a failure-prone, bufferless, paced, automatic transfer line in which material flows through a number of workstations in series, receiving continuous processing along each workstation. When a workstation fails, it stops operating, and so do all the other workstations upstream of it. The quality of the material trapped in the stopped workstations deteriorates with time. If this material remains immobilized beyond a certain critical time, its quality becomes unacceptable and it must be scrapped. We develop analytical expressions for important system performance measures for two cases. In the first case, the in-process material has no memory of the quality deterioration that it experienced during previous stoppages, whereas in the second case it has. In both cases, we assume that the workstation uptimes and downtimes follow memoryless distributions. We use the analytical expressions to numerically study the effect of system parameters on system performance. To evaluate the memoryless assumption, we compare the performance of the original model to that of a modified model in which the workstation downtimes do not follow memoryless distributions. The performance of the modified model is obtained via simulation.

Title: Dynamic Competitive Newsvendors with Service-Sensitive Demands
Abstract: When two firms compete for service-sensitive demands based on their product availability, their actions will affect the future market share reallocation. This problem was first studied by Hall and Porteus (2000) using a dynamic game model. We extend their work by incorporating a general demand model, which enables us to obtain properties that reveal the dynamics of the game and the behavior of the players. In particular, we provide conditions under which the market share of a firm has a positive value and give it an upper bound. We further extend the game competition model to an infinite-horizon setting. We prove that there exists a stationary equilibrium policy and that the dynamic equilibrium policy always converges to a stationary equilibrium policy. We demonstrate that demand patterns will dictate how firms compete rationally and show the likely outcomes of the competition.

Title: Simple Relational Contracts to Motivate Capacity Investment: Price Only vs. Price and Quantity
Abstract: Because of long lead times associated with product development and building capacity, a supplier must initiate investment in capacity when the product development effort is ongoing. Because the product is ill defined at this point in time, the buyer is unable to commit to the future terms of trade through a court-enforceable contract. Instead, to provide incentives for capacity investment, the buyer informally promises future terms of trade. The prospect of future interaction creates an incentive for the buyer to pay the supplier as promised. We characterize optimal price-only and price-and-quantity promises and compare their performance. If the production cost is low and either the capacity cost is low or the discount factor is high, then the buyer should promise to purchase a specific quantity rather than simply promise to pay a per unit price; otherwise, the buyer should simply promise to pay a specified unit price.

Title: Competition and Diversification Effects in Supply Chains with Supplier Default Risk
Abstract: We study the effects of disruption risk in a supply chain where one retailer deals with competing risky suppliers who may default during their production lead times. The suppliers, who compete for business with the retailer by setting wholesale prices, are leaders in a Stackelberg game with the retailer. The retailer, facing uncertain future demand, chooses order quantities while weighing the benefits of procuring from the cheapest supplier against the advantages of order diversification. For the model with two suppliers, we show that low supplier default correlations dampen competition among the suppliers, increasing the equilibrium wholesale prices. Therefore the retailer prefers suppliers with highly correlated default events, despite the loss of diversification benefits. In contrast, the suppliers and the channel prefer defaults that are negatively correlated. However, as the number of suppliers increases, our model predicts that the retailer may be able to take advantage of both competition and diversification.

Title: Managing a Bank's Currency Inventory Under New Federal Reserve Guidelines
Abstract: New currency recirculation guidelines implemented by the Federal Reserve System (Fed) of the United States are intended to reduce the overuse of its currency processing services by depository institutions (banks). These changes are expected to have a significant impact on operating policies at those depository institutions that handle large volumes of currency. We describe two business models that capture the flow of currency between a bank and the Fed; the first model captures the current operations of most banks, while the second is expected to be adapted by many banks in response to the new guidelines. Motivated by our work with Brink's, Inc., to assess the economic impact that banks will sustain from these guidelines, we present a detailed analysis that provides managers of banks with optimal strategies to manage the flow of currency to and from the Fed for a variety of cost structures and demand patterns. Given this insight into a bank's optimal behavior, the Fed can also use our analysis to fine tune its guidelines to achieve the desired goals.

Title: Workforce Agility in Repair and Maintenance Environments
Abstract: In this paper we consider workforce management in repair/maintenance environments in which repairmen are cross-trained to attend more than one type of machine. In this context, we study the machine-repairman problem with heterogeneous machines but with partially cross-trained repairmen. We introduce simple repairman-assignment rules as well as machine-priority rules that are effective in minimizing the machine downtime costs, or balancing the percentage of working machines of different types. We show that static machine priority rules are effective in minimizing systems downtime costs, while a generalized version of the longest queue policy is effective in balancing the percentage of working machines. We also introduce the concept of hidden symmetry in repair environments, and show that the well-known chain repairman skill set structure performs very well in repair environments with hidden symmetry. Finally, we provide insights into the design and control issues of repair/maintenance systems with cross-trained repairmen.

Title: Inspection and Replenishment Policies for Systems with Inventory Record Inaccuracy
Abstract: For many companies, inventory record inaccuracy is a major obstacle to achieving operational excellence. In this paper, we consider an inventory system in which inventory records are inaccurate. The manager makes inventory inspection and replenishment decisions at the beginning of each period. There is a cost associated with each inspection. If an inspection is performed, inventory records are aligned with physical inventory. The objective is to develop a joint inspection and replenishment policy that minimizes total costs in a finite horizon. We prove that an inspection adjusted base-stock (IABS) policy is optimal for the single-period problem. In the finite-horizon problem, we show that the IABS policy is near optimal in a numerical study. Under this policy, the manager performs an inspection if the inventory recorded is less than a threshold level, and orders up to a base-stock level that depends on the number of periods since the last inspection. The prevalent approach to deal with inventory inaccuracy in practice is to implement cycle-count programs. Based on the structure of the IABS policy, we propose a new cycle-count policy with state-dependent base-stock levels (CCABS). We show that CCABS is almost as effective as the IABS policy. In addition, we provide guidelines for practitioners to design effective cycle-count programs by conducting sensitivity analyses on the IABS policy. Finally, by comparing the costs associated with these policies and several benchmark systems, we quantify the true value of accurate inventory information, which may be provided by radio-frequency identification (RFID) systems.

Title: Production and Transportation Integration for a Make-to-Order Manufacturing Company with a Commit-to-Delivery Business Mode
Abstract: When a make-to-order manufacturing company adopts a commit-to-delivery business mode, it commits a delivery due date for an order and is responsible for the shipping cost. Without loss of generality, we consider that transportation is done by a third-party logistics company, such as FedEx or UPS, which provides multiple shipping modes such as overnight, one-day, two-day delivery, and more. When the transportation time has to be short, clearly, shipping cost is more expensive than it could have been. How should a company schedule production for accepted orders so that the company can leave enough transportation time for orders to take slow shipping modes to reduce the shipping cost? We study this problem of integrating the production and transportation functions for a manufacturing company producing a variety of customized products in a make-to-order environment with a commit-to-delivery mode of business. Various realistic scenarios are investigated in increasing order of complexity. When partial delivery is allowed by customers, we provide both a mixed-integer programming (MIP) model and a minimum cost flow model. We show that nonpreemptive earliest due date (NEDD) production schedules are optimal when partial delivery is allowed and shipping cost is a decreasing convex function with transportation time. When partial delivery is not allowed, we develop an MIP model and prove that the problem is NP-hard. An efficient heuristic algorithm with polynomial computation time is provided for the NP-hard problem. It gives near-optimal production schedules, as shown via thousands of numerical experiments. We also provide models and analysis for other scenarios where shipping cost accounts for customer locations and quantity discounts.

Title: Risk Ownership in Contract Manufacturing
Abstract: We consider a supply chain where a contract manufacturer (CM) serves a number of original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). Investment into productive resources is made before demand realization, hence the supply chain faces the risk of under- or overinvestment. The CM and OEMs differ in their forecast accuracy and in their resource pooling capabilities, leading to a disparity in their ability to minimize costs due to demand uncertainty. We consider two scenarios in which this risk is borne by the OEM and CM, respectively. We determine which party should bear the risk so that maximum supply chain profits are achieved. We investigate the effectiveness of premium-based schemes in inducing the best party to bear the risk, and conclude that they function well despite information asymmetry when double marginalization is not very high.

Title: Coordination Mechanisms for Supply Chains Under Price and Service Competition
Abstract: In a decentralized supply chain, with long-term competition between independent retailers facing random demands and buying from a common supplier, how should wholesale and retail prices be specified in an attempt to maximize supply-chain-wide profits? We show what types of coordination mechanisms allow the decentralized supply chain to generate aggregate expected profits equal to the optimal profits in a centralized system, and how the parameters of these (perfect) coordination schemes can be determined. We assume that the retailers face stochastic demand functions that may depend on all of the firms' prices as well as a measure of their service levels, e.g., the steady-state availability of the products. We systematically compare the coordination mechanisms when retailers compete only in terms of their prices, and when they engage in simultaneous price and service competition.

Title: Decentralization Cost in Scheduling: A Game-Theoretic Approach
Abstract: Decentralized organizations may incur inefficiencies because of scheduling issues associated with competition among decision makers (DMs) for limited resources. We analyze the decentralization cost (DC), i.e., the ratio between the Nash equilibrium cost and the cost attained at the centralized optimum. Solution properties of a dispatching-sequencing model are derived and subsequently used to develop bounds on the DC for an arbitrary number of jobs and DMs. A scheduling-based coordinating mechanism is then provided, ensuring that the centralized solution is obtained at equilibrium.

Title: Implementation of the Newsvendor Model with Clearance Pricing: How to (and How Not to) Estimate a Salvage Value
Abstract: The newsvendor model is designed to decide how much of a product to order when the product is to be sold over a short selling season with stochastic demand and there are no additional opportunities to replenish inventory. There are many practical situations that reasonably conform to those assumptions, but the traditional newsvendor model also assumes a fixed salvage value: all inventory left over at the end of the season is sold off at a fixed per-unit price. The fixed salvage value assumption is questionable when a clearance price is rationally chosen in response to the events observed during the selling season: a deep discount should be taken if there is plenty of inventory remaining at the end of the season, whereas a shallow discount is appropriate for a product with higher than expected demand. This paper solves for the optimal order quantity in the newsvendor model, assuming rational clearance pricing. We then study the performance of the traditional newsvendor model. The key to effective implementation of the traditional newsvendor model is choosing an appropriate fixed salvage value. (We show that an optimal order quantity cannot be generally achieved by merely enhancing the traditional newsvendor model to include a nonlinear salvage value function.) We demonstrate that several intuitive methods for estimating the salvage value can lead to an excessively large order quantity and a substantial profit loss. Even though the traditional model can result in poor performance, the model seems as if it is working correctly: the order quantity chosen is optimal given the salvage value inputted to the model, and the observed salvage value given the chosen order quantity equals the inputted one. We discuss how to estimate a salvage value that leads the traditional newsvendor model to the optimal or near-optimal order quantity. Our results highlight the importance of understanding how a model can interact with its own inputs: when inputs to a model are influenced by the decisions of the model, care is needed to appreciate how that interaction influences the decisions recommended by the model and how the model's inputs should be estimated.

Title: Two-Wholesale-Price Contracts: Push, Pull, and Advance-Purchase Discount Contracts
Abstract: The allocation of inventory ownership affects the inventory availability in a supply chain, which in turn determines the supply chain performance. In this paper, we consider a supplier-retailer supply chain in which the supplier starts production well in advance of the selling season, and the retailer is offered two ordering opportunities at different points in time. An early order is allowed before the supplier's production decision, and a late order is allowed after the completion of production and after observing the demand. When the two wholesale prices change, we illustrate how the inventory decision rights and ownership are shifted and/or shared between the two firms, resulting in push, pull, or advance-purchase discount contracts. We then characterize the complete set of Pareto-dominant contracts for any given two-wholesale-price contract. We find that Pareto improvement can be achieved when inventory ownership is shifted from individual to shared and sometimes vice versa. In the latter case, push contracts not only are more likely to offer Pareto improvement, but also can achieve higher supply chain efficiency than pull contracts. We also identify conditions that enable Pareto improvement by introducing a new ordering opportunity to firms that had been bound by a single ordering opportunity without renegotiating the existing wholesale price, and we demonstrate through a numerical study that the adoption of the new ordering opportunity can significantly improve supply chain efficiency. We show that such Pareto improvement is more likely to happen when demand is more volatile.

Title: Inventory, Speculation, and Sourcing Strategies in the Presence of Online Exchanges
Abstract: We study how online business-to-business (B2B) exchanges affect buyer-supplier relationships where an exchange takes the role of a secondary market in which buyers (of the initial product) can trade excess inventory to address supply and demand imbalances. Over the last several years, B2B exchanges have attempted to provide supply for storable industrial goods with some degree of design specification (as opposed to undifferentiated commodities). Through this research, we elucidate some aspects of how speculative online exchanges with a small number of participants might behave and the impact they will have on the use of long-term contracts for supply. By endogenizing the evolution of spot prices in response to buyers' and their supplier's actions, we produce price fluctuations that exhibit significant autocorrelation in such markets. We show that participating buyers accrue network benefits as the number of participating firms increases through the inventory-pooling effects, resulting in reduced costs for them. However, a supplier acting strategically will counteract such benefits by restricting availability of goods to the spot market, sacrificing short-term spot-market revenue for long-term contract volume.

Title: Optimal Due Date Assignment and Resource Allocation to Minimize the Weighted Number of Tardy Jobs on a Single Machine
Abstract: With the increased emphasis on the effective management of operational issues in supply chains, the timely delivery of products has become even more important. Companies have to quote attainable delivery dates and then meet these, or face large tardiness penalties. We study systems that can be modeled by single-machine scheduling problems with due date assignment and controllable job-processing times, which are either linear or convex functions of the amount of a continuously divisible and nonrenewable resource that is allocated to the task. The due date assignment methods studied include the common due date, the slack due date, which reflects equal waiting time allowance for the jobs, and the most general method of unrestricted due dates, when each job may be assigned a different due date. For each combination of due date assignment method and processing-time function, we provide a polynomial-time algorithm to find the optimal job sequence, due date values, and resource allocations that minimize an integrated objective function, which includes the weighted number of tardy jobs, and due date assignment, makespan, and total resource consumption costs.

Title: Strengthening the Empirical Base of Operations Management
Abstract: Isuggest that the prospering fields of physics, medicine, and finance illustrate the value of a strong empirical dimension to research that is well integrated with theoretical research. I use empirical research in these fields to formulate a framework for classifying empirical research and illustrate that framework with a few selected examples in operations management. I offer some advice on data sources and approaches to conducting empirical research and suggest ways strengthening empirical research in operations management. This is obviously a partial treatment of a large subject and represents my personal point of view. This paper should encourage comments by others to further develop the topic and to offer alternative points of view.

Title: Simple Models of Discrete Choice and Their Performance in Bandit Experiments
Abstract: Recent operations management papers model customers as solving multiarmed bandit problems, positing that consumers use a particular heuristic when choosing among suppliers. These papers then analyze the resulting competition among suppliers and mathematically characterize the equilibrium actions. There remains a question, however, as to whether the original customer models on which the analyses are built are reasonable representations of actual consumer choice. In this paper, we empirically investigate how well these choice rules match actual performance as people solve two-armed Bernoulli bandit problems. We find that some of the most analytically tractable models perform best in tests of model fit. We also find that the expected number of consecutive trials of a given supplier is increasing in its expected quality level, with increasing differences, a result consistent with the models' predictions as well as with loyalty effects described in the popular management literature.

Title: What Can Be Learned from Classical Inventory Models? A Cross-Industry Exploratory Investigation
Abstract: Classical inventory models offer a variety of insights into the optimal way to manage inventories of individual products. However, top managers and industry analysts are often concerned with the aggregate macroscopic view of a firm's inventory rather than with the inventories of individual products. Given that classical inventory models often do not account for many practical considerations that a company's management faces (e.g., competition, industry dynamics, business cycles, the financial state of the company and of the economy, etc.) and that they are derived at the product level and not the firm level, can insights from these models be used to explain the inventory dynamics of entire companies? This exploratory study aims to address this issue using empirical data. We analyze absolute and relative inventories using a quarterly data panel that contains 722 public U.S. companies for the period 1992-2002. We have chosen companies that are not widely diversified and whose business in large part relies on inventory management to concentrate on empirically testing hypotheses derived from a variety of classical inventory models (economic order quantity (EOQ), [Q, r], newsvendor, periodic review, etc.). We find empirical evidence that firms operating with more uncertain demand, longer lead times, and higher gross margins have larger inventories. Furthermore, larger companies appear to benefit from economies of scale and therefore have relatively less inventory than smaller companies. We obtain mixed evidence on the relationship between inventory levels and inventory holding costs. We also analyze the breakdown of data into eight segments--oil and gas, electronics, wholesale, retail, machinery, hardware, food, and chemicals--and find that, with a few notable exceptions, our hypotheses are supported within the segments as well. Overall, our results demonstrate that many of the predictions from classical inventory models extend beyond individual products to the aggregate firm level; hence, these models can help with high-level strategic choices in addition to tactical decisions.

Title: U.S. Retail and Wholesale Inventory Performance from 1981 to 2004
Abstract: This paper examines the inventories of publicly traded U.S. retail and wholesale companies between 1981 and 2004. First, we document that inventory holdings have been reduced. The median of wholesale inventory holding periods was reduced from 73 days to 49 days. Retail inventory did not start to decline until about 1995. Second, we document that firms with abnormally high inventories have abnormally poor long-term stock returns. Third, we illustrate these effects for the cases of Wal-Mart, 7-Eleven (Japan), and some related firms.

Title: In Search of the Bullwhip Effect
Abstract: The bullwhip effect is the phenomenon of increasing demand variability in the supply chain from downstream echelons (retail) to upstream echelons (manufacturing). The objective of this study is to document the strength of the bullwhip effect in industry-level U.S. data. In particular, we say an industry exhibits the bullwhip effect if the variance of the inflow of material to the industry (what macroeconomists often refer to as the variance of an industry's "production") is greater than the variance of the industry's sales. We find that wholesale industries exhibit a bullwhip effect, but retail industries generally do not exhibit the effect, nor do most manufacturing industries. Furthermore, we observe that manufacturing industries do not have substantially greater demand volatility than retail industries. Based on theoretical explanations for observing or not observing demand amplification, we are able to explain a substantial portion of the heterogeneity in the degree to which industries exhibit the bullwhip effect. In particular, the less seasonal an industry's demand, the more likely the industry amplifies volatility--highly seasonal industries tend to smooth demand volatility whereas nonseasonal industries tend to amplify.

Title: Estimating Demand Uncertainty Using Judgmental Forecasts
Abstract: Measuring demand uncertainty is a key activity in supply chain planning, but it is difficult when demand history is unavailable, such as for new products. One method that can be applied in such cases uses dispersion among forecasting experts as a measure of demand uncertainty. This paper provides a test for this method and presents a heteroscedastic regression model for estimating the variance of demand using dispersion among experts' forecasts and scale. We test this methodology using three data sets: demand data at item level, sales data at firm level for retailers, and sales data at firm level for manufacturers. We show that the variance of a random variable (demand and sales for our data sets) is positively correlated with both dispersion among experts' forecasts and scale: The variance increases sublinearly with dispersion and more than linearly with scale. Further, we use longitudinal data sets with sales forecasts made three to nine months before the earnings report date for retailers and manufacturers to show that the effects of dispersion and scale on variance of forecast error are consistent over time.

Title: An Empirical Study of System Improvement by Frontline Employees in Hospital Units
Abstract: This paper investigates the conditions under which frontline employees take initiative to improve their work systems to prevent operational failures. Drawing on the system improvement and team learning literatures, we develop a framework of frontline system improvement and test it using survey data from 37 workgroups. We find that psychological safety--the belief that one can talk about errors without risk of punishment--and problem-solving efficacy--the belief that the organization will support employees' system improvement efforts--were positively correlated with frontline system improvement (FLSI). Surprisingly, felt responsibility was negatively associated with FLSI. These findings suggest that rather than relying on hiring motivated individuals, managers need to support employees' efforts to improve their work systems by creating a work environment where it is safe to talk about operational failures and responding to employee communication about operational failures. Doing this may result in higher levels of FLSI efforts and ultimately improve work processes.

Title: The Effect of Operational Performance and Focus on Profitability: A Longitudinal Study of the U.S. Airline Industry
Abstract: We study the impact of operational performance on profitability in the context of the U.S. domestic airline industry. In addition, we investigate the impact of focus [Skinner, W. 1974. The focused factory. Harvard Bus. Rev. 52(3) 113-121] on profitability in services. We use quarterly data on all major carriers, available since the introduction of required reporting of service indicators to the U.S. Department of Transportation. Our analysis demonstrates two main points. First, the relationship between operational performance and profitability is contingent on a company's operating model; "focused" airlines show a link between late arrivals and profitability while full-service airlines do not. Also, capacity utilization is a stronger driver of profitability for full-service airlines than for focused airlines. Second, focused airlines outperform the rest of the industry in terms of profitability.

Title: Store Manager Incentive Design and Retail Performance: An Exploratory Investigation
Abstract: Store managers perform multiple tasks within a store, and the way in which they are evaluated and rewarded for these tasks affects their behavior. Using empirical data from multiple stores of a consumer electronics retailer, Tweeter Home Entertainment Group, we highlight the extent to which store manager incentive design impacts store manager behavior and, consequently, retail performance. More specifically, we describe the shift in store manager behavior resulting from a change in incentives, which, in part, altered the importance of sales relative to inventory shrinkage in the store manager compensation plan. Store managers, following this change, directed less attention to the prevention of inventory shrinkage and more toward sales-generating activities and made different process choices within the store. We observed increases in the level of inventory shrinkage and sales within these stores. Controlling for alternative drivers of sales and inventory shrinkage, we find this change in incentive design to be associated with a profit improvement of 4.2% of sales. This work indicates that altering how store managers are compensated impacts retail performance. Moreover, our findings underscore the importance of balancing the rewards given for different types of activities in contexts where agents face multiple competing tasks.

Title: Customer Efficiency, Channel Usage, and Firm Performance in Retail Banking
Abstract: Innovations in technology and service design have increasingly enabled firms to incorporate self-service technology to augment or substitute for "traditional" employee-provided service channels. Although it is clear that self-service can reduce cost, less is known about how customers utilize self-service channels in a multichannel service delivery system and the resulting impact on firm performance. An important aspect of service operations is that customers are coproducers of the service. Thus, the performance of the delivery system and customers' use of service channels can be affected by customers' own efficiency or productivity in service coproduction (customer efficiency). In this paper, we utilize prior theoretical frameworks in service operations and economics to hypothesize relationships among customer characteristics (especially coproduction efficiency), channel utilization, and firm performance. We then test these hypotheses using panel data from a large retail bank. Overall, we find that higher customer efficiency in self-service channels is associated with greater profitability and has a complex relationship with customer retention and product utilization.

Title: Examining the Influence of Operational Intellectual Capital on Capabilities and Performance
Abstract: Managers have long been challenged by an abundance of internal and external demands and uncertainties in their operating environments. Anecdotal evidence and a growing number of research studies have advocated process flexibility and product innovation as organization-level operating capabilities critical for responding to such demands and uncertainties, and have highlighted the need for more efficient and effective management of the firm's knowledge-based resources. Leveraging arguments from the resource-based and knowledge-based views of the firm, we introduce a second-order latent construct called operational intellectual capital, which represents the organization's operating know-how embedded in a system of complementary (i.e., covarying) knowledge-based resources. We argue that operational intellectual capital influences organization-level operating capabilities such as process flexibility and product innovation, which, in turn, influence business performance. We empirically examine these relationships using structural equation modeling on a cross-section of U.S. manufacturing survey data. Statistical results from the estimation of a coalignment model and comparisons with several other models support our operational intellectual capacity conceptualization and its impact on operating capabilities and business performance, respectively. Our research thus suggests the importance of possessing and leveraging a system of complementary knowledge-based operating resources, and addresses the need for the reformulation of operations strategy theory in terms of the emergent knowledge-based view of the firm.

Title: Project Performance and the Enabling Role of Information Technology: An Exploratory Study on the Role of Alignment
Abstract: As firms focus on new product, process, and service innovations, improving the performance and productivity of projects that help deliver these innovations assumes greater importance. Information technology (IT) has been an enabler of manufacturing productivity improvement, but its effect on improving the productivity of innovation-intensive operational activities has been mixed. In this paper, we explore the pathways through which IT impacts project-level performance measured in terms of speed, quality, and cost. Specifically, in this exploratory study we seek to present a theory of how the fit between enabling IT and the core characteristics of the project impacts project performance. We test our research hypotheses empirically, using a relatively large, cross-sectional sample of project data. The central contribution is the development and testing of a research model to improve our understanding of the relationship between enabling IT-project alignment, project competencies, and project performance. In doing so, our study clarifies the role of information technologies in project management, providing insights into how to integrate IT into innovation-intensive operational activities for improving project execution competence and productivity.

Title: Structural Properties of Buyback Contracts for Price-Setting Newsvendors
Abstract: This paper studies a buyback contract in the Stackelberg framework of a manufacturer (leader) selling to a price-setting newsvendor retailer (follower). Using an analytical model that focuses on a multiplicative demand form, we generalize previous results and produce new structural insights. A novel transformation technique first enables us to establish the unimodality of the profit functions for both channel partners, under relatively mild assumptions. Further analysis identifies the necessary and sufficient condition under which the optimal contract for the manufacturer (wholesale and buyback prices) is distribution free, i.e., independent of the uncertainty in customer demand. A specific instance of the above condition is also necessary and sufficient for a no-buyback contract to be optimal from the manufacturer's perspective. We then prove that the optimal performance of the decentralized channel for distribution-free buyback contracts depends only on the curvature of the deterministic demand part. In addition, some of the optimal decisions and relevant profit ratios for buyback contracts in our setting are shown to be identical to those for their deterministic price-only counterparts.

Title: Workforce Design with Movement Restrictions Between Workstation Groups
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the problem of determining the optimal size and composition of a permanent workforce needed to run a facility when demand is specified by a workstation group (WSG) for up to 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. For full-time employees, a solution is characterized by a bid job, which consists of a five-day-a-week schedule, a lunch break for all shifts, and a set of WSG task assignments for each of the half-hour periods in a shift. In contrast, each part-time employee may be given anywhere from one to six shifts during the week, and each shift may vary from four to eight hours in length. To facilitate supervision, all employees must be assigned to a home WSG, but when idle time exists in their schedules, they can be redeployed to other WSGs for a portion of the day. One of the complicating and unique factors addressed in this paper is the existence of nonsymmetric movement restrictions between WSGs. For example, an employee whose home base is A may be permitted to perform tasks at B, but not vice versa. Because the full problem could not be reduced to a single model, a multistage solution approach was developed. In the first stage, an extended shift-scheduling problem is solved to determine the optimal number of employees and their shifts. The results are postprocessed in subsequent stages to obtain lunch breaks, days off, and task assignments under WSG movement restrictions. In the implementation of the multistage approach, two alternatives were explored. The first was based on the idea of partitioning the WSGs into manageable clusters and then solving them in series. The second involved the direct solution of an integer programming formulation of the task assignment problem with home-base restrictions and WSG movement restrictions, but for a fixed workforce. An iterative scheme was used to adjust the size of the workforce until all constraints were satisfied and overall optimality was achieved. Testing was done with data provided by the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) mail processing and distribution center (P& DC) in Dallas. The computations showed that the second alternative always yielded the smaller workforce and was always able to find good solutions within 30 minutes.

Title: Demand Allocation in Systems with Multiple Inventory Locations and Multiple Demand Sources
Abstract: We consider the problem of allocating demand that originates from multiple sources among multiple inventory locations. Demand from each source arrives dynamically according to an independent Poisson process. The cost of fulfilling each order depends on both the source of the order and its fulfillment location. Inventory at all locations is replenished from a shared production facility with a finite production capacity and stochastic production times. Consequently, supply lead times are load dependent and affected by congestion at the production facility. Our objective is to determine an optimal demand allocation and optimal inventory levels at each location so that the sum of transportation, inventory, and backorder costs is minimized. We formulate the problem as a nonlinear optimization problem and characterize the structure of the optimal allocation policy. We show that the optimal demand allocations are always discrete, with demand from each source always fulfilled entirely from a single inventory location. We use this discreteness property to reformulate the problems as a mixed-integer linear program and provide an exact solution procedure. We show that this discreteness property extends to systems with other forms of supply processes. However, we also show that supply systems exist for which the property does not hold. Using numerical results, we examine the impact of different parameters and provide some managerial insights.

Title: OM Forum--Managing Customer Experiences: Perspectives on the Temporal Aspects of Service Encounters
Abstract: Aservice encounter is an experience that extends over time. Therefore, its effective management must include the control of the timing of the delivery of each of the service's elements and the enhancement of the customer's experience between and during the delivery of the various elements. This paper provides a conceptual framework that links the duration of a service encounter to behaviors that have been shown to affect profitability. Analysis of the framework reveals a wide gap between the behavioral assumptions typically made in operations research (OR) and operations management (OM) models and the state of the art in the marketing and psychology literature. The central motivations behind this paper are (1) to help the OR and OM community bridge this gap by bringing to its attention recent findings from the behavioral literature that have implications for the design of queueing systems for service firms and (2) to identify opportunities for further research.

Title: Maximum Profit Scheduling
Abstract: The classical scheduling literature considers many problems where a given set of jobs must be processed at minimum cost, subject to various resource constraints. The literature only considers the issue of revenue generation in a very limited way, by allowing a job to remain unprocessed and its revenue contribution to be lost. By contrast, we consider three diverse practical situations where efficient scheduling affects revenue in much more general and realistic ways. First, we study two make-to-order environments where efficient scheduling increases customer goodwill, thus stimulating demand in different ways. Second, we study two make-to-stock environments where efficient scheduling creates inventory, thus also stimulating demand in different ways. Third, we study new product markets where efficient scheduling leads to a company becoming the first mover, and thus acquiring a larger market share. In each case, we provide both a computationally efficient algorithm for scheduling and a proof that a much more efficient algorithm is unlikely to exist. For both the make-to-stock and make-to-order problems, we also describe heuristic approaches that are easy to implement, and we study their average performance. The results show that substantial benefits arise from considering the implications of efficient scheduling for revenue and net profit. The practical impact of our work is to demonstrate the importance of efficient scheduling, not only in controlling cost, but also in increasing revenue and net profit.

Title: An Approach to Securely Identifying Beneficial Collaboration in Decentralized Logistics Systems
Abstract: The problem of sharing manufacturing, inventory, or capacity to improve performance is applicable in many decentralized operational contexts. However, the solution of such problems commonly requires an intermediary or a broker to manage information security concerns of individual participants. Our goal is to examine use of cryptographic techniques to attain the same result without the use of a broker. To illustrate this approach, we focus on a problem faced by independent trucking companies that have separate pick-up and delivery tasks and wish to identify potential efficiency-enhancing task swaps while limiting the information they must reveal to identify these swaps. We present an algorithm that finds opportunities to swap loads without revealing any information except the loads swapped, along with proofs of the security of the protocol. We also show that it is incentive compatible for each company to correctly follow the protocol as well as provide their true data. We apply this algorithm to an empirical data set from a large transportation company and present results that suggest significant opportunities to improve efficiency through Pareto improving swaps. This paper thus uses cryptographic arguments in an operations management problem context to show how an algorithm can be proven incentive compatible as well as demonstrate the potential value of its use on an empirical data set.

Title: Designing Optimal Preannounced Markdowns in the Presence of Rational Customers with Multiunit Demands
Abstract: We analyze the optimal design of a markdown pricing mechanism with preannounced prices. In the presence of limited supply, buyers who choose to purchase at a lower price may face a scarcity in supply. Our focus is on the structure of the optimal markdown mechanisms in the presence of rational or strategic buyers who demand multiple units. We first examine a complete information setting where the set of customer valuations is known but the seller does not know the valuation of each individual customer (i.e., cannot exercise perfect price discrimination). We then generalize our analysis to an incomplete valuation information setting where customer valuations are drawn from known distributions. For both settings, we compare the seller's profit resulting from the optimal markdown mechanism and the optimal single price. We provide a number of managerial insights into designing profitable markdown mechanisms.

Title: Design Architecture and Introduction Timing for Rapidly Improving Industrial Products
Abstract: Technological advances present firms in many industries with opportunities to substantially improve their product's capabilities in short periods of time. Customers who invest in these products may, however, react adversely to rapid improvements that make their previous versions obsolete by deferring their purchase. In industrial markets, there is an emerging trend of sequentially improving products designed to be upgraded in a modular fashion. We study the impact of product architecture and introduction timing on the launch of rapidly improving products. We find that by localizing performance improvements in a sequence of upgradable modules of the product, a firm can better manage the introduction of rapidly improving products. Specifically, we show that modular upgradability can reduce the need for slowing the pace of innovation or forgoing upgrade pricing. The additional flexibility in pricing and timing makes the modular, upgradable approach preferable to an integrated architecture, even in some situations where there may be distinct performance or cost-related disadvantages to pursuing the modular architecture. We differentiate between proprietary and nonproprietary approaches to modular upgradability and consider the implications for profits. Our central contribution in this paper is the innovative integration of product architecture with pricing and timing decisions for managing the introduction of rapidly improving products.

Title: Improving Performance in Cyclic Production Systems by Using Forced Variable Idle Setup Time
Abstract: In the early 1990s, research began to show that the Japanese production theory, which espouses reduction of machine setup time as a sure way to improve production performance, may be limited. Specifically, it was found that reduction in mean setup times without any change in variance can, paradoxically, increase waiting time and work in process (WIP) in a cyclic production system. Setup time variance was demonstrated to play a central role because of the paradoxes it produced with the resulting harm to effective capacity. Subsequently, explicit formulas were derived for determining whether adding fixed forced idle time (but holding variance constant) would reduce waiting time and, if so, the optimal amount of idle time to add. However, research to date has offered little guidance to reduce setup time variance to improve waiting time. We show that a greater reduction is achievable by adding a variable idle time that is a nonincreasing function of setup time and thereby reduce the combined setup time variance. We provide explicit procedures for finding the optimal variable idle time as a function of setup time when the latter follows any finite discrete distribution. We also show how to implement our policy and show that our approach can improve waiting time even when other currently known approaches cannot.

Title: Load-Based POLCA: An Integrated Material Control System for Multiproduct, Multimachine Job Shops
Abstract: This article proposes a supporting framework for the implementation of the material control system POLCA (paired-cell overlapping loops of cards with authorization). The POLCA system is particularly appropriate for environments that involve highly variable demand and large product variety, which force small batch (or even one-of-a-kind) production. We propose a load-based version of the POLCA control system (LB-POLCA), which determines the POLCA parameters (release authorizations, allowed workloads in the loops) according to an advanced resources planning (ARP) system that adequately captures the stochastic behavior of the production system and enables fine-tuning and high-level optimization of the manufacturing lot sizes. We also discuss the implementation of an electronic LB-POLCA system in a metal shop of Spicer Off-Highway Products Division, a subsidiary of the Dana Corporation.

Title: Note--Replenishment Sequencing in a Supply Chain with Balanced Ordering
Abstract: This paper studies a supply chain with one supplier and multiple heterogeneous retailers where base-stock policies are practiced. The supplier's performance, in terms of optimal cost, optimal stocking level, and implied service level, is investigated under different retailer replenishment sequences. We show that under many realistic demand distributions, it is optimal to sequence retailers according to ascending variability. Furthermore, if the retailers vary in magnitudes of their orders, then the optimal sequence is usually the one with descending magnitudes.

Title: Mass Customization vs. Mass Production: Variety and Price Competition
Abstract: We study competition between two multiproduct firms with distinct production technologies in a market where customers have heterogeneous preferences on a single taste attribute. The mass customizer (MC) has a perfectly flexible production technology and thus can offer any variety within a product space, represented by Hotelling's linear city. The mass producer (MP) has a more focused production technology and therefore offers a finite set of products in the same space. The MP can invest in more flexible technology, which reduces its cost of variety and hence allows it to offer a larger set of products; in the extreme, the MP can emulate the MC's technology and offer infinite variety. The firms simultaneously decide whether to enter the market, and the MP chooses its degree of product-mix flexibility on entry. Next, the MP designs its product line--i.e., the number and position of its products--the MC's perfectly flexible technology makes this unnecessary. Finally, both firms simultaneously set prices. We analyze the subgame-perfect Nash equilibrium in this three-stage game, allowing firm-specific fixed and variable costs that together characterize their production technology. We find that an MP facing competition from an MC offers lower product variety than an MP monopolist to reduce the intensity of price competition. We also find that the MP can survive this competition, even if it has higher fixed cost of production technology, higher marginal cost of production, or both.

Title: Integrating the Promotional and Service Roles of Retail Inventories
Abstract: In some retail contexts, higher inventories not only improve service levels, but also stimulate demand by serving as a promotional tool (e.g., by increasing product visibility). Motivated by a building-products retailer's practice of stocking large quantities of products to stimulate demand, we study inventory management and pricing policies when demand is uncertain but increases with stocking quantity. We first characterize the profit-maximization policy for a stochastic inventory model with a general inventory-dependent demand distribution and given price, and show that demand stimulation (by inventories) has the effect of increasing the target service level beyond the classical newsvendor model's critical fractile ratio. To underscore the importance of considering both demand stochasticity and inventory influence, we consider two functionally oriented benchmark policies--a demand-driven policy and a critical fractile policy--that might, respectively, represent marketing and inventory managers' viewpoints. Our numerical analysis reveals that the optimal policy can generate considerably higher profits than the two complementary functional perspectives. Moreover, we prove that the optimal stocking quantity always exceeds the critical fractile solution and can even exceed the demand-driven stocking quantity. We also address the problem of jointly optimizing both stocking quantity and price for demand-stimulating products using a multiplicative model to represent the influence of price and stocking quantity on the demand distribution. For this model, we show that the pricing and stocking decisions can be determined sequentially, with the optimal policy setting higher prices and stock levels than both the functional policies.

Title: Dynamic Inventory Management with Learning About the Demand Distribution and Substitution Probability
Abstract: Awell-known result in the Bayesian inventory management literature is: If lost sales are not observed, the Bayesian optimal inventory level is larger than the myopic inventory level (one should "stock more" to learn about the demand distribution). This result has been proven in other studies under the assumption that inventory is perishable, so the myopic inventory level is equal to the Bayesian optimal inventory level with observed lost sales. We break that equivalence by considering nonperishable inventory. We prove that with nonperishable inventory, the famous "stock more" result is often reversed to "stock less," in that the Bayesian optimal inventory level with unobserved lost sales is lower than the myopic inventory level. We also prove that making lost sales unobservable increases the Bayesian optimal inventory level; in this specific sense, the famous "stock more" result of other studies generalizes to the case of nonperishable inventory. When the product is out of stock, a customer may accept a substitute or choose not to purchase. We incorporate learning about the probability of substitution. This reduces the Bayesian optimal inventory level in the case that lost sales are observed. Reducing the inventory level has two beneficial effects: to observe and learn more about customer substitution behavior and (for a nonperishable product) to reduce the probability of overstocking in subsequent periods. Finally, for a capacitated production-inventory system under continuous review, we derive maximum likelihood estimators (MLEs) of the demand rate and probability that customers will wait for the product. (Accepting a raincheck for delivery at some later time is a common type of substitution.) We investigate how the choice of base-stock level and production rate affect the convergence rate of these MLEs. The results reinforce those for the Bayesian, uncapacitated, periodic review system.

Title: Retail Inventory Management When Records Are Inaccurate
Abstract: Inventory record inaccuracy is a significant problem for retailers using automated inventory management systems. In this paper, we consider an intelligent inventory management tool that accounts for record inaccuracy using a Bayesian belief of the physical inventory level. We assume that excess demands are lost and unobserved, in which case sales data reveal information about physical inventory levels. We show that a probability distribution on physical inventory levels is a sufficient summary of past sales and replenishment observations, and that this probability distribution can be efficiently updated in a Bayesian fashion as observations are accumulated. We also demonstrate the use of this distribution as the basis for practical replenishment and inventory audit policies and illustrate how the needed parameters can be estimated using data from a large national retailer. Our replenishment policies avoid the problem of "freezing," in which a physical inventory position persists at zero while the corresponding record is positive. In addition, simulation studies show that our replenishment policies recoup much of the cost of inventory record inaccuracy, and that our audit policy significantly outperforms the popular "zero balance walk" audit policy.

Title: Strategic Inventory Placement in Supply Chains: Nonstationary Demand
Abstract: The life cycle of new products is becoming shorter and shorter in all markets. For electronic products, life cycles are measured in units of months, with 6- to 12-month life cycles being common. Given these short product life cycles, product demand is increasingly difficult to forecast. Furthermore, demand is never really stationary because the demand rate evolves over the life of the product. In this paper, we consider the problem of where in a supply chain to place strategic safety stocks to provide a high level of service to the final customer with minimum cost. We extend our model for stationary demand to the case of nonstationary demand, as might occur for products with short life cycles. We assume that we can model the supply chain as a network, that each stage in the supply chain operates with a periodic review base-stock policy, that demand is bounded, and that there is a guaranteed service time between every stage and its customers. We consider a constant service time (CST) policy for which the safety stock locations are stationary; the actual safety stock levels change as the demand process changes. We show that the optimization algorithm for the case of stationary demand extends directly to determining the safety stocks when demand is nonstationary for a CST policy. We then examine with an illustrative example how well the CST policy performs relative to a dynamic policy that dynamically modifies the service times. In addition, we report on numerical tests that demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed solution and how it would be deployed.

CORC Technical Report TR-2004-01, Department of Industrial Engineering and Operations Research, Columbia University, New York.] recently proposed a choice-based deterministic linear programming model (CDLP) for network revenue management (RM) that parallels the widely used deterministic linear programming (DLP) model. While they focused on analyzing "flexible products"--a situation in which the provider has the flexibility of using a collection of products (e.g., different flight times and/or itineraries) to serve the same market demand (e.g., an origin-destination connection)--their approach has broader implications for understanding choice-based RM on a network. In this paper, we explore the implications in detail. Specifically, we characterize optimal offer sets (sets of available network products) by extending to the network case a notion of "efficiency" developed by Talluri and van Ryzin [Talluri, K. T., G. J. van Ryzin. 2004. Revenue management under a general discrete choice model of consumer behavior. Management Sci. 50 15-33.] for the single-leg, choice-based RM problem. We show that, asymptotically, as demand and capacity are scaled up, only these efficient sets are used in an optimal policy. This analysis suggests that efficiency is a potentially useful approach for identifying "good" offer sets on networks, as it is in the case of single-leg problems. Second, we propose a practical decomposition heuristic for converting the static CDLP solution into a dynamic control policy. The heuristic is quite similar to the familiar displacement-adjusted virtual nesting (DAVN) approximation used in traditional network RM, and it significantly improves on the performance of the static LP solution. We illustrate the heuristic on several numerical examples.

Title: Cooperation Between Multiple Newsvendors with Warehouses
Abstract: This study considers a supply chain that consists of n retailers, each facing a newsvendor problem, and m warehouses. The retailers are supplied with a single product via some warehouses. In these warehouses, the ordered amounts of goods of these retailers become available after some lead time. At the time that the goods arrive at the warehouses, demand realizations are known by the retailers. The retailers can increase their expected joint profits if they can coordinate their orders and make allocations after demand realization. For this setting, we consider an associated cooperative game between the retailers. We show that this associated cooperative game has a nonempty core. Finally, we introduce a noncooperative game, where the retailers decide on their order quantities individually, and show that the set of payoff vectors resulting from strong Nash equilibria corresponds to the core of the associated cooperative game.

Title: Note--Further Improvements on Base-Stock Approximations for Independent Stochastic Lead Times with Order Crossover
Abstract: When inventory replenishments can arrive in a different sequence than the one in which they were placed, it is important to use the shortfall distribution to set the base-stock level. Because the exact shortfall distribution is quite difficult to compute, heuristics are commonly used in its stead. Bradley and Robinson [Bradley, J. R., L. W. Robinson. 2005. Improved base-stock approximations for independent stochastic lead times with order crossover. Manufacturing Service Oper. Management 7 319-329.] developed an upper bound on the variance of the number of outstanding orders that they used within a normal approximation of the shortfall distribution. In this short note, we tighten their upper bound and use it within a beta approximation of the shortfall distribution to derive a policy whose costs average only 0.05% above that of the optimal.

Title: Optimal Pricing of Seasonal Products in the Presence of Forward-Looking Consumers
Abstract: We study the optimal pricing of a finite quantity of a fashion-like seasonal good in the presence of forward-looking (strategic) customers. We distinguish between two classes of pricing strategies: contingent and announced fixed-discount. In both cases, the seller acts as a Stackelberg leader announcing his pricing strategy, while consumers act as followers taking the seller's strategy as given and determining their purchasing behavior. In each case, we identify a subgame-perfect Nash equilibrium and show that given the seller's strategy, the equilibrium in the consumer subgame is unique and consists of symmetric threshold purchasing policies. For both cases, we develop a benchmark model in which customers are nonstrategic (myopic). We conduct a comprehensive numerical study to explore the impact of strategic consumer behavior on pricing policies and expected revenue performance. We show that strategic customer behavior suppresses the benefits of price segmentation, particularly under medium-to-high values of heterogeneity and modest rates of decline in valuations. However, when the level of consumer heterogeneity is small, the rate of decline is medium-to-high, and the seller can optimally choose the time of discount in advance, segmentation can be used quite effectively even with strategic consumers. We find that the seller cannot avoid the adverse impact of strategic consumer behavior even under low levels of initial inventory. We argue that while the seller expects customers to be more concerned about product availability at discount time, he cannot use high-price "betting" strategies as he would in the case of low inventory and myopic customers. Under certain qualifications, announced fixed-discount strategies perform essentially the same as contingent pricing policies in the case of myopic consumers. However, under strategic consumer behavior, announced pricing policies can be advantageous to the seller, compared to contingent pricing schemes. Interestingly, those cases that announced discount strategies offer a significant advantage compared to contingent pricing policies. They appear to offer only a minimal advantage in comparison to fixed-pricing policies. Finally, when the seller incorrectly assumes that strategic customers are myopic in their purchasing decisions, it can be quite costly, reaching potential revenue losses of about 20%.

Title: Pricing Promotional Products Under Upselling
Abstract: Upselling is offering an additional product to a customer who just made a purchase. Most catalogers and online sellers, in addition to some traditional retailers, use upselling often to clear inventories of slow-moving items. We investigate the pricing and discounting questions for such an item, which we call the promotional product. In our model, an arriving customer may purchase this promotional product or one of the other products that the firm sells. If the customer purchases one of the other products, the promotional product is offered to the customer, possibly with a discount. While deciding whether to offer a discount and, if so, how big a discount to offer, the firm uses the information that the customer has just bought a certain product with a certain price. We investigate how discounting decisions depend on the inventory levels, time, type of pricing policy in use, and the relationship between the customers' reservation prices for the promotional product and the other products (negatively or positively correlated). In particular, we find that if the firm sets prices and discounts dynamically and the customers' reservation prices for the promotional product are negatively correlated with their reservation prices for the product they purchased, then customers are always offered a discount regardless of the inventory levels and time. On the other hand, if the customers' reservation prices for the promotional product are positively correlated with their reservation prices for the product they purchased, then the customer may or may not be offered a discount, depending on the inventory levels and time. Our numerical study shows that the benefit to the firm from using customer purchase information is high when the firm uses a static price, but chooses discounts dynamically. We also find that although dynamic discounting decisions bring modest improvements, setting the price dynamically seems to have a more significant effect on the firm's profits.

Title: Competitive Customization
Abstract: We consider a duopoly market with heterogeneous customer tastes. The firms play a two-stage game. First, each firm chooses whether to invest in mass customization, which would enable it to offer customized products that increasingly match each customer's ideal product as the chosen customization level increases. A firm that chooses not to invest in mass customization serves a standard product. Second, the firms competitively price their product lines. We characterize each firm's investment in mass customization and study its dependence on competitive position, as determined by its cost efficiency and perceived quality vis--vis its competitor. We find that the value of mass customization critically depends on the firm's competitive position. It may not be desirable even at zero cost due to its negative effect on price competition. A firm with an overall cost and quality disadvantage never unilaterally adopts mass customization. We show that allowing firms to set different prices for each product configuration leads to a broader adoption of mass customization compared to when they are restricted to uniform prices. However, a firm's chosen customization level may be higher with uniform prices. Our analysis also helps a customizing firm determine whether to target its process improvement efforts for a lower cost or a higher customization level.

Title: Interday Forecasting and Intraday Updating of Call Center Arrivals
Abstract: Accurate forecasting of call arrivals is critical for staffing and scheduling of a telephone call center. We develop methods for interday and dynamic intraday forecasting of incoming call volumes. Our approach is to treat the intraday call volume profiles as a high-dimensional vector time series. We propose first to reduce the dimensionality by singular value decomposition of the matrix of historical intraday profiles and then to apply time series and regression techniques. Our approach takes into account both interday (or day-to-day) dynamics and intraday (or within-day) patterns of call arrivals. Distributional forecasts are also developed. The proposed methods are data driven, appear to be robust against model assumptions in our simulation studies, and are shown to be very competitive in out-of-sample forecast comparisons using two real data sets. Our methods are computationally fast; it is therefore feasible to use them for real-time dynamic forecasting.

Title: Simple Methods for Shift Scheduling in Multiskill Call Centers
Abstract: This paper introduces a new method for shift scheduling in multiskill call centers. The method consists of two steps. First, staffing levels are determined, and next, in the second step, the outcomes are used as input for the scheduling problem. The scheduling problem relies on a linear programming model that is easy to implement and has short computation times, i.e., a fraction of a second. Therefore, it is useful for different purposes and it can be part of an iterative procedure: for example, one that combines shifts into rosters.

Title: A Simple Staffing Method for Multiskill Call Centers
Abstract: We study a simple method for staffing in multiskill call centers. The method has short computation times and determines nearly optimal staffing levels. It is in both views competitive to other methods from the literature. Because of the fast and accurate performance of the method, many different scenarios can be analyzed, and our method can be used for both tactical and strategic capacity management decisions.

Title: Usage Restriction and Subscription Services: Operational Benefits with Rational Users
Abstract: This paper studies a rental firm that offers reusable products to price- and quality-of-service-sensitive customers--Netflix or Blockbuster can be thought of as the canonical example. Customers' perception of quality is determined by their likelihood of obtaining the product or service immediately upon request. We study the alternatives of offering either a subscription option that limits the number of concurrent rentals in return for a flat fee per-unit time, or a pay-per-use option with no such restriction. Customers are assumed to desire a nominal usage rate of the product, which they meet by adjusting their request rate in either option. Thus, they have a higher request rate in the subscription option. We propose a Markov chain model for customer behavior under the subscription option equivalent to the standard Poisson model under the pay-per-use option. In a large market setting, assuming exponential demand, we show that using the subscription option is more profitable for the firm. Further, via a numerical study, we show that this assumption is not essential for the result to hold. However, we show that the subscription option does not necessarily dominate the pay-per-use option in quality of service. The firm manages the trade-off between price and quality of service better in the subscription option. Moreover, we show that social welfare and the consumer surplus can also be higher in the subscription option, indicating that both the firm and the consumers can benefit from the subscription option.

Title: Computing Virtual Nesting Controls for Network Revenue Management Under Customer Choice Behavior
Abstract: We consider a revenue management, network capacity control problem in a setting where heterogeneous customers choose among the various products offered by a firm (e.g., different flight times, fare classes, and/or routings). Customers may therefore substitute if their preferred products are not offered. These individual customer choice decisions are modeled as a very general stochastic sequence of customers, each of whom has an ordered list of preferences. Minimal assumptions are made about the statistical properties of this demand sequence. We assume that the firm controls the availability of products using a virtual nesting control strategy and would like to optimize the protection levels for its virtual classes accounting for the (potentially quite complex) choice behavior of its customers. We formulate a continuous demand and capacity approximation for this problem, which allows for the partial acceptance of requests for products. The model admits an efficient calculation of the sample path gradient of the network revenue function. This gradient is then used to construct a stochastic steepest ascent algorithm. We show the algorithm converges in probability to a stationary point of the expected revenue function under mild conditions. The algorithm is relatively efficient even on large network problems, and in our simulation experiments it produces significant revenue increases relative to traditional virtual nesting methods. On a large-scale, real-world airline example using choice behavior models fit to actual booking data, the method produced an estimated 10% improvement in revenue relative to the controls used by the airline. The examples also provide interesting insights into how protection levels should be adjusted to account for choice behavior. Overall, the results indicate that choice behavior has a significant impact on both capacity control decisions and revenue performance and that our method is a viable approach for addressing the problem.

Title: An Analysis of the Control-Algorithm Re-solving Issue in Inventory and Revenue Management
Abstract: While inventory- and revenue-management problems can be represented as Markov decision process (MDP) models, in some cases the well-known dynamic-programming curse of dimensionality makes it computationally prohibitive to solve them exactly. An alternative solution, called here the control-algorithm approach, is to use a math program (MP) to approximately represent the MDP and use its optimal solution to heuristically instantiate the parameters of the decision rules of a given set of control policies. As new information is observed over time, the control algorithm can incorporate it by re-solving the MP and revising the parameters of the decision rules with the newly obtained solution. The re-solving issue arises when one reflects on the consequences of this revision: Does the performance of the control algorithm really improve by revising its decision-rule instantiation with the solution of the re-solved MP, or should an appropriate modification of the prior solution be used? This paper analyzes the control-algorithm re-solving issue for a class of finite-horizon inventory- and revenue-management problems. It establishes sufficient conditions under which re-solving does not deteriorate the performance of a control algorithm, and it applies these results to control algorithms for network revenue management and multiproduct make-to-order production with lost sales and positive lead time.

Title: Facility Location with Stochastic Demand and Constraints on Waiting Time
Abstract: We analyze the problem of optimal location of a set of facilities in the presence of stochastic demand and congestion. Customers travel to the closest facility to obtain service; the problem is to determine the number, locations, and capacity of the facilities. Under rather general assumptions (spatially distributed continuous demand, general arrival and service processes, and nonlinear location and capacity costs) we show that the problem can be decomposed, and construct an efficient optimization algorithm. The analysis yields several insights, including the importance of equitable facility configurations (EFCs), the behavior of optimal and near-optimal capacities, and robust class of solutions that can be constructed for this problem.
Keywords: facility location, stochastic demand, queueing, service level

Title: Just-in-Time Smoothing Through Batching
Abstract: This paper presents two methods to solve the production smoothing problem in mixed-model just-in-time (JIT) systems with large setup and processing time variability between different models the systems produce. The problem is motivated by production planning at a leading U.S. automotive pressure hose manufacturer. One method finds all Pareto-optimal solutions that minimize total production rate variation of models and work in process (WIP), and maximize system utilization and responsiveness. These Pareto-optimal solutions are found efficiently in polynomial time with respect to total demand by an algorithm proposed in the paper. The other method relies on Daniel Webster's method of apportionment for production smoothing, which produces periodic, uniform, and reflective production sequences that can improve operations management of the JIT systems. Finally, the paper presents the results of a computational experiment with the two methods.

Title: Learning by Doing in the Newsvendor Problem: A Laboratory Investigation of the Role of Experience and Feedback
Abstract: We investigate learning by doing in the newsvendor inventory problem. An earlier study observed that decision makers tend to anchor their orders around average demand and fail to adjust sufficiently toward the expected profit-maximizing order. Principles of behavioral theory suggest some relatively simple interventions into the decision maker's experience and feedback that might improve performance, and these guide our investigation. The results imply that the institutional organization of experience and feedback may have a significant influence on whether inventory is stocked optimally.

Title: Newsvendors Under Simultaneous Price and Inventory Competition
Abstract: This paper extends the theory of N competitive newsvendors to the case where competition occurs simultaneously in price and inventory. The basic research questions are whether the Nash equilibrium exists in this game, whether it is unique, and how the resulting inventories and prices are affected by competition. Using a novel method, we show the quasiconcavity of the competitive newsvendor's problem and establish the existence of the pure-strategy Nash equilibrium. Through a contraction mapping approach, we develop sufficient conditions for the Nash equilibrium to be unique. We then analyze the properties of the equilibrium and compare it with the optimal solution for the (noncompeting) price-sensitive newsvendor. We prove that at a symmetric equilibrium, retail prices and safety stocks strictly increase with the proportion of a newsvendor's unsatisfied customers that switch to a competitor, but strictly decrease with the intensity of price competition. Total inventories, on the other hand, increase with the intensity of price competition. Furthermore, the competitive equilibrium never has lower safety stocks and higher retail prices (a situation that definitely hurts the customers) than the solution for noncompetitive newsvendors.

Title: How Improved Forecasts Can Degrade Decentralized Supply Chains
Abstract: This research studies the impact of improved forecasts on the members of a two-stage supply chain. The supplier builds capacity based on original forecast information, and the manufacturer places its order after observing improved (but imperfect) demand information. We study three types of wholesale price purchasing arrangements: (1) when the wholesale price is determined to be exogenous to the supply chain; (2) when the supplier sets the wholesale price; and (3) when the manufacturer sets the wholesale price. Although improved demand information reduces the demand uncertainty that the manufacturer faces, the manufacturer is constrained by the supplier's capacity decision. In all three cases, we show that improved information can decrease the supply chain's expected profit, even as the supplier's capacity increases with improved information. Because improved demand information always increases the centralized supply chain's expected profit, we present a contract that coordinates the channel and provides flexibility in dividing systemwide profit.

Title: Introduction to the Special Issue on Behavioral Operations
Abstract: The observed behavior of customers and managers often does not fit the assumptions of theoretical models used in the operations management (OM) literature. New research in behavioral OM is emerging to bridge the gap between traditional models and these newer observational findings. This work is both deductive and inductive, and it draws on multiple reference disciplines: experimental and behavioral economics, judgment and decision making from psychology, and organizational behavior and decision analysis from management. This special issue presents seven interesting papers that reflect the wide range of current research activity in behavioral OM. These papers provide insightful and thought-provoking introduction to this new direction in OM research.

Title: Bounded Rationality in Newsvendor Models
Abstract: Many theoretical models adopt a normative approach and assume that decision makers are perfect optimizers. In contrast, this paper takes a descriptive approach and considers bounded rationality, in the sense that decision makers are prone to errors and biases. Our decision model builds on the quantal choice model: While the best decision need not always be made, better decisions are made more often. We apply this framework to the classic newsvendor model and characterize the ordering decisions made by a boundedly rational decision maker. We identify systematic biases and offer insight into when overordering and underordering may occur. We also investigate the impact of these biases on several other inventory settings that have traditionally been studied using the newsvendor model as a building block, such as supply chain contracting, the bullwhip effect, and inventory pooling. We find that incorporating decision noise and optimization error yields results that are consistent with some anomalies highlighted by recent experimental findings.

Title: Newsvendor "Pull-to-Center" Effect: Adaptive Learning in a Laboratory Experiment
Abstract: In the newsvendor game, the expected-profit-maximizing order quantity is higher in the demand interval when the per-unit profit margin is high and lower in the demand interval when the per-unit profit margin is low. However, laboratory experiments show a "pull-to-center" effect: average order quantities are too low when they should be high and vice versa. We replicate this pull-to-center effect in laboratory experiments and construct an adaptive learning model that incorporates memory, reinforcement, and probabilistic choice to explain individual decisions. The intuition underlying the model's prediction is that the most recent demand observation is more likely to have been greater than the optimal order quantity if the optimal order quantity is low, in which case a recency bias tends to pull the order quantity upward. A countervailing downward pull exists if the optimal order quantity is high. The recency effect may be augmented by a reinforcement bias, which causes subjects to focus more on the profitability of decisions they actually make and less on counterfactual payoffs that would have resulted from other order quantities. The predictions of this model track the observed data patterns across treatments. A pull-to-center pattern is also observed in designs involving doubled payoffs and reduced order frequency.

Title: Inventory Service-Level Agreements as Coordination Mechanisms: The Effect of Review Periods
Abstract: Asupplier stocking goods for delivery to a retailer may face a (finite-horizon) service-level agreement (SLA). In this context, the SLA is a commitment by a supplier to achieve a minimum fill rate over a specified time horizon. This kind of SLA is an important, but understudied coordination mechanism. We focus on the impact of two contract parameters: the length of the review period and the magnitude of the bonus for meeting or exceeding the service-level target. For a supplier following a base stock (order-up-to) inventory policy, increasing the bonus increases optimal supplier stocking levels, whereas lengthening the review period may increase or decrease optimal stocking levels. We investigate these mechanisms in a controlled laboratory setting and find that longer review periods are generally more effective than shorter review periods in inducing higher stocking levels. As in several earlier laboratory studies, the explanation lies in the improved feedback reliability that longer review periods provide. The primary managerial implication of our findings is that, in practice, longer review periods may be more effective than shorter ones at inducing service improvements.

Title: Decision Biases in Revenue Management: Some Behavioral Evidence
Abstract: We study a problem of selling a fixed number of goods over a finite and known horizon. After presenting a procedure for computing optimal decision policies and some numerical results of a simple heuristic policy for the problem, we describe results from three experiments involving financially motivated subjects. The experiments reveal that decision makers employ decision policies of the same form of the optimal policy. However, they show systematic biases to demand too much when they have many units to sell and too little when they have few to sell, resulting in significant revenue losses.

Title: A Model of Fair Process and Its Limits
Abstract: Fair process research has shown that people care not only about outcomes, but also about the process that produces these outcomes. For a decision process to be seen as fair, the people affected must have the opportunity to give input and possibly to influence the decision, and the decision process and rationale must be transparent and clear. Existing research has shown empirically that fair process enhances both employee motivation and performance in execution. However, work to date has not addressed why fair process is so often violated in practice. This paper breaks new ground by analytically examining the subtle trade-offs involved. We develop a model of fair process in a principal-agent (i.e., manager-employee) context, rooted in psychological preferences for autonomy and fairness. We show that indeed fair process will not always be used, and why the hoped-for benefits may be insufficient to convince management to use fair process.

Title: Dual Sales Channel Management with Service Competition
Abstract: We study a manufacturer's problem of managing his direct online sales channel together with an independently owned bricks-and-mortar retail channel, when the channels compete in service. We incorporate a detailed consumer channel choice model in which the demand faced in each channel depends on the service levels of both channels as well as the consumers' valuation of the product and shopping experience. The direct channel's service is measured by the delivery lead time for the product; the retail channel's service is measured by product availability. We identify optimal dual channel strategies that depend on the channel environment described by factors such as the cost of managing a direct channel, retailer inconvenience, and some product characteristics. We also determine when the manufacturer should establish a direct channel or a retail channel if he is already selling through one of these channels. Finally, we conduct a sequence of controlled experiments with human subjects to investigate whether our model makes reasonable predictions of human behavior. We determine that the model accurately predicts the direction of changes in the subjects' decisions, as well as their channel strategies in response to the changes in the channel environment. These observations suggest that the model can be used in designing channel strategies for an actual dual channel environment.<sup>1</sup>

Title: Toward a Theory of Behavioral Operations
Abstract: Human beings are critical to the functioning of the vast majority of operating systems, influencing both the way these systems work and how they perform. Yet most formal analytical models of operations assume that the people who participate in operating systems are fully rational or at least can be induced to behave rationally. Many other disciplines, including economics, finance, and marketing, have successfully incorporated departures from this rationality assumption into their models and theories. In this paper, we argue that operations management scholars should do the same. We explore the theoretical and practical implications of incorporating behavioral and cognitive factors into models of operations management and suggest fruitful avenues for research in behavioral operations.

Title: A Stochastic Inventory Model with Trade Credit
Abstract: Suppliers routinely sell goods to retailers on credit. Common credit terms are tantamount to a schedule of declining discounts (escalating penalties) that depend on how long the retailer takes to pay off the supplier's loan. However, issues such as which stocking policies are optimal in the presence of supplier-provided credit have been investigated only when demand is assumed deterministic. Nearly all stochastic inventory models assume either time-invariant finance charges or charges that may vary with time but not with the age of the credit. In this article we present a discrete time model of the retailer's operations with random demand, which is used to prove that the structure of the optimal policy is not affected by credit terms, although the value of the optimal policy parameter is. This is followed by a continuous time model, which leads to an algorithm for finding the optimal stock level. We also model the supplier's problem and calculate the optimal credit parameters in numerical experiments.

Title: Sensitivity of Optimal Capacity to Customer Impatience in an Unobservable M/M/S Queue (Why You Shouldn't Shout at the DMV)
Abstract: This paper employs sample path arguments to derive the following convexity properties and comparative statics for an M/M/S queue with impatient customers. If the rate at which customers balk and renege is an increasing, concave function of the number of customers in the system (head count), then the head-count process and the expected rate of lost sales are decreasing and convex in the capacity (service rate or number of servers). This result applies when customers cannot observe the head count, so that the balking probability is zero and the reneging rate increases linearly with the head count. Then the optimal capacity increases with the customer arrival rate but is not monotonic in the reneging rate per customer. When capacity is expensive or the reneging rate is high, the optimal capacity decreases with any further increase in the reneging rate. Therefore, managers must understand customers' impatience to avoid building too much capacity, but customers have an incentive to conceal their impatience, to avoid a degradation in service quality. If the system manager can prevent customers from reneging during service (by requiring advance payment or training employees to establish rapport with customers), the system's convexity properties are qualitatively different, but its comparative statics remain the same. Most important, the prevention of reneging during service can substantially reduce the total expected cost of lost sales and capacity. It increases the optimal capacity (service rate or number of servers) when capacity is expensive and reduces the optimal capacity when capacity is cheap.

Abstract: Motivated by the ease with which online customers can bid simultaneously in multiple auctions, we analyze a system with two competing auctioneers and three types of bidders: those dedicated to either of the two auctions and those that participate simultaneously in both auctions. Bidding behavior is specified and proven to induce a Bayesian Nash equilibrium, and a closed-form expression for the expected revenue of each auctioneer is derived. For auctioneers selling a single item, partial pooling--i.e., the presence of some cross-auction bidders--is beneficial to both auctioneers as long as neither one dominates the market (e.g., possesses more than 60%-65% of the market share). For multi-item auctions, pooling is mutually beneficial only if both auctioneers have nearly identical ratios of bidders per items for sale; otherwise, only the auctioneer with the smaller ratio benefits from pooling. Pooling's impact on revenue decreases with the number of bidders, suggesting that popular auction sites need not be overly concerned with mitigating bidding across auctions.

Title: The Impact of Service Operations Failures on Customer Satisfaction: Evidence on How Failures and Their Source Affect What Matters to Customers
Abstract: Research in consumer psychology shows that customers seek reasons for service failures and that attributions of blame moderate the effects of failure on the level of customer satisfaction. This paper extends research on service operations failures by hypothesizing that attributions of blame also affect what matters to the customer during service failures. Specifically, we hypothesize that the relative weights that customers assign to key service elements in reaching an overall assessment of customer satisfaction are affected by customer attributions of blame for service failures. We use the U.S. airline industry as a quasi-experimental research setting to investigate the components of customer satisfaction for three samples of customers who experience (1) routine service, (2) flight delays of external (i.e., weather) origin, and (3) flight delays of internal origin. Although the level of customer satisfaction is lower for all service failures, we find that the key components of satisfaction differ between delayed and routine flights only when customers blame the service provider for the failure. Specifically, when delays are of external origin satisfaction is lower than for routine flights, but there is virtually no difference in the weight that customers assign to the components of customer satisfaction (including employee interactions). In contrast, when delays are of internal origin, satisfaction is lower than for either routine flights or flights delayed by external factors, and employee interactions have a significantly diminished role in customer satisfaction evaluations. Contrary to the popular view that employee interactions take on a greater role in determining customer satisfaction during service failures, we find that the opposite is true if the customer attributes blame to the service provider. Our findings highlight the important role of customer attributions during service failures and present more nuanced evidence on the role of employee-customer interactions in mitigating the effects of service failures on customer satisfaction.

Title: Pointwise Stationary Fluid Models for Stochastic Processing Networks
Abstract: Generalizing earlier work on staffing and routing in telephone call centers, we consider a processing network model with large server pools and doubly stochastic input flows. In this model the processing of a job may involve several distinct operations. Alternative processing modes are also allowed. Given a finite planning horizon, attention is focused on the two-level problem of capacity choice and dynamic system control. A pointwise stationary fluid model (PSFM) is used to approximate system dynamics, which allows development of practical policies with a manageable computational burden. Earlier work in more restrictive settings suggests that our method is asymptotically optimal in a parameter regime of practical interest, but this paper contains no formal limit theory. Rather, it develops a PSFM calculus that is broadly accessible, with an emphasis on modeling and practical computation.

Title: Multimarket Facility Network Design with Offshoring Applications
Abstract: Moving production to low-wage countries may reduce manufacturing costs, but it increases logistics costs and is subject to foreign trade barriers, among others. This paper studies a manufacturer's multimarket facility network design problem and investigates the offshoring decision from a network capacity investment perspective. We analyze a firm that manufactures two products to serve two geographically separated markets using a common component and two localized final assemblies. The common part can be transported between the two markets that have different economic and demand characteristics. Two strategic network design questions arise naturally: (1) Should the common part be produced centrally or in two local facilities? (2) If a centralization strategy is adopted, in which market should the facility be located? We present a transportation cost threshold that captures costs, revenues, and demand risks, and below which centralization is optimal. The optimal location of commonality crucially depends on the relative magnitude of price and manufacturing cost differentials but also on demand size and uncertainty. Incorporating scale economies further enlarges the centralization's optimality region.

Title: Long-Term Contracts Under the Threat of Supplier Default
Abstract: Contracting with suppliers prone to default is an increasingly common problem in some industries, particularly automotive manufacturing. We model this phenomenon as a two-period contracting game with two identical suppliers, a single buyer, deterministic demand, and uncertain production costs. The suppliers are distressed at the start of the game and do not have access to external sources of capital; hence, revenues from the buyer are crucial in determining whether default occurs. The production cost of each supplier is the sum of two stochastic components: a common term that is identical for both suppliers (representing raw materials costs, design specifications, etc.) and an idiosyncratic term that is unique to a given supplier (representing inherent firm capability). The buyer chooses a supplier and then decides on a single- or two-period contract. Comparing models with and without the possibility of default, we find that, without the possibility of supplier failure, the buyer always prefers short-term contracts over long-term contracts, whereas this preference is typically reversed in the presence of failure. Neither of these contracts coordinates the supply chain. We also consider dynamic contracts, in which the contract price is partially tied to some index representing the common component of production costs (e.g., commodity prices of raw materials such as steel or oil), allowing the buyer to shoulder some of the risk from cost uncertainty. We find that dynamic long-term contracts allow the buyer to coordinate the supply chain in the presence of default risk. We also demonstrate that our results continue to hold under a variety of alternative assumptions, including stochastic demand, allowing the buyer the option of subsidizing a bankrupt supplier via a contingent transfer payment or loan and allowing the buyer to unilaterally renegotiate contracts. We conclude that the possibility of supplier default offers a new reason to prefer long-term contracts over short-term contracts.

Title: Using Imperfect Advance Demand Information in Production-Inventory Systems with Multiple Customer Classes
Abstract: We consider a make-to-stock supplier that operates a production facility with limited capacity. The supplier receives orders from customers belonging to several demand classes. Some of the customer classes share advance demand information with the supplier by announcing their orders ahead of their due date. However, this advance demand information is not perfect because the customer may decide to order prior to or later than the expected due date or may decide to cancel the order altogether. Customer classes vary in their demand rates, expected due dates, cancellation probabilities, and shortage costs. The supplier must decide when to produce and, whenever an order becomes due, whether or not to satisfy it from on-hand inventory. Hence, the supplier is faced with a joint production-control and inventory-allocation problem. We formulate the problem as a Markov decision process and characterize the structure of the optimal policy. We show that the optimal production policy is a state-dependent base-stock policy with a base-stock level that is nondecreasing in the number of announced orders. We show that the optimal inventory-allocation policy is a state-dependent multilevel rationing policy, with the rationing level for each class nondecreasing in the number of announced orders (regardless of whether the class provides advance information). From numerical results, we obtain several insights into the value of advance demand information for both supplier and customers.

Title: Managing an Assemble-to-Order System with Returns
Abstract: We consider a multiproduct assemble-to-order (ATO) system, in which inventory is kept only at the component level and the finished products are assembled in response to customer demands. In addition to stochastic demand for finished products, the system experiences stochastic returns of subsets of components, which can then be used to satisfy subsequent demands. The system is managed over an infinite horizon using a component-level base-stock policy. We identify several ways in which returns complicate the behavior of the system, and we demonstrate how to handle these additional complexities when calculating or approximating key order-based performance metrics, including the immediate fill rate, the fill rate within a time window, and average backorders. We also present a method for computing a near-optimal base-stock policy. We use these results to address managerial questions on both operational and product-design levels. For example, we find that tracking product-based (as opposed to component-based) return information appears to provide much less value than tracking product-based demand information, and we explore the impact of the number of products, component lead times, and different patterns of component returns (joint versus independent returns, returns of common versus dedicated components) on the value of component commonality.

Title: OM Practice--Balancing Risk and Efficiency at a Major Commercial Bank
Abstract: Check processing institutions are being forced to downsize their workforce to cut cost and improve the efficiency of their operations as a result of continued growth of electronic payments, a consequence of the increasing popularity of debit/credit cards and use of online banking. For these institutions, these events are making more urgent the decision of how to staff a check-clearing house to trade off efficiency and the expected costs associated with the risks of delayed checks, which include fraud and float costs. In this paper, we discuss how a team of executives at a major commercial bank (CB) and Carnegie Mellon University students and faculty engaged in conducting a model-based study of the CB check-clearing operations. This project culminated in the development of a simulation optimization model to systematically analyze the nature of the highlighted risk efficiency trade-off at CB. The firm used the model recommendations to obtain operations downsizing guidelines for its senior managers during the implementation of a strategic workforce reduction program at their check-clearing house. The managerial insights from the team analysis, and the specific model-based recommendations, enabled CB executives to balance risk and efficiency while planning the reduction of their check-processing workforce.

Title: Managing Inventory Over a Short Season: Models with Two Procurement Opportunities
Abstract: Motivated by many recent applications reported in the literature, we examine the impact of a second procurement opportunity on inventory management of products with short selling seasons. In our framework, the first order is placed at the start of the preseason and delivered at the start of the selling season; the second order is placed at or after the start of the selling season for subsequent delivery. Under this framework, the decision maker must make three interrelated choices: the first order quantity, when to place the second order, and the second order quantity. Our focus is on elucidating the optimal policy structure for the three interrelated decisions. By casting our models as sequential decision-making problems, we are able to reduce the optimization problems into sequential and embedded searches for the concerned decision variables that allow us to identify the conditions on the economic parameters and demand distribution to effectively facilitate the search for the optimal solutions.

Title: Impact of Supply Learning When Suppliers Are Unreliable
Abstract: Dual sourcing and inventory are two prevalent and widely studied strategies firms use to manage yield risk. A pervasive but implicit assumption in the literature is that a firm knows its suppliers' yield distributions with certainty. This is a strong assumption in many circumstances. A firm is more likely to have a forecast of a supplier's yield distribution and to update that forecast based on its experiences with the supplier. We introduce and analyze a Bayesian model of "supply learning" (i.e., distribution updating) and investigate how supply learning influences both sourcing and inventory strategies in dual-sourcing and single-sourcing models, respectively. In the case of Bernoulli all-or-nothing yield distributions, we completely characterize the firm's optimal sourcing and inventory decisions for the supply-learning model. Among other results, we prove that for a given expected supplier reliability (i.e., the mean of the firm's forecast for the probability of successful delivery) an increase in the reliability forecast uncertainty increases the attractiveness of a supplier, but it reduces the firm's desire to invest in inventory to protect against future supply failures. We extend our analysis to allow for general yield distributions, multiple sourcing (i.e., more than two suppliers), and inventory carryover in the dual-sourcing model.

Title: Multiple Part-Type Production in Robotic Cells: Equivalence of Two Real-World Models
Abstract: We address the scheduling of operations in a robotic cell that produces multiple part-types. The objective is to obtain a cyclic schedule--a sequence of robot moves and an ordering of the parts--that minimizes the long-run average time to produce a part or, equivalently, maximizes the throughput. We consider two different models that are currently used in practice. The first is a single-gripper cell with a unit-capacity output buffer at each machine. The second is a bufferless dual-gripper cell. We focus our analysis on a widely used class of cyclic solutions, referred to as CRM cycles. The main outcome of our analysis is the equivalence of the two models (i.e., the maximum throughput is the same for both models) under conditions that are common in practice. The equivalence is established in two steps: (i) identification of a subset of dominating cyclic solutions for each model, and (ii) provision of a one-to-one mapping between these dominating cycles such that corresponding cycles have the same throughput. We also analyze the computational complexity of the throughput maximization problem for the two models. The enhanced capabilities (i.e., output buffers and dual gripper) of both models were motivated by a need to improve the throughput. However, the costs of acquiring these capabilities differ significantly. Our discussions with operations managers at a Dallas-area robotic cell manufacturer revealed that the total cost of designing and programming the robot's control mechanism for a cell with output buffers is about 20% less than that for a dual-gripper cell. The equivalence of the two models is, therefore, somewhat surprising and has significant practical implications. For cells that operationalize CRM cycles, the use of output buffers instead of a dual gripper can result in considerable savings without compromising throughput.

Title: Note--Optimal Component Acquisition for a Single-Product, Single-Demand Assemble-to-Order Problem with Expediting
Abstract: We consider a component acquisition problem for a contract manufacturer who faces a one-time stochastic demand for a single product consisting of a number of components. Components can be ordered early at normal prices before the demand is revealed, or they can be replenished later at higher prices due to expediting. In addition, the customer pays a price for the final product that is nonincreasing in the delivery lead time to discourage late delivery. We propose a cost-minimization model and develop an efficient polynomial time algorithm to solve the problem.

A newly available server serves the customer from the head of the queue of the class (from among those the server is eligible to serve) whose queue length most exceeds a specified proportion of the total queue length. Under fairly general conditions, QIR produces an important state-space collapse as the total arrival rate and the numbers of servers increase in a coordinated way. That state-space collapse was previously used to delicately balance service levels for the different customer classes. In this sequel, we show that a special version of QIR stochastically minimizes convex holding costs in a finite-horizon setting when the service rates are restricted to be pool dependent. Under additional regularity conditions, the special version of QIR reduces to a simple policy: linear costs produce a priority-type rule, in which the least-cost customers are given low priority. Strictly convex costs (plus other regularity conditions) produce a many-server analogue of the generalized-c\mu  (Gc\mu ) rule, under which a newly available server selects a customer from the class experiencing the greatest marginal cost at that time.

Title: Incentives for Quality Through Endogenous Routing
Abstract: We study how rework routing together with wage and piece-rate compensation can strengthen incentives for quality. Traditionally, rework is assigned back to the agent who generates the defect (in a self-routing scheme) or to another agent dedicated to rework (in a dedicated routing scheme). In contrast, a novel cross-routing scheme allocates rework to a parallel agent performing both new jobs and rework. The agent who passes quality inspection or completes rework receives the piece rate paid per job. We compare the incentives of these rework-allocation schemes in a principal-agent model with embedded quality control and routing in a multiclass queueing network. We show that conventional self-routing of rework cannot induce first-best effort. Dedicated routing and cross-routing, however, strengthen incentives for quality by imposing an implicit punishment for quality failure. In addition, cross-routing leads to workload-allocation externalities and a prisoner's dilemma, thereby creating the greatest incentives for quality. Firm profitability depends on demand levels, revenues, and quality costs. When the number of agents increases, the incentive effect of cross-routing reduces monotonically and approaches that of dedicated routing.

Title: ERP Competence-Building Mechanisms: An Exploratory Investigation of Configurations of ERP Adopters in the European and U.S. Manufacturing Sectors
Abstract: This paper contributes to the literature on enterprise resource planning (ERP) by pursuing two objectives. First, it identifies configurations of ERP adopters that have similar needs and develop similar competencies. Second, it tests the hypothesis that, to maximize benefits from their ERP projects, organizations should align their ERP competence-building mechanisms with the ERP needs that arise from their operational environment. The analysis of a sample of manufacturing companies that implemented ERP between 1995 and 2001 uncovers four distinct configurations representing different degrees of fit between needs and competence-building mechanisms: the frugal ERP, the extensive business process reengineering (BPR), the adaptive ERP, and the straitjacket. The results support our hypothesis and suggest that the consequences of a misfit between needs and competence-building mechanisms are more severe for companies that operate in complex and dynamic environments and have informal organizational structures than for firms with rigid structures that operate in simple and stable environments.

Title: Effects of Information Disclosure Under First- and Second-Price Auctions in a Supply Chain Setting
Abstract: We study a supply chain where an upstream supplier auctions his inventory or capacity as a bundle. The importance of this setting is twofold: From a practical point of view, there are several examples, both in manufacturing (e.g., auctioning the capacity of a wafer fabrication facility) and service industries (e.g., auctioning the sponsorship of a website), where a supplier's capacity is sold as a single piece; from a theoretical side, it highlights the information asymmetry introduced on the downstream supply chain parties when the auction result is disclosed. We formulate the problem as a two-stage supply chain comprising a single supplier and two resellers. Each reseller receives a signal of the consumer demand and bids for the capacity of the supplier. The supplier announces the winner as well as the auction price. Both resellers can get additional units in a procurement market and then engage in Cournot competition in the consumer market. We analyze the impact of the information elicited by the supplier in the early stage of the game. We characterize sufficient conditions for the existence of equilibrium behavior, derive the equilibrium bidding functions under both first- and second-price auctions, and show that the bidding functions are lower than the corresponding ones for a single-shot auction without resale. Our computational experiments indicate that both the supplier and resellers are better off running a second-price auction and that consumers benefit if the resellers have very different signals on the total demand. Overall, our results suggest that traditional auctions may have a profound impact in the context of a supply chain because of the information disclosure in the upstream stages.

Title: Dynamic Pricing and Inventory Control of Substitute Products
Abstract: We study dynamic pricing and inventory control of substitute products for a retailer who faces a long supply lead time and a short selling season. Within a multinomial logit model of consumer choice over substitutes, we develop a stochastic dynamic programming formulation and derive the optimal dynamic pricing policy. We prove that dynamic pricing converges to static pricing as inventory levels of all variates approach the number of remaining selling periods (assuming at most one customer arrival within each period). Our extensive numerical study of the effects of time and inventory depletion on the optimal pricing reveals two fundamental underlying driving forces of the complex price behavior: the level of inventory scarcity and the quality difference among products. We also compare the performance of three restricted pricing strategies: static, unified dynamic, and mixed dynamic pricing. We find that full-scale dynamic pricing is of great value in the presence of inventory scarcity, and initial inventory decisions are quite robust in the pricing scheme employed in the selling season. Based on the above insights, we propose a computationally efficient approach to the initial inventory decision, which delivers close-to-optimal inventory levels for all testing cases.

Title: Benefits of Reevaluating Real-Time Order Fulfillment Decisions
Abstract: When a customer orders online, an online retailer assigns the order to one or more of its warehouses and/or drop-shippers to minimize procurement and transportation costs based on the available current information. However, this assignment is necessarily myopic because it cannot account for any subsequent customer orders or future inventory replenishment. We examine the benefits of periodically reevaluating these real-time assignments. We construct near-optimal heuristics for the reassignment for a large set of customer orders to minimize the total number of shipments. Finally, we present evidence of significant saving opportunities by testing the heuristics on order data from a major online retailer.

Title: Data Set--Choice-Based Revenue Management: Data from a Major Hotel Chain
Abstract: In this paper, we describe data collected from five U.S. properties of a major hotel chain that can be used to benchmark the performance of choice-based revenue management (RM) algorithms. The process used to collect this data illustrates subtle complexities involved in extracting product availability information from current RM systems and sheds new light on practical issues that need to be addressed to successfully implement choice-based RM systems.

Title: Optimal Backlogging Over an Infinite Horizon Under Time-Varying Convex Production and Inventory Costs
Abstract: We consider an infinite horizon production planning problem with nonstationary, convex production and inventory costs. Backlogging is allowed, unlike as in related previous work, and inventory cost is interpreted as backlogging cost when inventory is negative. We create finite horizon truncations of the infinite horizon problem and employ classic results on convex production planning to derive a closed-form formula for the minimum forecast horizon. We show that optimal production levels are monotonically increasing in the length of horizon, leading to solution convergence and a rolling horizon procedure for delivering an infinite horizon optimal production plan. The minimum forecast horizon formula is employed to illustrate how cost parameters affect how far one must look into the future to make an infinite horizon optimal decision today.

Title: Optimal Scheduling and Incentive Compatible Pricing for a Service System with Quality of Service Guarantees
Abstract: This paper proposes a resource allocation and pricing mechanism for a service system that serves multiple classes of jobs within an organization. Each class of service request is subject to a class-dependent quality of service (QoS) guarantee on the expected delay bound, which may be imposed by business rules in an organization or other application-specific technical constraints. We develop an extension of a resource allocation and pricing mechanism for an M/M/1 system. In contrast to the system without the QoS guarantee, where a fixed priority scheduling policy--known as the c\mu  rule--is optimal, we show that the system may need to adopt a more general randomized priority scheduling policy to maximize the overall system profit. We also develop a transfer pricing scheme that is both optimal and incentive compatible, allowing users to act in their self-interests while collectively achieving the system optimum. We show that the pricing scheme with the QoS guarantee depends on the scheduling policy implemented and has different characteristics from that without the QoS guarantee.

Title: Real-Time Delay Estimation Based on Delay History
Abstract: Motivated by interest in making delay announcements to arriving customers who must wait in call centers and related service systems, we study the performance of alternative real-time delay estimators based on recent customer delay experience. The main estimators considered are: (i) the delay of the last customer to enter service (LES), (ii) the delay experienced so far by the customer at the head of the line (HOL), and (iii) the delay experienced by the customer to have arrived most recently among those who have already completed service (RCS). We compare these delay-history estimators to the standard estimator based on the queue length (QL), commonly used in practice, which requires knowledge of the mean interval between successive service completions in addition to the QL. We characterize performance by the mean squared error (MSE). We do an analysis and conduct simulations for the standard GI/M/s multiserver queueing model, emphasizing the case of large s. We obtain analytical results for the conditional distribution of the delay given the observed HOL delay. An approximation to its mean value serves as a refined estimator. For all three candidate delay estimators, the MSE relative to the square of the mean is asymptotically negligible in the many-server and classical heavy-traffic (HT) limiting regimes.

Title: Partitioning of Servers in Queueing Systems During Rush Hour
Abstract: This paper is motivated by two phenomena observed in many queueing systems in practice. The first is the partitioning of server capacity among different customers based on their service time requirements. The second is rush hour demand where a large number of customers arrive over a short period of time followed by few or no arrivals for an extended period thereafter. We study a system with multiple parallel servers and multiple customer classes. The servers can be partitioned into server groups, each dedicated to a single customer class. The system operates under a rush hour regime with a large number of customers arriving at the beginning of the rush hour period. We show that this allows us to reduce the problem to one that is deterministic and for which closed-form solutions can be obtained. We compare the performance of the system with and without server partitioning during rush hour and address three basic questions. (1) Is partitioning beneficial to the system? (2) Is it equally beneficial to all customer classes? (3) If it is implemented, what is an optimal partition? We evaluate the applicability of our results to systems where customers arrive over time using (1) deterministic fluid models and (2) simulation models for systems with stochastic interarrival times.

Title: The Influence of Psychological Safety and Confidence in Knowledge on Employee Knowledge Sharing
Abstract: This research empirically examines the influence of psychological safety on knowledge sharing among coworkers in manufacturing and service operations contexts. Reconciling conflicting findings in the literature, we demonstrate that whereas psychological safety is an important antecedent of knowledge sharing, the relationship between psychological safety and knowledge sharing is moderated by the level of confidence that employees have in what they know. The greater this confidence, the lesser is the importance of psychological safety in facilitating knowledge sharing. Linking this result to social network theory, we find that psychological safety increases with the frequency of communication among coworkers and that the confidence of employees in their knowledge is related to the codifiability of the knowledge involved. We further investigate direct and indirect antecedents of psychological safety. This research offers insights into actions that managers can take to enhance psychological safety and, consequently, motivate their employees to share knowledge.

Title: Second Sourcing vs. Sole Sourcing with Capacity Investment and Asymmetric Information
Abstract: We study the decision of a manufacturer (the buyer), expecting new sourcing opportunities in the future, in selecting between sole- and second-sourcing strategies for a noncommodity component. In a sole-sourcing strategy, the buyer commits to sourcing from a single supplier (the incumbent) over the entire horizon. In a second-sourcing strategy, the buyer keeps the option open to source from a new supplier (the entrant) in the future. Supplier costs are private information, and the incumbent's cost may change in the future because of what it has learned. The buyer is relatively sure about current demand but uncertain about future demand. A supplier has to invest in capacity to produce the inputs for the buyer. With future private cost information, the incumbent earns rent in the future, and this prospective rent influences the incumbent's decision early in the horizon. On one hand, a second-sourcing strategy allows the buyer to take advantage of alternative sourcing opportunities, lowering her future cost. This benefit to the buyer is referred to as the option value of second sourcing. On the other hand, the future supplier competition in second-sourcing hurts the incumbent's future profit. The expectation of a lower future profit in second sourcing induces the incumbent to ask for a higher price at the beginning of the horizon. This causes more initial sourcing cost for the buyer in second sourcing than in sole sourcing, and is referred to as the cost of future supplier competition of second sourcing. The overall benefit of second sourcing relative to sole sourcing is influenced by the demand distribution and capacity cost. If the demand increases over time with positive probability, the incumbent's initial capacity may not be able to cover all future demand. If the capacity is cheap, the entrant may serve as an exclusive supplier, ousting the incumbent. In this case, the option value of second sourcing is high. If the capacity is expensive, the entrant may serve as a supplementary supplier by receiving only the demand in excess of the incumbent's installed capacity. In this case, the cost of future supplier competition is low and the option value is still significant. Thus second sourcing is better than sole sourcing not only when the capacity cost is low, but also when it is high (under the condition that demand increases over time with positive probability and the entrant's cost is relatively low). For intermediate capacity cost, the cost of future supplier competition dominates the option value; hence, sole sourcing is preferred. We also find that second sourcing is more attractive when the buyer expects the future demand to be higher or more volatile. Finally, more initial incumbent capacity strengthens the incumbent's competitiveness against the entrant, reducing the cost of future supplier competition. As a result, we find that second sourcing may lead to overinvestment of the initial capacity.

Title: Certification in the Indian Offshore IT Services Industry
Abstract: Third-party process certification programs such as the ISO 9001 and capability maturity model (CMM) have been widely adopted in recent years. In this study we employ three competing theoretical frameworks--signaling, efficiency gains, and institutional theory--to analyze the motivations for a firm to acquire quality certification and the performance implications thereafter. We test these hypotheses in the context of CMM certification based on data from the Indian offshore IT services industry between 1997 and 2002. Our results indicate that more cost-effective firms and export-oriented firms are more likely to seek out and acquire certification. In addition, CMM-certified firms show significant improvements in exports, but not on the firm's cost structure. Furthermore, our findings suggest that CMM certification helps indicate firm capabilities to potential customers and thus appear to be most consistent with signaling explanations of certification rather than the efficiency gains or institutional theories.

Title: The Value of Component Commonality in a Dynamic Inventory System with Lead Times
Abstract: Component commonality has been widely recognized as a key factor in achieving product variety at low cost. Yet the theory on the value of component commonality is rather limited in the inventory literature. The existing results were built primarily on single-period models or periodic-review models with zero lead times. In this paper, we consider a continuous-review system with positive lead times. We find that although component commonality is in general beneficial, its value depends strongly on component costs, lead times, and dynamic allocation rules. Under certain conditions, several previous findings based on static models do not hold. In particular, component commonality does not always generate inventory benefits under certain commonly used allocation rules. We provide insight on when component commonality generates inventory benefits and when it may not. We further establish some asymptotic properties that connect component lead times and costs to the impact of component commonality. Through numerical studies, we demonstrate the value of commonality and its sensitivity to various system parameters in between the asymptotic limits. In addition, we show how to evaluate the system under a new allocation rule, a modified version of the standard first-in-first-out rule.

Title: Demand-Supply Mismatches and Stock Market Reaction: Evidence from Excess Inventory Announcements
Abstract: This paper documents that excess inventory announcements, an indication of demand-supply mismatch, are associated with an economically and statistically significant negative stock market reaction. The results are based on a sample of 276 excess inventory announcements made during 1990-2002. Over a two-day period (the day of the announcement and the day before the announcement) the mean (median) stock market reaction ranges from -6.79% to -6.93% (-4.51% to -4.79%), depending on the benchmark used to estimate the market reaction. The percent of sample firms that experience negative market reaction ranges from 73% to 74%. When excess inventory is at the announcing firm's customers, the market reaction is more negative than when the excess inventory is at the announcing firm. The stock market reaction is less negative for excess inventory announcements made by larger firms but is more negative for firms with higher growth prospects and with higher debt-equity ratios.

Title: Division of Labor in Medical Office Practices
Abstract: This paper examines the staffing, division of labor, and resulting profitability of primary care physician practices. Division of labor is viewed as a mechanism to increase the efficiency of production processes through specialization. At the same time, division of labor also introduces coordination cost as handoffs and communication needs increase. We attempt to empirically assess the net effect in primary care physician offices. We collected data from a sample of these practices and tested two hypotheses: (H1) controlling for staff size, greater delegation through the use of more staff types will decrease the throughput of visits, and (H2) controlling for staff size, income per unit time generated by the practice is decreasing in the number of staff types. We find evidence supporting both hypotheses. We conclude that many physicians are gaining little financial benefit from delegating work to support staff. This suggests that small practices with few staff may be viable alternatives to traditional practice designs.

Title: Note--Pricing and Inventory Control for a Perishable Product
Abstract: In this note, we study the concurrent determination of pricing and inventory replenishment decisions for a perishable product in an infinite horizon. Demands in consecutive periods are independent and influenced by prices charged in each period. In particular, we treat price as a decision variable to maximize the total discounted profit. We analyze the optimal solution-structure of a two-period lifetime problem and from insights gained in numerical experiments, develop a base-stock/list-price heuristic policy for products with arbitrary fixed lifetimes. Experiments show this policy to be effective.

Title: Joining Longer Queues: Information Externalities in Queue Choice
Abstract: A classic example that illustrates how observed customer behavior impacts other customers' decisions is the selection of a restaurant whose quality is uncertain. Customers often choose the busier restaurant, inferring that other customers in that restaurant know something that they do not. In an environment with random arrival and service times, customer behavior is reflected in the lengths of the queues that form at the individual servers. Therefore, queue lengths could signal two factors--potentially higher arrivals to the server or potentially slower service at the server. In this paper, we focus on both factors when customers' waiting costs are negligible. This allows us to understand how information externalities due to congestion impact customers' service choice behavior. In our model, based on private information about both the service-quality and queue-length information, customers decide which queue to join. When the service rates are the same and known, we confirm that it may be rational to ignore private information and purchase from the service provider with the longer queue when only one additional customer is present in the longer queue. We find that, due to the information externalities contained in queue lengths, there exist cycles during which one service firm is thriving whereas the other is not. Which service provider is thriving depends on luck; i.e., it is determined by the private signal of the customer arriving when both service providers are idle. These phenomena continue to hold when each service facility has multiple servers, or when a facility may go out of business when it cannot attract customers for a certain amount of time. Finally, we find that when the service rates are unknown but are negatively correlated with service values, our results are strengthened; long queues are now doubly informative. The market share of the high-quality firm is higher when there is service rate uncertainty, and it increases as the service rate decreases. When the service rates are positively correlated with unknown service values, long queues become less informative and customers might even join shorter queues.

Title: Cournot Competition Under Yield Uncertainty: The Case of the U.S. Influenza Vaccine Market
Abstract: This paper is inspired by the recurring mismatch between demand and supply in the U.S. influenza vaccine market. Economic theory predicts that an oligopolistic market with unregulated but costly entry will experience excess entry and oversupply, not the undersupply observed in the market for influenza vaccine in recent years. In this paper, we examine the interaction between yield uncertainty, a key characteristic of many production processes, including that for influenza vaccine, and firms' strategic behavior. We find that yield uncertainty can contribute to a high degree of concentration in an industry and a reduction in the industry output and the expected consumer surplus in equilibrium. We use parameter values loosely based on the U.S. influenza vaccine market to numerically illustrate the impact of yield uncertainty.

Title: Optimal Restocking Fees and Information Provision in an Integrated Demand-Supply Model of Product Returns
Abstract: Product returns cost U.S. companies more than $100 billion annually. The cost and scale of returns management issues necessitate a deeper understanding of how to deal with product returns. We develop an analytical model that describes how consumer purchase and return decisions are affected by a seller's pricing and restocking fee policy. Taking into account the consumers' strategic behavior, we derive the seller's optimal policy as a function of consumer preferences, consumer uncertainty about product attributes, consumer hassle cost for returns, and the effectiveness of the seller's forward and reverse channel capability. We allow for two sources of consumer uncertainty and show how the seller may use its price and restocking fee as a means of targeting a segment of consumers who know their product consumption utilities. We find that even if it is possible to eliminate returns costlessly through the provision of information about the fit between consumer preferences and product characteristics, returns can nevertheless be part of an optimal product sales process. That is, we identify conditions under which it is (or is not) optimal to provide product fit information to consumers. We show that the marginal value of information to the seller is decreasing in the operational efficiency of the seller's forward and reverse logistics process as well as the level of product uncertainty. We identify the impact of multiple product options and sources of consumer uncertainty on the model's results. The analysis generates testable hypotheses about how consumer-level and seller-level parameters affect the return policies observed in the marketplace.

Title: Consumer Returns Policies and Supply Chain Performance
Abstract: This paper develops a model of consumer returns policies. In our model, consumers face valuation uncertainty and realize their valuations only after purchase. There is also aggregate demand uncertainty, captured using the conventional newsvendor model. In this environment, consumers decide whether to purchase and then whether to return the product, whereas the seller sets the price, quantity, and refund amount. Using our model, we study the impact of full returns policies (e.g., using 100% money-back guarantees) and partial returns policies (e.g., when restocking fees are charged) on supply chain performance. Next, we demonstrate that consumer returns policies may distort incentives under common supply contracts (such as manufacturer buy-backs), and we propose strategies to coordinate the supply chain in the presence of consumer returns. Finally, we explore several extensions and demonstrate the robustness of our findings.

Title: Inventory, Discounts, and the Timing Effect
Abstract: We introduce and analyze a model that explicitly considers the timing effect of intertemporal pricing--the concept, found in practice, that demand during a sale is increasing in the time since the last sale. We present structural results that characterize the interaction between the decision to hold a sale and the inventory-ordering decision. We show that the optimal inventory-ordering policy is a state-dependent base-stock policy; however, the optimal pricing policy can be quite complicated due to both the value and the cost of holding inventory and delaying sales. In our computational analysis, we find that compared to a fixed-price policy, we see an average gain in profit of almost 5% from optimally varying promotion and inventory decisions accounting for intertemporal demand, and we find that this potential profit gain increases as demand variability decreases. We also develop a heuristic based on deterministic pricing and find that it performs well relative to the optimal policy.

Title: The Consistent Vehicle Routing Problem
Abstract: In the small package shipping industry (as in other industries), companies try to differentiate themselves by providing high levels of customer service. This can be accomplished in several ways, including online tracking of packages, ensuring on-time delivery, and offering residential pickups. Some companies want their drivers to develop relationships with customers on a route and have the same drivers visit the same customers at roughly the same time on each day that the customers need service. These service requirements, together with traditional constraints on vehicle capacity and route length, define a variant of the classical capacitated vehicle routing problem, which we call the consistent VRP (ConVRP). In this paper, we formulate the problem as a mixed-integer program and develop an algorithm to solve the ConVRP that is based on the record-to-record travel algorithm. We compare the performance of our algorithm to the optimal mixed-integer program solutions for a set of small problems and then apply our algorithm to five simulated data sets with 1,000 customers and a real-world data set with more than 3,700 customers. We provide a technique for generating ConVRP benchmark problems from vehicle routing problem instances given in the literature and provide our solutions to these instances. The solutions produced by our algorithm on all problems do a very good job of meeting customer service objectives with routes that have a low total travel time. In the paper "The Consistent Vehicle Routing Problem," published in Manufacturing & Service Operations Management, ePub ahead of print December 4, 2008, http://msom.journal.informs.org/cgi/content/abstract/msom.1080.0243v1, the authors have amended the original text published online to correct an oversight in conveying the real-world problem studied in this article.

Title: Managing Service Systems with an Offline Waiting Option and Customer Abandonment
Abstract: Many service providers offer customers the choice of either waiting in a line or going offline and returning at a dynamically determined future time. The best-known example is the FASTPASS<sup></sup> system at Disneyland. To operate such a system, the service provider must make an upfront decision on how to allocate service capacity between the two lines. Then, during system operation, he must provide estimates of the waiting times for both lines to each arriving customer. The estimation of offline waiting times is complicated by the fact that some offline customers do not return for service at their appointed time. We show that when demand is large and service is fast, for any fixed-capacity allocation decision, the two-dimensional process tracking the number of customers waiting in a line and offline collapses to one dimension, and we characterize the one-dimensional limit process as a reflected diffusion with linear drift. The analytic tractability of this one-dimensional limit process allows us to solve for the capacity allocation that minimizes average cost when there are costs associated with customer abandonments and queueing. We further show that in this limit regime, a simple scheme based on Little's Law to dynamically estimate in line and offline wait times is effective.

Title: Strategic Safety Stocks in Supply Chains with Evolving Forecasts
Abstract: We examine the placement of safety stocks in a supply chain for which we have an evolving demand forecast. Under assumptions about the forecasts, the demand process, and the supply chain structure, we show that safety-stock placement for such systems is effectively equivalent to the corresponding well-studied problem for systems with stationary demand bounds and base-stock policies. Hence, we can use existing algorithms to find the optimal safety stocks. We use a case study with real data to demonstrate that there are significant benefits from the inclusion of the forecast process when determining the optimal safety stocks. We also conduct a computational experiment to explore how the placement and size of the safety stocks depend on the nature of the forecast evolution process.

Title: Priority Assignment Under Imperfect Information on Customer Type Identities
Abstract: In many service systems, customers are not served in the order they arrive, but according to a priority scheme that ranks them with respect to their relative "importance." However, it may not be an easy task to determine the importance level of customers, especially when decisions need to be made under limited information. A typical example is from health care: When triage nurses classify patients into different priority groups, they must promptly determine each patient's criticality levels with only partial information on their conditions. We consider such a service system where customers are from one of two possible types. The service time and waiting cost for a customer depends on the customer's type. Customers' type identities are not directly available to the service provider; however, each customer provides a signal, which is an imperfect indicator of the customer's identity. The service provider uses these signals to determine priority levels for the customers with the objective of minimizing the long-run average waiting cost. In most of the paper, each customer's signal equals the probability that the customer belongs to the type that should have a higher priority and customers incur waiting costs that are linear in time. We first show that increasing the number of priority classes decreases costs, and the policy that gives the highest priority to the customer with the highest signal outperforms any finite class priority policy. We then focus on two-class priority policies and investigate how the optimal policy changes with the system load. We also investigate the properties of "good" signals and find that signals that are larger in convex ordering are more preferable. In a simulation study, we find that when the waiting cost functions are nondecreasing, quadratic, and convex, the policy that assigns the highest priority to the customer with the highest signal performs poorly while the two-class priority policy and an extension of the generalized c\mu  rule perform well.

We consider two commonly used types of vessels--"liners" (ships whose routes are fixed in advance) and "trampers" (ships for which future route components are selected based on available shipping jobs)--and formulate a vessel profit maximization problem as a stochastic dynamic program. For liner vessels, the profit maximization reduces to the problem of minimizing refueling costs over a given route subject to random fuel prices and limited vessel fuel capacity. Under mild assumptions about the stochastic dynamics of fuel prices at different ports, we provide a characterization of the structural properties of the optimal liner refueling policies. For trampers, the vessel profit maximization combines refueling decisions and route selection, which adds a combinatorial aspect to the problem. We characterize the optimal policy in special cases where prices are constant through time and do not differ across ports and prices are constant through time and differ across ports. The structure of the optimal policy in such special cases yields insights on the complexity of the problem and also guides the construction of heuristics for the general problem setting.

Title: OM Practice--Work Expands to Fill the Time Available: Capacity Estimation and Staffing Under Parkinson's Law
Abstract: We develop a method to estimate the capacity of agents who answer e-mail in a contact center, given aggregate historical data that have been distorted both by constraints on work availability and by internal incentives to slow down when true capacity exceeds demand. We use the capacity estimate to find a contact center's optimal daily staffing levels. The implementation results, from an actual contact center, demonstrate that the method provides accurate staffing recommendations. We also examine and test models in which agents exhibit speed-up behavior and in which capacity varies over time. Finally, we use the capacity estimates to examine the implications of solving the staffing problem with two different model formulations, the service-level constraint formulation used by the contact center and an alternate profit-maximization formulation.

Title: Effect of Supply Reliability in a Retail Setting with Joint Marketing and Inventory Decisions
Abstract: This paper studies the impact of supply reliability on a retail firm's performance under joint marketing and inventory decisions. The firm sells a product in a single selling season and can exert marketing effort to influence consumer demand. We develop a modeling framework to quantify the value of improving supply reliability and investigate how this value depends on different model parameters. Our results provide useful insights into how firms should make investment decisions on adopting new technologies to improve supply reliability. First, we establish a necessary and sufficient condition under which the maximum unit cost a firm is willing to pay to improve supply reliability increases in product price. We further show that this condition would hold in most practical situations. Thus, with some caveats, our result supports the intuition that a firm is willing to pay more to improve supply reliability for products with a higher price. Next, we show that for two products with the same price, a firm is willing to pay more to improve supply reliability for the product with a higher product cost. This implies that it is not necessarily true that emerging technologies for improving supply reliability should be first adopted for products with the highest unit contribution margin. Finally, we show that a product with a lower marketing cost function always benefits more from improved supply reliability than a product with a higher marketing cost function. This finding suggests that the priority of adopting new technologies should be given to situations where the firm can effectively induce greater demand through promotional effort.

Title: Buy Now and Match Later: Impact of Posterior Price Matching on Profit with Strategic Consumers
Abstract: With a posterior price matching (PM) policy, a seller guarantees to reimburse the price difference to a consumer who buys a product before the seller marks it down. Such a policy has been widely adopted by retailers. We examine the impact of a posterior PM policy on consumers' purchasing behavior, a seller's pricing and inventory decisions, and their expected payoffs, assuming that the seller cannot credibly commit to a price path, but can implement a posterior PM policy. We find that the PM policy eliminates strategic consumers' waiting incentive and thus allows the seller to increase price in the regular selling season. When the fraction of strategic consumers is not too small and their valuation decline over time is neither too low nor too high, the PM policy can substantially improve the seller's profit, as well as the inventory investment. In such situations, the strategic consumers' waiting incentive and the loss if they wait are both high. However, to adopt this policy, the seller also bears the refund cost. The seller must either pay the refund that consumers will claim or forgo the salvage value of any leftover inventory. The PM policy can be detrimental when there are only a few strategic consumers or the strategic consumers' valuation decline is very low or very high. We find that the performance of this policy is insensitive to the proportion of consumers who claim the refund. From the consumers' perspective, the PM policy generally reduces consumer surplus; however, there are cases where consumer surplus can be increased, typically when the variance of the potential high-end market volume is high. As a result, a Pareto improvement on both the seller's and the consumers' payoffs is possible. Finally, we find that the ability to credibly commit to a fixed price path is not very valuable when the seller can implement price matching.

Title: Robust Controls for Network Revenue Management
Abstract: Revenue management models traditionally assume that future demand is unknown but can be described by a stochastic process or a probability distribution. Demand is, however, often difficult to characterize, especially in new or nonstationary markets. In this paper, we develop robust formulations for the capacity allocation problem in revenue management using the maximin and the minimax regret criteria under general polyhedral uncertainty sets. Our approach encompasses the following open-loop controls: partitioned booking limits, nested booking limits, displacement-adjusted virtual nesting, and fixed bid prices. In specific problem instances, we show that a booking policy of the type of displacement-adjusted virtual nesting is robust, both from maximin and minimax regret perspectives. Our numerical analysis reveals that the minimax regret controls perform very well on average, despite their worst-case focus, and outperform the traditional controls when demand is correlated or censored. In particular, on real large-scale problem sets, the minimax regret approach outperforms by up to 2% the traditional heuristics. The maximin controls are more conservative but have the merit of being associated with a minimum revenue guarantee. Our models are scalable to solve practical problems because they combine efficient (exact or heuristic) solution methods with very modest data requirements.

Title: The Coordination of Pricing and Scheduling Decisions
Abstract: This paper considers the coordination of pricing and scheduling decisions in a make-to-order environment. Following common industry practice, we assume knowledge of a deterministic demand function that is nonincreasing in price. We consider three alternative measures of scheduling cost: total work-in-process inventory cost of orders, total penalty for orders delivered late to customers, and total capacity usage. The objective is to maximize the total net profit, i.e., revenue less scheduling cost, resulting from the pricing and scheduling decisions. We develop computationally efficient optimal algorithms for solving the three pricing and scheduling problems. Because these problems are formally intractable, much faster algorithms are not possible. We develop a fully polynomial time approximation scheme for each problem. We also estimate the value of coordinating pricing and production scheduling decisions by comparing solutions delivered by (a) an uncoordinated approach where pricing and scheduling decisions are made independently, (b) a partially coordinated approach that uses only general information about scheduling that a marketing department typically knows, (c) a simple heuristic approach for solving the coordinated problem, and (d) our optimal algorithm for solving the coordinated problem. Our main managerial insight is that there is a significant benefit even if pricing and scheduling are only heuristically or partially coordinated. Moreover, heuristic and partial coordination are simple to achieve.

Title: Supplier Competition in Decentralized Assembly Systems with Price-Sensitive and Uncertain Demand
Abstract: In a decentralized assembly supply chain, independent suppliers produce a set of complementary components from which an assembler assembles a final product and sells it to the market. In such a channel, several competitive forces interact with one another to affect the price and quantity decisions of the firms involved. These include: (1) the direct competition each supplier faces for producing the same component, (2) the indirect competition among the suppliers producing the set of complementary components needed for assembling the final product, and (3) the vertical interaction between the assembler and the component suppliers. This paper shows that the direct competition that one supplier faces helps improve the performance of the assembler and all the other suppliers in the channel; and surprisingly, it can help improve the performance of this particular supplier facing the competition as well. Second, the assembler benefits from a merger of suppliers producing different components in the complementary set. Furthermore, the assembler prefers a merger of suppliers with less direct competition over a merger of suppliers with more direct competition.

Title: Customer-Driven vs. Retailer-Driven Search: Channel Performance and Implications
Abstract: A common phenomenon that occurs in any decentralized multilocation system is stock imbalance, whereby some locations have unsatisfied demands while others are overstocked. The system can be rebalanced by using a search process that is driven by either the customers or the retailers. In a customer-driven search (CDS), the customer with unmet demand may search for the product at another location and, if it is available, complete the purchase. In a retailer-driven search (RDS), the retailer with unsatisfied demand searches for product and schedules transshipment to fulfill the unmet demand at his location. Of course, the revenues generated through search in RDS need to be shared between the parties according to a transfer pricing scheme. In a setting of one manufacturer and two retailers with price-dependent and random demand, we explore the impact of the search method and the transfer price scheme used on the preferences of the manufacturer, the retailers, and the customers. With endogenous retail prices, we find that both the manufacturer and the retailers prefer RDS over CDS when they can design the transfer pricing scheme in RDS. Interestingly, neither party prefers the fixed transfer pricing scheme commonly assumed in the literature. Instead, transfer price that is proportional to the price of the retailer with either excess stock or excess demand is preferred. However, although both parties favor an RDS system when they can design the transfer pricing scheme in RDS, they may prefer RDS or CDS when the other party designs the RDS. Thus, the interests of the manufacturer and the retailers are rarely aligned. Customers benefit from a lower price in an RDS but at the expense of lower availability (as measured by the level of safety stock).

Title: Continuous Review Inventory Model with Dynamic Choice of Two Freight Modes with Fixed Costs
Abstract: We analyze a continuous review (Q, r) stochastic inventory model in which orders placed with a make-to-order manufacturer can be shipped via two alternative freight modes differing in lead time and costs. The costs of placing an order and using each freight mode consist of fixed components and hence exhibit economies of scale. We derive an optimal policy for using the two freight modes for shipping each order. This freight-mode decision is delayed until manufacturing is complete and the optimal policy uses information about the demand incurred in the meantime. Furthermore, given that the two freight modes are used optimally for shipping each order, we solve our model for reorder point and order quantity that minimizes cost. We analyze the cost savings achieved from postponing the freight-mode decision and provide analytical and numerical comparisons between the solutions to our two-freight model and single-freight models. Finally, we illustrate the properties of the solution to our model using an extensive set of numerical examples.

Title: Feasting on Leftovers: Strategic Use of Shortages in Price Competition Among Differentiated Products
Abstract: Two single-product firms with different quality levels and fixed limited capacities engage in sequential price competition in an essentially deterministic model where customers have heterogeneous valuations for both products. We develop conditions under which the leader (she) can take strategic advantage of her limited capacity by pricing relatively low, purposefully creating shortages and leaving some leftovers for the follower (him) to feast on, avoiding direct competition. The extent to which the leader benefits in this Leftovers Equilibrium depends on operational variables such as the capacity levels of the two firms and the sequence in which customers arrive at the market. We spell out the details for three different known arrival sequences within a specific subset of plausible fixed-capacity levels. The follower's strategic shadow price can be positive even when not all his capacity is used, and the leader's can be negative when all her capacity is used. We illustrate that Leftovers Equilibria can arise when some of our assumptions are relaxed.

Title: Testing the Validity of a Demand Model: An Operations Perspective
Abstract: The fields of statistics and econometrics have developed powerful methods for testing the validity (specification) of a model based on its fit to underlying data. Unlike statisticians, managers are typically more interested in the performance of a decision rather than the statistical validity of the underlying model. We propose a framework and a statistical test that incorporate decision performance into a measure of statistical validity. Under general conditions on the objective function, asymptotic behavior of our test admits a sharp and simple characterization. We develop our approach in a revenue management setting and apply the test to a data set used to optimize prices for consumer loans. We show that traditional model-based goodness-of-fit tests may consistently reject simple parametric models of consumer response (e.g., the ubiquitous logit model), while at the same time these models may "pass" the proposed performance-based test. Such situations arise when decisions derived from a postulated (and possibly incorrect) model generate results that cannot be distinguished statistically from the best achievable performance--i.e., when demand relationships are fully known.

Title: Media Revenue Management with Audience Uncertainty: Balancing Upfront and Spot Market Sales
Abstract: An important challenge faced by media broadcasting companies is how to allocate limited advertising space between upfront (forward) contracts and the spot market (referred to in advertising as the scatter market) to maximize profits and meet contractual commitments. We develop stylized optimization models of airtime capacity planning and allocation across multiple clients under audience uncertainty. In a short-term profit maximizing setting, our results provide insight for capacity planning decisions upfront and during the broadcasting season. Our results suggest that broadcasting companies should prioritize upfront clients according to marginal revenue per audience unit. We find that accepted upfront market contracts can be aggregated across clients and served in proportion to the audience demanded. Closed-form solutions are obtained in a static setting. These results remain valid in a dynamic setting, when considering the opportunity to increase allocation by airing make-goods during the broadcasting season. Our structural results characterize the impact of contracting parameters, time, and audience uncertainty on profits and capacity decisions. The results hold under general audience and spot market profit models. Overall, we find that ignoring audience uncertainty can have a significant cost for media capacity planning and allocation.

Title: Service Provider Competition: Delay Cost Structure, Segmentation, and Cost Advantage
Abstract: We model competition between two providers who serve delay-sensitive customers. We compare a generalized delay cost structure, where a customer's delay cost depends on her service valuation, with the traditional additive delay cost structure, where the delay cost is independent of the customer's service valuation. Under the additive delay cost structure, service providers offer different prices and expected delays, but customers are indifferent between the providers. Under the generalized delay cost structure, when the providers have different capacity or operating costs, we obtain value-based market segmentation, whereby higher-value customers choose one provider and lower-value customers choose the other. We study how the delay cost parameters, the market size, and the service providers' costs affect the structure of the equilibrium.

Title: Coordination of Outsourced Operations to Minimize Weighted Flow Time and Capacity Booking Costs
Abstract: A set of manufacturers outsources certain operations to a single third party following the announcement of a booking price for each available day of production. Knowing these costs, manufacturers book available production days in a first-come-first-serve order to optimize their individual cost. The cost for each manufacturer consists of booking and work-in-progress costs, as expressed by the weighted flow time. When window booking is completed, the third party identifies a schedule that minimizes the total cost incurred by all manufacturers. This coordination reduces the total cost but may result in higher costs for a subset of manufacturers. For this reason, the third party devises a savings sharing scheme with which the monetary benefit for each manufacturer is greater. In this article we present algorithms for the problem considered, as well as savings-sharing schemes that make coordination a better alternative for all parties. The highlight of our experiments is that the costs of the production chain can be reduced by an average of 32% if one-third of the members let the third party cover their increased work-in-progress cost in exchange for 38%-53% of the total savings.

Title: The Optimal Composition of Influenza Vaccines Subject to Random Production Yields
Abstract: The Vaccine and Related Biologic Products Advisory Committee meets at least once a year to decide the composition of seasonal influenza vaccine in the United States. Past evidence suggests that the committee could use a more systematic approach to incorporate observed information and to quantify the risks associated with different options. There are two key trade-offs involved in this decision. First, if the Committee decides to retain the current vaccine composition instead of updating to a new one, there is lower uncertainty in production yields, but the current vaccine could be less effective if a new virus strain spreads. Second, if the Committee decides early with less information, then manufacturers have more production time, but the reduced information increases the risk of choosing a wrong strain. We derive an optimal dynamic policy for this decision. Because of the greater uncertainty in production yields of new vaccines, the optimal thresholds are neither symmetric between retaining and updating the composition nor monotonic over time. We apply our model to past decisions using parameter values estimated from a historical case. Our analysis shows that the dynamic optimal policy can significantly improve social welfare.

Title: Global Facility Network Design with Transshipment and Responsive Pricing
Abstract: This paper considers the facility network design problem for a global firm that sells to two markets: the domestic market and a foreign market. Although the firm has to invest in capital-intensive production facilities and produce outputs in the face of demand and exchange rate uncertainties, it can postpone the transshipment, localization, and distribution of the output until after uncertainties are resolved. The key network design decisions faced by the firm are in which of the two markets to locate the capital-intensive production facilities and what the corresponding output levels should be. We provide the complete characterization of the optimal global facility network configuration for two types of global firms: a newsvendor with exogenously given selling prices and a firm with the flexibility of pricing responsively after uncertainties are resolved. Our study's focus is on the impact of exchange rate uncertainty and responsive pricing on facility network decisions. Compared with a newsvendor facing demand uncertainty only, the introduction of exchange rate uncertainty or the use of responsive pricing can increase the attractiveness of centralized production. A responsive-pricing firm's optimal network design differs from that of a newsvendor firm as follows. (1) The firm's network preference is less susceptible to the increase of localization costs. (2) The firm is less likely to switch from a network of regional production to a network of centralized production in response to the increasing size of one market. (3) Demand and exchange rate uncertainties can have opposite effects on its optimal centralized output when the nature of the random shocks they introduce to the firm's demand function is different: under the linear demand function, the optimal centralized output increases in the demand volatility when demand shock is additive, but it may decrease in the exchange rate volatility because the corresponding price shock is multiplicative. Interestingly, common to both types of firms, their network preferences, although sensitive to costs and mean demand and exchange rate, are robust to the demand and exchange rate volatilities, suggesting that transshipment-enabled output substitutability between the two markets diminishes the impact of increasing market volatilities on the network design decision.

Title: Transshipment of Inventories: Dual Allocations vs. Transshipment Prices
Abstract: We study a newsvendor game with transshipments, in which n retailers face a stochastic demand for an identical product. Before the demand is realized, each retailer independently orders her initial inventory. After the demand is realized, the retailers select an optimal transshipment pattern and ship residual inventories to meet residual demands. Unsold inventories are salvaged at the end of the period. We compare two methods for distribution of residual profit--transshipment prices (TPs) and dual allocations (DAs)--that were previously analyzed in literature. TPs are selected before the demand is known, and DAs, which are obtained by calculating the dual prices for the transshipment problem, are calculated after observing the true demand. We first study the conditions for the existence of the Nash equilibria under DA and then compare the performance of the two methods and show that neither allocation method dominates the other. Our analysis suggests that DAs may yield higher efficiency among "more asymmetric" retailers, whereas TPs work better with retailers that are "more alike," but the difference in profits does not seem significant. We also link expected dual prices to TPs and use those results to develop heuristics for TPs with more than two symmetric retailers. For general instances with more than two asymmetric retailers, we propose a TP agreement that uses a neutral central depot to coordinate the transshipments (TPND). Although DAs in general outperform TPND in our numerical simulations, its ease of implementation makes TPND an attractive alternative to DAs when the efficiency losses are not significant (e.g., high critical fractiles or lower demand variances).

Title: Managing Perishables with Substitution: Inventory Issuance and Replenishment Heuristics
Abstract: We consider a discrete-time supply chain for perishable goods having separate demand streams for items of different ages. For a good that has two periods of lifetime, we build a model that generalizes and/or subsumes many of the models in the literature and study the effectiveness of two intuitive heuristic (base-stock) replenishment policies combined with different substitution rules. For each replenishment policy, we identify sufficient conditions on cost parameters for a substitution rule to be economically superior to others under our base-stock replenishment policies. Our analysis shows that the replenishment policy almost universally advocated in the perishable inventory literature may lead to pathological behavior when used with issuance rules that pool inventory (via substitution) to satisfy multiple, age-differentiated demand streams. Furthermore, we find that system behavior is typically more predictable, and potentially less costly, under a policy long-discarded in the literature that ignores the inventory of aged items, ordering a constant amount each period. Thus the benefit of pooling inventory for substitutable, perishable products depends critically on the replenishment policy used.

Title: A Comparison of Traditional and Open-Access Policies for Appointment Scheduling
Abstract: This paper compares two types of appointment-scheduling policies for single providers: traditional and open-access. Under traditional scheduling, each of a specified number of patients per day is booked well in advance, but may not show up for his or her appointment. Under open-access scheduling, a random number of patients call in the morning to make an appointment for that same day. Thus the number of patient arrivals will be random, for different reasons, under both policies. We find that the open-access schedule will significantly outperform the traditional schedule--in terms of a weighted average of patients' waiting time, the doctor's idle time, and the doctor's overtime--except when patient waiting time is held in little regard or when the probability of no-shows is quite small.

Title: Dynamic Scheduling of Outpatient Appointments Under Patient No-Shows and Cancellations
Abstract: This paper develops a framework and proposes heuristic dynamic policies for scheduling patient appointments, taking into account the fact that patients may cancel or not show up for their appointments. In a simulation study that considers a model clinic, which is created using data obtained from an actual clinic, we find that the heuristics proposed outperform all the other benchmark policies, particularly when the patient load is high compared with the regular capacity. Supporting earlier findings in the literature, we find that the open access policy, a recently proposed popular scheduling paradigm that calls for "meeting today's demand today," can be a reasonable choice when the patient load is relatively low.

Title: OM Practice--Choice-Based Revenue Management: An Empirical Study of Estimation and Optimization
Abstract: Discrete choice models are appealing for airline revenue management (RM) because they offer a means to profitably exploit preferences for attributes such as time of day, routing, brand, and price. They are also good at modeling demand for unrestricted fare class structures, which are widespread throughout the industry. However, there is little empirical research on the practicality and effectiveness of choice-based RM models. Toward this end, we report the results of a study of choice-based RM conducted with a major U.S. airline. Our study had two main objectives: (1) to assess the extent to which choice models can be estimated well using readily available airline data, and (2) to gauge the potential impact that choice-based RM could have on a sample of test markets. We developed a maximum likelihood estimation algorithm that uses a variation of the expectation-maximization method to account for unobservable data. The procedure was applied to data for a test market from New York City to a destination in Florida. The outputs are promising in terms of the quality of the computed estimates, although a large number of departure instances may be necessary to achieve highly accurate results. These choice model estimates were then used in a simulation study to assess the revenue performance of the EMSR-b (expected marginal seat revenue, version b) capacity control policies and the current controls used by the airline relative to controls optimized to account for choice behavior. Our simulation results show 1%-5% average revenue improvements using choice-based RM. Although such simulated results must be taken with caution, overall our study suggests that choice-based revenue management is both feasible to execute and economically significant in real-world airline environments.

Title: On the Pricing of Natural Gas Pipeline Capacity
Abstract: Pipelines play a critical role in matching the supply and demand of natural gas. The pricing of their capacity is an important problem in practice for pipeline companies and the users of this capacity, which include shippers such as natural gas merchants, producers, and local distribution companies. This paper conducts a normative analysis of how pipeline capacity should be priced by each of these players. Although the trading value of this capacity should be relevant to merchants and its substitution and congestion values to shippers and pipelines, respectively, this analysis shows that all of these are equivalent values. Thus pipeline capacity should be priced at its trading value, a prediction that can be empirically investigated. This paper also conducts an empirical analysis of this prediction based on transacted prices of transport contracts for the capacity of the Tennessee Gas Pipeline, a major interstate pipeline in the United States, and finds support for it. This analysis suggests that the uncertainty in the evolution of natural gas prices is an important driver of operational performance in the pricing of pipeline capacity. The results of this paper have potential relevance for the pricing of the capacity of other commodity conversion assets.

Title: The Impact of Quick Response in Inventory-Based Competition
Abstract: We propose an extension of the competitive newsvendor model to investigate the impact of quick response under competition. For this purpose, we consider two retailers that compete in terms of inventory: customers that face a stockout at their first-choice store will look for the product at the other store. Consequently, the total demand that each retailer faces depends on the competitor's inventory level. We allow for asymmetric reordering capabilities, and we are particularly interested in the case when one of the firms has a lower ordering cost but can only produce at the beginning of the selling season, whereas the second firm has higher costs but can replenish stock in a quick response manner, taking advantage of any incremental knowledge about demand (if it is available). We visualize this problem as the competition between a traditional make-to-stock retailer that builds up inventory before the season starts versus a retailer with a responsive supply chain that can react to early demand information. We provide conditions for this game to have a unique pure-strategy subgame-perfect equilibrium, which then allows us to perform numerical comparative statics. We confirm that quick response is more beneficial when demand uncertainty is higher or exhibits a higher correlation over time. We also find that the competitive advantage from quick response is larger when facing a slow response competitor, and interestingly, asymmetric competition can be desirable to both competitors.

Title: Improving Supply Chain Performance: Real-Time Demand Information and Flexible Deliveries
Abstract: In some supply chains, materials are ordered periodically according to local information. This paper investigates how to improve the performance of such a supply chain. Specifically, we consider a serial inventory system in which each stage implements a local reorder interval policy; i.e., each stage orders up to a local base-stock level according to a fixed-interval schedule. A fixed cost is incurred for placing an order. Two improvement strategies are considered: (1) expanding the information flow by acquiring real-time demand information and (2) accelerating the material flow via flexible deliveries. The first strategy leads to a reorder interval policy with full information; the second strategy leads to a reorder point policy with local information. Both policies have been studied in the literature. Thus, to assess the benefit of these strategies, we analyze the local reorder interval policy. We develop a bottom-up recursion to evaluate the system cost and provide a method to obtain the optimal policy. A numerical study shows the following: Increasing the flexibility of deliveries lowers costs more than does expanding information flow; the fixed order costs and the system lead times are key drivers that determine the effectiveness of these improvement strategies. In addition, we find that using optimal batch sizes in the reorder point policy and demand rate to infer reorder intervals may lead to significant cost inefficiency.

Title: Pricing and Dimensioning Competing Large-Scale Service Providers
Abstract: The literature on many-server approximations provides significant simplifications toward the optimal capacity sizing of large-scale monopolists, but falls short of providing similar simplifications for a competitive setting in which each firm's decision is affected by its competitors' actions. In this paper, we introduce a framework that combines many-server heavy-traffic analysis with the notion of epsilon-Nash equilibrium and apply it to the study of equilibria in a market with multiple large-scale service providers that compete on both prices and response times. In an analogy to fluid and diffusion approximations for queueing systems, we introduce the notions of fluid game and diffusion game. The proposed framework allows us to provide first-order and second-order characterization results for the equilibria in these markets. We use our results to provide insights into the price and service-level choices in the market and, in particular, into the impact of market scale on the interdependence between these two strategic decisions.

Title: When Promotions Meet Operations: Cross-Selling and Its Effect on Call Center Performance
Abstract: We study cross-selling operations in call centers. The following questions are addressed: How many customer-service representatives are required (staffing), and when should cross-selling opportunities be exercised (control) in a way that will maximize the expected profit of the center while maintaining a prespecified service level target? We tackle these questions by characterizing control and staffing schemes that are asymptotically optimal in the limit, as the system load grows large. Our main finding is that a threshold priority control, in which cross-selling is exercised only if the number of callers in the system is below a certain threshold, is asymptotically optimal in great generality. The asymptotic optimality of threshold priority reduces the staffing problem to a solution of a simple deterministic problem in one regime and to a simple search procedure in another. We show that our joint staffing and control scheme is nearly optimal for large systems. Furthermore, it performs extremely well, even for relatively small systems.

Title: Mitigating Supply Risk: Dual Sourcing or Process Improvement?
Abstract: Surveys suggest that supply chain risk is a growing issue for executives and that supplier reliability is of particular concern. A common mitigation strategy is for the buying firm to expend effort improving the reliability of its supply base. We explore a model in which a firm can source from multiple suppliers and/or exert effort to improve supplier reliability. For both random capacity and random yield types of supply uncertainty, we propose a model of process improvement in which improvement efforts (if successful) increase supplier reliability in the sense that the delivered quantity (for any given order quantity) is stochastically larger after improvement. We characterize the optimal procurement quantities and improvement efforts and generate managerial insights. For random capacity, improvement is increasingly favored over dual sourcing as the supplier cost heterogeneity increases, but dual sourcing is favored over improvement if the supplier reliability heterogeneity is high. In the random yield model, increasing cost heterogeneity can reduce the attractiveness of improvement, and improvement can be favored over dual sourcing if the reliability heterogeneity is high. A combined strategy (improvement and dual sourcing) can provide significant value if suppliers are very unreliable and/or capacity is low relative to demand.

Title: Exploiting Market Size in Service Systems
Abstract: We study a profit-maximizing firm providing a service to price and delay sensitive customers. We are interested in analyzing the scale economies inherent in such a system. In particular, we study how the firm's pricing and capacity decisions change as the scale, measured by the potential market for the service, increases. These decisions turn out to depend intricately on the form of the delay costs seen by the customers; we characterize these decisions up to the dominant order in the scale for both convex and concave delay costs. We show that when serving customers on a first-come, first-served basis, if the customers' delay costs are strictly convex, the firm can increase its utilization and extract profits beyond what it can do when customers' delay costs are linear. However, with concave delay costs, the firm is forced to decrease its utilization and makes less profit than in the linear case. While studying concave delay costs, we demonstrate that these decisions depend on the scheduling policy employed as well. We show that employing the last-come, first-served rule in the concave case results in utilization and profit similar to the linear case, regardless of the actual form of the delay costs.

Title: Alliance Formation Among Perfectly Complementary Suppliers in a Price-Sensitive Assembly System
Abstract: Independent parties that produce perfectly complementary components may form alliances (or coalitions or groups) to better coordinate their pricing decisions when they sell their products to downstream buyers. This paper studies how market demand conditions (i.e., the form of the demand function, demand uncertainty, and price-sensitive demand) drive coalition formation among complementary suppliers. In a deterministic demand model, we show that for an exponential or isoelastic demand function, suppliers always prefer selling in groups; for a linear-power demand function, suppliers may all choose to sell independently in equilibrium. These results are interpreted through the pass-through rate associated with the demand function. In an uncertain demand model, we show that, in general, the introduction of a multiplicative stochastic element in demand has an insignificant impact on stable coalitions and that an endogenous retail price (i.e., demand is price sensitive) increases suppliers' incentives to form alliances relative to the case with a fixed retail price. We also consider the impact of various other factors on stable outcomes in equilibrium, e.g., sequential decision making by coalitions of different sizes, the cost effect due to alliance formation (either cost savings or additional costs), and a system without an assembler.

Title: Implementing Supply-Routing Optimization in a Make-to-Order Manufacturing Network
Abstract: Dell's supply chain for desktops involves Asian vendors shipping components by sea to several U.S. plants. Although suppliers are responsible for shipping enough inventory to meet total needs across all production sites, Dell can reroute and expedite their shipments while in transit, and also transfer on-hand inventory in order to balance supply across sites. This paper describes the development, implementation, and impact of the process and optimization-based control system now used by Dell to address this supply-routing challenge for its U.S.-bound monitors. In a first phase, Dell created a new job definition focused solely on supply routing and implemented a supporting visualization tool. In a second phase, a decision support system relying on a mixed-integer programming formulation was implemented, overcoming two main challenges: (i) the estimation of shortages as a function of expected inventory, accounting for actual forecast quality; and (ii) the estimation of a meaningful shortage cost. This new methodology is estimated to have reduced Dell's inventory-repositioning costs for monitors by about 60%.

Title: Leadtime-Variety Tradeoff in Product Differentiation
Abstract: The literature on mass customization generally focuses on the tradeoff between higher revenues from better matching customer preferences with product specifications, and higher costs of offering a broader--possibly fully customized--product line. Less well understood is the tradeoff between the increased ability to precisely meet customer preferences and the increased leadtime from order placement to delivery often associated with customized products. In this paper, we use a locational customer choice model to formulate a firm's integrated product line design problem that involves variety, leadtime (or inventory), and pricing decisions. We propose a dynamic programming based solution procedure that amounts to solving a shortest path problem on an acyclic network, and derive some structural results on the optimal product line design. We find that unimodal preferences generally result in hybrid product lines, with standard products clustering around the mode and custom products covering the tails, in contrast with the all-custom or all-standard product lines that are optimal under uniform preferences. We also numerically examine how the firm should adjust its leadtime and variety in response to changes in parameters such as customer dispersion and operational scale. We find that the tradeoff between leadtime and variety is sometimes nonintuitive and complex.

Title: Independence of Capacity Ordering and Financial Subsidies to Risky Suppliers
Abstract: The risk of supply disruptions because of suppliers' financial problems plays a prominent role in manufacturers' risk portfolios. Even large suppliers (e.g., Delphi) could file for bankruptcy, and manufacturers' actions, such as financial subsidies to suppliers, profoundly affect suppliers' financial health. Using a dynamic, stochastic, periodic-review model of the manufacturer's joint capacity reservation and financial subsidy decisions and a general firm-value model of the supplier's financial state, this paper addresses the following questions: What is the optimal joint capacity ordering and financial subsidy policy for the manufacturer? Must subsidy and capacity ordering decisions be made jointly? How good are the recommendations from the traditional procurement models, which ignore the benefits of controlling the supplier's financial state through subsidies? The paper presents general assumptions that allow the manufacturer to make ordering decisions independent of subsidy decisions and investigates interactions between ordering and subsidy decisions when these assumptions are violated. Conditions are presented for the optimal subsidy policy to have a "subsidize-up-to" structure and for the optimal ordering decisions to be newsvendor fractiles.

Title: Procurement Mechanism Design in a Two-Echelon Inventory System with Price-Sensitive Demand
Abstract: This paper studies a buyer's procurement strategies in a two-stage supply chain with price-sensitive demand. The buyer procures a product from a supplier and then sells to the marketplace. Market demand is stochastic and depends on the buyer's selling price. The supplier's production cost is private information, and the buyer only knows the distribution of the cost. Both the buyer and the supplier can hold inventories to improve service, and a periodic-review inventory system is considered. The buyer takes two attributes into consideration when designing the procurement mechanism: quantity attribute (i.e., the total purchase quantity) and service-level attribute (i.e., the supplier's delivery performance). We first identify the optimal procurement mechanism for the buyer, which consists of a nonlinear menu of contracts for each of the two attributes. It can be shown that the optimal mechanism induces both a lower market demand and a lower service level compared to the supply chain optimum. In view of the complexity of the optimal mechanism, we proceed to search for simpler mechanisms that perform well for the buyer. We find that the above two attributes have different implications for procurement mechanism design: The value of using complex contract terms is generally negligible for the service-level attribute, whereas it can be highly valuable for the quantity attribute. In particular, we demonstrate that a fixed service-level contract, which consists of a target service level and a price-quantity menu, yields nearly optimal profit for the buyer. Additionally, the price-quantity menu is essentially a quantity discount scheme widely observed in practice.

Title: ASAP: The After-Salesman Problem
Abstract: We consider the operational scheduling or dispatching problem of assigning servicemen to service requests that arrive in real time. The objective is to optimize responsiveness, i.e., to minimize waiting in excess of a promised response time. We study how responsiveness is influenced by modeling decisions and solution methods that arise when solving the dynamic problem by repeatedly solving real-time problems. Most results are derived using a set-partitioning based solution approach, which is shown to perform best among considered alternatives. Our research is based on a large-scale real-life application regarding roadside service assistance.

Title: To Wave or Not to Wave? Order Release Policies for Warehouses with an Automated Sorter
Abstract: Batch (wave) release policies are prevalent in warehouses with an automated sorter, and take different forms depending on how batches released consecutively may overlap downstream in the sorter. Continuous (waveless) release constitutes an emerging alternative recently adopted by several firms. Although that new policy presents several advantages relative to waves, it requires more expensive technology and involves the possibility of congestion-induced collapse (gridlock) at the sorter. Using an extensive data set of detailed warehouse flow information from a leading U.S. online retailer, we first develop a model with validated predictive accuracy for a warehouse operating under waveless release. We then use that model to compute operational guidelines for dynamically managing the main control lever of that policy with the goal of maximizing throughput while keeping the risk of gridlock under a specified threshold. Second, we leverage that model and data set to compare the performance of wave-based and waveless policies through simulation. The best waveless policy yields larger or equal throughput than the best wave-based policy in all scenarios considered, and thus appears to merit some consideration by practitioners.

Title: Myopic Inventory Policies Using Individual Customer Arrival Information
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the optimality of myopic inventory replenishment policies in a periodic-review single-echelon system, with nonstationary, correlated, stochastic demand and cost, and nonincreasing stochastic prices. Using the single-unit decomposition approach, we provide certain general conditions on the demand and cost processes under which a myopic policy is optimal. Under these conditions, the optimal policy is a myopic state-dependent base-stock policy, which can be expressed in closed form as a base-probability policy. Specifically, the order associated with a given customer should be placed if and only if its arrival probability within the leadtime is higher than a threshold. Our results generalize earlier conditions for the optimality of myopic policies. Namely, we show that myopic policies can be optimal even when the demand is correlated or stochastically decreasing.

Title: Do Random Errors Explain Newsvendor Behavior?
Abstract: Previous experimental work showed that newsvendors tend to order closer to mean demand than prescribed by the normative critical fractile solution. A recently proposed explanation for this mean ordering behavior assumes that the decision maker commits random choice errors, and predicts the mean ordering pattern because there is more room to err toward mean demand than away from it. Do newsvendors exhibit mean ordering simply because they make random errors? We subject this hypothesis to an empirical test that rests on the fact that the random error explanation is insensitive to context. Our results strongly support the existence of context-sensitive decision strategies that rely directly on (biased) order-to-demand mappings, such as mean demand anchoring, demand chasing, and inventory error minimization.

Title: On the Interaction Between Demand Substitution and Production Changeovers
Abstract: This paper analyzes the trade-off between (demand) substitution costs and (production) changeover costs in a discrete-time production-inventory setting using a two-product dynamic lot-sizing model with changeover, inventory carrying, and substitution costs. We first show that the problem is polynomially solvable and then develop several insights into the behavior of such systems and identify strategies for effectively managing them. A key driver for the extent of substitution is the ratio of changeover cost to the substitution cost associated with mean demand. The interaction between changeovers and substitution is most prominent when this ratio is neither too high nor too low. Furthermore, the value of this ratio also influences the length of an appropriate rolling horizon; an increase in the value of the ratio signals an increase in the length of a near-optimal rolling horizon. We identify a complementary relationship between substitution and changeover costs: When the changeover cost is large, it is better to invest in reducing the substitution cost and vice versa. As the holding cost of the substitutable product increases, substitution is (respectively, changeovers are) utilized more when the changeover (respectively, substitution) cost is large.

Title: Project Management Contracts with Delayed Payments
Abstract: When managing projects with considerable uncertainty, such as those arising in construction, defense, and new product development, it is customary for a manufacturer (project manager) to offer contracts under which each supplier (contractor) receives a prespecified payment when she completes her task. However, there are recent cases in which the manufacturer imposes "delayed payment" contracts under which each supplier is paid only when all suppliers have completed their tasks. By considering a model of one manufacturer and n \ge 2 identical and independent suppliers with exponential completion times, we analyze the impact of both a delayed payment regime and a no-delayed-payment regime on each supplier's effort level and on the manufacturer's net profit in equilibrium. When the suppliers' work rates are unadjustable, we conjecture that the manufacturer is actually worse off under the delayed payment regime. However, when the suppliers' work rates are adjustable, we obtain a different result: the delayed payment regime is more profitable for the manufacturer either when the project revenue is sufficiently small or when the number of suppliers is sufficiently large.
