Title: The Newsvendor Problem with Advertising Revenue
Abstract: We study a modified newsvendor model in which the newsvendor obtains a revenue from sales to end users as well as from an advertiser paying to obtain access to those end users. We study the optimal decisions for both a price-taking and a price-setting newsvendor when the advertiser has private information about its willingness to pay for advertisements. We find that the newsvendor's optimal policy excludes advertisers with low willingness to pay and distorts the price and quantity from its system-efficient level to screen the advertiser. Our analysis reveals the different roles that pricing and production quantity play as screening instruments. We perform a numerical analysis to investigate the value of information and the impact of the model parameters.

Title: Improved Inventory Targets in the Presence of Limited Historical Demand Data
Abstract: Most of the literature on inventory management assumes that the demand distribution and the values of its parameters are known with certainty. In this paper, we consider a repeated newsvendor setting where this is not the case and study the problem of setting inventory targets when there is a limited amount of historical demand data. Consequently, we achieve the following objectives: (1) to quantify the inaccuracy in the inventory-target estimation as a function of the length of the historical demand data, the critical fractile, and the shape parameters of the demand distribution; and (2) to determine the inventory target that minimizes the expected cost and accounts for the uncertainty around the demand parameters estimated from limited historical data. We achieve these objectives by using the concept of expected total operating cost and representing the demand distribution with the highly flexible Johnson translation system. Our procedures require no restrictive assumptions about the first four moments of the demand random variables, and they can be easily implemented in practical settings with reduced expected total operating costs.

Title: Fluid Tasks and Fluid Teams: The Impact of Diversity in Experience and Team Familiarity on Team Performance
Abstract: In this paper, we consider how the structures of tasks and teams interact to affect team performance. We study the effects of diversity in experience on a team's ability to respond to task changes by separately examining <i>interpersonal</i> team diversity (i.e., differences in experience across the entire team) and <i>intrapersonal</i> team diversity (i.e., whether individuals on the team are more or less specialized). We also examine whether team familiarity--team members' prior experience working with one another--helps teams to better manage challenges created by task changes and greater interpersonal team diversity. Using detailed project- and individual-level data from an Indian software services firm, we find that the interaction of task change with intrapersonal diversity is related to improved project performance, whereas the interaction of task change with interpersonal diversity is related to diminished performance. Additionally, the interaction of team familiarity with <i>inter</i>personal diversity is related to improved project performance in some cases. Our results highlight a need for more nuanced approaches to leveraging experience in team management.

Title: Herding in Queues with Waiting Costs: Rationality and Regret
Abstract: We study how consumers with waiting cost disutility choose between two congested services of unknown service value. Consumers observe an imperfect private signal indicating which service facility may provide better service value as well as the queue lengths at the service facilities before making their choice. If more consumers choose the same service facility because of their private information, longer queues will form at that facility and indicate higher quality. On the other hand, a long queue also implies more waiting time. We characterize the equilibrium queue-joining behavior of arriving consumers and the extent of their learning from the queue information in the presence of such positive and negative externalities. We find that when the arrival rates are <i>low</i>, utility-maximizing rational consumers herd and join the longer queue, ignoring any contrary private information. We show that even when consumers treat queues as independently evolving, herd behavior persists with consumers joining longer queues above a threshold queue difference. However, if the consumers seek to minimize ex post regret when making their decisions, herd behavior may be dampened.

Title: Product Customization and Customer Service Costs: An Empirical Analysis
Abstract: We conduct a field study in a U.S. health insurance firm to examine how product customization affects the firm's cost to serve customers through its call center. In our setting, the product is a complex health insurance plan. The firm incurs substantial costs in serving the customers through its call center and in adjudicating the claims using its information systems. The firm sells either standard plans or in some instances allows customer groups to customize their plans by adding and modifying certain aspects in active collaboration with the firm. Such a collaboration process is akin to the firm cocreating products with its customers. This cocreation process should increase customers' familiarity with their coverage and improve the fit with their medical needs. Better fit and familiarity in turn, reduces customers' incentives to contact the call center for clarifications regarding the firm's product coverage. In particular, we show that customers with a customized plan call 21% less frequently than customers with a standard plan. Our results account for possible self-selection of customers to customized plans. We also show no difference in the claims adjudication cost between a standard and a customized plan exists. Overall, our results suggest customized plans may be operationally cheaper to serve than standard plans. Thus, our paper provides a link between a growing business concern (customer support cost via call centers) and a prevalent business strategy (product customization via cocreation).

Title: Incentives for Transshipment in a Supply Chain with Decentralized Retailers
Abstract: We examine transshipment incentives in a decentralized supply chain where a monopolist distributes a product through independent retailers. A key insight is that the transshipment price determines whether the firms benefit from, or are hurt by, transshipment. In particular, we show that the manufacturer prefers to set the transshipment price as high as possible, whereas retailers prefer a lower transshipment price. Given the important role of the transshipment price in determining the benefits that each firm gets from transshipment, it is useful to consider transshipment in the case where retailers are under joint ownership (a "chain store") and the transshipment price does not play a role. This comparison yields two surprising results. First, if decentralized retailers control the transshipment price, they will choose a relatively low transshipment price as a way to mitigate the manufacturer's ability to extract profits by increasing wholesale prices; therefore, the manufacturer may prefer dealing with the chain store, which does not have a transshipment price, rather than with decentralized retailers. Similarly, the decentralized retailers can use a low transshipment price to achieve higher total profits than a chain store.

Title: Adaptive Appointment Systems with Patient Preferences
Abstract: Patients' satisfaction with an appointment system when they attempt to book a nonurgent appointment is affected by their ability to book with a doctor of choice and to book an appointment at a convenient time of day. For medical conditions requiring urgent attention, patients want quick access to a familiar physician. For such instances, it is important for clinics to have open slots that allow same-day (urgent) access. A major challenge when designing outpatient appointment systems is the difficulty of matching randomly arriving patients' booking requests with physicians' available slots in a manner that maximizes patients' satisfaction as well as clinics' revenues. What makes this problem difficult is that booking preferences are not tracked, may differ from one patient to another, and may change over time. This paper describes a framework for the design of the next generation of appointment systems that dynamically learn and update patients' preferences and use this information to improve booking decisions. Analytical results leading to a partial characterization of an optimal booking policy are presented. Examples show that heuristic decision rules, based on this characterization, perform well and reveal insights about trade-offs among a variety of performance metrics important to clinic managers.

Title: Product Variety and Capacity Investments in Congested Production Systems
Abstract: We investigate a firm's product line design and capacity investment problem for vertically differentiated products along design quality levels. Customers arrive according to a Poisson process and are heterogeneous in their marginal valuation of the quality level. Customers make product choices to maximize a linear utility function of price, quality level, and waiting cost. Resulting product demands are met through capacity investments in production processes, which are modeled as queuing systems. We consider two different types of production processes: product-focused, dedicated to the production of a single-product variant; and product-flexible, processing all product variants in the product line. Capacity investment and variable production costs are functions of the processed product's quality. We develop an integrated marketing-operations model that provides insights on the factors determining the right level of product variety to offer, the relative quality positioning of the products in the line, the resulting market coverage and segmentation, and the effects on production costs and congestion levels of the processes. We show that the statistical economies of scale resulting from the congestion phenomena in the production system impose limits on the optimal product variety. For product-focused processes the market size promotes a higher optimal product variety, whereas the per-unit capacity investment and customer waiting costs act as deterrents for higher product variety. For product-flexible processes optimal product variety also depends on the specific type of flexibility and the ratio of capacity investment to variable production costs.

Title: The Impact of Yield-Dependent Trading Costs on Pricing and Production Planning Under Supply Uncertainty
Abstract: This paper studies the role of the yield-dependent trading cost structure influencing the optimal choice of the selling price and production quantity for a firm that operates under supply uncertainty in the agricultural industry. The firm initially leases farm space, but its realized amount of fruit supply fluctuates because of weather conditions, diseases, etc. At the end of the growing season, the firm has three options: convert its crop supply to the final product, purchase additional supplies from other growers, and sell some (or all) of its crop supply in the open market without converting to the finished product. We consider the problem both from a risk-neutral and a risk-averse perspective with varying degrees of risk aversion. The paper offers three sets of contributions: (1) It shows that the use of a static cost exaggerates the initial investment in the farm space and the expected profit significantly, and the actual value gained from a secondary (emergency) option for an agricultural firm is lower under the yield-dependent cost structure. (2) It proves that although the risk-neutral firm does not benefit from fruit futures, a sufficiently risk-averse firm can benefit from the presence of a fruit futures market. The same risk-averse firm does not purchase fruit futures when it operates under static costs. Thus, fruit futures can only add value under yield-dependent trading costs. (3) Contrary to the results presented for the newsvendor problem under demand uncertainty, the firm does not always commit to a lower initial quantity (leased farm space) under risk aversion. Rather, the firm might lease a larger farm space under risk aversion.

Title: Inventory Management of Platelets in Hospitals: Optimal Inventory Policy for Perishable Products with Regular and Optional Expedited Replenishments
Abstract: Platelets are short-life blood components used in hospital blood transfusion centers. Excluding time for transportation, testing, and arrangement, clinically transfusable platelets have a mere three-day life span. This paper analyzes a periodic review inventory system for such a perishable product under two replenishment modes. Regular orders are placed at the beginning of a cycle. Within the cycle, the manager has an option of placing an additional order, referred to as an expedited order, characterized by an order-up-to level policy. For this platelet inventory problem, we prove the existence and uniqueness of an optimal policy that minimizes the expected cost. We then derive the necessary and sufficient conditions for the policy, based on which an algorithm is developed. Using real-life data, we provide a numerical illustration and a sensitivity analysis followed by extensive simulation experiments to examine the dynamics of platelet inventory management. It is shown that the optimal cost is significantly affected by demand uncertainty, lead times, seasonality, and vintage of expedited orders. Given a hospital's demand profile and the cost parameters, we are able to determine whether the hospital should order daily or every other day (i.e., adopting a combined use of regular and optional expedited orders). We also show that the analytical solution is a good approximation of the optimal policy obtained from simulation experiments, where more realistic features are incorporated. This inventory research problem can be classified as a fixed-lifetime perishable problem with dual modes of replenishments.

Title: Supplier Diversification Strategies in the Presence of Yield Uncertainty and Buyer Competition
Abstract: The benefits of supplier diversification are well established for price-taking firms. In this paper, we investigate the benefits from supplier diversification for dual-sourcing duopolists. We consider a two-echelon supply chain in which suppliers sell components to buyers who produce and sell substitutable products. The suppliers' output processes are uncertain and modeled as having a proportional random yield. Buyers engage in a quantity-based Cournot competition. We find that an increase in supplier correlation leads to more correlated buyers' outputs and a decrease in their profits. In the presence of end-market competition, dual sourcing still brings value by reducing the inefficiency caused by random yield: Namely, when the suppliers' yield processes are strongly negatively correlated, dual sourcing increases the expected market output and improves the firms' profits over sole sourcing. However, unlike a monopolist firm, a duopolist does not necessarily allocate its supplier orders to minimize output variability. We generalize the main results to a two-stage order-quantity-output-quantity game and to one with asymmetric suppliers.

Title: Computing Bid Prices for Revenue Management Under Customer Choice Behavior
Abstract: We consider a choice-based, network revenue management (RM) problem in a setting where heterogeneous customers consider an assortment of products offered by a firm (e.g., different flight times, fare classes, and/or routes). Individual choice decisions are modeled through an ordered list of preferences, and minimal assumptions are made about the statistical properties of this demand sequence. The firm manages the availability of products using a bid-price control strategy, and would like to optimize the control parameters. We formulate a continuous demand and capacity model for this problem that allows for the partial acceptance of requests. The model admits a simple calculation of the sample path gradient of the revenue function. This gradient is then used to construct a stochastic steepest ascent algorithm. We show that the algorithm converges (w.p.1) to a stationary point of the expected revenue function under mild conditions. The procedure is relatively efficient from a computational standpoint, and in our synthetic and real-data experiments performs comparably to or even better than other choice-based methods that are incompatible with the current infrastructure of RM systems. These features make it an interesting candidate to be pursued for real-world applications.

Title: Efficient Funding: Auditing in the Nonprofit Sector
Abstract: Nonprofit organizations are a critical part of society as well as a growing sector of the economy. For funders there is an increasing and pressing need to ensure that society reaps the most social benefit for their money while also developing the nonprofit sector as a whole. By routinely scrutinizing nonprofit reports in an effort to deduce whether a nonprofit organization is efficient, funders may believe that they are, in fact, giving responsibly. However, we find that these nonprofit reports are unreliable, supporting a myriad of empirical research and revealing that report-based funding methods do not facilitate efficient allocation of funds. In response, we develop audit contracts that put funders in a position to enact change. Auditing, perhaps obviously, supports funders; however, we find that it also benefits the population of nonprofits. Moreover, auditing results in improved efficiency for the nonprofit sector overall. Indeed, our conclusions indicate that nonprofits may want to work with funders to increase the use of auditing, consequently increasing efficiency for the sector overall and impacting society as a whole.

Title: How Much Is a Reduction of Your Customers' Wait Worth? An Empirical Study of the Fast-Food Drive-Thru Industry Based on Structural Estimation Methods
Abstract: In many service industries, companies compete with each other on the basis of the waiting time their customers experience, along with other strategic instruments such as the price they charge for their service. The objective of this paper is to conduct an empirical study of an important industry to measure to what extent waiting time performance impacts different firms' market shares and price decisions. We report on a large-scale empirical industrial organization study in which the demand equations for fast-food drive-thru restaurants in Cook County are estimated based on so-called structural estimation methods. Our results confirm the belief expressed by industry experts, that in the fast-food drive-thru industry customers trade off price and waiting time. More interestingly, our estimates indicate that consumers attribute a very high cost to the time they spend waiting.

Title: Value of Local Cash Reuse: Inventory Models for Medium-Size Depository Institutions Under the New Federal Reserve Policy
Abstract: The effective local reuse of physical cash by depository institutions (DIs) is the primary goal of the new cash recirculation policy of the Federal Reserve System (Fed) of the United States. These guidelines, implemented since July 2007, encourage the reuse of cash by (i) penalizing a DI for the practice of <i>cross shipping</i>, the near-simultaneous deposit of used cash to--and withdrawal of fit cash from--the Fed; and (ii) offering a <i>custodial inventory</i> program that enables a DI to transfer fit cash to the Fed's books, but physically hold it within the DI's secured facility. The effective management of the inventory of cash under these new guidelines is both a challenging and important issue for DIs. We introduce two new multiperiod models--designed specifically to capture the operations of a medium-size DI--that emerge from the DI's objective to minimize the total cost incurred in managing the inventory of cash over a finite planning horizon. The Basic Model (BM) captures the DI's mode of operations if it chooses not to locally reuse cash and, instead, incur the cross-shipping penalty. Using two important structural properties, we provide a polynomial-time dynamic programming algorithm for BM. The Reuse Model (RM) represents the DI's actions when it locally recirculates cash. We first prove the hardness of RM and then develop an integer programming formulation. A comprehensive test bed--based on our interaction with a leading secure-logistics provider--helps us to develop several useful insights into the relative impacts of the DI-specific parameters and the Fed's cross-shipping fee on the effective management of cash. In particular, we show that the <i>Value of Local Reuse</i> for a DI, measured as the percentage cost saving between the optimal solutions of BM and RM, is substantial, and we analyze the forces that influence the volume of cross shipping. We also develop a rolling-horizon procedure to adapt the optimal solutions of BM and RM for obtaining near-optimal real-time solutions in the presence of a modest amount of uncertainty. Finally, we provide a comparative analysis of a DI's decisions under the Fed's mechanism and those under a socially optimal mechanism.

Title: A Censored-Data Multiperiod Inventory Problem with Newsvendor Demand Distributions
Abstract: We study the stochastic multiperiod inventory problem in which demand in excess of available inventory is lost and unobserved so that demand data are censored. A Bayesian scheme is employed to dynamically update the demand distribution for the problem with storable or perishable inventory and with exogenous or endogenous price. We show that the Weibull is the only newsvendor distribution for which the optimal solution can be expressed in scalable form. Moreover, for Weibull demand the cost function is not convex in general. Nevertheless, in all but the storable case, sufficient structure can be discerned so that the optimal solution can be easily computed. Specifically, for the perishable inventory case, the optimal policy can be found by solving simple recursions, whereas the perishable case with pricing requires solutions to more complex one-step look-ahead recursions. Interestingly, for the special case of exponential demand the cost function is convex, so that for the storable inventory case, the optimal policy can be found using simple one-step look-ahead recursions whereas for the perishable case the optimal policy can be expressed by exact closed-form formulas.

Title: Call Centers with Delay Information: Models and Insights
Abstract: In this paper, we analyze a call center with impatient customers. We study how informing customers about their anticipated delays affects performance. Customers react by balking upon hearing the delay announcement and may subsequently renege, particularly if the realized waiting time exceeds the delay that has originally been announced to them. The balking and reneging from such a system are a function of the delay announcement. Modeling the call center as an <i>M</i>/<i>M</i>/<i>s</i> &plus; <i>M</i> queue with endogenized customer reactions to announcements, we analytically characterize performance measures for this model. The analysis allows us to explore the role announcing different percentiles of the waiting time distribution, i.e., <i>announcement coverage</i>, plays on subsequent performance in terms of balking and reneging. Through a numerical study, we explore when informing customers about delays is beneficial and what the optimal coverage should be in these announcements. We show how managers of a call center with delay announcements can control the trade-off between balking and reneging through their choice of announcements to be made.

Title: Pricing Multiple Products with the Multinomial Logit and Nested Logit Models: Concavity and Implications
Abstract: We consider the problem of pricing multiple differentiated products with the nested logit model and, as a special case, the multinomial logit model. We prove that concavity of the total profit function with respect to market share holds even when price sensitivity may vary with products. We use this result to analytically compare the optimal monopoly solution to oligopolistic equilibrium solutions. To demonstrate further applications of the concavity result, we consider several multiperiod dynamic models that incorporate the pricing of multiple products in the context of inventory control and revenue management, and establish structural results of the optimal policies.

Title: <b>OM Forum</b>--Some Lessons on Operations Management Model Implementation Drawn from the RAND Fire Project
Abstract: This article examines the contributions and historical context of the fire project that was undertaken in the early 1970s by the New York City-RAND Institute on behalf of the New York City Fire Department. We identify a number of technical and nontechnical factors that contributed to the high impact of this operations modeling effort. We hypothesize that these factors, though derived from the experiences in a particular public sector engagement, are applicable to other large-scale operations modeling efforts. This invited contribution is based on the author's inaugural Manufacturing and Service Operations Management (MSOM) Distinguished Fellows address that was given at the June 2011 MSOM conference at the University of Michigan.

Title: The Impact of Group Purchasing Organizations on Healthcare-Product Supply Chains
Abstract: This paper examines the impact of group purchasing organizations (GPOs) on healthcare-product supply chains. The supply chain we study consists of a profit-maximizing manufacturer with a quantity-discount schedule that is nonincreasing in quantity and ensures nondecreasing revenue, a profit-maximizing GPO, a competitive source selling at a fixed unit price, and <i>n</i> providers (e.g., hospitals) with fixed demands for a single product. Each provider seeks to minimize its total purchasing cost (i.e., the cost of the goods plus the provider's own fixed transaction cost). Buying through the GPO offers providers possible cost reductions but may involve a membership fee. Selling through the GPO offers the manufacturer possibly higher volumes, but requires that the manufacturer pay the GPO a contract administration fee (CAF), i.e., a percentage of all revenue contracted through it. Using a game-theoretic model, we examine questions about this supply chain, including how the presence of a GPO affects the providers' total purchasing costs. We also address the controversy about whether Congress should amend the Social Security Act, which, under current law, permits CAFs. Among other things, we conclude that although CAFs affect the distribution of profits between manufacturers and GPOs, they do not affect the providers' total purchasing costs.

Title: Capacity Allocation over a Long Horizon: The Return on Turn-and-Earn
Abstract: We consider a supply chain in which a supplier sells products to multiple retailers. When orders from the retailers exceed the supplier's capacity, she must employ an allocation mechanism to balance supply and demand. In particular, we consider a commonly used allocation scheme in the automobile industry: turn-and-earn, which uses past sales to allocate capacity. In essence, retailers "earn" an allotment of a vehicle after they sell one. In contrast to turn-and-earn, fixed allocation ignores past sales and gives each retailer an equal share of the capacity. Earlier work has demonstrated that turn-and-earn induces more sales in a two-period setting compared to fixed allocation. The question remains unanswered whether turn-and-earn induces similar behaviors over a long horizon when retailers possess private demand information. We construct a dynamic stochastic game of order competition over an infinite horizon to track the order dynamics of the supply chain. We obtain a richer set of equilibrium behaviors than existing models predict. Instead of a symmetric allocation outcome, we observe that sales leadership may arise in equilibrium and that retailers with different past sales adopt distinct ordering strategies to respond to demand uncertainty. Transient sales dynamics suggest that sales leadership may not be persistent and can be eliminated by the occurrence of extremely low demand. This provides a theoretical explanation for several behavioral observations of some U.S. automobile dealers. In addition to the sales-inducing effect, interestingly, turn-and-earn also causes the retailers to absorb local demand variability.

Title: Good and Bad News About the (<i>S</i>, <i>T</i>) Policy
Abstract: This paper studies the optimization of the (<i>S</i>, <i>T</i>) inventory policy, where <i>T</i> is the replenishment interval and <i>S</i> is the order-up-to level. First, we demonstrate that the previously established joint convexity of the long-run average cost is false. Hence, the optimization is not straightforward. We then point out that the joint convexity concept depends on whether <i>S</i> and <i>T</i> are continuous or discrete variables, and in some situations it may not even be well defined. Nonetheless, we are able to identify several useful properties of the cost function, such as submodularity and coordinatewise convexity. Based on these properties, we develop efficient algorithms to compute the optimal policy for continuous and discrete demands.

Title: An Econometric Analysis of Patient Flows in the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit
Abstract: This paper explores the rationing of bed capacity in a cardiac intensive care unit (ICU). We find that the length of stay for patients admitted to the ICU is influenced by the occupancy level of the ICU. In particular, a patient is likely to be discharged early when the occupancy in the ICU is high. This in turn leads to an increased likelihood of the patient having to be readmitted to the ICU at a later time. Such "bounce-backs" have implications for the overall ICU effective capacity--an early discharge immediately frees up capacity, but at the risk of a (potentially much higher) capacity requirement when the patient needs to be readmitted. We analyze these capacity implications, shedding light on the question of whether an ICU should apply an aggressive discharge strategy or if it should follow the old quality slogan and "do it right the first time." By comparing the total capacity usage for patients who were discharged early versus those who were not, we show that an aggressive discharge policy applied to patients with lower clinical severity levels frees up capacity in the ICU. However, we find that an increased number of readmissions of patients with high clinical severity levels occur when the ICU is capacity constrained, thereby effectively reducing peak bed capacity.

Title: Routing to Manage Resolution and Waiting Time in Call Centers with Heterogeneous Servers
Abstract: In many call centers, agents are trained to handle all arriving calls but exhibit very different performance for the same call type, where we define performance by both the average call handling time and the call resolution probability. In this paper, we explore strategies for determining which calls should be handled by which agents, where these assignments are dynamically determined based on the specific attributes of the agents and/or the current state of the system. We test several routing strategies using data obtained from a medium-sized financial service firm's customer service call centers and present empirical performance results. These results allow us to characterize overall performance in terms of customer waiting time and overall resolution rate, identifying an efficient frontier of routing rules for this contact center.

Title: The Value of Collaborative Forecasting in Supply Chains
Abstract: Motivated by the mixed evidence concerning the adoption level and value of collaborative forecasting (CF) implementations in retail supply chains, in this paper, we explore the conditions under which CF offers the highest potential. We consider a two-stage supply chain with a single supplier selling its product to consumers through a single retailer. We assume that both the supplier and the retailer can improve the quality of their demand forecasts by making costly forecasting investments to gather and analyze information. First, we consider a <i>noncollaborative</i> model where the supplier and the retailer can invest in forecasting but do not share forecast information. Next, we examine a <i>collaborative forecasting</i> model where the supplier and the retailer combine their information to form a single shared demand forecast. We investigate the value of CF by comparing each party's profits in these scenarios under three contractual forms that are widely used in practice (two variations of the simple wholesale price contract as well as the buyback contract). We show that for a given set of parameters, CF may be Pareto improving for none to all three of the contractual structures, and that the Pareto regions under all three contractual structures can be expressed with a unifying expression that admits an intuitive interpretation. We observe that these regions are limited and explain how they are shaped by the contractual structure, power balance, and relative forecasting capability of the parties. To determine the specific value of collaborative forecasting as a function of different factors, we carry out a numerical analysis and observe the following. First, under noncoordinating contracts, improved information as a result of CF has the added benefit of countering the adverse effects of double marginalization in addition to reducing the cost of supply-demand mismatch. Second, one may expect the value of CF to increase with bargaining power, however this does not hold in general: The value of CF for the newsvendor first increases and then decreases in his bargaining power. Finally, whereas one may expect CF to be more valuable under coordinating contracts, rather than a simple wholesale price contract that is prone to double marginalization, the <i>magnitude of the gain</i> from CF is in many cases higher in the absence of quantity coordination.

Title: The Timing of Staffing Decisions in Hospital Operating Rooms: Incorporating Workload Heterogeneity into the Newsvendor Problem
Abstract: We study the problem of setting nurse staffing levels in hospital operating rooms when there is uncertainty about daily workload. The workload is the number of operating room hours used by a medical specialty on a given day to perform surgical procedures. Variable costs consist of wages at a regular (scheduled) rate and at an overtime rate when the realized workload exceeds the scheduled time. Using a newsvendor framework, we consider the problem of determining optimal staffing levels with different information sets available at the time of decision: no information, information on number of cases, and information on number and types of cases. We develop empirical models for the daily workload distribution in which the mean and variance change with the information available. We use these models to derive optimal staffing rules based on historical data from a U.S. teaching hospital and prospectively test the performance of these rules. Our numerical results suggest that hospitals could potentially reduce their staffing costs by up to 39%-49% by deferring staffing decisions until procedure type information is available. The results demonstrate how data availability can affect a newsvendor's performance. The systematic approach of empirical modeling presented in the paper can be applied to other newsvendor problems with heterogeneous sources of demand.

Title: Turning Waste into By-Product
Abstract: This paper studies how a firm can create and capture value by converting a waste stream into a useful and saleable by-product (i.e., implementing by-product synergy (BPS)). We show that BPS creates an operational synergy between two products that are jointly produced. In essence, BPS is a process innovation that reduces the marginal cost of the original product and/or the by-product. The firm creates value through this process innovation and can capture this value by capturing newly created market opportunities, taking market share from competitors, or licensing the innovation to its competitors. We determine the optimal operating and licensing strategies for the firm and find market conditions under which the firm would benefit most from implementing BPS. We show that the optimal operating and licensing strategies are driven by the size of the cost reduction enabled by the BPS process innovation. We also show that leveraging the synergies between the original product and by-product can lead to counterintuitive profit-maximizing operating strategies such as increasing the amount of waste generated, and strategically increasing the quantity of original product above the business as usual production volume. We present a framework for assessing the environmental impact of BPS that incorporates the impact of the optimal operating and licensing strategies.

Title: A Laboratory Investigation of Rank Feedback in Procurement Auctions
Abstract: A popular procurement auction format is one in which bidders compete during a live auction event but observe only the rank of their own bid and not the price bids of their competitors. We investigate the performance of auctions with rank feedback in a simple setting for which analytical benchmarks are readily available. We test these benchmarks in the laboratory by comparing the performance of auctions with rank-based feedback to auctions with full-price feedback as well as to auctions with no price feedback (sealed-bid auctions). When bidders are risk-neutral expected-profit maximizers, the buyer's expected costs should be the same under rank and full-price feedback; moreover, expected buyer costs should be the same as in a sealed-bid auction. However, when we test this theoretical equality in a controlled laboratory setting we find that, consistent with practitioners' beliefs but contrary to our model, rank feedback results in <i>lower</i> average prices than full-price feedback. We identify two behavioral reasons for the difference. The first explanation is based on the similarity of the bidders' problem in a sealed-bid first-price auction and an open-bid auction with rank feedback. The second explanation incorporates the use of jump bids motivated by bidder impatience.

Title: Effect of Traffic on Sales and Conversion Rates of Retail Stores
Abstract: Attracting shoppers to stores and converting the incoming traffic into sales profitably are vital for the financial health of retailers. In this paper, we use proprietary data pertaining to an apparel retailer to study the relationship between store traffic, labor, and sales performance. We decompose sales volume into conversion rate (defined as the ratio of number of transactions to traffic) and basket value (defined as the ratio of sales volume to number of transactions) and analyze the impact of traffic on sales and its components. We find that store sales volume exhibits diminishing returns to scale with respect to traffic, and labor moderates the impact of traffic on sales. For example, we find that for values of traffic and labor corresponding to the mean, increasing average traffic per hour by one unit increases average sales volume per hour by $9.97. Further, we find that the marginal returns to traffic increases from $10.00 to $11.32 when labor increases by one standard deviation. In addition, we find that the conversion rate declines with increasing traffic and a lower conversion rate is associated with a decrease in future traffic growth. Our study underscores the importance of in-store operations in driving the financial performance of retailers.

Title: Capacity Planning in the Semiconductor Industry: Dual-Mode Procurement with Options
Abstract: To help a firm reduce inefficiencies associated with equipment capacity planning, we propose a <i>dual-mode equipment procurement</i> (DMEP) framework. DMEP combines dual-source (i.e., a less-expensive-but-slower base mode and a faster-but-more-expensive flexible mode) procurement with option contracts in three layers: a <i>contract negotiation</i> layer, where the firm chooses the best combination of lead time and price for each mode from the supply contract menu; a capacity <i>reservation</i> layer, where the firm reserves total equipment procurement quantities from the two supply modes before the planning horizon starts; and an <i>execution</i> layer, where the firm orders equipment from the two supply modes based on the updated demand information. We first investigate the execution layer as a dynamic dual-source capacity expansion problem with demand backlogging and demonstrate that the optimal policy lacks structure even under the simplest setting. Thus, we propose a heuristic solution for the execution-layer problem, which also serves as a building block for the other two layers. Through numerical analysis, we quantify the value of the added flexibility of DMEP for the firm. The DMEP framework has been implemented at Intel Corporation and has resulted in savings of tens of millions of dollars for one process technology.

Title: Operational Compliance Levers, Environmental Performance, and Firm Performance Under Cap and Trade Regulation
Abstract: Cap and trade programs impose limits on industry emissions but offer individual firms the flexibility to choose among different operational levers toward compliance, including inputs, process changes, and the use of allowances to account for emissions. In this paper, we examine the relationships among (1) levers for compliance (at-source pollution prevention, end-of-pipe pollution control, and the use of allowances); (2) environmental performance; and (3) firm market performance for the context of stringent cap and trade regulation with allowance grandfathering (i.e., the allocation of allowances for free). To investigate these relationships, we use data on publicly traded utility firms operating coal-fired generating units regulated by the U.S. Acid Rain Program from three principal sources: the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and the Compustat database. Our results indicate a significant relationship between better environmental performance and lower firm market performance over at least a three-year period. From a regulatory perspective, our results show a negative association between allowance grandfathering and firm environmental performance. Overall, by explicitly considering the context of stringent regulation, we find a counter-example to the view that better environmental performance generally associates with better economic performance.

Title: Using a Dual-Sourcing Option in the Presence of Asymmetric Information About Supplier Reliability: Competition vs. Diversification
Abstract: We study a buyer's strategic use of a dual-sourcing option when facing suppliers possessing private information about their disruption likelihood. We solve for the buyer's optimal procurement contract. We show that the optimal contract can be interpreted as the buyer choosing between diversification and competition benefits. Better information increases diversification benefits and decreases competition benefits. Therefore, with better information the buyer is more inclined to diversify. Moreover, better information may increase or decrease the value of the dual-sourcing option, depending on the buyer's unit revenue: for large revenue, the buyer uses the dual sourcing option for diversification, the benefits of which increase with information; for small revenue, the buyer uses the dual sourcing option for competition, the benefits of which decrease with information. Surprisingly, as the reliability of the entire supply base decreases, the buyer may stop diversifying under asymmetric information (to leverage competition), whereas it would never do so under symmetric information. Finally, we analyze the effect of codependence between supply disruptions. We find that lower codependence leads the buyer to rely less on competition. Because competition keeps the information costs in check, a reduction in supplier codependence increases the buyer's value of information. Therefore, strategic actions to reduce codependence between supplier disruptions should not be seen as a substitute for learning about suppliers' reliabilities.

Title: Are Reservations Recommended?
Abstract: We examine the role of reservations in capacity-constrained services with a focus on restaurants. Although customers value reservations, restaurants typically neither charge for them nor impose penalties for failing to keep them. However, reservations impose costs on firms offering them. We offer a novel motivation for offering reservations that emphasizes the way in which reservations can alter customer behavior. We focus on a market in which demand is uncertain and the firm has limited capacity. There is a positive chance that the firm will not have enough capacity to serve all potential customers. Customers are unable to observe how many potential diners are in the market before incurring a cost to request service. Hence, if reservations are not offered, some may choose to stay home rather than risk being denied service. This lowers the firm's sales when realized demand is low. Reservations increase sales on a slow night by guaranteeing reservations holders service. However, some reservation holders may choose not to use their reservations resulting in no-shows. The firm must then trade off higher sales in a soft market with sales lost to no-shows on busy nights. We consequently evaluate various no-show mitigation strategies, all of which serve to make reservations more likely in equilibrium. Competition also makes reservations more attractive; when there are many small firms in the market, reservations are always offered.

Title: Optimizing Organic Waste to Energy Operations
Abstract: A waste-to-energy firm that recycles organic waste with energy recovery performs two environmentally beneficial functions: it diverts waste from landfills and it produces renewable energy. At the same time, the waste-to-energy firm serves and collects revenue from two types of customers: waste generators who pay for waste disposal service and electricity consumers who buy energy. Given the process characteristics of the waste-to-energy operation, the market characteristics for waste disposal and energy, and the mechanisms regulators use to encourage production of renewable energy, we determine the profit-maximizing operating strategy of the firm. We also show how regulatory mechanisms affect the operating decisions of the waste-to-energy firm. Our analyses suggest that if the social planner's objective is to maximize landfill diversion, offering a subsidy as a per kilowatt-hour for electricity is more cost effective, whereas if the objective is to maximize renewable energy generation, giving a subsidy as a lump sum to offset capital costs is more effective. This has different regulatory implications for urban and rural settings where the environmental objectives may differ.

Title: Unit-Contingent Power Purchase Agreement and Asymmetric Information About Plant Outage
Abstract: This paper analyzes a unit-contingent power purchase agreement between an electricity distributor and a power plant. Under such a contract the distributor pays the plant a fixed price if the plant is operational and nothing if plant outage occurs. Pricing a unit-contingent contract is complicated by the fact that the plant's true status is its private information. The difference between the electricity spot price and the unit-contingent contract price provides an incentive for the plant to misreport its status and earn profit at the distributor's expense. To prevent misreporting, the distributor may inspect the plant and levy penalties if misreporting is discovered. We find that some type of misreporting under certain circumstances can benefit both the plant and the distributor, because it serves as a risk-allocation mechanism between the two parties. We show that such a risk-allocation mechanism is equivalent to using state-contingent options and prohibiting misreporting.

Title: The Impact of Dependent Service Times on Large-Scale Service Systems
Abstract: This paper investigates the impact of dependence among successive service times on the transient and steady-state performance of a large-scale service system. This is done by studying an infinite-server queueing model with time-varying arrival rate, exploiting a recently established heavy-traffic limit, allowing dependence among the service times. This limit shows that the number of customers in the system at any time is approximately Gaussian, where the time-varying mean is unaffected by the dependence, but the time-varying variance is affected by the dependence. As a consequence, required staffing to meet customary quality-of-service targets in a large-scale service system with finitely many servers based on a normal approximation is primarily affected by dependence among the service times through this time-varying variance. This paper develops formulas and algorithms to quantify the impact of the dependence among the service times on that variance. The approximation applies directly to infinite-server models but also indirectly to associated finite-server models, exploiting approximations based on the peakedness (the ratio of the variance to the mean in the infinite-server model). Comparisons with simulations confirm that the approximations can be useful to assess the impact of the dependence.

Title: Optimal Algorithms for Assortment Selection Under Ranking-Based Consumer Choice Models
Abstract: A retailer's product selection decisions are largely driven by her assumptions on how consumers make choices. We use a ranking-based consumer choice model to represent consumer preferences: every customer has a ranking of the potential products in the category and purchases his highest ranked product (if any) offered in the assortment. We consider four practically motivated special cases of this model, namely, the one-way substitution, the locational choice, the outtree, and the intree preference models, and we study the retailer's product selection problem when products have different price and cost parameters. We assume that the retailer incurs a fixed carrying cost per product offered, a goodwill penalty for each customer who does not purchase his first choice and a lost sale penalty for each customer who does not find an acceptable product to buy. For the first three models, we obtain efficient solution methods that simplify to either a shortest path method or a dynamic program. For the fourth model, we construct an effective algorithm and show numerically that, in practice, it is much faster than enumeration. We also obtain valuable insights on the structure of the optimal assortment.

Title: In-Season Transshipments Among Competitive Retailers
Abstract: A decentralized system of competing retailers that order and sell the same product in a sales season is studied. When a customer demand occurs at a stocked-out retailer, that retailer requests a unit to be transshipped from another retailer who charges a transshipment price. If this request is rejected, the unsatisfied customer may go to another retailer with a customer overflow probability. Each retailer decides on the initial order quantity from a manufacturer and on the acceptance/rejection of <i>each</i> transshipment request. For two retailers, we show that retailers' optimal transshipment policies are dynamic and characterized by chronologically nonincreasing inventory holdback levels. We analytically study the sensitivity of holdback levels to explain interesting findings, such as smaller retailers and geographically distant retailers benefit more from transshipments. Numerical experiments show that retailers substantially benefit from using optimal transshipment policies compared to no sharing. The expected sales increase in all but a handful of over 3,000 problem instances. Building on the two-retailer optimal policies, we suggest an effective heuristic transshipment policy for a multiretailer system.

Title: Managing Opportunistic Supplier Product Adulteration: Deferred Payments, Inspection, and Combined Mechanisms
Abstract: Recent cases of product adulteration by foreign suppliers have compelled many manufacturers to rethink approaches to deterring suppliers from cutting corners, especially when manufacturers cannot fully monitor and control the suppliers' actions. In this paper, we study three mechanisms for dealing with product adulteration problems: (a) the deferred payment mechanism--the buyer pays the supplier after the deferred payment period only if no adulteration has been discovered by the customers; (b) the inspection mechanism--the buyer pays the supplier immediately, contingent on product passing the inspection; and (c) the combined mechanism--a combination of the deferred payment and inspection mechanisms. We show that the inspection mechanism cannot completely deter the suppliers from product adulteration, whereas the deferred payment mechanism can. Surprisingly, the combined mechanism is redundant: either the inspection or the deferred payment mechanisms perform just as well. Finally, we identify four factors that determine the dominance of deferred payment mechanism over the inspection mechanism: (a) the inspection cost relative to inspection accuracy, (b) the buyer's liability for adulterated products, (c) the difference in financing rates for the buyer and the supplier relative to the defects discovery rate by customers, and (d) the difference in production costs for adulterated and unadulterated product. We find that the deferred payment mechanism is preferable to inspection if the threats of adulteration (either incentive to adulterate or the consequences) are low.

Title: Key Factors in the Market for Remanufactured Products
Abstract: Measures to extend the economic lives of products--such as remanufacturing carried out by <i>closed-loop supply chains</i>--are receiving increased attention because of various economic and regulatory factors. In this paper, we examine drivers of price differentials between new and remanufactured products using data on purchases made on eBay. Our analysis shows that seller reputation significantly explains the price differentials between new and remanufactured products. We also find that products remanufactured by original equipment manufacturers or their authorized factories are purchased at relatively higher prices than products remanufactured by third parties. However, in the presence of these reputation signals (seller reputation and remanufacturer identity), we find that stronger warranties are not significantly associated with higher prices paid for remanufactured products. Our work contributes to the closed-loop supply chain research stream in operations management by empirically examining market factors that have not been studied before.

Title: Supply Chain Dynamics and Channel Efficiency in Durable Product Pricing and Distribution
Abstract: This study extends the single-period vertical price interaction in a manufacturer-retailer dyad to a multiperiod setting. A manufacturer distributes a durable product through an exclusive retailer to an exhaustible population of consumers with heterogeneous reservation prices. In each period, the manufacturer and retailer in turn set wholesale and retail prices, respectively, and customers with valuation above the retail price adopt the product at a constant (hazard) rate. We derive the open-loop, feedback, and myopic equilibria for this dynamic pricing game and compare it to the centralized solution. Although in an integrated supply chain a forward-looking dynamic pricing strategy is always desirable, we show that this is not the case in a decentralized setting, because of vertical competition. Our main result is that both supply chain entities are better off in the long run when they ignore the impact of current prices on future demand and focus on immediate-term profits. A numerical study confirms that this insight is robust under various supply- and demand-side effects. We use the channel efficiency corresponding to various pricing rules to further derive insights into decisions on decentralization and disintermediation.

Title: Markdown Pricing with Unknown Fraction of Strategic Customers
Abstract: A growing segment of the revenue management and pricing literature assumes "strategic" customers who are forward-looking in their pursuit of utility. Recognizing that such behavior may not be directly observable by a seller, we examine the implications of seller uncertainty over strategic customer behavior in a markdown pricing setting. We assume that some proportion of customers purchase impulsively in the first period if the price is below their willingness to pay, while other customers strategically wait for lower prices in the second period. We consider a two-period selling season in which the seller knows the aggregate demand curve but not the proportion of customers behaving strategically. We show that a robust pricing policy that requires no knowledge of the extent of strategic behavior performs remarkably well. We extend our model to a setting with stochastic demand, and show that the robust pricing policy continues to perform well, particularly as capacity is loosened or the problem is scaled up. Our results underscore the need to recognize strategic behavior, but also suggest that in many cases effective performance is possible without precise knowledge of strategic behavior.

Title: The Value of Product Variety When Selling to Strategic Consumers
Abstract: We consider a firm that sells two vertically (quality) differentiated products to strategically forward-looking consumers over two periods, setting the prices dynamically in each period. The consumers are heterogeneous in their evaluations of quality, and strategic in that they decide not only whether and which product variant to buy, but also when to buy, choosing the option that maximizes their utility. We derive the equilibrium of the pricing-purchasing game between the firm and the consumers. We find that the loss due to strategic customer behavior can be less with two product variants compared to the single-product benchmark, which indicates that product variety can serve as a lever when dealing with strategic customers. This benefit exists when the additional product has an inferior cost-to-quality ratio. Because of this benefit, a firm may find it attractive to sell a product variant that would be unprofitable otherwise. However, product variety can also hurt profitability due to strategic customer behavior: A product variant that would be profitable absent strategic customers can in fact be unprofitable. This can happen when customer impatience and firm costs are moderate.

Title: Robust Design and Control of Call Centers with Flexible Interactive Voice Response Systems
Abstract: We consider the robust design and control of call center systems with flexible interactive voice response (IVR) systems. In a typical call center equipped with an IVR system, customers are handled first by the IVR system, which is a computerized system that often enables customers to self-serve. Those customers whose service cannot be handled by the IVR system are sent to the second stage to be served by agents. To address the design of a call center with a flexible IVR system, we consider a call center whose IVR system can operate in two different service delivery modes that have statistically different outcomes. We formulate a stochastic program to determine the number of agents needed in the second stage as well as the proportion of customers that should be selected for each IVR service mode under different demand levels with the objective of minimizing the total staffing and abandonment costs. We also propose dynamic control policies to achieve the optimal proportions without the knowledge of the exact arrival rate. We show that the staffing levels found by the stochastic program combined with the proposed routing policies are asymptotically optimal in large systems. We present extensive numerical and simulation results to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed solutions.

Title: Service-Level Variability of Inbound Call Centers
Abstract: In practice, call center service levels are reported over periods of finite length that are usually no longer than 24 hours. In such small periods the service level has a large variability. It is therefore not sufficient to base staffing decisions only on the expected service level. In this paper we consider the classical <i>M</i>/<i>M</i>/<i>s</i> queueing model that is often used in call centers. We develop accurate approximations for the service-level distribution based on extensive simulations. This distribution is used for a service-level variability-controlled staffing approach to circumvent the shortcomings of the traditional staffing based on the expected service level.

Title: Single-Stage Approximations for Optimal Policies in Serial Inventory Systems with Nonstationary Demand
Abstract: Companies often face nonstationary demand due to product life cycles and seasonality, and nonstationary demand complicates supply chain managers' inventory decisions. This paper proposes a simple heuristic for determining stocking levels in a serial inventory system. Unlike the exact optimization algorithm, the heuristic generates a near-optimal solution by solving a series of independent single-stage systems. The heuristic is constructed based on three results we derive. First, we provide a new cost decomposition scheme based on echelon systems. Next, we show that the optimal base-stock level for each echelon system is bounded by those of two revised echelon systems. Last, we prove that the revised echelon systems are essentially equivalent to single-stage systems. We examine the myopic solution for these single-stage systems. In a numerical study, we find that the change of direction of the myopic solution is consistent with that of the optimal solution when system parameters vary. We then derive an analytical expression for the myopic solution and use it to gain insights into how to manage inventory. The analytical expression shows how future demand affects the current optimal local base-stock level; it also explains an observation that the safety stock at an upstream stage is often stable and may not increase when the demand variability increases over time. Finally, we discuss how the heuristic leads to a time-consistent coordination scheme that enables a decentralized supply chain to achieve the heuristic solution.

Title: The Impact of Airline Flight Schedules on Flight Delays
Abstract: Airline flight delays have come under increased scrutiny lately in the popular press, with the Federal Aviation Administration data revealing that airline on-time performance was at its worst level in 13 years in 2007. Flight delays have been attributed to several causes such as weather conditions, airport congestion, airspace congestion, use of smaller aircraft by airlines, etc. In this paper, we examine the impact of the scheduled block time allocated for a flight, a factor controlled by airlines, on on-time arrival performance. We analyze empirical flight data published by the Bureau of Transportation Statistics to estimate the scheduled on-time arrival probability of each commercial domestic flight flown in the United States in 2007 by a major carrier. The structural estimation approach from econometrics is then used to impute the overage to underage cost ratio of the newsvendor model for each flight. Our results show that airlines systematically "underemphasize" flight delays, i.e., the flight delay costs implied by the newsvendor model are less than the implied costs of early arrivals for a large fraction of flights. Our results indicate that revenue drivers (e.g., average fare) and competitive measures (e.g., market share) have a significant impact on the scheduled on-time arrival probability. We also show that the scheduled on-time arrival probability is not positively affected by the total number of passengers on the aircraft rotation who could be affected by a flight delay, or the number of incoming and outgoing connecting passengers on a flight. Operational characteristics such as the hub and spoke network structure also have a significant impact on the scheduled on-time arrival probability. Finally, full-service airlines put a higher weight on the cost of late arrivals than do low-cost carriers, and flying on the lowest fare flight on a route results in a drop in the scheduled on-time arrival probability.

Title: A Computational Approach to the Real Option Management of Network Contracts for Natural Gas Pipeline Transport Capacity
Abstract: Commodity merchants use real option models to manage their operations. A central element of such a model is its underlying operating policy. We focus on network contracts for the transport capacity of natural gas pipelines, specific energy conversion assets. Practitioners commonly manage these contracts as portfolios of spread options. Although computationally fast, we show that this approach in general is heuristic because of the suboptimality of its operating policy. We propose a different computationally efficient real option approach based on an optimal operating policy, integrating linear optimization and Monte Carlo simulation. We use our approach to benchmark the spread option approach in a numerical study based on market data and realistic instances. We find that our approach can substantially improve on the contract valuations computed by the spread option approach, especially for contracts with flexibility in their allowed capacity usage. We also show that the optimal operating policy of contracts with this flexibility is of the greedy type, whereas the one of contracts without it in general is not. However, we observe that greedy optimization yields a near-optimal operating policy for the latter type of contracts with a substantially reduced computational effort. A version of our model was recently implemented by a major international energy trading company. Our model can also be employed to efficiently estimate the contract value sensitivities (the "Greeks"), which merchants use for financial hedging purposes. Potentially, our work has wider significance for the merchant management of other commodity conversion assets with payoffs determined by solving capacity constrained optimization models.

Title: Seasonal Energy Storage Operations with Limited Flexibility: The Price-Adjusted Rolling Intrinsic Policy
Abstract: The value of seasonal energy storage depends on how the firm operates storage to capture seasonal price spreads. Energy storage operations typically face limited operational flexibility characterized by the speed of storing and releasing energy, which makes the optimal policy, in general, difficult to compute. A widely used practice-based heuristic, the rolling intrinsic (RI) policy, generally performs well compared with an optimal policy but can significantly underperform in some cases. In this paper, we aim to understand the gap between the RI policy and the optimal policy and leverage the resulting insights to improve the RI policy. A new heuristic policy, the <i>price-adjusted rolling intrinsic</i> (PARI) policy, is developed based on theoretical analysis of storage options. This heuristic adjusts certain prices before applying the RI policy to provide the RI policy with estimates of the values of various storage options. We evaluate the performance of the RI and PARI polices using actual data from the natural gas industry. Our results show that, on average, the PARI policy recovers about 67% of the value loss of the RI policy. Furthermore, when the value loss of the RI policy is larger, the PARI policy tends to recover a higher fraction of that value loss.

Title: A Multiordering Newsvendor Model with Dynamic Forecast Evolution
Abstract: We consider a newsvendor who dynamically updates her forecast of the market demand over a finite planning horizon. The forecast evolves according to the martingale model of forecast evolution (MMFE). The newsvendor can place multiple orders with increasing ordering cost over time to satisfy demand that realizes at the end of the planning horizon. In this context, we explore the trade-off between improving demand forecast and increasing ordering cost. We show that the optimal ordering policy is a state-dependent base-stock policy and analytically characterize that the base-stock level depends on the information state in a <i>linear</i> (<i>log-linear</i>) fashion for additive (multiplicative) MMFE. We also study a benchmark model where the newsvendor is restricted to order only once. By comparing the multiordering and single-ordering models, we quantify the impact of the multiordering strategy on the newsvendor's expected profit and risk exposure.

Title: OM Forum--The Vital Role of Operations Analysis in Improving Healthcare Delivery
Abstract: There is now a broad consensus among healthcare professionals that the U.S. healthcare delivery system is woefully inefficient and needs to be radically redesigned. Healthcare costs have always been a driving force in policy and management, but quality has become equally important in driving decisions, particularly since emerging payment systems include metrics on clinical and operational performance. With the increasing use of information technology to capture financial, operational, and clinical data and to coordinate care across time and different venues, there is a growing demand for operations analysts to examine processes of care and provide much-needed insights on how to better utilize resources to improve outcomes while reducing costs. In this paper, I describe some of the essential features of the U.S. healthcare system and some critical issues that provide opportunities for operations researchers to make important contributions.

Title: Physician Workload and Hospital Reimbursement: Overworked Physicians Generate Less Revenue per Patient
Abstract: We study the impact of physician workload on hospital reimbursement utilizing a detailed data set from the trauma department of a major urban hospital. We find that the proportion of patients assigned a "high-severity" status for reimbursement purposes, which maps, on average, to a 47.8% higher payment for the hospital, is substantially reduced as the workload of the discharging physician increases. This effect persists after we control for a number of systematic differences in patient characteristics, condition, and time of discharge. Furthermore, we show that it is unlikely to be caused by selection bias or endogeneity in either discharge timing or allocation of discharges to physicians. We attribute this phenomenon to a workload-induced reduction in diligence of paperwork execution. We estimate the associated monetary loss to be approximately 1.1% (95% confidence interval, 0.4%-1.9%) of the department's annual revenue.

Title: Optimization of Prostate Biopsy Referral Decisions
Abstract: Prostate cancer is the most common solid tumor in American men and is screened for using prostate-specific antigen (PSA) tests. We report on a nonstationary partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) for prostate biopsy referral decisions. The core states are the patients' prostate cancer related health states, and PSA test results are the observations. Transition probabilities and rewards are inferred from the Mayo Clinic Radical Prostatectomy Registry and the medical literature. The objective of our model is to maximize expected quality-adjusted life years. We solve the POMDP model to obtain an age and belief (probability of having prostate cancer) dependent optimal biopsy referral policy. We also prove a number of structural properties including the existence of a control-limit type policy for the biopsy referral decision. Our empirical results demonstrate a nondecreasing belief threshold in age, and we provide sufficient conditions under which PSA screening should be discontinued for older patients. Finally, the benefits of screening under the optimal biopsy referral policy are estimated, and sensitivity analysis is used to prioritize the model parameters that would benefit from additional data collection.

Title: Process Management Impact on Clinical and Experiential Quality: Managing Tensions Between Safe and Patient-Centered Healthcare
Abstract: This research investigates the effect of process management on clinical and experiential quality. Clinical quality measures hospitals' performance on patient safety, i.e., adherence to standards, whereas experiential quality relates to patient centeredness, i.e., responsiveness to the needs and preferences of the patient. Drawing from the organizational learning literature, we argue for a trade-off between clinical and experiential quality as hospitals emphasize process management. We also study how external and internal forces, i.e., state legislation and hospital leadership, influence this relationship. A combination of primary data and secondary data collected at various time intervals is employed to test our hypotheses. Four important implications emerge from this work. First, we find that hospitals' emphasis on process management is associated with an increase in clinical quality but a decrease in experiential quality. Second, we find that state legislation initially reinforces this trade-off but, overtime, facilitates a positive impact of process management on both quality outcomes. Third, a post hoc analysis suggests that a specific type of hospital leadership, namely, patient-centered leadership, helps mitigate the negative association between process management and experiential quality. Finally, our research provides preliminary evidence regarding the relationship between clinical quality and patient satisfaction contingent on experiential quality. Implications for theory and practice are discussed.

Title: Integrated Block Sharing: A Win-Win Strategy for Hospitals and Surgeons
Abstract: We consider the problem of balancing two competing objectives in the pursuit of efficient management of operating rooms in a hospital: providing surgeons with predictable, reliable access to the operating room and maintaining high utilization of capacity. The common solution to the first problem (in practice) is to grant exclusive "block time," in which a portion of the week in an operating room is designated to a particular surgeon, barring other surgeons from using this room/time. As a major improvement over this existing approach, we model the possibility of "shared" block time, which need only satisfy capacity constraints in expectation. We reduce the computational difficulty of the resulting NP-hard block-scheduling problem by implementing a column-generation approach and demonstrate the efficacy of this technique using simulation, calibrated to a real hospital's historical data and objectives.Our simulations illustrate substantial benefits to hospitals under a variety of circumstances and demonstrate the advantages of our new approach relative to a benchmark method taken from the recent literature.

Title: A Queueing Model to Evaluate the Impact of Patient "Batching" on Throughput and Flow Time in a Medical Teaching Facility
Abstract: We consider the work flow in a medical teaching facility, examining the process that involves an initial patient exam by a resident physician, a subsequent conference between the resident and the attending physician, and the attending physician's visit with the patient. We create an analytical model of a tandem queue with finite buffer space to analyze the impact of different work prioritization policies on the throughput and the flow time of patients in the facility--measures that influence both the facility's finances and patients' satisfaction. We derive throughput-optimal policies and show that these policies involve dynamic batching. This finding is interesting because our model does not include any setup times, and setup times normally imply batching; rather it is the uncertain service times and the requirement for simultaneous service in the conference step that make batching optimal. The optimal dynamic batching policy is complex, so we consider a simpler static batching policy. We show that, in systems with limited buffer space, large batches can sometimes degrade efficiency by simultaneously increasing flow time and decreasing throughput. However, in general, both flow time and throughput increase with batch size. Flow time increases at a faster rate than throughput, so hospital management may want to consider what batch size is optimal given the value it places on the two measures.

Title: The Effect of Budgetary Restrictions on Breast Cancer Diagnostic Decisions
Abstract: We develop a finite-horizon discrete-time constrained Markov decision process (MDP) to model diagnostic decisions after mammography where we maximize the total expected quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) of a patient under resource constraints. We use clinical data to estimate the parameters of the MDP model and solve it as a mixed-integer program. By repeating optimization for a sequence of budget levels, we calculate incremental cost-effectiveness ratios attributable to consecutive levels of funding and compare actual clinical practice with optimal decisions. We prove that the optimal value function is concave in the allocated budget. Comparing to actual clinical practice, using optimal thresholds for decision making may result in approximately 22% cost savings without sacrificing QALYs. Our analysis indicates short-term follow-ups are the immediate target for elimination when budget becomes a concern. Policy change is more drastic in the older age group with the increasing budget, yet the gains in total expected QALYs related to larger budgets are predominantly seen in younger women along with modest gains for older women.

Title: Accumulating a Portfolio of Experience: The Effect of Focal and Related Experience on Surgeon Performance
Abstract: One key driver of improvement in surgical outcomes is a surgeon's prior experience. However, research notes that not all experience provides equal value for performance. How, then, should surgeons accumulate experience to improve quality outcomes? In this paper, we investigate the differential effects of focal and related (i.e., tasks similar to, but not identical to, the focal task) experience. We open up the black box of the volume-outcome relationship by going beyond just dividing experience into focal and related categories, but also considering how subtasks and context (i.e., the organization in which the work takes place) affect performance. To understand these issues, we assemble a novel data set on 71 cardiothoracic surgeons who performed more than 6,500 procedures during a period of 10 years after the introduction of a breakthrough surgical procedure. We find that, as compared to related experience, surgeon focal experience has a greater effect on surgeon performance. We also demonstrate that subtask experience has different, nonlinear performance relationships for focal and related experience. Finally, we find that focal experience is more firm specific than related experience and that nonfirm experience reduces the learning rate for both focal and related experience. We discuss implications of our findings for healthcare delivery and operations management.

Title: Information <i>Hang-overs</i> in Healthcare Service Systems
Abstract: The literature on business process design has focused on issues such as bottlenecks, workflow configuration (series versus parallel), replacing an existing workflow with a shorter one, etc. One important issue that has not received adequate attention is the information-intensive nature of medical service systems. Performance of clinical workflows depends not only on how various steps are carried out but also on when certain information items are collected. We report the results of a long-term empirical study that looked at the implementation of a radiology information system (RIS) at a large regional network of radiology clinics. We find that a failure to gather necessary clinical background information in earlier steps significantly delays later steps and causes them to <i>hang over</i>, with a significant impact on the total turnaround time of diagnostic reports. We show that information systems can solve this problem by separating the task of gathering information from its usage and relocating that task upstream in the workflow. We argue that such unbundling can lead to shorter report turnaround times even if it significantly increases the utilization of the bottleneck server. These results have broader implications for the optimal design of other clinical workflows, such as the process of filling prescriptions in pharmacies or the typical surgical preanesthesia evaluation in hospitals. Finally, we explain why the impact of addressing hang-over is often nonuniform across clinical modalities, providers, and patient types.

Title: Performance-Based Contracts for Outpatient Medical Services
Abstract: In recent years, the performance-based approach to contracting for medical services has been gaining popularity across different healthcare delivery systems, both in the United States (under the name of "pay for performance") and abroad ("payment by results" in the United Kingdom). The goal of our research is to build a unified performance-based contracting (PBC) framework that incorporates patient access-to-care requirements and that explicitly accounts for the complex outpatient care dynamics facilitated by the use of an online appointment scheduling system. We address the optimal contracting problem in a principal-agent framework where a service purchaser (the principal) minimizes her cost of purchasing the services and achieves the performance target (a waiting-time target) while taking into account the response of the provider (the agent) to the contract terms. Given the incentives offered by the contract, the provider maximizes his payoff by allocating his outpatient service capacity among three patient groups: urgent patients, dedicated advance patients, and flexible advance patients. We model the appointment dynamics as that of an <i>M/D/1</i> queue and analyze several contracting approaches under adverse selection (asymmetric information) and moral hazard (private actions) settings. Our results show that simple and popular schemes used in practice cannot implement the first-best solution and that the linear performance-based contract cannot implement the second-best solution. To overcome these limitations, we propose a threshold-penalty PBC approach and show that it coordinates the system for an arbitrary patient mix and that it achieves the second-best performance for the setting where all advance patients are dedicated.

Title: Appointment Scheduling Under Patient No-Shows and Service Interruptions
Abstract: We consider an appointment-based service system (e.g., an outpatient clinic) for which appointments need to be scheduled before the service session starts. Patients with scheduled appointments may or may not show up for their appointments. The service of scheduled patients can be interrupted by emergency requests that have a higher priority. We develop a framework that can be utilized in determining the optimal appointment policies under different assumptions regarding rewards, costs, and decision variables. We propose two methods to evaluate the objective function for a given appointment schedule. We specifically consider two different formulations, both of which aim to balance the trade-off between the patient waiting times and server utilization and carry out a numerical study to provide insights into optimal policies. We find that policies that ignore interruptions perform quite badly, especially when the number of appointments to be scheduled is also a decision variable. We also find that policies that require equally spaced appointments perform reasonably well when the interruption rate is constant. However, their performance worsens significantly when the interruption rate is time dependent.

Title: Fee-for-Service Contracts in Pharmaceutical Distribution Supply Chains: Design, Analysis, and Management
Abstract: Fee-for-service (FFS) contracts, first introduced in 2004, dramatically changed the way the pharmaceutical distribution supply chains are designed, managed, and operated. Investment buying (IB), forward buying in anticipation of drug price increases, used to be the way the distributors made most of their profits. FFS contracts limit the amount of inventory distributors can carry at any time (by imposing an inventory cap) and require inventory information sharing from the distributors to the manufacturers while compensating the distributors with a per-unit fee. In spite of its widespread popularity, the FFS model has never been rigorously analyzed or its effectiveness carefully tabulated. In this paper, we formulate the multiperiod stochastic inventory problems faced by the manufacturer and the distributor under the FFS and IB models, derive their optimal policies, and develop procedures to compute the policy parameters. We show that FFS contracts can improve the total supply chain profit--the manufacturer and distributor are now able to share a larger pie. Thus, there exists a range of the per-unit fees that leads to Pareto improvement. Simulation results show that such improvement is approximately 1.7% on average, and as much as 5.5%, and the improvement increases as the inventory cap decreases. Determining the Pareto-improving per-unit fees is a source of contention in FFS contract negotiation, and we propose a simple yet effective heuristic for computing them. Furthermore, supply chain transparency facilitated by the FFS contracts can significantly reduce the manufacturer's supply-demand mismatch costs (by approximately 3.63% on average and as much as 13.01%) and we show that the manufacturer should take advantage of this transparency especially when the inventory cap and drug price increase are high and demand variance is low. We believe that these results have the potential to improve the efficiency of pharmaceutical distribution supply chains, thus reducing the healthcare costs that are such a big burden on the U.S. economy.
