Title: The Relationship Between Abnormal Inventory Growth and Future Earnings for U.S. Public Retailers
Abstract: In this paper, we examine the relationship between inventory levels and one-year-ahead earnings of retailers using publicly available financial data. We use benchmarking metrics obtained from operations management literature to demonstrate an inverted-U relationship between abnormal inventory growth and one-year-ahead earnings per share for retailers. We also find that equity analysts do not fully incorporate the information contained in retailers' abnormal inventory growth in their earnings forecasts, resulting in systematic biases. Finally, we show that an investment strategy based on abnormal inventory growth yields significant abnormal stock market returns.

Title: Process Flexibility Design in Unbalanced Networks
Abstract: Several design guidelines and flexibility indices have been developed in the literature to inform the design of flexible production networks. In this paper, we propose additional flexibility design guidelines for unbalanced networks, where the numbers of plants and products are not equal, by refining the well-known Chaining Guidelines. We study symmetric networks, where all plants have the same capacity and product demands are independent and identically distributed, and focus mainly on the case where each product is built at two plants. We also briefly discuss cases where (1) each product is built at three plants and (2) some products are built at only one plant. An extensive computational study suggests that our refinements work very well for finding flexible configurations with minimum shortfall in unbalanced networks.

Title: Inventory Pooling to Deliver Differentiated Service
Abstract: Inventory pooling is at the root of many celebrated ideas in operations management. Postponement, component commonality, and resource flexibility are some examples. Motivated by our experience in the aftermarket services industry, we propose a model of inventory pooling to meet differentiated service levels for multiple customers. Our central research question is the following: What are the minimum inventory level and optimal allocation policy when a pool of inventory is used in a single period to satisfy individual service levels for multiple customers? We measure service by the probability of fulfilling a customer's entire demand immediately from stock. We characterize the optimal solution in several allocation policy classes; provide some structural results, formulas, and bounds; and also make detailed interpolicy comparisons. We show that the pooling benefit is always <i>strictly</i> positive, even when there are an arbitrary number of customers with perfectly positively correlated demands.

Title: Delegation vs. Control of Component Procurement Under Asymmetric Cost Information and Simple Contracts
Abstract: A manufacturer must choose whether to <i>delegate</i> component procurement to her tier 1 supplier or <i>control</i> it directly. Because of information asymmetry about suppliers' production costs and the use of simple quantity discount or price-only contracts, either delegation or control can yield substantially higher expected profit for the manufacturer. Delegation tends to outperform control when (1) the manufacturer is uncertain about the tier 1 supplier's cost and believes that it is likely to be high; (2) the manufacturer and the tier 1 supplier know the tier 2 supplier's cost or at least that it will be high; (3) the manufacturer has an alternative to engaging the tier 1 and tier 2 suppliers, such as in-house production; and (4) the firms use price-only contracts as opposed to quantity discount contracts. These results shed light on practices observed in the electronics industry.

Title: Advance Demand Information, Price Discrimination, and Preorder Strategies
Abstract: This paper studies the preorder strategy that a seller may use to sell a perishable product in an uncertain market with heterogeneous consumers. By accepting preorders, the seller is able to obtain advance demand information for inventory planning and price discriminate the consumers. Given the preorder option, the consumers react strategically by optimizing the timing of purchase. We find that accurate demand information may improve the availability of the product, which undermines the seller's ability to charge a high preorder price. As a result, advance demand information may hurt the seller's profit due to its negative impact for the preorder season. This cautions the seller about a potential conflict between the benefits of advance demand information and price discrimination when facing strategic consumers. A common practice to contain consumers' strategic waiting is to offer price guarantees that compensate preorder consumers in case of a later price cut. Under price guarantees, the seller will reduce price in the regular season only if the preorder demand is low; however, such advance information implies weak demand in the regular season as well. This means that the seller can no longer benefit from a high demand in the regular season. Therefore, under price guarantees, more accurate advance demand information may still hurt the seller's profit due to its adverse impact for the regular season. We also investigate the seller's strategy choice in such a setting (i.e., whether the preorder option should be offered and whether it should be coupled with price guarantees) and find that the answer depends on the relative sizes of the heterogeneous consumer segments.

Title: Forecasting Call Center Arrivals: Fixed-Effects, Mixed-Effects, and Bivariate Models
Abstract: We consider different statistical models for the call arrival process in telephone call centers. We evaluate the forecasting accuracy of those models by describing results from an empirical study analyzing real-life call center data. We test forecasting accuracy using different lead times, ranging from weeks to hours in advance, to mimic real-life challenges faced by call center managers. The models considered are (i) a benchmark fixed-effects model that does not exploit any dependence structures in the data; (ii) a mixed-effects model that takes into account both interday (day-to-day) and intraday (within-day) correlations; and (iii) two new bivariate mixed-effects models, for the joint distribution of the arrival counts to two separate queues, that exploit correlations between different call types. Our study shows the importance of accounting for different correlation structures in the data.

Title: Dynamic Pricing of Substitutable Products in the Presence of Capacity Flexibility
Abstract: Firms that offer multiple products are often susceptible to periods of inventory mismatches where one product may face shortages while the other has excess inventories. In this paper, we study a joint implementation of price- and capacity-based substitution mechanisms to alleviate the level of such inventory disparities. We consider a firm producing substitutable products via a capacity portfolio consisting of both product-dedicated and flexible resources and characterize the structure of the optimal production and pricing decisions. We then explore how changes in various problem parameters affect the optimal policy structure. We show that the availability of a flexible resource helps maintain stable price differences across products over time even though the price of each product may fluctuate over time. This result has favorable ramifications from a marketing standpoint because it suggests that even when a firm applies a dynamic pricing strategy, it may still establish consistent price positioning among multiple products if it can employ a flexible replenishment resource. We provide numerical examples for the price stabilization effect and discuss extensions of our results to a more general multiple product setting.

Title: Aligning Capacity Decisions in Supply Chains When Demand Forecasts Are Private Information: Theory and Experiment
Abstract: We study the problem of a two-firm supply chain in which firms simultaneously choose a capacity before demand is realized. We focus on the role that private information about demand has on firms' ability to align their capacity decisions. When forecasts are private information, there are at most two equilibria: a complete coordination failure or a monotone equilibrium. The former equilibrium always exists, whereas the latter exists only when the marginal cost of capacity is sufficiently low. We also show that both truthful information sharing and preplay communication have an equilibrium with higher profits. We then test the model's predictions experimentally. Contrary to our theoretical predictions, we show that private demand forecasts do not have a consistently negative effect on firm profits, though capacities are more misaligned. We show that preplay communication may be more effective at increasing profits than truthful information sharing. Finally, we document that "honesty is the best policy" when communicating private information.

Title: Strategic Queueing Behavior and Its Impact on System Performance in Service Systems with the Congestion-Based Staffing Policy
Abstract: We study strategic customer behavior in a multiserver stochastic service system with a congestion-based staffing (CBS) policy. With the CBS policy, the number of working servers is dynamically adjusted according to the queue length. Besides lining up for free service, customers have the option of paying a fee and getting faster service. Customers' equilibrium behavior is studied under two information scenarios: In the no information scenario, customers only know the long-term statistics, such as the expected waiting time; in the partial information scenario, customers observe the number of working servers and understand the staffing policy upon their arrival. Unlike a queueing system with a constant staffing level, a positive externality is associated with customers' joining the CBS system. Both avoid-the-crowd and follow-the-crowd customer behaviors are possible, and multiple equilibria could exist. We develop the stationary performance measures of the system by considering the customers' strategic behavior. Numerical analysis shows that information can either hurt or improve the performance of the system, depending on the staffing and pricing policy. Another important conclusion is that the system performance is more robust to setting a relatively high than a relatively low price.

Title: On the Equilibrium Behavior of a Supply Chain Market for Capacity
Abstract: Acapacity market is a business-to-business exchange in which equally capable suppliers compete with one another to satisfy generic orders from diverse buyers. The market is asymmetric because the buyers can carry inventory of the products ordered but the suppliers cannot store their capacity. In such a market, we might expect to see something like a price for capacity emerge to equilibrate demand and supply. The financial risk of participating in such a market will be driven by the volatility of the capacity price. In this paper we develop a model to explore the behavior of such a market and demonstrate, for example, that volatility of the price for capacity increases, to a point, when inflexibility of the capacity increases. We can also make statements about how the resolution of price uncertainty in the capacity market is related to the resolution of demand uncertainty faced by the buyers. Another contribution of the paper is to explain the role of market characteristics in how the market acts to minimize shortages caused by consumer demand uncertainty. We use continuous time stochastic optimal control techniques and numerical experiments to demonstrate these insights.

Title: Noncooperative Games for Subcontracting Operations
Abstract: Consider a set of manufacturers, all of which can subcontract part of their workload to a third party. For simplicity, we assume that every manufacturer as well as the third party each possess a single production facility. Each manufacturer has to decide the amount of workload to be subcontracted so as to minimize the completion time of his in-house and subcontracted workloads. In an effort to provide good service to all, the third party gives priority to manufacturers whose subcontracted workload is small. This incentive scheme forces manufacturers to compete for position in the third-party processing sequence. We develop pure Nash equilibria schedules under three distinct protocols for production.
