Title: Strategic Reliability and Preventive Maintenance
Abstract: Strategic reliability is defined as the product of availability, and the reliability over a fixed period of time <i>x</i> Preventive maintenance is performed after <i>T</i><sub><i>p</i></sub> hours of continuing operation without failure. We have to choose <i>T</i><sub><i>p</i></sub> so as to optimize, in case (i), the <i>availability</i>, and in case (ii), the <i>strategic reliability</i>. The exact solution for (i) was given by Morse and is briefly summarized. The exact solution for (ii) is derived. An approximate solution for (ii) is derived, and it is shown that the “optimum curve” commonly drawn for (i) may be used to solve (ii) approximately.

Title: A Study of Optimum Assembly Runs
Abstract: This paper reports on the formulation and application of a mathematical model of optimum assembly runs. The study was conducted in a large manufacturing firm and was concerned with the assembly and storage of expensive electronic equipments for use in commercial aircraft. The principle costs pertaining to this study involved the purchase of parts, internal parts fabrication, final assembly and inventories of raw materials, goods in process and finished goods. The most detailed consideration was given to assembly costs and these were derived directly from learmng curves which had been estimated from time-card records. Consideration was given to the effects on costs not only of varying the run size but also of varying the rate of assembly by altering the assembly time cycle. Thus the model includes as decision variables both the length of the run and the rate of assembly. It is formulated so that these decisions can be made simultaneously in a routine, clerical way. Finally, some remarks are made concerning the practical use of the model in the manufacturing operation.

Title: A Class of Stochastic Investment Problems
Abstract: A decision maker, faced with investment opportunities that occur throughout time, must, when confronted with a particular investment, decide whether to accept the investment. The problem of determining optimal decision rules under these conditions is formulated as a stochastic process that can be analyzed by the functional equation of dynamic programming. Some simple investment problems involving a decision maker with fixed assets are formulated and for a specific example, solved numerically. As an extension of these simple situations, a problem based on a business application of investing a stream of assets is solved and optimal decision rules are presented.

Title: Car-Following and Steady-State Theory for Noncongested Traffic
Abstract: Car-following and continuum theories have been shown by other investigators to describe a number of aspects of the complex phenomenon of vehicular traffic flow in both quantitative and qualitative terms. It is the purpose of this paper to suggest a variation in these theories in an effort to make them more accurate for traffic densities less than optimum. The theory as modified for noncongested traffic may help to describe quantitatively the sudden change of state occurring in a traffic stream going from a relatively free-flowing condition to a crawling stop-and-go condition and back again.

Title: Optimum Weapon Deployment for Nuclear Attack
Abstract: Presented herein are solutions for the optimum deployment of both offensive and defensive weapons for a nuclear missile or aircraft attack against point targets. These solutions make it possible to determine rapidly the optimum deployment for both offense and defense and to estimate the expected level of destruction. The equations give some insight as to the interrelations between such factors as surviving worth, target hardness, warhead yield, accuracy, and defensive and offensive vehicle inventories.

Title: The Distribution of Radial Error and its Statistical Application in War Gaming
Abstract: This paper presents a unified treatment of the assumptions and theorems concerning the distribution of radial error, and demonstrates its statistical application in war gaming. The density function and cumulative distribution function of the radial error are derived and graphed for one, two, and three dimensions. For each of these cases, formulas are given for the expectation, standard deviation, and median of the radial error. Tables of pertinent conversion factors are provided. Results are given for the distribution of detonation points in three dimensions that are useful in war games employing atomic rockets or torpedoes.

Abstract: Necessary and sufficient conditions for minima (maxima) of nonlinear functionals subjected to linear constraints are derived. Two classes of functionals are considered (<i>a</i>) convex (concave) functionals for which necessary and sufficient conditions for global minima (maxima) are obtained, and (<i>b</i>) more general functionals possessing continuous second derivatives for which necessary and sufficient conditions for local optima are obtained. In the first case the theorems presented here are special cases of the well-known Kuhn-Tucker theorems. Some simple examples are included.

Title: The Greatest of a Finite Set of Random Variables
Abstract: The variables (xi)<sub>1</sub>, ..., (xi)<sub><i>n</i></sub> have a joint normal distribution. We are concerned with the calculation or approximation of max((xi)<sub>1</sub>, ..., (xi)<sub><i>n</i></sub>). Current analyses and tables handle the case in which the (xi)<sub><i>ı</i></sub> are independently distributed with common expected values and common variances. This paper presents formulas and tables for the most general case with <i>n</i> = 2. When <i>n</i> > 2, the problem becomes cumbersome. This paper presents formulas and tables that permit approximations to the moments in case <i>n</i> > 2. The moments are approximated by iteration of a three-parameter computation or, alternatively, through successive use of a three-parameter table, which is given. Recent applications of the theory are described.

Title: Allocating for Acceptable Risk Instead of Expected Value
Abstract: Allocation of inventory, spares, or redundancy in reliable systems often seeks to maximize expected orders filled or hours until failure (assuming known distributions). Often there is no opportunity for an averaging process to permit this expectation to materialize. Each operation of the system may be critical, instead of the average of many, or the first shortage may terminate the whole operation. Predictable adequacy of each operation is attained by considering the full distribution, e.g., of operating hours before failure, instead of just the mean (expected) value. Distributions with small standard deviations permit more precise prediction of probable time before failure (shortage). Plans based on marginal utility concepts tend to avoid the expected-value trap but do not necessarily minimize the appropriate risk of shortage. Operating characteristic curves, like those used in quality control, allow intelligent consideration of the risks involved in choosing among alternate allocation plans. Allocation of a small number of stock items is used to illustrate the criterion.

Title: The Created Response Surface Technique for Optimizing Nonlinear, Restrained Systems
Abstract: A different approach to the general problem of optimization of nonlinear, restrained systems is presented. This approach, called the <i>Created Response Surface Technique</i>, is based, essentially, on steepest ascents up a succession of created response surfaces within the solution space. The most important characteristic of the approach is that it automatically avoids restraint boundary violations during the optimization. This article discusses application to fully developed steady-state mathematical models. By the use of appropriate experimental designs, the method could be used for the characterization and optimization of mathematically incomplete, nonlinear, restrained systems. In addition, it seems possible that the Created Response Surface concept could be applied to attain dynamic process control in certain nonlinear, restrained control situations. However, the mathematical implications of the new approach must be studied further.

Title: Full-Service Probability for Regular Arrangements
Abstract: A regular arrangement is a multiple correspondence between a set of elements supplying a service, called stations, and a set of elements requiring service, called installations. There are <i>n</i> installations and 2<i>n</i> stations. The regular arrangement is such that stations <i>a</i><sub><i>j</i></sub> and <i>a</i><sub><i>n</i>+<i>j</i></sub> are able to supply service to installations <i>b</i><sub><i>j</i></sub> and <i>b</i><sub><i>j</i>+1</sub>. Each station therefore can service either of two installations and each installation is associated with four stations. It is supposed that after this arrangement has been made a random event removes some stations. The remaining stations are used in the best possible way to supply service to the installations, a station being able to serve only one of its associated installations. The present paper obtains the probability that after the random event it is possible for all installations to receive service.

Title: Reliability Analysis of a One-Unit System
Abstract: This paper considers an electronic system that upon failure is repaired Only two states---the “on” state and the “off” state---are distinguished. The time-to-failure and the time-to-repair are random variables with general distribution functions. The purpose of the paper is to make available, in single unified treatment, mathematical information that is relevant for a reliability analysis of a one-unit system. The following questions are answered (<i>a</i>) What is the probability that the system will be on at any given time <i>t</i>? (<i>b</i>) What is the probability that it will be on <i>t</i> hours or more during a given time interval (0, <i>T</i>)? (<i>c</i>) What is the expected fractional amount of time that it will be on during (0, <i>T</i>)? (<i>d</i>) What is the probability distribution of the number of failures during a given time interval? (<i>e</i>) What is the expected number of failures during a given time interval?. In particular, it is noted that “down” time is approximately normally distributed for large time intervals. The special cases of exponential failure with exponential and constant repair are given as examples.

Title: Nonlinear Effects in the Dynamics of Car Following
Abstract: It is assumed that the velocity of a car at time t is some (nonlinear) function of the spacial headway at time <i>t</i> - (Delta), so the equations of motion for a sequence of cars consists of a set of differential-difference equations. There is a special family of velocity-headway relations that agrees well with experimental data for steady flow, and that also gives differential equations which for (Delta) = 0 can be solved explicitly. Some exact solutions of these equations show that a small amplitude disturbance propagates through a series of cars in the manner described by linear theories except that the dependence of the wave velocity on the car velocity causes an accleration wave to spread as it propagates and a deceleration wave to form a stable shock. These conclusions are then shown to hold for quite general types of velocity-headway relations, and to yield a theory that in certain limiting cases gives all the results of the linear car-following theories and in other cases all the features of the nonlinear continuum theories, plus a detailed picture of the shock structure.

(<i>b</i>) It yields a number of alternative programs that demonstrate the possible compromises between conflicting objectives of national planning Only “efficient” compromises are given. Thus, the decision-maker is furnished with the best possible basis for selection of a final compromise. (<i>c</i>) In selecting projects at a given point of time, it takes account of future opportunities for resource allocation.

Abstract: Military operations research in its early years is contrasted with a description of its present status. Changes in the types of problems attacked, the availability of data, tested techniques, and supporting theory are described as influencing the impact of military operations research on policy. Increasing emphasis on operational gaming is seen both as an expression of inadequacy in dealing with contemporary problems and as a reflection of the promise offered by this technique for an improved military operations-research capability.

Title: Military Operations Research---A Personal Retrospect
Abstract: Several instances, drawn from personal experiences since 1945, are presented in which military operations research has had an impact on national policy decisions. An attempt is made to identify instances of failure to influence higher authority, as well as admitted successes. Failures to transmit past experience are noted, with resultant need for rediscovery of results and tactics. The predominant point of view is that of the “scientific analyst,” working as liason with operational staffs, as opposed to that of the worker in large OR teams. Admittedly, these latter provided the analyst with his working capital, but the personal relation between analyst and operational commander is frequently decisive for the acceptance of the work of the larger group.

Title: Selecting Weapons Systems 1960---The Builder's-Eye View
Abstract: Caught by converging budgetary and technical constraints, weapons systems builders have discovered they cannot afford to pursue so many of the technically attractive potential new systems. They must ascertain which of these potential new systems will, in fact, evolve into operational systems. To do this, they have espoused operations-research methods and set about trying to select the potential systems which will meet three key conditions, that is systems which will answer a valid mission requirement and be economically and technically feasible, all in the future operational frame of reference. From experience gained in this selection process so far, the builders find that operations research needs to develop in certain directions if it is to meet their requirements. Looking ahead from this standpoint, it appears that the representative product of operations research increasingly may be the “white paper” on a broad issue, the general description of a broad problem such as ground warfare, the analysis of a broad concept or objective such as deterrence Interpretation will be emphasized at the expense of technical razzle dazzle. Significant negative findings will be disclosed more conscientiously.

Title: Critical-Path Planning and Scheduling: Mathematical Basis
Abstract: This paper is concerned with establishing the mathematical basis of the Critical-Path Method---a new tool for planning, scheduling, and coordinating complex engineering-type projects. The essential ingredient of the technique is a mathematical model that incorporates sequence information, durations, and costs for each component of the project. It is a special parametric linear program that, via the primal-dual algorithm, may be solved efficiently by network flow methods. Analysis of the solutions of the model enables operating personnel to answer questions concerning labor needs, budget requirements, procurement and design limitations, the effects of delays, and communication difficulties.

Title: Queuing with Multiple Poisson Inputs and Exponential Service Times
Abstract: This paper contains an analysis of a single-server queuing system for <i>m</i> different types of customers having independent Poisson arrivals with rates (lambda)<sub><i>ı</i></sub>, <i>ı</i> = 1, ..., <i>m</i> and exponential service times with rates (mu)<sub><i>ı</i></sub>, <i>ı</i> = 1, ..., <i>m</i>. The discipline is first-come, first-served. Some derived results are (a) a recursion relation for the steady-state probability of <i>n</i> in queue, (b) a recursion relation for the steady-state probability that some member of a particular class is in service and that <i>n</i> of any class are in queue, and (c) the characteristic equation for the waiting-time distribution and its general inversion for the two-population case. The recursion relations are simple for computational purposes.

Title: Activity Subdivision and PERT Probability Statements
Abstract: The Program Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT) has been developed and implemented as a technique for planning and evaluating the progress of research and development programs. Probability theory is used in PERT to calculate a measure of the uncertainty in meeting scheduled dates. These computed probabilities can then be used by managers to aid their judgment in evaluating the validity of schedules for accomplishing program objectives. This paper investigates the effect of subdividing activities in PERT flow diagrams on computed probabilities for meeting scheduled dates. It is shown that the mechanics of activity subdivision can increase or decrease the computed probabilities, depending upon whether the scheduled date for an event is later or earlier in time than the expected date. Management personnel who are using PERT probabilities to aid their judgment in evaluating schedules should be aware of the potential biases inherent in the computation of probabilities.

Title: Probability Functions for Waiting Times in Single-Channel Queues, with Emphasis on Simple Approximations
Abstract: One approach to the waiting-time problem is through the integral equation, whose solution is the cumulative probability function---the method derived by Lindley. The equation is of the type for which a general solution was developed by Wiener and Hopf, and an adaptation of their method is presented in this paper. A quite wide range of arrival and service-time distributions can be accommodated, and approximations for the tail of the density curve are readily found. This is a convenient property, because the useful information about waiting times is fully provided by the mean value and the tail of the curve. The approximation process occurs within the solution, giving a reduction in the total mathematical labor compared with the forming of an approximation from an exact final formula.

Title: Dispersal, Deterrence, and Damage
Abstract: Dispersal of alert bombers to large-city airfields has been proposed as a way of improving deterrence by increasing the targets that an enemy first strike would have to destroy, without the cost of constructing new bases. It does, however, make urgent targets out of population centers that might otherwise not be attacked. The improvement in deterrence has to be weighted against the greater damage the enemy would be required to inflict in the event he otherwise could not afford, or would not choose, to hit cities. This choice cannot be made without giving quantitative weights to alternative outcomes of war, and evaluating alternative probabilities of successful deterrence. The underlying strategic issue is whether general war, if it occurs, necessarily has to be unlimited, indiscriminate, and exhaustive.

Title: An Inclusive Solution to the Inventory Problem
Abstract: This paper gives a unified approach to a set of inventory problems subsumed under the classical inventory problem proposed by Arrow, Harris, and Marschak. This set includes those problems with periodic reordering, proportional costs and revenues, fixed time lags in receipt of an order, and a static criterion of optimality. Within this class shortages may be either back ordered or forgotten, the time lag can be any fixed integral number of periods, including zero, and demands in the various periods may follow any known joint distribution. The method yields a solution for the forgotten shortages case with time lag, as well as the familiar results for the instantaneous case and the back-order lag case. The approach can be modified to allow for a setup cost in purchasing.

It is shown that, if the three means are finite and the corresponding stochastic processes strictly stationary, and, if the arrival process is metrically transitive with nonzero mean, then <i>L</i> = (lambda)<i>W</i>.

Title: Application of Dynamic Programming to Countercurrent Flow Processes
Abstract: This paper shows how the methods of dynamic programming may be applied to the problem of optimal design and operation of countercurrent flow processes. The physical relations involved are summarized by a set of transformations describing the technology of the process. The dynamic programming recursive maximum return functions are then used to generate a set of optimal technologies. The stages above and below the feed stage are treated as independent dynamic programming problems that are then coupled through the feed stage technology. The optimal design of a complex of chemical plants is used as an illustrative example.

Title: Empirical Design of Priority Waiting Times for Jobbing Shop Control
Abstract: In many jobbing shops there exist a number of methods of increasing the capacity of machine groups. The extent of the capacity change required depends on the effect that such a change will have on the time jobs take to pass through the shop, in much the same way that the allocation of priorities both determines and is determined by the resulting waiting times. A case is put for the need to integrate these two aspects of control, and the results given of a simplified example of such control on waiting times in a single server, pre-emptive priority queue, obtained by manual sampling methods.

Title: Production Smoothing and Inventory Control
Abstract: Let production of a product be continuous and subject to the following costs the direct cost of production is proportional to the rate of output, the cost of changing the rate is proportional to the size of the change, with (possibly) different coefficients for upward and downward shifts, the cost of storage is proportional to the stock level, and there is a proportional penalty for backlogs. No orders are lost demands for the product arise at random intervals and the number of units demanded is a random variable with known distribution. The problem is to find the optimal policy of adjusting the rate of production to stock. It is shown that there exists a zone of control depending on the stock level such that no adjustment is made as long as the rate of production falls inside this zone and the rate is brought to its nearest endpoint when it has fallen outside the zone. A discrete version of this problem has been programmed on the IBM 650 Results of some computations are presented.

Title: Optimizing Systems When Components Have Discontinuous Cost Functions
Abstract: A special type of problem can be solved by linear programming even though some of the cost functions are discontinuous at zero due to fixed charges. A group of systems is represented on a flow chart, a network of directed links. Any single path through the network represents a complete system. The minimum-cost single path is the desired solution. Associated with each link are certain machines and known operating costs which apply if that link is in the system. A certain machine may be specified in several links, and a given system may use such a “multiple-use” machine once, several times, or not at all. This fact prohibits the use of a link cost that is constant regardless of the rest of the system. The types of restriction equations are limited, and the simplex algorithm normally yields a solution of the form <i>x<sub>ı</sub></i> = 0 or 1. The use of integer-solution methods allows further restrictions to be added Problems of determining optimum production levels and the materials handling system for this production can be solved.

Title: Stability of Following in Two Dimensions
Abstract: The mechanism by which objects follow each other on a two-dimensional surface is considered, with the movement of a convoy of ships in mind as a physical example. This is to be compared with single-lane traffic dynamics, which is essentially a one-dimensional following theory applied to cars on a straight highway. At first the assumed laws of following are linear in the position and velocity vectors of the ships, and the form of relation used is one suggested partly by previous work on traffic dynamics and partly from the theory of guided missiles. As a measure of imperfections in speed control and steering, various types of time constants are introduced and the resulting equations tested for stability, yielding criteria for the maximum permissible size of the time constants. Nonlinear control equations are also investigated, and by making linear approximations to the trajectories in these cases, stability criteria are again suggested. Finally a few computed trajectories have been obtained, including an interesting example where the following ship suddenly reverses its direction of motion in course.

Title: Decision on Retention of Excess Stock
Abstract: Simpson derived a formula for making decisions on the retention of excess stock having a constant probability of obsolescence and deterioration. The general problem of determining an economic retention period for excess stocks, when the shelf-life of the material follows some general probability distribution, is considered in this paper. A particular case in which the shelf-life follows the exponential distribution is derived. It is indicated that the relevant equation can be solved by a trial-and-error method even for the most general case with the help of truncated distribution of shelf-life.

Title: Design Criteria for Pellet-Dispersing Warheads
Abstract: A warhead is presumed to be so designed as to provide a radial dispersion of small pellets without significantly altering their collective forward motion. Thus, at the moment of target interception, the pellets are taken as randomly distributed over either a circular or an elliptical lamina, and those distributions that lead to optimum target-kill probabilities are derived. Design criteria are noted that tend to yield the largest over-all kill probability. Target and lamina size, individual pellet mass, over-all mass, kill probability of a single pellet that hits the target, and the random errors of predicting target position and of placing the pellet array at that position are all taken into account. An assessment is made of the basic proposition that the kill probability of every pellet striking the target is the same, independent of the number of previous hits, thereby some “limits of applicability” are established for the present study. In conclusion, an adaptation of the mathematical results to a shotgun-bird system is presented.

Title: Pellet-Effectiveness Analysis
Abstract: This paper presents an analysis of a simple but interesting random collision process. The problem involves the effectiveness of pellets against target objects. Appropriate probability density functions are derived from the physical conditions and are used to discuss various properties of the random collision process and the effectiveness of the pellets. No new statistical techniques are provided in the paper and it is perhaps noteworthy that such simple, well-known methods can be employed to investigate so many aspects of an interesting problem.

Title: Analytical Methods for Determination of Training-Device Requirements
Abstract: Training devices must be conceived of some time after the conceptualization of the systems they simulate. They must be delivered earlier than the systems they simulate. They compete for development funds with the system itself and with one another. There is thus a need for a logical analytical tool, which can operate upon the guesses and assumptions that, early in system development, are all that are available, in order to generate training-device needs, priorities, values, and specifications. This paper describes the development of such a logical tool. The process developed has been used to develop training device requirements for a large number of varied military systems. Though its results are sensitive to the assumptions with which it is entered, the method does provide a clearer statement of the training devices that will be needed than other methods appear to do.

Title: Nonlinear Follow-the-Leader Models of Traffic Flow
Abstract: A variety of nonlinear follow-the-leader models of traffic flow are discussed in the light of available observational and experimental data. Emphasis is placed on steady-state flow equations. Some trends regarding the advantages of certain follow-the-leader functionals over others are established. However, it is found from extensive correlation studies that more data are needed before one can establish the unequivocal superiority of one particular model. A discussion is given of some ideas concerning the possible reasons for the existence of a bimodal flow versus concentration curve especially for multilane highways.

Title: Letter to the Editor---An Application of the Assignment Problem
Abstract: The famous physician who discovered a cure for which there was no known disease has his parallel in many OR discoveries of solutions for which there is no known problem. Outstanding among these is the assignment problem. Mathematically, the assignment model can be represented as a linear-programming model in which each coefficient in every constraint equation is zero or unity. It provides a particularly attractive introduction for students to linear programming because the model is so simple, and because the Hungarian method (Flood, Merrill M. 1956. The traveling-salesman problem. <i>Opns Res.</i> <b>4</b> 61--72.) provides such elegant solutions.

Title: Importance Sampling in Monte Carlo Analyses
Abstract: Some Monte Carlo analyses require hundreds of hours of high speed computer time. Many problems of current interest can not be handled because the computer time required would be too great. Statistical sampling procedures have been developed that greatly reduce the required computer time. Importance sampling is one of these. This paper is an elementary description of importance sampling as used in Monte Carlo analyses.

Title: Multiple Triggers and Lot Sizes
Abstract: This paper gives a way of handling the inventory decisions as to when to make more (trigger point) and how much to make (lot size) of products that are stocked in more than one location. Many factory warehouse systems consist of a factory, a central warehouse, and regional warehouses. Triggering a production run of a joint lot depends on the inventory situation at each warehouse. Models are developed for the joint triggering, and joint lot size and its distribution, numerical examples and graphs are given for the trigger, along with references for the numerical methods. The models in the paper are for a simplified system, and references are given for extension of the theory.

Title: Operating Characteristics of a Simple Production, Inventory-Control Model
Abstract: Queuing theory is adapted to study the coordination of a continuous-level production rate with a base-stock level inventory policy, where the latter is depleted by a particular random demand process. Figures of merit for the combined production, inventory system (such as stock-out probability and expected demand delay, average inventory level, and production idleness probability) are given in terms of demand parameters, production rate, and maximum stock level. Costs are discussed, and a criteria is given for deciding when the stocking of inventory is economically desirable. Improvements in the model are proposed.

Title: Driver Response to the Amber Phase of Traffic Signals
Abstract: Observations of motorist response to the amber phase of traffic signals obtained at five intersections, representing three speed zones, are presented. The data from these observations give an estimate of the probability of stopping for vehicles as a function of their distance from the intersection at the onset of the amber phase of the traffic signal. The results lend no support to a popular hypothesis, i.e., that drivers tend to “take advantage” of a long amber phase by treating it as an extension of the green. The results of the study are compared with other investigations pertaining to amber phase lengths and implications of this work for the design of amber phases is discussed.

Title: On a Problem of Preemptive Priority Queuing
Abstract: A priority queuing system is considered possessing the following properties. There exist two populations of potential customers. One population of regular customers is infinitely large and its arrival characteristics are well-represented by a Poisson stream of constant intensity. The other population consists of a relatively small number of extraordinary customers. The arrival of each of these extraordinary customers is governed by an individual constant Poisson intensity. Service is given at a single station and regular customers on service are preempted by any arriving extraordinary customer. The expected value, the variance, etc., of the queue of ordinary customers is derived. Various relations given by previous authors are shown to represent special cases of the model discussed in this paper.

Title: The Fundamental Theorem of Exponential Smoothing
Abstract: Exponential smoothing is a formalization of the familiar learning process, which is a practical basis for statistical forecasting. Higher orders of smoothing are defined by the operator <i>S<sup>n</sup><sub>t</sub></i>(<i>x</i>) = (alpha)<i>S</i><sup><i>n</i>-1</sup><sub><i>t</i></sub>(<i>x</i>) + (1 - (alpha)) <i>S</i><sup><i>n</i></sup><sub><i>t</i>-1</sub>(<i>x</i>), where <i>S</i><sup>0</sup><sub><i>t</i></sub>(<i>x</i>) = <i>x<sub>t</sub></i>, 0 < (alpha) < 1. If one assumes that the time series of observations {<i>x<sub>t</sub></i>} is of the form <i>x<sub>t</sub></i> = <i>n<sub>t</sub></i> + (sum)<sup><i>ı</i>=<i>N</i></sup><sub><i>ı</i>=0</sub> <i>a<sub>ı</sub>t<sup>ı</sup></i> where <i>n<sub>t</sub></i> is a sample from some error population, then least squares estimates of the coefficients a, can be obtained from linear combinations of the operators <i>S</i>, <i>S</i><sup>2</sup>, ..., <i>S</i><sup><i>N</i>+1</sup>. Explicit forms of the forecasting equations are given for <i>N</i> = 0, 1, and 2. This result makes it practical to use higher order polynomials as forecasting models, since the smoothing computations are very simple, and only a minimum of historical statistics need be retained in the file from one forecast to the next.

Title: Cost Functions for Systems with Spare Components
Abstract: Cost functions for determining the optimum number of spare elements to be assigned to systems of identical components under a certain replacement scheme are investigated. The properties of one cost function are studied for component life as an exponentially distributed random variable, and tables are presented of the number of spare components that minimize the function for specified cost ratios. The problem of the optimum number of spares is also considered for systems in which unfailed components may be salvaged for use with later systems.

Title: Some Problems in the Theory of Intra-Urban Location
Abstract: A scientific understanding of urban-metropolitan structure and function is becoming increasingly important for metropolitan planning decisions and for governmental policy development, especially in the field of transportation. There is a strong coincidence between the needs of policy makers for adequate information about the implications of alternatives, and the interest of scientists in explaining the development of cities. Theories of urban form and intra-urban location are examined in some detail. It is concluded that existing theories of urban form are largely descriptive and taxonomic, while existing theories of locational behavior may be inadequate to deal with the inflexibilities and nonlinearities that arise in the urban framework. An adequate explanation and theory of metropolitan growth and structure depends on the accumulation of considerably more knowledge as to the behavior of locational decision makers, and the ways in which metropolitan policy impinges on their decisions. Some of the problems of this analysis are explored. Different types of models applicable to the urban system are considered and the particular model under development at the Penn Jersey. Transportation Study is sketched in relation to criteria developed. The implementation of models of the type discussed is related to questions of data collection, computer technology, mathematical formulation, and other operations-research concepts.

Title: The Future of Arms Control
Abstract: Arms control is based on the recognition that military preparations, and even war itself, are nonzero-sum-game activities, with scope for mutually advantageous accommodation even among potential enemies. It is an extension of traditional strategy in the direction of collaboration with potential enemies in the interest of reducing the likelihood of war, the limitation of war if it occurs, or the costs and risks of preparation for war. But the nature of this relation to potential enemies is still only dimly understood, even the character of the arms control that may be the most promising is hard to predict. It is not even clear that, by some measures, the level of armament is necessarily reduced. Although we have had a great deal of passive arms control, we are in a very exploratory stage with respect to explicit military alliances and understandings with potential enemies. It seems almost certain that the kind of strategic analysis that is needed to arrive at good military policy would also be needed to arrive at good arms-control policy.

Title: Preemptive Resume Priority Queue
Abstract: The queue length probability generating function for a preemptive resume priority queue characterized by Poisson arrivals and general service time distributions has been obtained by using the “supplemetary vanable method”. The preempted item follows the “resume” rule so that upon re-entry the service on the nonpriority unit is started at the point where it was interrupted when preemption occurred. Apart from the steady-state solution, the Laplace transform of the time dependent probability generating function and the length of busy periods has also been obtained.

Title: Letter to the Editor---The Use of Abstract Manned Simulation to Aid Weapon Planners
Abstract: Modern weapon systems are a complex amalgam of the end item hardware, the support ground operational and support equipment, spare parts, trained operational and logistical personnel, and a set of operational goals with a management system designed to help attain them. Given a choice of a hardware system to be developed into a weapon system, the weapon system's planners are left with an enormous number of choices between competing alternatives before that hardware system is developed into an operational weapon system. This decision-making process may involve several hundred “milestones,” many opinions, more than six years, and several billion dollars.

Title: Letter to the Editor---A Note on “Statistical Equilibrium”
Abstract: In most expositions of steady-state queuing theory in which the system can be represented as a Markov process, the condition of “statistical equilibrium” is introduced into the mathematical model for the queue by assuming that the mean transition rate into any given state is equal to the mean transition rate out of that state. The authors have found a slightly different approach that offers deeper insight into the relation between the queue and its model, and sometimes a reduction in the amount of algebraic manipulation required to find the distribution of queue lengths.

Title: Double Queues and Impatient Customers with an Application to Inventory Theory
Abstract: This paper starts by observing that any queuing system can be viewed as two symmetric queues, one of customers in line for service, and one of idle clerks, awaiting customers. Usually at least one of the queues (the idle clerks) has a finite limit, but examples, such as passengers and taxis at a taxi stand, exist where both queues are unlimited. In such cases, if arrival and service rates are independent of queue length, at least one of the queues is unstable and grows indefinitely as time passes. In practice there has to be some factor that limits queue length, and a possible mechanism is to assume that both passengers and taxis become impatient and will leave if, after some fixed amount of time, they have not been “serviced.” The equations governing such a system are developed and steady-state solutions are found. It is shown that steady-state solutions always exist for both queues, the means and variances (which are finite) are given. In the last part of the paper an application to inventory theory is suggested. Here the backlog of orders corresponds to the queue of customers, and items in stock to the idle clerks. It is assumed that orders not filled in a certain time are cancelled and that items are perishable and cannot be sold if stocked too long.

Title: Inclusion of Detection in Probability of Survival Models
Abstract: The chance for survival in aerial or vehicle-to-vehicle space combat, particularly with guided missiles, would seem to depend in large measure upon the relative ability to detect. But there seems to be few published quantitative studies of how the chance of survival varies with ability to detect. Therefore, this note develops simple models for estimating survival that include the detection distributions of the combatants. Simplifying assumptions are suggested that are realistic and mathematically reasonable, and it is indicated how “answers” can be computed in a variety of cases.

Title: A Traffic Counting Distribution
Abstract: A traffic counting distribution is derived in which a minimum spacing or headway between units of traffic is taken into account. A comparison is made between this probability distribution and the Type I Counter distribution derived by W. Feller. Explicit expressions are derived for the mean and variance of count as well as the probability that the interval of interest is completely filled by vehicles.

Title: Bargaining Strategy in a Production and Distribution Problem
Abstract: An attempt is made to select a bargaining strategy for a multiplant, multi-product, manufacturing company, engaged in negotiations with two of its distributors. The basis for negotiations is the company's <i>net profit equivalent</i>, and the distributors' net profit. Net profit is excess of income over expenditure. Net profit equivalent is net sales minus variable cost, statistically determined from 52-month data, treating output of the two component groups of products as the independent variable, and their cost, the dependent variable. The company's decision to manufacture in three, instead of four, plants affects the three types of revenue earned by the distributors. How should the company act vis-à-vis its distributors? The company may enter into coalitions with the customers of the distributors, and bid to supplant the distributors. It may negotiate with other manufacturing companies to supply the distributor customers, thus saving warehousing costs. So can the customers collude among themselves, with other manufacturing companies, etc. These coalitions, simultaneously entered into by the same players, who band together for and against the same party at the same time, in order to achieve joint-profit maximization in a nonzero-sum game, are defined for the first time in this paper as <i>concomitant coalitions</i>. The influence of the power to “bind” of the weaker players, who improve their gains by “some voluntary, but irreversible freedom of choice” is examined in the imputations. The dominant strategies are identified by inspection, and the corresponding outcome for the different players worked out has intutive appeal. Accepted by the company management as pertinent to long-term implementation, this analysis demonstrated how an otherwise loss situation could be successfully turned into one of significant profit.

Title: Comments on the Highway-Crossing Problem
Abstract: A discussion is given of the gap acceptance problem confronting a driver at a stop sign who is attempting to cross a single lane of traffic. This problem is discussed in the light of a gap acceptance probability that is taken in the form (alpha)(<i>t</i>) = 0 when <i>t</i> < <i>T</i> and 1 - (alpha)(<i>t</i>) = exp[-(lambda)(<i>t</i> - <i>T</i>)] when <i>t</i> > <i>T</i>, rather than a step function as has been considered in the past. Some experimental information is discussed concerning the values of the parameters (lambda) and <i>T</i> in such situations. This information coupled with theoretical considerations allows one to estimate quantities such as mean delay time, probability of zero delay, and highway transparency. Comments are made concerning the influence of car performance on road crossing and on entering highways.

Title: A Linear Programming Approach to the Cutting-Stock Problem
Abstract: The cutting-stock problem is the problem of filling an order at minimum cost for specified numbers of lengths of material to be cut from given stock lengths of given cost. When expressed as an integer programming problem the large number of variables involved generally makes computation infeasible. This same difficulty persists when only an approximate solution is being sought by linear programming. In this paper, a technique is described for overcoming the difficulty in the linear programming formulation of the problem. The technique enables one to compute always with a matrix which has no more columns than it has rows.

Title: The Distribution of Urban Population and an Application to a Servicing Problem
Abstract: The growth of the urban component of a nation and the shift in population from rural to urban areas in the course of industrial development are processes that show both regularity and predictability. Consequently, it is possible to describe the concentration of population in terms of population density and area by comparatively simple expressions. In this paper expressions are examined for the distribution of people within cities, for the distribution of city sizes within the United States, and for the total population contained within boundaries described in various ways. These generalizations have many applications, both in industrial planning and in civil defense and other military considerations. The paper shows how it is possible to make approximate estimates of the total population serviced by operations of specified types as a function of the cost structure of the operation.

Title: Priority Assignment in Waiting-Line Problems Under Conditions of Misclassification
Abstract: This article deals with priority assignment in waiting-line problems in case the classification on which the priorities are based is subject to errors. The expected waiting time under this condition is derived for a two-priority single-channel system. The procedure recommended involves the introduction of a “mixed” group for those customers who cannot be classified with certainty in group 1 or group 2, and to allocate such a customer to this group when the probability that he really belongs to group 1 lies in a certain interval, the limits of which are determined by the basic data of the waiting-line problem (mean service times, arrival rates, etc).

Title: The Face of Bargaining
Abstract: The nature of a bargaining situation is discussed. Two general propositions about the conditions affecting the likelihood of a bargaining agreement are presented. The effects of the availability of threat and of permissive and compulsory communication upon interpersonal bargaining are investigated experimentally in a two-person bargaining game. The major findings are (1) Under conditions of bilateral (i.e., available to both players) threat, players have most difficulty in reaching agreements, unilateral (available to one player) threat produces somewhat less difficulty, however, only under conditions of no threat are subjects able to maximize their payoffs. (2) Under conditions of permissive communication, subjects' performance does not differ from that found when the opportunity to communicate is not present. (3) Under conditions of compulsory communication, an improvement in performance is noted in the unilateral threat condition only. These findings are discussed with respect to the balance of cooperative and competitive motivational forces present and the player's need to maintain “face” in interpersonal encounters.

Title: Letter to the Editor---Some Properties of a Disguised Poisson Function
Abstract: There have been a number of papers on closed queues in which the solution has been stated in the form of formulas for the probabilities of each state in terms of one particular state probability. However, the measures of effectiveness proposed are usually linear functions of the state probabilities and it is often possible to compute these more efficiently without calculating the individual state probabilities explicitly.

Title: Letter to the Editor---A Criterion for Realism in War Games
Abstract: The author has been in the business of constructing rules for war games (i.e., games with human players) for some years. The search for “realism” has been arduous and always frustrating. Since the author must usually adopt a pragmatic attitude towards this elusive property and make do with whatever is at hand, the search for truly general criteria for realism has been sometimes desperate. Over the last several years one such criterion has slowly emerged. It is only a <i>necessary</i> condition, not a sufficient one. Therefore it is only a weak criterion for realism, but appears to be a strong test for a lack of realism. Special purpose games can probably be imagined for which the theorem does not apply.
