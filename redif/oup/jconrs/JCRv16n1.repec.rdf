Title: 
 The Effects of Background Music in Advertising: A Reassessment.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 113-18
Issue: 1
Volume: 16
Year: 1989
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 Gorn's pioneering article on the effects of background music in
 advertising has spurred a significant controversy and inspired vigorous
 interest in the topic. Following the recommendation Allen and Madden
 (1985), we conducted three experiments that attempted to replicate Gorn's
 results. Contrary to Gorn's findings, there was no evidence that product
 preferences can be conditioned through a single exposure to appealing or
 unappealing music.

Title: 
 Some Exploratory Findings on the Development of Musical Tastes.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 119-24
Issue: 1
Volume: 16
Year: 1989
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 Preferences toward popular music appear to reflect tastes acquired during
 late adolescence or early adulthood. In an empirical investigation of this
 parsimonious inductive proposition, both the aggregate results (R = 0.84)
 and the disaggregated findings (R = 0.46) suggest that the development of
 tastes for popular music follows an inverted U-shaped pattern that reaches
 a peak in about the 24th year. Possible explanations include intrinsic
 components (e.g., a developmental period of maximum sensitivity analogous
 to the critical periods documented in ethological studies of imprinting)
 and extrinsic components (e.g., social pressures from one's peer group
 that reach peak intensity during a particular phase in one's life cycle.)

Title: 
 Utility and Choice: An Empirical Study of Wife/Husband Decision Makin g.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 87-97
Issue: 1
Volume: 16
Year: 1989
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 Results of an experiment manipulating the effects of cognitive conflict,
 role dominance, and persuasive messages on husband-wife decisions show
 that couples tend to choose options that are equitable and centered in
 their negotiation set, a tendency that is prevalent over choice occasions
 and bargaining conditions. Two mechanisms that support equity--static
 cooperation and dynamic shifts in individual utility function--are
 interpreted in light of these findings and those of other researchers.

Title: 
 Contextual Influences on Perceptions of Merchant-Supplied Reference Prices.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 55-66
Issue: 1
Volume: 16
Year: 1989
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 Two contextual variables that have theoretical roots in information
 processing, attribution, and social judgment theories were manipulated
 along with three levels of merchant-supplied reference price in a 2 x 2 x
 3 analysis of variance design. Results support the hypothesized effects of
 consistency and distinctiveness as contextual variables that influence
 internal price standards and purchase evaluations. The three price levels
 resulted in a curvilinear pattern of results for the purchase evaluation
 and source credibility dependent variables, as hypothesized. However,
 contrary to assimilation-contrast theory, the impact of the
 merchant-supplied reference price on estimates of normal and fair prices
 was monotonic.

Title: 
 The Sacred and the Profane in Consumer Behavior: Theodicy on the Odyssey.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 1-38
Issue: 1
Volume: 16
Year: 1989
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 Two processes at work in contemporary society are the secularization of
 religion and the sacralization of the secular. Consumer behavior shapes
 and reflects these processes. For many, consumption has become a vehicle
 for experiencing the sacred. This article explores the ritual substratum
 of consumption and describes properties and manifestations of the sacred
 inherent in consumer behavior. Similarly, the processes by which consumers
 sacralize and desacralize dimensions of their experience are described.
 The naturalistic inquiry approach driving the insights in this article is
 advanced as a corrective to a premature narrowing of focus in consumer
 research.

Title: 
 On the Use of Component Scores in the Presence of Group Structure.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 106-12
Issue: 1
Volume: 16
Year: 1989
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 Examination of the properties of component scores in the presence of
 group structure shows that the first few components extracted, typically
 viewed as most informative regarding total variance, do not necessarily
 contain the most information across group differences.  A method for
 identifying informative components that account for across group
 differences is presented and illustrated.

Title: 
 Priming Price: Prior Knowledge and Context Effects.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 67-75
Issue: 1
Volume: 16
Year: 1989
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 Category priming has recently stirred the interest of judgment
 researchers. By unobtrusively presenting exemplars of a category, that
 category becomes temporarily more accessible from memory and more likely
 to be used subsequently in processing new information. This research
 extends work in cognitive and social psychology to consumer judgments. The
 two studies presented here examine conditions under which cognitive
 categories of price may be primed and the resulting effects on product
 judgment. The results also suggest that these effects are influenced by
 individual difference in consumer knowledge.

Title: 
 Schema Congruity as a Basis for Product Evaluation.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 39-54
Issue: 1
Volume: 16
Year: 1989
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 Mandler theorized that the level of congruity between a product and a
 more general product category schema may influence the nature of
 information processing and thus product evaluations. Products that are
 moderately incongruent with their associated category schemas are expected
 to stimulate processing that leads to a more favorable evaluation relative
 to products that are either congruent of extremely incongruent. Data from
 three experiments conducted in new product contexts are consistent with
 Mandler's hypothesis and serve as a basis for theorizing about the
 process.

Title: 
 The Effect of Goal-Setting and Daily Electronic Feedback on In-home Energy Use.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 98-105
Issue: 1
Volume: 16
Year: 1989
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 Goal-setting in conjunction with feedback on the degree of goal
 attainment can assist consumers in monitoring and, thus, reducing or
 stabilizing their in-home energy use. A field experiment compared the
 effects of daily electronic feedback with monthly external feedback and
 with self-monitoring of energy use. With daily feedback, a 12.3 percent
 reduction in natural gas use was achieved, more than in the other
 conditions and more than the stated 10 percent conservation goal. One year
 after the experiment, energy use remained reduced relative to the baseline
 in all groups; however, differences between the experimental conditions
 were no longer significant.
