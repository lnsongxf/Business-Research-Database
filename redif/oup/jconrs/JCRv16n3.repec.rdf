Title: 
 The Role of Attitude Accessibility in the Attitude-to-Behavior Process.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 280-89
Issue: 3
Volume: 16
Year: 1989
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 Attitudes toward a number of products and the accessibility of those
 attitudes as indicated by the latency of response to an attitudinal
 inquiry were assessed. Subjects with highly accessible attitudes toward a
 given product displayed greater attitude-behavior correspondence than did
 those with relatively less accessible attitudes. Furthermore, subjects
 with less accessible attitudes displayed more sensitivity to the salience
 afforded a product by its position in the front row, as opposed to the
 back row, than did subjects with more accessible attitudes. The
 implications of these data for a model of the process by which attitudes
 guide behavior are discussed.

Title: 
 Money Talks: Perceived Advertising Expense and Expected Product Quality.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 344-53
Issue: 3
Volume: 16
Year: 1989
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 Does the perceived expense of a new product's advertising campaign
 influence expectations about the product's quality? This article
 conceptualizes the process by which perceived advertising expense acts as
 a cue to quality. Results from six experiments indicate that under some
 conditions, knowledge of cost-related campaign elements can evoke
 advertising expense inferences the influence quality predictions, and
 these inferences may be spontaneous.

Title: 
 Ambiguity, Processing Strategy, and Advertising-Evidence Interactions.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 354-60
Issue: 3
Volume: 16
Year: 1989
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 Although advertising persuades through overt appeals to reason or
 emotion, we focus on the indirect process by which advertising influences
 the interpretation of objective product evidence. We investigate how two
 factors moderate advertising-evidence interactions: the ambiguity of the
 evidence and consumer information processing strategies. We provide a
 theoretical account of ambiguity, identifying structural characteristics
 that render evidence about product quality open to either one or multiple
 interpretations. In our first experiment, the ambiguity of a decision
 environment played a key role in determining the effect of advertising on
 product quality perception. In our second experiment, different
 information processing strategies influence advertising's effects on
 interpretation of the evidence.

Title: 
 Literary Criticism and Consumer Research: Overview and Illustrative Analysis.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 322-34
Issue: 3
Volume: 16
Year: 1989
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 This article proposes literary criticism as a source of insight into
 consumer behavior, presents a broad overview of literary criticism,
 provides a specific illustrative analysis, and offers suggestions for
 further research. Literary analysis of advertising text reveals elements
 that provide additional information to consumer researchers, and
 contributions of literary criticisms to consumer research are discussed.
 Major postwar critical schools are reviewed, and relevant theoretical
 concepts summarized. An ad for Ivory Flakes is analyzed using a variety of
 concepts drawn from literary schools, primarily sociocultural and
 reader-response ones. Suggestions for additional research on content
 analysis, image analysis, and the history of consumption are made.

Title: 
 Product-Level Choice: A Top-Down or Bottom-Up Process?

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 289-99
Issue: 3
Volume: 16
Year: 1989
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 Examination of the process by which consumers form decision criteria and
 subsequently evaluate and choose product-level alternatives when purchase
 goals are well defined indicates that decision criteria are formulated in
 a goal-driven, top-down fashion rather than a product-driven, bottom-up
 fashion. Evaluations of alternatives follows a within-product strategy, as
 opposed to a within-attribute strategy, and is characterized by less
 reliance on price information than reported in previous research. Even
 without a specific goal for product decisions, the formation and
 utilization of decision criteria did not follow the bottom-up process.
 Alternative explanations are offered for these contrasts along with
 implications for future research on product-level decisions.

Title: 
 Equity and Disconfirmation Perceptions as Influences on Merchant and Product Satisfaction.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 372-83
Issue: 3
Volume: 16
Year: 1989
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 Prior work on the equity and disconfirmation determinants of transaction
 satisfaction was extended to product satisfaction. Based on perceptions of
 inputs and outcomes of buyer, dealer, and salesperson, two subtractive
 versions of the equity formula-- absolute equity difference and equity
 advantage--were tested with fairness and preference as mediating
 variables. Both variables were related only to the equity advantage
 formula, and disconfirmation and fairness were shown to be distinct
 components of post-transaction dispositions. Moreover, product
 satisfaction was shown to be a function of product disconfirmation,
 complaining, and satisfaction with the dealer. The latter apparently
 mediates both fairness and salesperson satisfaction.

Title: 
 The Effect of Advertising on Attitude Accessibility, Attitude Confidence, and the Attitude-Behavior Relationship.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 269-79
Issue: 3
Volume: 16
Year: 1989
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 The influence of advertising repetition on several non-evaluative
 dimensions of attitudes and the strength of the relationship between
 attitudes and behavior are examined. The results indicate that attitudes
 formed on the basis of repeated ad exposure are similar to those formed on
 the basis of direct experience in that they are more accessible from
 memory, held with more confidence, and are more predictive of subsequent
 behavior than are attitudes based on a single ad exposure. The results are
 consistent with the propositions that attitude accessibility and attitude
 confidence moderate the attitude-behavior relationship.

Title: 
 Who Is the Celebrity Endorser? Cultural Foundations of the Endorsement Process.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 310-21
Issue: 3
Volume: 16
Year: 1989
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 This article offers a new approach to celebrity endorsement. Previous
 explanations, especially the source credibility and source attractiveness
 models are criticized, and an alternative meaning transfer model is
 proposed. According to this model, celebrities' effectiveness as endorsers
 stems from the cultural meanings with which they are endowed. The model
 shows how meanings pass from celebrity to product and from product to
 consumer. The implications of this model for our understanding of the
 consumer society are considered. Research avenues suggested by the model
 are also discussed.

Title: 
 Situational Ethnicity and Consumer Behavior.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 361-71
Issue: 3
Volume: 16
Year: 1989
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 The role of situational ethnicity in consumption behaivor is examined,
 and the relationship between ethnicity and consumption is argued to be
 affected by the situational contexts in which choices are made.
 Situational effects are proposed to operate through changes in the level
 of felt ethnicity and in the relationship between felt ethnicity and
 behavior. An empirical study demonstrates these effects by showing the
 impact of two situational dimensions--social surroundings and antecedent
 conditions--on ethnic food choices.

Title: 
 The Differential Processing of Product Category and Noncomparable Choice Alternatives.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 300-309
Issue: 3
Volume: 16
Year: 1989
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 This article contrasts consumer choice processing of single products from
 different categories (noncomparable alternatives) with the processing of
 multiple products from different categories (product category
 alternatives). It is unclear whether choosing among single or multiple
 alternatives from different product categories will drastically affect
 choice processing. Theoretically, the processing of product categories
 should be more hierarchical or top-down, and the processing of
 non-comparables should be more constructive or bottom-up. The results
 reported here support the theoretical predictions and demonstrate the
 perceptual and processing differences between the two types of choices.

Title: 
 Using Drama to Persuade.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 335-43
Issue: 3
Volume: 16
Year: 1989
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 Television ads can be classified as either arguments or dramas or hybrids
 of these forms. We claim that form dimension influences how ads are
 processed. An argument backs its claims with appeals to objectivity and is
 processed evaluatively. A drama appeals more to subjective criteria and is
 processed empathically. A study is reported in which 40 television
 commercials were classified on a dramatization scale. They were shown to
 1,215 people, and measures of evaluative and empathic processing were
 taken. The measures were found to be weighted differently for arguments
 and dramas, supporting the contention that form influences processing.
