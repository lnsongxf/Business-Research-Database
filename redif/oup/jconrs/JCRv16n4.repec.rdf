Title: 
 Modeling Distance Structures in Consumer Research: Scale versus Order in Validity Assessment.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 479-89
Issue: 4
Volume: 16
Year: 1990
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 Confirmatory multidimensional scaling (CMDS) is presented as a spatial
 technique for structural modeling based on ordinal assumptions, and as an
 alternative to metric techniques such as LISREL. The article links both
 techniques to the multitrait-multimethod matrix and presents a system for
 deriving measures of symmetric construct relationships, measurement error,
 and goodness of fit. Examples show that CMDS and LISREL often give
 comparable results, but that LISREL is sensitive to the magnitude of
 correlations whereas CMDS is sensitive only to their order. The trade-offs
 involved in assumptions, results, and interpretations with these methods
 are highlighted in the conclusion.

Title: 
 Conditions Facilitating Successful Discounting in Consumer Decision Making.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 442-51
Issue: 4
Volume: 16
Year: 1990
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 Two types of discounting appeals were tested for effectiveness: an ignore
 appeal asks consumers to disregard a previously communicated claim because
 it may not be valid; a refute appeal specifically states that the
 challenged claim is incorrect. Results from two experiments indicate that
 the impact of the two appeals on consumer decision making depends on the
 elaboration the message underwent during encoding. Impact is also mediated
 by the extent to which a discounting cue provides counterinformation about
 a product and signals are interpretations of nonchallenged claims. Refute
 appeals are more effective due to their specificity and strength.

Title: 
 The Effects of Bargainable Attributes and Attribute Range Knowledge on Consumer Choice Processes.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 409-19
Issue: 4
Volume: 16
Year: 1990
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 The bargaining purchase process is viewed as a multiattribute,
 multialternative choice in which the attribute values are subject to
 change. Bargaining is studied empirically by directly comparing
 information search strategies for purchase tasks that do and do not
 include a bargaining component. Knowledge of attribute value ranges is
 manipulated to examine its effects on bargaining and non-bargaining
 purchase tasks. The results provide evidence that buyers reduce
 information search when they have the option of bargaining. Furthermore,
 knowledge of attribute value ranges appears to increase the degree to
 which buyers replace information search with bargaining.

Title: 
 Predicting Memory for Components of TV Commercials from EEG.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 472-78
Issue: 4
Volume: 16
Year: 1990
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 Subjects watched television while EEG was being recorded and later
 completed a series of recognition tests based on component parts of the
 commercials they had seen. Memory correlated significantly with changes in
 the electrical patterns that occurred during viewing. The probability of
 correct recognition was enhanced when alpha blocking continued for a
 longer period of time and when hemispheric laterality shifted to the right
 during the onset of a commercial component and then to the left during the
 following seconds.

Title: 
 An Evaluation Cost Model of Consideration Sets.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 393-408
Issue: 4
Volume: 16
Year: 1990
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 If utility (net of price) varies by consumption occasion, the
 consideration set of a rational consumer will represent trade-offs between
 decision costs and the incremental benefits of choosing from a larger set
 of brands. If evaluating a brand decreases bias and uncertainty in
 perceived utility, the decision to evaluate a brand for inclusion in a
 consideration set is different from the decision to consider an evaluated
 brand. The decision to consumer is, in turn, different from the decision
 to consider. This article provides analytical expressions for these
 decision criteria and presents four aggregate implications of the model:
 (1) distributions of consideration set sizes, (2) order-of-entry
 penalties, (3) dynamic advertising response, and (4) competitive promotion
 intensity.

Title: 
 Attention to Social Comparison Information: An Individual Difference Factor Affecting Consumer Conformity.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 461-71
Issue: 4
Volume: 16
Year: 1990
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 Interpersonal influence in consumer behavior is moderated by the extent
 of consumer sensitivity to social comparison information concerning
 product pruchase and usage behavior (cf. Calder and Burnkrant 1977). Two
 survey studies indicate that Lennox and Wolfe's (1984)
 attention-to-social-comparison-information (AT-SCI) scale has adequate
 convergent and discrimination validity and moderates the relative
 influence of normative consequences on behavioral intentions, as
 predicted. A quasi-experiment and an experiment in which control subjects
 under no social pressure are compared with high and low ATSCI subjects
 under pressure reveal that high ATSCI subjects are more likely to comply
 with normative pressures.

Title: 
 Age Differences in Product Categorization.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 452-60
Issue: 4
Volume: 16
Year: 1990
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 This article examines the bases children of different ages use to
 categorize products. Data from children ages 4 to 10 indicate that the use
 of perceptual attributes as a basis for categorizing products decreases
 with age, whereas the use of underlying attributes to categorize products
 increases with age. These findings provide a conceptual replications of
 earlier findings from developmental psychology. Moreover, the findings
 suggest that younger children's failure to consider underlying attributes
 can be traced to common types of processing deficits. Theoretical
 implications arising from these observations and directions for future
 research are discussed.

Title: 
 Conjoint Analysis on Objects with Environmentally Correlated Attributes: The Questionable Importance of Representative Design.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 490-97
Issue: 4
Volume: 16
Year: 1990
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 When studying objects with environmentally correlated attributes, the use
 of orthogonal arrays in conjoint analysis can produce some highly
 unrealistic stimuli that might threaten a study's ecological validity. The
 effect of such departures from realism induced by environmental
 correlations is examined. A series of three experiments compares a
 stimulus set that has non-zero, but lower than environmental, correlations
 to one using an orthogonal array in terms of both perceived realism and
 predictive power. The results indicate that environmentally correlated
 attributes may pose fewer problems in practice than in theory.

Title: 
 The Formation of Expected Future Price: A Reference Price for Forward-Looking Consumers.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 420-32
Issue: 4
Volume: 16
Year: 1990
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 Among numerous possible reference prices, expected future price is
 important. A consumer's expectation of the future price of a brand plays a
 crucial role in the decision to buy now or later. Failure to characterize
 reference price as a forward-looking concept, a common practice in the
 reference pricing literature, violates premises of neoclassical economic
 theory and leads to questionable modeling applications. Explicit measures
 of future price expectations were obtained and used to test various models
 of expectations formation, providing insight into the effect of expected
 future price on consumers' responses to price promotions and brand choice
 decisions.

Title: 
 Consumer Skepticism of Advertising Claims: Testing Hypotheses from Economics of Information.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 433-41
Issue: 4
Volume: 16
Year: 1990
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 Propositions regarding consumers' differential skepticism for search,
 experience, and credence claims are tested in an experiment using adult
 consumers. The results provide clear support for Nelson's (1970)
 hypotheses that consumers are more skeptical of experience than search
 attribute claims and more skeptical of subjective than of objective
 claims. No support is found, however, for the Darby and Karni (1973)
 hypothesis that consumers will be more skeptical of credence than of
 experience attribute claims or for the hypothesis that consumers will not
 be less skeptical of experience claims for low-priced goods.
