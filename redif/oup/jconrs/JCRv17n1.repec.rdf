Title: 
 Expenditure Pattern Differentials between One-Earner and Dual-Earner Households: 1972-1973 and 1984.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 43-52
Issue: 1
Volume: 17
Year: 1990
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 The impact of women's changing work roles on household expenditures by
 married couples is analyzed for 1972-73 and 1984 utilizing data from the
 Consumer Expenditure Survey (CEX). One-earner households with a
 non-working wife (NWW) are compared at the same level of after-tax income
 to a dual-earner households in which the wife works part time (PWW) and to
 those with wives working full time (FWW). The analysis indicates that
 expenditure shares are fairly consistent among types of households over
 time in terms of wife's work status and income levels and that income is
 the most important determinant of expenditures.

Title: 
 Purchasing Behavior in Embedded Markets.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 1-12
Issue: 1
Volume: 17
Year: 1990
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 This article explores the concept of market embeddedness and its impact
 on purchasing behavior in a consumer market. Embeddedness exists when
 consumers derive utility from two sources simultaneously: from attributes
 of the product and from social capital found in preexisting ties between
 buyers and sellers. This framework is applied to the home party method of
 direct sales. We find that the degree of social capital present, as
 measured by the strength of the buyer-seller tie and buyer indebtedness to
 the seller. Significantly affects the likelihood of purchase.

Title: 
 Secular Immorality and the American Ideology of Affluence.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 31-42
Issue: 1
Volume: 17
Year: 1990
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 Extending the Warnerian tradition of social class dynamics, this article
 explores the attainment of secular immortality through affluence. A
 diverse set of literary media directed to or written about wealthy
 consumers was interpreted in a hermeneutic fashion to discern the dominant
 themes composing the ideology of affluence. Among the themes identified
 were entrepreneurial achievement, the achievement of celebrity status via
 consumption, and secular achievement in artistry and craftsmanship. The
 ideology of affluence was found to promote the seeking of personal secular
 immortality through the cultural celebration of achievement, wealth,and
 the accumulation of possessions.

Title: 
 Memory-Based Inferences during Consumer Choice.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 82-93
Issue: 1
Volume: 17
Year: 1990
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 This study explores consumers' inference strategies in a mixed choice
 task involving memory,external information, and missing information on
 attribute values for some brands. Accessibility of relevant information
 was manipulated, and both instructed and uninstructed or natural
 inferences were studied. Instructed inference by low accessibility
 subjects confirmed more with prior overall evaluations of the brands,
 displaying evaluative consistency. Instructed inferences by high
 accessibility subjects tended to follow a correlational role linking
 missing information to other attribute information in memory, displaying
 probabilistic consistency. Choices conformed to inferences, and both are
 more variable when inferences were uninstructed.

Title: 
 On Comparing Alternative Segmentation Schemes: The List of Values (LOV) and Values and Life Styles (VALS).

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 105-09
Issue: 1
Volume: 17
Year: 1990
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 This article begins with a partial replication of previous work--a
 comparison of the Values and Life Styles (VALS) system and the List of
 Values (LOV). The analysis is then extended to evaluate the role of a set
 of standard demographic variables with respect to both psychographic
 segmentation systems.

Title: 
 Factorial Preference Structures.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 94-104
Issue: 1
Volume: 17
Year: 1990
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 This article presents a way to model individual preferences and purchase
 intentions under the assumption that the pattern of relative similarity or
 substitutability among brands can be represented factorially. Factorial
 preference structure represent a compromise between the Luce model, which
 assumes that none of the alternatives share any common features, and EBA,
 which assumes that each possible subset of a choice set has a unique set
 of common features. Factorial preference structures are compared to
 several hierarchical structures and to one that assumes that preferences
 are simply scalable.

Title: 
 A Sociocultural Analysis of a Midwestern American Flea Market.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 13-30
Issue: 1
Volume: 17
Year: 1990
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 The ethnographic case study presented in this article illustrates the
 institutional complexity and sociocultural significance of a midwestern
 American flea market. A conception of market place structure and function
 that incorporates informal and festive dimensions of consumer behavior is
 advanced. The article explores the relationship of primary and secondary
 economic activity. Buyer and seller behavior, marketplace ambience, the
 social embeddedness of consumption, and experiential aspects of
 consumption are considered at length.

Title: 
 The Influence of Print Advertisement Organization on Affect toward a Brand Name.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 53-65
Issue: 1
Volume: 17
Year: 1990
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 Three experiments demonstrate that the allocation of subconscious
 resources during the processing of ads can influence the evaluation of the
 brand names or logos included in the ads. The evaluation of a brand name
 is shown to depend on its placement relative to the ad's focal
 information. Increases in brand name evaluation are attributed to matching
 activation--the elaborated processing of nonattended material in one
 hemisphere when the opposing hemisphere is the primary processor of the
 attended material. Implications for the design and layout of print ads and
 for the influence of advertising on purchase behavior are discussed.

Title: 
 The Effects of Knowledge, Motivation, and Type of Message on Ad Processing and Product Judgments.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 66-73
Issue: 1
Volume: 17
Year: 1990
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 We examined the effects of knowledge, motivation, and the type of message
 on ad processing and on product judgments. The data suggest that,
 regardless of subjects' prior knowledge, they could be motivated to
 process message information in detail. However, experts and novices
 differed in the types of information that prompted detailed message
 processing. Experts are more likely to process a message in detail when
 given only attribute information, while novices are more likely to do so
 when given benefit (or benefit and attribute) information. Experts and
 novices also differed in how they processed messages; experts' detailed
 message processing was evaluative, while novices' was more literal.

Title: 
 Promotion Signal: Proxy for a Price Cut?

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 74-81
Issue: 1
Volume: 17
Year: 1990
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 Evidence suggests that some consumers react to promotion signals without
 considering relative price information. We adopt Petty and Cacioppo's
 Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM) to explain this behavior in terms of
 the ELM's peripheral route to pursuasion in which the promotion signal is
 taken as a cue for a price cut. Experimental results show that low need
 for cognition individuals react to the simple presence of a promotion
 signal whether or not the price of the promoted brand is reduced, but that
 high need for cognition individuals react to a promotion signal only when
 it is accompanied by a substantive price reduction.
