Title: 
 The Effects of Comparative Advertising on Attention, Memory, and Purchase Intentions.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 180-91
Issue: 2
Volume: 17
Year: 1990
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 There is discrepancy between practitioners' views of comparative
 advertising and null findings by academics. However, in most studies,
 subjects' attention to and memory of the comparative claims were inflated,
 which may have precluded effects on these variables and on purchase
 intentions. This study manipulated market share and type of comparative
 claim, used nonforced exposure, measured attention via a computerized
 magazine, and assessed memory and purchase intentions after a 24-hour
 delay. Some findings are that direct comparative claims attract attention
 and thereby enhance purchase intentions for low-share brands but detract
 from purchase intentions for established brands by increasing awareness of
 competitors and sponsor misidentifications.

Title: 
 Trying to Consume.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 127-40
Issue: 2
Volume: 17
Year: 1990
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 An important but relatively neglected area of consumer behavior--the
 pursuit of goals--is addressed. Two recent modifications of the Fishbein
 model are discussed, and an extension is introduced to better explain goal
 pursuit. Major revisions include (1) specification of three dimensions of
 attitude--toward success, failure, and the process of trying, (2) the
 incorporation of self-efficacy judgments as expectations of success and
 failure, and (3) refinement in the specificity of referents and their
 correspondence to reflect trying as the focal explanatory concept. Recency
 and frequency of past trying are independent variables in three models
 tested with weight loss data.

Title: 
 Understanding Jingles and Needledrop: A Rhetorical Approach to Music in Advertising.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 223-36
Issue: 2
Volume: 17
Year: 1990
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 Studies of music in advertising have tended to characterize music as a
 nonsemantic, affective stimulus working independently of meaning or
 context. This implicit theory is reflected in methodology and procedures
 that separate music from its syntax of verbal and visual elements.
 Consequently, the consumer's ability to judge and interpret music as part
 of an overall rhetorical intention is overlooked. This article proposes an
 alternative theory--that music is meaningful, language-like--and calls for
 both interpretive and empirical research as ways of exploring a richer,
 potentially more explanatory concept.

Title: 
 The Effects of Contextual Priming in Print Advertisements.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 215-22
Issue: 2
Volume: 17
Year: 1990
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 This study investigated one particular way that contextual materials can
 affect the processing of ambiguous product information in print ads. It
 was proposed that prior exposure to contextual factors can prime certain
 product attributes and subsequently increase the likelihood that consumers
 interpret product information in terms of these activated attributes,
 thereby affecting the evaluation of the adverised brand. Two experiments
 were conducted to test the hypothesis, and the results demonstrated that
 specific attributes relevant to evaluating the advertised brand varied in
 their acessibility as a function of the context and that these variations
 influenced brand attitudes.

Title: 
 Effects of Brand Awareness on Choice for a Common, Repeat-Purchase Product.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 141-48
Issue: 2
Volume: 17
Year: 1990
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 Results of a controlled experiment on the role of brand awareness in the
 consumer choice process showed that brand awareness was a dominant choice
 heuristic among awareness-group subjects. Subjects with no brand awareness
 tended to sample more brands and selected the high-quality brand on the
 final choice significantly more often than those with brand awareness.
 Thus, when quality differences exist among competing brands, consumers may
 "pay a price" for employing simple choice heuristics such as brand
 awareness in the interest of economizing time and effort. However,
 building brand awareness is a viable strategy for advertising aimed at
 increasing brand-choice probabilities.

Title: 
 Predicting the Effectiveness of Different Strategies of Advertising Variation: A Test of the Repetition-Variation Hypotheses.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 192-202
Issue: 2
Volume: 17
Year: 1990
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 Two strategies for varying the content of ads over repeated presentations
 are distinguished, and the effectiveness of these strategies are examined
 at two different levels of consumer motivation to process the ads.
 Consistent with the hypothesis, experiment 1 found that a cosmetic
 variation strategy (variation in nonsubstantive features of an ad across
 multiple presentations) had greater impact on attitude when motivation to
 porcess the ad was low (as induced by low personal relevance of the
 product). Experiment 2 found thata substantive variation strategy
 (variation in relevant product attributes across multiple presentations)
 was more influential when motivation to process the ad was high. These
 results are consistent with the Elaboration Likelihood Model of
 persuasion.

Title: 
 The Effect of Perceived Advertising Costs on Brand Perceptions.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 160-71
Issue: 2
Volume: 17
Year: 1990
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 How, why, and when consumers use their perceptions of advertising costs
 as cues to a new brand's quality-related attributes is examined. It is
 proposed that consumers perceive advertising costs as deviations from
 expectations about typical costs in the product category. Perceived costs
 are hypothesized to affect brand perceptions in an inverted-U fashion with
 extemely high costs leading to negative perceptions. The level of
 involvement and informativeness of ad content moderate this relationship.
 An experiment in which subjects are exposed to an ad for a new product
 provides evidence for the proposed model.

Title: 
 The Role of Mood in Advertising Effectiveness.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 203-14
Issue: 2
Volume: 17
Year: 1990
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 This study demonstrates the facilitating effect of positive mood on brand
 attitudes for readers of print advertising and explores contingencies and
 cognitive processes underlying that effect. Mood appears to affect the
 amount of total cognitive elaboration, bias the evaluation of argument
 quality, and peripherally affect brand attitudes. An experiment using
 print ads reveals that positive moods create less elaboration, which
 results in more heuristic processing and reduces the extent to which
 message evaluation--itself favorably influenced by positive
 moods--mediates brand attitudes. The effect is greater when the reader has
 a low need for cognition and when the ad contains weak message arguments.

Title: 
 When Consumer Behavior Goes Bad: An Investigation of Adolescent Shoplifting.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 149-59
Issue: 2
Volume: 17
Year: 1990
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 Shoplifting is a troubling and widespread aspect of consumer behavior,
 particularly among adolescents, yet it has attracted little attention from
 consumer researchers. This article reports and interprets findings on the
 pervasiveness of shoplifting among adolescents, the characteristics that
 distinguish adolescent shoplifters from their nonshoplifting peers, and
 adolescents' views regarding the reasons for this behavior. Our findings
 contradict some popular stereotypes concerning the typical shoplifter and
 suggest some rethinking about adolescents' reasons for shoplifting.

Title: 
 Alternative Approaches to Understanding the Determinants of Typicality.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 111-26
Issue: 2
Volume: 17
Year: 1990
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 Data were collected for eight sets of product- and brand-level categories
 to better understand the determinants of typicality and the relationship
 between typicality and attitude of reach category level. Measures of both
 feature similarity (family resemblance) and goal achievement (ideals,
 attribute structure) predicted typicality. However, the latter measures
 were more likely to moderate the typicality-attitude relationship.
 Frequency of instantiation was superior to a general familiarity measure
 in predicting typicality. Attitudes and attribute structure better
 predicted typicality for subordinate (e.g., fast-food restaurants) than
 superordinate (e.g., restaurants) categories. Implications for the nature
 and structure of product and brand categories are discussed.

Title: 
 The Effects of Advertiser Reputation and Extremity of Advertising Claim on Advertising Effectiveness.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 172-79
Issue: 2
Volume: 17
Year: 1990
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 A factorial experiment was developed in which the reputation of the
 advertising firm and the extremity of the adverising claim were
 manipulated. Two levels of advertiser reputation, focusing on the
 expertise and trustworthiness of the sponsoring firm, were developed.
 Claim extremity was structured on a rank-order scale with product claims
 as first, third, fifth, or twentieth best among 100 competing brands.
 Product evaluation was significantly influenced by both independent
 variables and by the interaction between the two. Measures of ad
 credibility helped provide an explanation for the findings.
