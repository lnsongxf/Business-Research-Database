Title: 
 The Homeless in America: An Examination of Possessions and Consumption Behaviors.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 303-21
Issue: 3
Volume: 17
Year: 1990
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 This research utilized an ethnographic approach to advace our
 understanding of the survival strategies employed by the homeless in our
 society. We examine the types of possessions consumed, how possessions are
 acquired through nontraditional employment and scavenging, and why some
 products are purchased while others are scavenged. We also look at the
 tools used to facilitate search, acquisition, storage, and consumption of
 these products. Finally, we consider the importance of community for
 protection of self and possessions and how community among the homeless
 affects consumption. Emergent themes that allow interpretation of the
 description are presented.

Title: 
 The Lived Meaning of Free Choice: An Existential-Phenomenological Description of Everyday Consumer Experiences of Contemporary Married Women.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 346-61
Issue: 3
Volume: 17
Year: 1990
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 An existential-phenomenological description of everday consumer
 experiences of contempory married women with children as offered. An
 idiographic case study provides a thick description of this phenomenon and
 illustrates the hermeneutic process used in the interpretation. Following
 the case study, three interpretive themes are presented as mutually
 related aspects of an experiential gestalt that is shaped by the
 contextual ground of participants' life-world situations. Viewed
 holistically, the thematic aspects exhibit several dialectical relations
 that can be understood in terms of the emergent meaning of free choice.
 The applicability of this experiment gestalt to other life-world contexts
 is discussed.

Title: 
 Determinants of Product Evaluation: Effects of the Time Interval between Knowledge of a Product's Country of Origin and Information about Its Specific Attributes.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 277-88
Issue: 3
Volume: 17
Year: 1990
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 Concepts related to country of origin can affect interpretation of
 information about specific product attributes. However, these effects are
 likely to be pronounced only when country of origin is conveyed some time
 before attribute descriptions, allowing a separate concept of the product
 to be formed on the basis of it. When country of origin and intrinsic
 attribute information were presented in the same experimental session,
 subjects perceived country of origin as simply another product attribute.
 When presented the day before, however, country of origin not only had a
 greater influence on product evaluations but affected the interpretation
 of attribute descriptions.

Title: 
 Self-Gifts: Phenomenological Insights from Four Contexts.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 322-32
Issue: 3
Volume: 17
Year: 1990
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 This article reports the results of a study meant to portray a detailed
 picture of self-gift experiences in four contexts, focusing notably on
 reward and therapeutic self-gifts. Extending prior conceptual discussions,
 the findings suggest that self-gifts are a form of personally symbolic
 self-communication through special indulgences that tend to be
 premeditated and highly context bound. Discussion centers on theoretical
 implications and future directions for self-gift research. Overall,
 self-gifts represent a complex class of personal acquisitions that offer
 intriguing insights on self-directed consumer behavior.

Title: 
 Recall and Consumer Consideration Sets: Influencing Choice without Altering Brand Evaluations.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 263-76
Issue: 3
Volume: 17
Year: 1990
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 This article focuses on memory-based choice situations where changes in a
 brand's accessibility may affect the probability that it is retrieved and
 considered for choice. In such instances, factors other than evaluation
 may affect which brands are brought to mind at purchase. Two experiments
 are described that manipulate the determinants of brand accessibility and
 measure consequent effects on retrieval, consideration, choice, and
 evaluation. Results provide evidence for the influence of memory during
 the brand-choice process. For a brand to be selected in memory-based
 choice, the consumer must recall that brand and fail to recall other
 brands that might otherwise be preferred.

Title: 
 More than a Labor of Love: Gender Roles and Christmas Gift Shopping.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 333-45
Issue: 3
Volume: 17
Year: 1990
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 Through a field study of 229 men and women, the effect of gender-related
 variables on Christmas-gift-shopping patterns was explored. Survey results
 suggest that women are more involved than men in the activity. However,
 men are likely to be more involved if they hold egalitarian gender-role
 attitudes. Overall, the study indicates that, while Christmas shopping may
 be a "labor of love" to some, it is most widely construed as "women's
 work."

Title: 
 The Effects of Stimulus and Consumer Characteristics on the Utilization of Nutrition Information.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 362-74
Issue: 3
Volume: 17
Year: 1990
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 This research investigates the effect of consumer characteristics (e.g.,
 familiarity and enduring motivation) and stimulus characteristics (e.g.,
 information format and content) on the utilization of nutrition
 information. Results indicate that both types of charcteristics influence
 information processing and decision quality. Moreover, stimulus
 characteristics, in general, were found to facilitate these activities
 irrespective of consumer differences.

Title: 
 Sociocognitive Analysis of Group Decision Making among Consumers.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 245-62
Issue: 3
Volume: 17
Year: 1990
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 A sociocognitive perspective is developed to further the understanding of
 the relation between cognitive and social processes. The approach combines
 social network analysis with a cognitive network perspective to enable the
 researcher to study how social structure influences cognitive structure
 and how shared cognitive structure influences choice. This perspective is
 applied to how a group (with several subgroups) makes a consumer decision
 with consequences for the entire group. The results show that social
 structure influences cognitive structure, that shared knowledge is related
 to choice, and that the sociocognitive perspective provides new insights
 to prior literature on group decision making and the relation between
 group membership and brand choice.

Title: 
 The Role of Time in the Action of the Consumer.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 289-302
Issue: 3
Volume: 17
Year: 1990
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 A phenomenological approach was used to study the temporal system of
 consumers, an important but neglected aspect of individual action and
 consumer behavior. Two patterns of temporal attitude with profoundly
 different implications for consumer behavior were identified: some
 individuals appear to live and act as if they are more subject to
 deterministic functioning in relation to their temporal orientation, while
 other appear subject to voluntaristic functioning. Different temporal
 orientations may induce different sorts of motivation, different plans,
 the consumption of different types of products, and different specific
 attitudes that elicit a certain organizational process in relation to
 products.
