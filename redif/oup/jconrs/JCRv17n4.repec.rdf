Title: 
 A Multistage Model of Customers' Assessments of Service Quality and Value.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 375-84
Issue: 4
Volume: 17
Year: 1991
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 This article develops a model of how customers with prior experiences and
 expectations assess service performance levels, overall service quality,
 and service value. The model is applied to residential customers'
 assessments of local telephone service. The model is estimated with a
 two-stage least squares procedure through survey data. Results indicate
 that residential customers' assessments of quality and value are primarily
 a function of disconfirmation arising from discrepancies between
 anticipated and perceived performance levels. However, perceived
 performance levels also were found to have an important direct effect on
 quality and value assessments.

Title: 
 Multitrait-Multimethod Matrices in Consumer Research.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 426-39
Issue: 4
Volume: 17
Year: 1991
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 This article examines three alternative procedures for analyzing
 multitrait-multimethod matrices: the Campbell-Fiske procedure,
 confirmatory factor analysis, and the direct product model. The implicit
 assumptions, as well as the strengths and weaknesses, of each approach are
 presented and their implications discussed. It is proposed that one should
 carefully examine model assumptions, individual parameters, and various
 diagnostic indicators, as well as overall model fits. The implications of
 these recommendations are illustrated through reanalyses of data from
 earlier studies of consumer behavior. Potentially misleading conclusions
 in these studies are corrected in demonstrations of the three procedures.
 The results show that methods often have multiplicative effects, a finding
 that supports the direct product model, which has not been previously used
 in consumer research. The need for multiple-method, multiple-measure
 approaches to research is highlighted by examining the limitations of
 single-method, single-measure approaches to theory testing.

Title: 
 Inference Effects without Inference Making? Effects of Missing Information on Discounting and Use of Presented Information.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 477-91
Issue: 4
Volume: 17
Year: 1991
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 Subjects evaluated a focal set of single-attribute product descriptions
 along with descriptions of competing brands that systematically altered
 what attributes subjects perceived as missing from the product
 descriptions. This manipulation selectively increased thoughts about
 undescribed attributes and led to (1) reduced effects of
 described-attribute levels on product evaluations and (2) lowered
 evaluations of a target set of products. In the past, similar effects have
 been interpreted as evidence that subjects incorporated inferred
 missing-attribute values in their evaluations. However, the results of the
 present study suggest that neither effect was mediated by inferencemaking.
 Process tracing data showed that noting an attribute as missing was
 usually not followed by inferences about its value.

Title: 
 Consumer Responses to Advertising: The Effects of Ad Content, Emotions, and Attitude toward the Ad on Viewing Time.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 440-53
Issue: 4
Volume: 17
Year: 1991
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 This study develops and tests a hierarchical model of advertising effects
 on viewing time. The ads studied represent a sample of commercials aired
 during prime-time broadcasts, and the effects are analyzed across the ads
 rather than across people. Primary emphasis is placed on the attempt to
 explain a simulated behavioral measure of attention to television
 commercials--that of channel switching (zapping) and fast-forwarding
 through ads on prerecorded programs (zipping). In addition, the study
 demonstrates a chain of effects from the content of television ads,
 through emotional reactions and attitude toward the ad, to actual viewing
 behaviors.

Title: 
 Determinants of Household Expenditures for Services.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 385-97
Issue: 4
Volume: 17
Year: 1991
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 Data from the Bureau of Statistics Consumer Expenditure Surveys were used
 to investigate factors influencing household expenditures for services in
 the United States. There were significant differences between families
 with full-time and part-time working wives in expenditures on child care,
 food away from home, and total services. Household production variables
 had a significant impact on service expenditures in most instances, while
 the effects of other variables such as family life cycle, education, race,
 and geographic location varied by service category and employment status
 of wife.

Title: 
 Effects of Word-of-Mouth and Product-Attribute Information on Persuasion: An Accessibility-Diagnosticity Perspective.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 454-62
Issue: 4
Volume: 17
Year: 1991
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 The effects of word-of-mouth (WOM) communications and specific attribute
 information on product evaluations were investigated. A face-to-face WOM
 communication was more persuasive than a printed format (experiment 1).
 Although a strong WOM effect was found, this effect was reduced or
 eliminated when a prior impression of the target brand was available from
 memory or when extremely negative attribute information was presented
 (experiment 2). The results suggest that diverse, seemingly unrelated
 judgmental phenomena--such as the vividness effect, the perseverance
 effect, and the negativity effect--can be explained through the
 accessibility-diagnosticity model.

Title: 
 Memory and Evaluation Effects in Competitive Advertising Environments.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 463-76
Issue: 4
Volume: 17
Year: 1991
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 A laboratory experiment replicates and extends prior research on how
 competitive advertising and retrieval cues affect consumer memory and
 evaluations of brands. The number and valence of competing ads, presence
 of ad retrieval cues, and valence of target ads were manipulated. A high
 level of competitive advertising varying in valence produced interference
 effects for recall and evaluations. Ad retrieval cues offset these effects
 and enhanced recall and evaluations even when there were no competing ads.
 Interference effects were more pronounced for recall of brand claims; cue
 effects were more pronounced for recall of cognitive responses and
 evaluations of the advertised brand.

Title: 
 Selves in Transition: Symbolic Consumption in Personal Rites of Passage and Identity Reconstruction.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 412-25
Issue: 4
Volume: 17
Year: 1991
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 The consumption of aesthetic plastic surgery is examined within the
 broader context of daily life in an investigation of the motives and the
 self-concept dynamics underlying this symbolic consumer behavior. Data
 were collected in multiple, in-depth, ethnographic interviews, and
 analyzed by a constant comparative method revealing insights into both a
 priori and emergent themes. A priori themes regarding body image,
 impression management, symbolic self-completion, and possible selves are
 developed through a literature review and discussed briefly in light of
 the findings. Emergent themes, including role transitions, sexual selves
 and romantic fantasies, control and efficacy, and identity play are
 developed and embedded in a discussion of identity reconstruction and
 personal rites of passage. It is concluded that consumption activities are
 imprtant to both the maintenance and the development of a stable,
 harmonious self-concept. Directions for future research are discussed.

Title: 
 Time-Inconsistent Preferences and Consumer Self-Control.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 492-507
Issue: 4
Volume: 17
Year: 1991
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 Why do consumers sometimes act against their own better judgment,
 engaging in behavior that is often regretted after the fact and that would
 have been rejected with adequate forethought? More generally, how do
 consumers attempt to maintain self-control in the face of
 time-inconsistent preferences? This article addresses consumer impatience
 by developing a decision-theoretic model based on reference points. The
 model explains how and why consumers experience sudden increases in desire
 for a product, increases that can result in the temporary overriding of
 long-term preferences. Tactics that consumers use to control their own
 behavior are also discussed. Consumer self-control is framed as a struggle
 between two psychological forces, desire and willpower. Finally, two
 general classes of self-control strategies are described: those that
 directly reduce desire, and those that overcome desire through willpower.

Title: 
 Artifacts, Identity, and Transition: Favorite Possessions of Indians and Indian Immigrants to the United States.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 398-411
Issue: 4
Volume: 17
Year: 1991
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 The things to which we are attached help to define who we are, who we
 were, and who we hope to become. These meanings are likely to be
 especially salient to those in identity transitions. In this study we
 examine such meanings by comparing favorite possessions of Indians in
 India and Indians who immigrated to the United States. Because the Indian
 sense of self differs considerably from Western concepts, these immigrants
 provide an interesting and important group in which to examine the use of
 possessions in securing identity. Results suggest that possessions play an
 important role in the reconstruction of immigrant identity.
