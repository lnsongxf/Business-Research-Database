Title: 
 A Polarization Model for Describing Group Preferences.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 108-18
Issue: 1
Volume: 18
Year: 1991
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 This article develops a model for describing the preferences of a group
 of its individual members. The model incorporates the empirically observed
 group-polarization phenomenon. It Is interesting that the resulting group
 preference evaluation is essentially a weighted linear model of individual
 preferences with the addition of an intercept term. The polarization model
 is empirically tested in two experimental contexts, faculty-candidate and
 restaurant selection. For both experimental situations, the polarization
 model performed better for the majority of groups tested in predicting a
 holdout sample than did either the more common weighted linear model
 without an intercept (with weights summing to one) or the multilinear
 model.

Title: 
 Positivism and Paradigm Dominance in Consumer Research: Toward Critical Pluralism and Rapproachement.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 32-44
Issue: 1
Volume: 18
Year: 1991
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 As spirited debate continues on the appropriate philosophical and
 methodological foundations for consumer research, participants claim the
 literature has been full of misconceptions, misunderstandings,
 misrepresentations, and mischaracterizations. Through historical
 methodology, this article shows that these "misses" stem, at least in
 part, from the debate's having been historically ill informed about the
 origins and fundamental beliefs of a group of philosophers called logical
 positivists. After addressing a fundamental premise of the entire debate
 (i.e., that contemporary social science and consumer research are
 dominated by positivism), this article advocates critical pluralism and
 documents a favorable prognosis for rapprochement.

Title: 
 Comprehension's Role in Persuasion: The Case of Its Moderating Effect on the Persuasive Impact of 
Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 52-62
Issue: 1
Volume: 18
Year: 1991
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 A study of reactions to a novel product attributed the invention to
 either an expert or a novice. Comprehension of the product description was
 manipulated by varying information exposure time (Study 1) and contextual
 prior knowledge (Study 2). As predicted by the heuristic-systematic model
 comprehensibility moderated the persuasive impact of source expertise.
 When comprehension was low, subjects relied on the inventor's expertise in
 forming their attitudes toward the product, but when comprehension and
 hence, systematic processing were higher, source expertise had no impact
 on subjects' attitudes. In a pilot study, however, subjects attributed
 comprehensibility to the source and derogated incomprehensible
 communications.

Title: 
 Social Comparison and the Idealized Images of Advertising.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 71-83
Issue: 1
Volume: 18
Year: 1991
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 This article reviews theories that might explain how advertising causes
 dissatisfaction with the self. It is hypothesized that consumers compare
 themselves with idealized advertising images. Exposure to such images may
 change consumers comparison standards for what they desire or lower
 perceptions of their own performance on relevant dimensions; the result is
 lowered satisfaction. Explanatory and experimental research examined these
 hypotheses in the context of idealized images of physical attractiveness
 in ads targeted at young women. Evidence for comparison was found. Results
 suggest that idealized images raised comparison standards for
 attractiveness and lowered satisfaction with one's own attractiveness.

Title: 
 Exploring Differences in Males' and Females' Processing Strategies.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 63-70
Issue: 1
Volume: 18
Year: 1991
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 Existing research suggests that, relative to males, females often are
 more concerned with the particulars of message claims when processing
 advertising messages. This research examines how males process messages,
 when gender differences in processing are likely to occur, and whether
 variance In either information availability (the extent of message
 encoding) or information accessibility (the richness of message encoding)
 is likely to mediate such differences. The findings suggest that whether
 gender differences in processing occur depends on the nature of the
 response task and the level of cue incongruity contained in the message.
 Differences in the accessibility of message cues and in the genders'
 likelihood of using alternative processing strategies seem likely to
 account for these findings.

Title: 
 Consumer Normal Price Estimation: Market versus Personal Standards.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 45-51
Issue: 1
Volume: 18
Year: 1991
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 In reference-price models, internal reference price is typically
 estimated from actual market prices. Given the generally poor price
 knowledge consumers have exhibited in prior research, the question is
 whether it is reasonable to use actual market prices to estimate
 consumers' internal reference-price standards. The initial answer provided
 in this research, surprisingly, is yes. Although internal reference prices
 are measurable and do affect consumer price perception, the gains in
 measuring and using those standards in predicting brand choice for
 frequently purchased products may not be worth the costs. Reasons why the
 surrogate price measure may work and implications for the measurement of
 internal reference-price standards are considered.

Title: 
 The Influence of External Constraints on Brand Choice: The Lone-Alternative Effect.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 119-27
Issue: 1
Volume: 18
Year: 1991
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 In an earlier "Journal of Consumer Research" article, Kahn, Moore, and
 Glazer examined the phenomenon of constrained choice in experimental
 settings and found empirical results that ran counter to generally
 accepted models of hierarchical choice (e.g., preference trees). In this
 article, the authors reexamine those findings. Specifically, their main
 purposes are (1) to provide an explanation for the deviations from
 accepted theoretical models, (2) to suggest operational measures for the
 new constructs identified by Kahn, Moore, and Glazer, and (3) to propose a
 modification of hierarchical models that improves choice prediction by
 adjusting for bias against lone alternatives.

Title: 
 A Program of Classical Conditioning Experiments Testing Variations in the Conditioned Stimulus and Context.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 1-12
Issue: 1
Volume: 18
Year: 1991
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 Twenty-one experiments regarding the strength of attitudinal conditioning
 for various brands of cola were performed. The conditioned stimulus, brand
 familiarity (various unknown, moderately known, and well-known cola
 brands), and the embedding context In which conditioning trials occurred
 (other known or unknown brands) were manipulated. Effects are strongest
 for unknown and moderately known brands and for colas conditioned In a
 context of known versus unknown brands. Evidence is also provided showing
 that attitudes are conditioned only when subjects are aware of the
 contingency between conditioned and unconditioned stimuli.

Title: 
 The Dimensionality of Consumption Emotion Patterns and Consumer Satisfaction.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 84-91
Issue: 1
Volume: 18
Year: 1991
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 Although both consumption emotion and satisfaction judgments occur in the
 postpurchase period, little is known about their correspondence. This
 article investigates the interrelationships between the two constructs by
 way of taxonomic and dimensional analyses to identify patterns of
 emotional response to product experiences. Five discriminable patterns of
 affective experience were uncovered, which were based on three independent
 affective dimensions of hostility, pleasant surprise, and interest. The
 results extend prior findings of a simple bidimensional affective-response
 space and reveal that satisfaction measures vary in their ability to
 represent the affective content of consumption experiences.

Title: 
 Picture-Based Persuasion Processes and the Moderating Role of Involvement.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 92-107
Issue: 1
Volume: 18
Year: 1991
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 Although pictures have been shown to enhance the impact of persuasive
 communications, little is known about the robustness of such effects. This
 study examines how involvement moderates the process by which pictures
 affect brand attitudes and purchase intentions. The results show that
 involvement's moderating role depends on whether pictures convey
 product-relevant information. Whereas the impact of affect-laden pictures
 devoid of product-relevant information declines as involvement increases,
 involvement exerts the opposite effect for product-relevant pictures. The
 results also demonstrate that the images evoked by pictures and thoughts
 about a picture's appropriateness play an important mediating role in the
 persuasion process underlying peripheral pictures. Coauthors are Sunil
 Bhatla, Kenneth R. Lord, Peter R. Dickson, and H. Rao Unnava.
