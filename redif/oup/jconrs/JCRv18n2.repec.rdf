Title: 
 The Use of Comparative Advertising for Brand Positioning: Association versus Differentiation.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 145-60
Issue: 2
Volume: 18
Year: 1991
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 The explicit superiority claims in direct comparative ads should
 facilitate differentiation of the advertised brand from the comparison
 brand. However prior research suggests that such ads primarily associate
 brands. This problem is investigated by considering the categorization and
 inferential processes elicited by direct comparative ads. Results suggest
 that direct comparative ads can enhance a consumers' perceptions of the
 advertised brand by associating it with the comparison brand and
 simultaneously differentiate the brands by lowering consumers' perceptions
 of the comparison brand on the featured attribute. But both effects are
 contingent on the typicality of the featured attribute and the familiarity
 of the advertised brand. A key finding is that direct comparative ads are
 most effective for both unfamiliar and familiar advertised brands when the
 featured attribute is typical of the category.

Title: 
 Value Segmentation: A Model for the Measurement of Values and Value Systems.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 208-18
Issue: 2
Volume: 18
Year: 1991
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 This article develops a model for the measurement of human values that,
 rather than obtain aggregate measurements, identifies distinct value
 systems within a population and classifies individuals according to them.
 These value systems are inferred from the stated priority rankings,
 obtained from each individual via the Rokeach value survey.

Title: 
 Evaluation of Brand Extensions: The Role of Product Feature Similarity and Brand Concept Consistency.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 185-93
Issue: 2
Volume: 18
Year: 1991
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 This article examines two factors that differentiate between successful
 and unsuccessful brand extensions: product feature similarity and brand
 concept consistency. The results reveal that, in identifying brand
 extensions, consumers take into account not only information about the
 product-level feature similarity between the new product and the products
 already associated with the brand, but also the concept consistency
 between the brand concept and the extension. For both function-oriented
 and prestige-oriented brand names, the most favorable reactions occur when
 brand extensions are made with high brand concept consistency and high
 product feature similarity. In addition, the relative impact of these two
 factors differs to some extent, depending on the nature of the brand-name
 concept. When a brand's concept is consistent with those of its extension
 products, the prestige brand seems to have greater extendibility to
 products with low feature similarity than the functional brand does.

Title: 
 The Differential Role of Characteristics of Music on High- and Low-Involvement Consumers' Processing of Ads.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 161-73
Issue: 2
Volume: 18
Year: 1991
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 This article examines the impact of two dimensions of music--its fit with
 the advertised message and its ties to past emotion-laden experiences
 (indexicality)--on low- and high-involvement consumers' ad processing.
 Previous research suggests that executional cues in an ad exert their
 influence primarily under conditions of low involvement in the form of
 peripheral-route processing. However this view may be overly simplistic.
 Certain executional cues may influence central-route (message-based) and
 peripheral (non-message-based) processing of both high- and
 low-involvement consumers; however, the direction of this influence may
 depend on both the specific characteristic of the cue and the level of
 consumer involvement. The results of this research generally are
 consistent with these expectations.

Title: 
 An Empirical Test of a Model of External Search for Automobiles.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 233-42
Issue: 2
Volume: 18
Year: 1991
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 A structural equations model of the determinants of external search for
 automobiles is developed and tested on survey data from recent automobile
 purchasers. By considering how perceived risk and perceived benefits
 affect search, by specifying the role of experience and knowledge in the
 search process more precisely than in other field studies of search, and
 by modeling the interrelationship between the various determinants of
 search, the authors attempt to provide new insights into the determinants
 of search behavior for automobiles and other consumer durables.

Title: 
 Content-Analysis Research: An Examination of Applications with Directives for Improving Research Reliability and Objectivity.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 243-50
Issue: 2
Volume: 18
Year: 1991
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 This article provides an empirical review and synthesis of published
 studies that have used content-analysis methods. Harold Kassarjian's
 critical guidelines for content-analysis research were used to examine the
 methods employed in 128 studies. The guidelines were expanded by providing
 an empirical investigation of multiple dimensions of objectivity.
 Reliability issues were also assessed by examining factors central to the
 replication and interjudge coefficient calculations. The findings indicate
 a general need for improvement in the application of content-analysis
 methods. Suggestions for calculating reliability coefficients and for
 improving the objectivity and reliability of research are offered.

Title: 
 The Critical Imagination: Emancipatory Interests in Consumer Research.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 129-44
Issue: 2
Volume: 18
Year: 1991
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 Critical theory is presented as an interdisciplinary approach to seeking
 knowledge about consumers. Critical theory holds that social problems
 often result from groups in society being constrained by social structures
 and processes that they themselves construct and maintain. Critical
 research involves grasping both the intersubjective understandings of the
 groups involved and the historical-empirical understanding of the
 potentially constraining objective social conditions. Contradictions that
 are discovered provide the stimuli for change. Through the process of
 critique and dialogue the critical researcher tries to help people imagine
 alternative social organizations that facilitate the development of human
 potential free from constraints.

Title: 
 Perceived Control and the Effects of Crowding and Consumer Choice on the Service Experience.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 174-84
Issue: 2
Volume: 18
Year: 1991
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 Perceived control is proposed to be a crucial variable in mediating the
 consumer's emotional and behavioral responses to the physical environment
 and the contact personnel that constitute the service encounter. Results
 of an experimental test of this proposition confirm the importance of
 perceived control in mediating the effects of two situational features of
 the encounter--consumer density (the number of consumers that are present
 in a service setting) and consumer choice (whether it is a person's own
 decision to enter into, and stay in, a service situation)--on the
 pleasantness of the service experience and the consumer's
 approach-avoidance responses to the service encounter.

Title: 
 The Self-Manipulation of My Pervasive, Perceived Vital Energy through Product Use: An Introspective-Praxis Perspective.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 194-207
Issue: 2
Volume: 18
Year: 1991
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 Consumer researchers as well as others, have overlooked the perceived
 vital energy dimension of consumer behavior. To deal with this issue, this
 article uses an introspective-praxis approach to explore as "thickly" as
 possible the pervasive role perceived vital energy plays in one consumer's
 everyday use of products namely The author's own. In doing so, it
 introduces an energy-based model of product use that encompasses the
 characteristics/states of that vital energy and the product-related
 operation's employed by the consumer to manipulate those states. After
 these aspects of energy are considered, several thematic examples
 concerning its role and significance in his own consumption are discussed.
 Finally, implications for future research are considered.

Title: 
 Prediction of Consumer Behavior by Experts and Novices.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 251-56
Issue: 2
Volume: 18
Year: 1991
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 Are those who are familiar with scientific research on consumer behavior
 better able to make predictions about phenomena in this field? Predictions
 were made for 105 hypotheses from 20 empirical studies selected from
 "Journal of Consumer Research." A total of 1,736 predictions were obtained
 from 16 academics, 12 practitioners, and 43 high school students. The
 practitioners were correct on 58.2 percent of the hypotheses, the students
 on 56.6 percent, and the academics on 51.3 percent. No group performed
 better than chance.

Title: 
 Repositioning for Changing Preferences: The Case of Beef versus Poultry.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 219-32
Issue: 2
Volume: 18
Year: 1991
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 The authors demonstrate that a superior, high-share product (beef) could
 lose its relative position and sales as a result of a change in consumer
 preference for an attribute (convenience) on which the competition
 (poultry) was actually weaker. They use multiple data sources to show this
 has happened for beef and poultry, rather than the alternative explanation
 of increased health awareness. These sources include United States
 Department of Agriculture (USDA) consumption data, a time series of new
 product introductions, and a sample of convenience beef and poultry
 products. The data support the hypothesis that increased demand for
 convenience contributed to poultry's success rather than the explanation
 that increased health awareness is solely responsible.
