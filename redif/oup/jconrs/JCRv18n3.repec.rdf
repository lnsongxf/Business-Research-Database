Title: 
 Exploring More Than 24 Hours a Day: A Preliminary Investigation of Polychronic Time Use.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 392-401
Issue: 3
Volume: 18
Year: 1991
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 The present exploratory study investigates the concept of polychronic
 time use through the development and preliminary testing of a proposed
 scale, the Polychronic Attitude Index (PAI). Polychronic time use is
 defined and reviewed in relation to role overload and household
 demographic characteristics. When a sample of consumers in New Jersey was
 surveyed, both the PAI and role overload were found to be related to
 different types of polychronic time use. Overall, this research
 demonstrates that the concept of polychronic time use contributes to our
 understanding of consumer behavior and raises questions worthy of future
 research.

Title: 
 Elaborating on Elaboration: The Distinction between Relational and Item-Specific Elaboration.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 358-67
Issue: 3
Volume: 18
Year: 1991
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 This article examines the distinction between and the effects of two
 different types of elaboration on various indicators of ad effectiveness.
 One type of elaboration known as item-specific processing, emphasizes the
 distinctive features of each ad claim. A second type, called relational
 processing, highlights similarities (e.g., common themes) that link
 various ad claims. This study shows that recall of ad claims is enhanced
 when manipulations foster both types of elaboration simultaneously.
 However, recognition and clustered recall are enhanced only when
 manipulations invite item-specific and relational processing,
 respectively. Finally, data on product judgments, consumption intentions,
 and the correspondence between these types of responses suggest that
 item-specific processing may have more impact on these measures.

Title: 
 Autodriving: A Photoelicitation Technique.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 257-72
Issue: 3
Volume: 18
Year: 1991
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 This article presents a literature review that explains the antecedents
 and values of visual research. Then it illustrates the use of photographs
 and audio recordings of informants to enrich interviews. The term
 "autodriving" indicates that the interview is "driven" by informants who
 are seeing and hearing their own behavior. Autodriving addresses the
 obtrusiveness and reactivity inherent in consumer-behavior research by
 explicitly encouraging consumers to comment on their consumption behavior
 as the photographs and recordings represent it. Thus, the research aims
 for a negotiated interpretation of consumption events. The results suggest
 that photographs offer exciting challenges to informants by encouraging
 their need to explain themselves.

Title: 
 Adapting Cutoffs to the Choice Environment: The Effects of Attribute Correlation and Reliability.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 346-57
Issue: 3
Volume: 18
Year: 1991
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 Consumers frequently simplify complex choices by setting attribute
 cutoffs, which are minimum acceptable levels that an alternative must
 possess to be considered further. The authors explore the extent to which
 consumers adapt these cutoffs to the choice environment. They show that,
 as the reliability of information about the attribute increases, consumers
 make more severe cutoffs (i.e., fewer attribute levels are acceptable),
 Further, positive correlations between attributes elicit more severe
 cutoffs than negative correlations do, and consumers' expectations about
 the choice outcome partially mediate this relationship. The format of
 correlational information also affects adaptation: consumers adapt their
 cutoffs when they are given direct information about the correlation, but
 not when they are allowed to infer the correlation from a set of
 alternatives. Overall, consumers appear to adapt to information about
 reliability and correlations, but they have difficulty assessing
 correlation from the choice environment.

Title: 
 Contextual Influences on the Meanings Ascribed to Ordinary Consumption Objects.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 311-24
Issue: 3
Volume: 18
Year: 1991
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 Although the perception of contextualized objects pervades our everyday
 experiences, the literature provides little insight into how consumers
 ascribe meaning to contextualized.products, or indeed into what meaning
 is. The authors address this gap in the literature by providing a
 conceptualization of consumption-object meaning and an a priori model for
 measuring it. An experiment tested several hypotheses concerning how the
 kind and amount of context affects the meanings people ascribe to ordinary
 consumption objects (and the labels that they use to identify those
 meanings). Overall, the findings support the proposed conceptualization.

Title: 
 The Effect of Semantic Cues on Consumer Perceptions of Reference Price Ads.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 380-91
Issue: 3
Volume: 18
Year: 1991
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 This article examines the differential effects of two types of semantic
 cues: (1) cues connoting that an advertised price discount exhibits low
 consistency over time, and (2) cues connoting that an advertised discount
 is highly distinctive vis-a-vis competitors. Results suggest that, for
 manipulations of external reference prices with offering price held
 constant, semantic cues that connote high distinctiveness are more
 effective in influencing consumers' price-related evaluations when the
 external reference price is otherwise implausibly high than are semantic
 cues that connote low consistency. For manipulations of offering prices
 with external reference price held constant, however, semantic cues
 connoting high distinctiveness exert more relative influence on
 price-related cognitions when offering prices are high.

Title: 
 Homeless Women, Special Possessions, and the Meaning of "Home": An Ethnographic Case Study.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 298-310
Issue: 3
Volume: 18
Year: 1991
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 This article investigates homelessness among adult women, an important
 and growing subpopulation among the homeless. To examine their situation
 within a consumer-behavior context, an ethnographic case study of a
 shelter for homeless women run by an order of Roman Catholic sisters was
 performed. The study focused on how these women became homeless, the
 effects of early life experiences on their homelessness, available
 emotional and financial support, possessions that were lost, maintained,
 or became available during their homeless period(s), their perspectives on
 their lives at the shelter and its ability to act as a "home," and their
 fantasies about home life. Public policy implications and contributions of
 these findings to the developing literature in consumer behavior regarding
 the meaning of possessions are discussed.

Title: 
 Assessing the Influence of Journal of Consumer Research: A Citation Analysis.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 402-10
Issue: 3
Volume: 18
Year: 1991
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 This article employs citation analysis to investigate empirically the
 influence of the "Journal of Consumer Research" (JCR) on the social
 science literature. Some 7,166 citations from the Social Science Citation
 Index (1974-89) were made to 537 articles published in JCR between 1974
 and 1986. The results show that most research appearing in JCR is used and
 that research in the journal has an influence on other disciplines.
 Consumer research, marketing, and psychology were the largest users of
 JCR. Empirical articles have the single largest influence on the
 literature, although review and theory articles have a disproportionate
 influence.

Title: 
 Ignoring Irrelevant Information: Situational Determinants of Consumer Learning.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 325-45
Issue: 3
Volume: 18
Year: 1991
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 Three experiments examined the effects of situational factors on the
 ability to learn simple rules for classifying products and estimating
 prices. In each experiment, multiattribute information about stereo
 speakers was presented to subjects in a training phase. However, only one
 attribute was diagnostic. Analytic processing (i.e., the ability to
 isolate the diagnostic attribute in a subsequent test of product
 knowledge) was measured. Results showed that analytic processing varied
 significantly as a function of memory load, processing goals. type of
 information search, and the relative perceptual salience of product
 attributes. Surprisingly little holistic (i.e., multiattribute) processing
 was observed among nonanalytic subjects. Most of these subjects relied on
 a small subset of attributes, often placing heavy emphasis on a single
 nondiagnostic attribute.

Title: 
 A Critical Appraisal of Demand Artifacts in Consumer Research.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 273-83
Issue: 3
Volume: 18
Year: 1991
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 Especially since the publication of Sawyer's instructive article on the
 topic, consumer researchers have been concerned that demand artifacts
 significantly compromise the validity and generalizability of experimental
 findings. In this article the authors provide an overview of the issues
 surrounding the demand-artifacts controversy, evaluate the preconditions
 for demand artifacts. and offer a critique of suppositions about the
 consequences and appropriate control of demand artifacts. J. Kellaris and
 A. Cox's (1989) critique of G. Gorn's (1982) well-known classical
 conditioning experiments provides the back-drop for much of the
 discussion.

Title: 
 Economic Dimensions of Household Gift Giving.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 368-79
Issue: 3
Volume: 18
Year: 1991
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 The purpose of this research was to explore economic dimensions of a
 consumer gift-giving model. Two dimensions of extrahousehold gift
 expenditures were modeled: the probability of giving and the expected
 value of the corresponding expenditures. Data were from 4,139 households
 in the Quarterly Interview component of the 1984-85 U.S. Continuing
 Consumer Expenditure Survey. The results demonstrated that both the
 probability of giving and the value of annual expenditures for gifts given
 outside the consumer unit are related to total expenditures (a proxy for
 income), family size, life-cycle stage, and education. In addition, the
 probability of gift giving is related to the number of female adults,
 ethnicity, and urbanization, and the value of gift expenditures is related
 to region. Extrahousehold gift expenditures appear to be a luxury--as
 income increases, gift expenditures increase more rapidly.
