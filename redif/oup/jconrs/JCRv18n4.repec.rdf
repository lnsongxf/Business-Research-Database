Title: 
 The Role of Expectancy and Relevancy in Memory for Verbal and Visual Information: What Is Incongruency?

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 475-92
Issue: 4
Volume: 18
Year: 1992
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 Three experiments are presented that investigate the effect of using
 incongruent information to improve the memorability of complex marketing
 communications. The basic premise of the research is that incongruency is
 a multidimensional concept, the components of which may produce
 countervailing effects on memory. Drawing on research in social cognition
 and information processing, a theoretical framework is developed that
 posits two dimensions of incongruency: relevancy and expectancy. Results
 of the research provide empirical support for the framework and suggest
 implications for consumer research and the development of ads.

Title: 
 A Study of Information Search Behavior during the Categorization of New Products.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 452-63
Issue: 4
Volume: 18
Year: 1992
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 Consumers are confronted with hundreds of new products each year, yet
 little is known about how these new products are integrated into existing
 knowledge structures. Depending on the new products similarity or
 dissimilarity to categories stored in memory, consumers information search
 may be influenced. In this study, consumers' information-seeking behavior
 was explored during the categorization of new products that differed in
 varying degrees from preexisting category expectations. Results suggest
 that subjects manage the cognitive effort of search by limiting breadth of
 search. However, an inverted-U relationship exists between discrepancy and
 depth of search. Thus, it appears that, at a moderate level of
 discrepancy, subjects may examine a relevant set of attributes in greater
 depth rather than search for information on a broad range of attributes.
 With high discrepancy, however, it appears that subjects try alternative
 internal strategies rather than search for more information.

Title: 
 State versus Action Orientation and the Theory of Reasoned Action: An Application to Coupon Usage.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 505-18
Issue: 4
Volume: 18
Year: 1992
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 This article investigates how the individual difference variable of state
 versus action orientation moderates the pattern of relationships among
 constructs in the theory of reasoned action. State orientation refers to a
 low capacity for the enactment of action-related mental structures,
 whereas action orientation refers to a high capacity for this type of
 enactment. A field study was conducted in the context of consumers
 self-reported usage of coupons for grocery shopping. The results showed
 that state versus action orientation moderates the relative importance of
 determinants of intentions; specifically subjective norms become more
 important as people become state oriented whereas the relative importance
 of attitudes increases as people become action oriented. In addition, the
 study showed that past behavior is a determinant of intentions to use
 coupons.

Title: 
 A Comparison of Attitudes and Emotions as Predictors of Behavior at Diverse Levels of Behavioral Experience.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 493-504
Issue: 4
Volume: 18
Year: 1992
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 This study examines individuals' reports about emotive experience
 vis-a-vis their attitudinal judgments as predictors of subsequent
 behavior. Hypotheses are developed around the general premise that
 emotional reports tap information with motivational implications that need
 not be integrated into attitude judgments and thus should supplement
 attitude in prediction. The hypotheses are tested with a unique data base
 that allows categorization of subjects on the basis of diverse levels of
 prior experience and features naturally occurring behavior over a 12-month
 period as the criterion variable. The data support the premise that
 emotional variables can serve as incremental predictors in instances in
 which situational pressures may inhibit formation of meaningful attitudes.
 Also, the data suggest that emotional reports may furnish some unique
 information about what perpetuates a behavior. Implications for further
 integration of emotional experience into consumer research are discussed.

Title: 
 Levels of Subjective Comprehension in Advertising Processing and Their Relations to Ad Perceptions, Attitudes, and Memory.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 411-24
Issue: 4
Volume: 18
Year: 1992
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 Two fundamental orientations toward message comprehension have appeared
 in advertising research: the traditional objective view, which applies an
 accuracy criterion to conceptualize and evaluate comprehension, and the
 subjective view, which applies other criteria related to the individual
 comprehender and the actual experience of the message. This article
 develops a framework for four levels of subjective comprehension on the
 basis of an elaboration criterion. Comprehension levels are hypothesized
 to differ in their relations to ad perceptions, attitudes, and memory.
 Results from an empirical study provide initial support for the framework,
 including new theoretical insights and explanatory ability beyond the
 objective orientation. Discussion focuses on implications for advertising
 theory and consumer research.

Title: 
 Selective Recall and Information Use in Consumer Preferences.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 464-74
Issue: 4
Volume: 18
Year: 1992
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 This study investigated the relation between consumers' memory and use of
 information in judging brand preferences. The authors used ads to test
 hypotheses about how pictorial and verbal presentations of previously
 encountered information and the content of subsequently encountered
 information affect recall and information use in shaping brand
 preferences. Even when subjects more easily recalled.pictured attributes
 than verbally described attributes, this picture superiority effect did
 not influence memory-based preferences. In contrast, externally available
 information for an alternative brand influenced both recall and
 preferences. The overall pattern of results suggests that enhancing
 recallability improves the likelihood that consumers will use a piece of
 information to compare brands only if other information is unavailable or
 inadequate.

Title: 
 Feeling and Liking Responses to Television Programs: An Examination of Two Explanations for Media-Context Effects.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 441-51
Issue: 4
Volume: 18
Year: 1992
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 This research empirically examined how the feelings elicited by
 television programs and the liking of television programs affected
 viewers' evaluations of commercials. Subjects' feelings were manipulated
 by viewing a positive, negative, or neutral emotion-eliciting program
 while program liking was controlled statistically. Viewers' liking of
 programs positively influenced attitude toward the ad and attitude toward
 the brand, with the effect on the latter mediated.through the former.
 Feelings elicited by the programs had no effect on these same attitudes.
 The influence of program liking on attitude toward the ad, and
 subsequently on attitude toward the brand, was moderated by both
 commercial involvement and the commercial's position in a sequence of
 commercials.

Title: 
 Item Context and the Stability of Entity-Based and Attribute-Based Multiattribute Scaling Methods.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 536-45
Issue: 4
Volume: 18
Year: 1992
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 Multientity scaling is a multiattribute-measurement procedure that
 obtains simultaneous ratings of two or more entities from a single
 respondent. The purpose of this research is to examine experimentally the
 issue of item-context effects on the stability of two types of multientity
 scaling procedures--attribute-based and entity-based multientity scaling.
 The findings indicate that both procedures may be subject to problems of
 instability when the comparative context of the ratings is changed, with
 attribute-based scaling being characterized.by more instability than
 entity-based scaling. On the basis of the findings, potential methods of
 increasing multientity scaling stability are explored.

Title: 
 Generalizing the Sensitivity Conditions in an Overall Index of Product Quality.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 530-35
Issue: 4
Volume: 18
Year: 1992
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 The issue of the sensitivity of weighted linear composites to
 attribute-importance weights has attracted researchers from various
 disciplines, including marketing, psychology, and statistics. At issue is
 how sensitive a weighted scale is to a particular choice of weights. Scale
 sensitivity is defined by a negative correlation between two scales. By
 considering the general case of "n" attributes and using an algebraic
 approach, the authors specify the precise sufficiency conditions under
 which two scales correlate negatively and thus be sensitive to the weights
 chosen. These sensitive conditions are derived in the context of the
 computation of an overall product-quality scale, which is simply a special
 case of the general multiattribute problem. They illustrate these
 conditions for the case of two quality scales using examples from "Test"
 (1983), a German magazine similar to "Consumer Reports," and from "Places
 Rated Almanac" (1987).

Title: 
 How Does Motivation Moderate the Impact of Central and Peripheral Processing on Brand Attitudes and Intentions?

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 519-29
Issue: 4
Volume: 18
Year: 1992
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 This study examined how motivation moderates the impact of central and
 peripheral processing on the formation of brand attitudes and purchase
 intentions in an advertising pretest setting. The results indicate that
 increasing motivation to evaluate an advertised brand through the
 manipulation of consumer processing goals (1) increases the impact of
 central brand processing on brand attitudes and decreases the impact of a
 peripheral cue on brand attitudes, primarily by influencing the strengths
 of the relations among these constructs rather than by influencing their
 mean levels, (2) has no effect on the impact of the peripheral cue on
 brand cognitions, and (3) increases the impact of brand attitudes on
 purchase intentions by strengthening the attitude-intention relation and
 by increasing brand attitudes directly. The theoretical and practical
 implications of these findings are discussed.

 How Do Young Children Learn to Be Consumers? A Script-Processing Approach.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 425-40
Issue: 4
Volume: 18
Year: 1992
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 The experiments reported in this article examine young children's
 knowledge-acquisition abilities, relative to older children, with the goal
 of identifying how young children learn and then using this understanding
 to design situations in which age differences in learning are eliminated.
 The results indicate that young children are able to acquire knowledge
 equivalent to that of older children when the experimental materials and
 response formats are congruent with their encoding and retrieval
 abilities. Younger children's learning was enhanced by (1) the repetition
 of the same event in an audiovisual format, (2) the presentation of
 somewhat different events in which the goal of the event and the steps
 involved in enacting the event were made salient, and (3) contextual
 response formats that enhanced their retrieval skills.
