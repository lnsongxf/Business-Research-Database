Title: 
 The Influence of Anticipating Regret and Responsibility on Purchase Decisions.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 105-18
Issue: 1
Volume: 19
Year: 1992
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 It is suggested that consumers' choices between alternatives can be
 systematically influenced by asking them to an anticipate the regret and
 responsibility they would feel if they made the wrong decision.
 Specifically, on the basis of the notion that choices of conventional or
 default options are associated with lower regret and responsibility, it is
 proposed that consumers who anticipate how they would feel if they made
 the wrong decision would be more likely to purchase a currently available
 item on sale rather than wait for a better sale and more likely to prefer
 a higher-priced, well-known brand over a less expensive, lesser-known
 brand. These propositions were supported in three studies. The findings
 also suggest that an error caused by selection of a lesser-known,
 lower-priced brand is associated with greater responsibility but less
 regret than an error caused by a choice of a well-known, higher-priced
 brand.

Title: 
 Antecedents and Consequences of Attitude toward the Ad: A Meta-analysis.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 34-51
Issue: 1
Volume: 19
Year: 1992
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 A meta-analysis of pairwise relationships involving attitude toward the
 ad was conducted. Analyses of correlations across studies are first
 analyzed and reported. Because significant variance across studies was
 found, moderator analyses were conducted to account for interstudy
 variance. The results suggest a number of methodological variables that
 moderate the strengths of relationships found in studies of ad attitudes.
 Analyses were also conducted to assess the robustness of the
 dual-mediation path model of the effects of ad attitudes. Results indicate
 support for the model as well as a more important role for the indirect
 influence of ad attitudes on brand attitudes (via brand cognitions) than
 that found in previous model tests.

Title: 
 The Influence of Processing Conversational Information on Inference, Argument Elaboration, and Memory.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 83-92
Issue: 1
Volume: 19
Year: 1992
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 Despite the pervasiveness of conversations as a means of transmitting
 information consumer researchers have not considered the effects of
 conversations on consumers' information processing. This article discusses
 those structural properties of conversation that differentiate it from
 prose and extends literature from the field of communication to develop a
 set of propositions regarding how these structural properties of
 conversation affect consumers inference, argument elaboration, and memory.
 The article concludes with a discussion of possible methods for examining
 the propositions.

Title: 
 Comparing Dynamic Consumer Choice in Real and Computer-Simulated Environments.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 71-82
Issue: 1
Volume: 19
Year: 1992
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 Actual supermarket purchases made by consumers over a seven-month period
 are compared with the choice decisions collected in one sitting in a
 laboratory simulation. The laboratory simulation was designed to mimic the
 original market environment. Although there were systematic biases in
 predictions, of true purchase behavior from the simulated data, the
 "compressed simulations" were reasonably valid in predicting market shares
 and promotion sensitivity for brands across consumers. Coauthors are Bari
 A. Harlam, Barbara E. Kahn, and Leonard M. Lodish.

Title: 
 Does Attitude toward the Ad Endure? The Moderating Effects of Attention and Delay.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 26-33
Issue: 1
Volume: 19
Year: 1992
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 Do the effects of attitude toward the ad on consumer decisions endure
 beyond the scenarios that characterize previous research? In examining
 this question, the authors focus on the persistence of ad-attitude effects
 as a function of the level of attention at encoding and the delay between
 ad exposure and response. The results of an experiment designed to test
 their hypotheses suggest that ad-attitude effects do not persist in a
 number of instances. Over time, as memory for an ad fades, its effects on
 ad attitude dissipate. As a result, the ad-attitude effects on brand
 attitude that are reported in past research disappear after a delay. In
 fact, in certain situations likable ads are shown to have a detrimental
 impact on brand attitude. For instance, when it receives little attention,
 a highly affective ad (compared with a more neutral ad) may focus
 attention away from the brand claims and lead to a lower brand attitude
 after a delay.

Title: 
 An Empirical Analysis of Internal and External Reference Prices Using Scanner Data.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 62-70
Issue: 1
Volume: 19
Year: 1992
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 Single-source yogurt data are used to examine whether both internal and
 external reference prices affect purchase decisions. Internal reference
 prices are memory-resident prices based on actual, fair, or other price
 concepts. External reference prices are observed stimuli, such as "regular
 prices", that stores may display along with a sale price for
 comparability. Discrete choice models with variables representing the two
 types of reference prices are estimated, and both types of variables are
 found to have significant effects on purchase probabilities. This suggests
 that consumers may use multiple reference points in evaluating price in
 purchase decisions. In addition, a model using an indicator of a sale
 price discount explains purchase probabilities as well as one that models
 the actual discount, which suggests that consumers may be reacting to the
 indication of savings rather than to the amount of the discount.

Title: 
 The Value of Time Spent in Price-Comparison Shopping: Survey and Experimental Evidence.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 52-61
Issue: 1
Volume: 19
Year: 1992
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 The value that consumers place on time spent in price-comparison shopping
 is central to the economics of information theory and models of consumers
 search behavior. Yet few empirical studies have examined consumers
 subjective value of time. Building on Gary Becker's work this article
 presents two tests of a model of the subjective value of time. In an
 effort to explain consumers subjective value of time while they are
 price-comparison shopping the model introduces perceived enjoyment of
 shopping as a new explanatory variable. The findings reveal that
 respondents incorporate both wage rates and perceived enjoyment of
 price-comparison shopping into their subjective value of time.

Title: 
 The Influence of Purchase Quantity and Display Format on Consumer Preference for Variety.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 133-38
Issue: 1
Volume: 19
Year: 1992
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 The authors propose that what consumers buy can be systematically
 influenced by how much they buy. They hypothesize that, as the number of
 items purchased in a category on a shopping occasion increases, a consumer
 is more likely to select product variants (e.g. yogurt flavors) that s/he
 does not usually purchase. They used yogurt scanner data to support this
 hypothesis. This study also revealed that consumers were more likely to
 select their regular brands when purchasing more containers of yogurt on a
 given occasion. A laboratory experiment showed that this reflects the
 combined impact of purchase quantity and product-display format (i.e., the
 by-brand display of yogurt in supermarkets) on consumer choice.
