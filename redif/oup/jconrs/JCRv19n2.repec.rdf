Title: 
 A Structural Modeling Approach to the Measurement and Meaning of Cognitive Age.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 292-301
Issue: 2
Volume: 19
Year: 1992
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 This article examines the measurement properties of cognitive age and its
 relationship both to demographic antecedent variables and to
 nondemographic consequential variables through the use of a structural
 modeling framework. Cognitive age is shown to possess unidimensionally and
 to demonstrate acceptable reliability. Cognitively younger "older" women
 manifested higher self-confidence and greater fashion interest, were more
 work oriented, and had greater participation in entertainment and
 culturally related activities. Contrary to the hypothesis, cognitively
 younger women were not more socially involved than their cognitively older
 counterparts.

Title: 
 Knowledge Development and Scientific Status in Consumer-Behavior Research: A Social Exchange Perspective.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 282-91
Issue: 2
Volume: 19
Year: 1992
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 The communication patterns (1977 through 1988) between the JOURNAL OF
 CONSUMER RESEARCH (JCR) and other related disciplines are examined from a
 social exchange perspective. As one way of assessing scientific status, we
 completed a citation analysis to consider both the journals that JCR
 authors cite and the journals that cite JCR. The results reveal that JCR
 performs an important bridging function between the psychology and
 marketing literatures. However, JCR has had considerably less impact on
 other cognate disciplines, in particular those represented by the members
 of its policy board. In general, we find that JCR does appear to be making
 some progress in achieving its goal of becoming an interdisciplinary
 consumer research publication.

Title: 
 On Resonance: A Critical Pluralistic Inquiry into Advertising Rhetoric.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 180-97
Issue: 2
Volume: 19
Year: 1992
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 Print ads exhibit resonance when they combine wordplay with a relevant
 picture to create ambiguity and incongruity. This article uses multiple
 perspectives and methods within a framework of critical pluralism to
 investigate advertising resonance. Semiotic text analyses, a content
 analysis of contemporary magazine ads, two experiments, and
 phenomenological interviews combine to yield insights into the operation,
 prevalence, impact and experience of resonance. Specifically, the two
 experiments show that manipulation of resonance produces positive
 treatment effects in three domains: liking for the ad, brand attitude, and
 unaided recall of ad headlines. These effects appear contingent of
 subjects' successful decoding of resonance and their tolerance for
 ambiguity (an individual difference variable). Implications for future
 research on resonance and for the use of critical pluralism in consumer
 advertising research are discussed.

Title: 
 The Consciousness of Addiction: Toward a General Theory of Compulsive Consumption.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 155-79
Issue: 2
Volume: 19
Year: 1992
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 This article reviews and integrates recent theories of addiction drawn
 from a diverse set of disciplines--consumer behavior, medicine, sociology,
 psychiatry, and psychology--to provide a comprehensive framework for
 understanding the etiology of addiction and other compulsive consumer
 behaviors. Interpretive material from personal interviews with addicted
 and nonaddicted drug users is then used to illustrate the consciousness of
 addictive consumption. Two a priori themes--serial/simultaneous addictions
 and personal crises/role transitions--and five emergent themes--relapse,
 deception, dysfunctional families, suicide, and boundaries--are discussed.

Title: 
 Some Effects of Schematic Processing on Consumer Expectations and Disconfirmation Judgments.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 240-55
Issue: 2
Volume: 19
Year: 1992
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 Recent research has shown that processing based on the product-category
 schemas of consumers can influence the manner in which consumers evaluate
 products. This article presents a series of studies that explore how
 processing based on such schemas interacts with consumer expectations
 prior to the trial of a new product and influences disconfirmation
 judgments and product evaluations following the trial. An initial study
 finds that, when attributes included in the description of a new product
 are very discrepant from a prior category schema, consumers may switch
 schemas in forming pretrial expectations. A second study finds that more
 negative product evaluations following the trial may result when
 consumers' experience with a product during the trial is very different
 from schema expectations, compared with the situation in which the product
 matches schema expectations. A third study demonstrates that
 disconfirmation judgments and post-trial evaluations may occur through
 processing at the product-category schema level, rather than through
 processing at the product attribute level.

Title: 
 Hypothesized and Confounded Explanations in Theory Tests: A Bayesian Analysis.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 139-54
Issue: 2
Volume: 19
Year: 1992
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 Traditional views of research methodology hold that little, if any,
 useful information can be obtained from one or more confounded studies,
 unless the results from one study rule out or falsify an alternative
 explanation from a previous study. We present a Bayesian analysis of
 hypothesis testing to model knowledge accumulation from a series of
 confounded or unconfounded experiments. By applying this Bayesian
 analysis, we find that a hypothesis can receive support from a study with
 known flaws. Our analysis also implies that the status of an explanation
 is independent of whether it was proposed a priori or post hoc.

Title: 
 The Influence of Familial and Peer-Based Reference Groups on Consumer Decisions.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 198-211
Issue: 2
Volume: 19
Year: 1992
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 A replication and extension of a study performed by Bearden and Etzel are
 reported in this article. The influence of peers on individuals' products
 and brand decisions for products that range in their degree of
 conspicuousness is examined for comparable samples in the United States
 and in Thailand to assess the validity of the original framework over time
 and across cultural contexts. Further, the influence of the family is
 addressed through an examination of intergenerational influences across
 the two cultures. The results of the study lend support to the original
 theoretical approach and also provide insight into how reference-group
 influence may vary depending on whether the influence is exercised by a
 member of a peer group or by a family member.

Title: 
 Peripheral Persuasion and Brand Choice.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 226-39
Issue: 2
Volume: 19
Year: 1992
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 Although the impact of peripheral advertising cues on postcommunication
 attitudes has received considerable attention in the research literature,
 less consideration has been given to whether such persuasion affects
 behavior. This research examines the potential for peripheral persuasion
 to influence brand choice as a function of the degree of differentiation
 among choice alternatives. The results from three experiments show that
 peripheral advertising cues can affect brand choice but that the extent of
 this influence depends on the particular brand-relevant information
 available at the time of choice. These findings substantiate the
 usefulness of peripheral persuasion tactics for modifying consumer choice.

Title: 
 The Effect of Prior Knowledge on Price Acceptability and the Type of Information Examined.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 256-70
Issue: 2
Volume: 19
Year: 1992
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 This article assesses whether differences in prior knowledge result in
 differences in (1) price acceptability and (2) the extent to which
 different types of information are examined. Using a personal
 computer-based methodology, subjects who varied in their prior product
 knowledge provided price responses, and the time they spent examining
 various kinds of information was measured. Acceptable price-range and
 points (price limits) were found to be lowest for low-knowledge subjects.
 Further, the extent to which price and related extrinsic information was
 examined was found to be lowest for moderatly knowledgeable subjects.
 Results from a second study provide substantive support for the claim that
 increasing prior knowledge is accompanied by an increase in both limits of
 the acceptable price range.

Title: 
 The Ecological Validity of Photographic Slides and Videotapes in Simulating the Service Setting.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 271-81
Issue: 2
Volume: 19
Year: 1992
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 In the study of consumers' evaluation of the service setting, laboratory
 experiments using environmental simulations provide researchers with a
 level of control that can otherwise be difficult to achieve in field
 studies. This article demonstrates that photographic slides and
 videotapes, used as environmental simulations in testing a theory of
 crowding, have ecological validity. The same theoretical model is tested
 with data obtained from a field quasi-experimental study and with data
 from a laboratory study that used photographic slides and videotapes to
 simulate the service setting. Conditions that may constrain the
 applications of various kinds of environmental simulations in consumer
 research on services are also discussed.

Title: 
 Low-Involvement Learning: Memory without Evaluation.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 212-25
Issue: 2
Volume: 19
Year: 1992
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 In three learning experiments we examined how subjects' level of
 involvement during initial exposure to consumer trivia influences what
 they learn and what they subsequently come to believe. Subjects rated
 consumer trivia statements as more true when they had been exposed to
 those statements earlier in the experiment. Simple repetition increased
 subsequent truth ratings. Moreover, when subjects processed the
 information during initial exposure in a less involving fashion, the
 effect of repetition on truth became more pronounced. Familiarity emerged
 as a key mediator of the truth effect. When subjects experienced an "it
 rings a bell" reaction, they judged the information to be more true.
 Finally, under low-involvement processing, the truth effect increased when
 subjects engaged in a processing task (rote rehearsal) that increased
 familiarity without increasing evaluative processing of the information.
