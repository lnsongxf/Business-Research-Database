Title: 
 Price Premium Variations as a Consequence of Buyers' Lack of Information.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 412-23
Issue: 3
Volume: 19
Year: 1992
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 It appears that buyers sometimes knowingly pay a price that is higher
 than that justified by the relative quality of the product. Such a price
 premium is argued to be an economically rational attempt by
 quality-conscious buyers to ensure that the seller does not provide a
 lower than promised level of quality for experience products. Conversely,
 for search products, price premiums are argued to be the consequence of
 lack of search by buyers who are less quality conscious. Results from a
 survey conducted in an organizational buying setting indicate that buyers'
 tendency to pay a price premium for experience products increases with an
 increase in their quality consciousness, while for search products this
 tendency decreases with an increase in their quality consciousness. The
 implications of this finding are discussed; further analysis leads to
 additional speculation regarding some other mechanisms that buyers may use
 to assure product quality.

Title: 
 A Meaning-Based Model of Advertising Experiences.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 317-38
Issue: 3
Volume: 19
Year: 1992
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 This article adopts and extends a meaning-based approach to advertising.
 We emphasize the consumer's perspective and seek to address important
 factors that motivate and shape actualized advertising meanings. A graphic
 model is delineated that focuses on consumers' life themes (e.g., being
 true vs. being false) and life projects (e.g., what it means to be an
 educator). The model is assessed through a phenomenological inquiry into
 the life stories of three individuals and their respective experiences of
 contemporary magazine advertisements. Findings corroborate the proposition
 that many actualized ad meanings are a function of the consumer's salient
 life projects as conjoined by life themes. Discussion focuses on the
 implications for advertising theory and consumer research.

Title: 
 An Examination of the Use of Unacceptable Levels in Conjoint Analysis.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 470-76
Issue: 3
Volume: 19
Year: 1992
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 Unacceptable levels in conjoint analysis are studied using both a full
 profile method and Sawtooth Software's Adaptive Conjoint Analysis. The
 utility of an unacceptable level was set equal to a value that would have
 been assigned if the unacceptable levels question was not asked, but the
 respondent treated that level as unacceptable. With ADA, this resulted in
 a model with (a) superior predictive power relative to a model that
 eliminates alternatives with unacceptable levels and (b) equivalent
 predictive power to a compensatory model that does not consider
 unacceptable levels. Furthermore, in this application, this was
 accomplished even though the respondent was presented with approximately
 30 percent fewer paired comparison observations.

Title: 
 When Timing Matters: The Influence of Temporal Distance on Consumers' Affective and Persuasive Responses.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 424-33
Issue: 3
Volume: 19
Year: 1992
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 Existing theorizing suggests that consumers should experience more
 intense affective reactions when a positive outcome is missed (short
 temporal distance) than when its occurrence is relatively remote (long
 temporal distance). Two studies are reported that explore why and when
 these effects occur and whether they also occur for persuasion responses.
 The findings indicate that this effect is likely to occur and influence
 persuasion only when people's involvement with the message issue is low
 rather than high. This observation together with findings obtained on a
 thought-listing task provide evidence that variations in temporal distance
 seem to operate by altering people's motivation to scrutinize a situation
 and evoke thoughts about alternative outcomes that might have been.

Title: 
 Moving Possessions: An Analysis Based on Personal Documents from the 1847-1869 Mormon Migration.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 339-61
Issue: 3
Volume: 19
Year: 1992
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 Possessions may be a burden to nomadic people of the present and past,
 but for those moving to more permanent dwellings, possessions offer a
 means to shed, transport, or create meanings across locales. Mormon
 pioneer diaries and other historical personal documents are used to assess
 the meanings and importance of the possessions these pioneers brought on
 their journey. Computer-assisted qualitative analyses of these documents
 suggest five major categories of possession symbolism: (1) sacred
 meanings, (2) material meanings, (3) personal meanings, (4) familial
 meanings, and (5) communal meanings. Within some of these categories of
 meaning there are notable differences between men and women. Even though
 the present findings are based on a particular group and time period, it
 seems likely that these types of symbolic possession meanings are also to
 be found in other moves.

Title: 
 A Consumer Values Orientation for Materialism and Its Measurement: Scale Development and Validation.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 303-16
Issue: 3
Volume: 19
Year: 1992
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 This article reviews the construct and measurement of materialism and
 concludes that materialism is appropriately conceptualized as a consumer
 value. The development of a values-oriented materialism scale with three
 components--acquisition centrality, acquisition as the pursuit of
 happiness, and possession-defined success--is described. In validation
 tests high scorers (compared with low scores) desired a higher level of
 income, place greater emphasis on financial security and less on
 interpersonal relationships, preferred to spend more on themselves and
 less on others, engaged in fewer voluntary simplicity behaviors, and were
 less satisfied with their lives.

Title: 
 An Investigation into the Social Context of Early Adoption Behavior.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 477-86
Issue: 3
Volume: 19
Year: 1992
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 The social context of new product adoption behavior is a key aspect of
 the diffusion of innovations. Yet little is known about the process by
 which social contextual factors influence individual adoption decisions.
 This research develops and tests a model of the effects of perceived
 consumption visibility and superorder group influence on new product
 intention formation. A structural equation model is used in an
 experimental design to provide a comprehensive view of variable interval
 and to incorporate measurement error. Key findings indicate that (1)
 perceived visibility of consumption significantly affects consumers'
 predictions of normative outcomes (i.e., social approval from referents)
 and (2) superorder group influence has a direct effect on consumers'
 perceptions of consumption visibility and expectations of both personal
 (i.e., intrinsically valued product benefits) and normative outcomes from
 early adoption. The results have important implications for understanding
 the role of consumption symbols as mechanisms for social differentiation
 and integration.

Title: 
 The Consumption of Performance.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 362-72
Issue: 3
Volume: 19
Year: 1992
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 This article develops a vocabulary to describe the management of
 performance and the nature of consumer judgments of staged performance
 quality. It distinguishes three kinds of performance--contractual,
 enacted, and dramatistic. While all marketing actions are by nature
 dramatistic, this article explores how marketing can obscure the traces of
 dramatism by reframing the performance as contractual or enacted.
 Alternatively, marketing may seek to emphasize a performance's dramatistic
 character, selecting among skill, show, thrill, or festive frames. I apply
 this framework to examine the issue of the quality of performances.

Title: 
 A Clinical Screener for Compulsive Buying.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 459-69
Issue: 3
Volume: 19
Year: 1992
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 Advancements in understanding problematic behaviors require the ability
 to identify affected or at-risk individuals. This article reports the
 development of a scale to identify compulsive buyers. Seven items
 representing specific behaviors, motivations, and feelings associated with
 buying significantly contributed to correctly classifying approximately 88
 percent of the subjects. Evidence indicates this screening scale is
 undimmed and possesses good reliability. Validity is demonstrated by
 comparing members of a general consumer sample who are identified as
 compulsive buyers by the screener with self-identified compulsive buyers
 and noncompulsoriness consumers on several established correlates and
 outcomes of compulsive buying. Evidence of external validity using a
 separate sample is also presented.

Title: 
 The Role of Optimum Stimulation Level in Exploratory Consumer Behavior.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 434-48
Issue: 3
Volume: 19
Year: 1992
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 This study examines the role of optimum stimulation level (SOL) in
 exploratory consumer behavior. The concept of SOL and its measurement are
 discussed, and the literature on exploratory consumer tendencies and their
 relationship with SOL is reviewed. Hypotheses are developed concerning the
 relationship between SOL and cognitive responses to ads, ad repetition,
 information search, variety seeking, decision making under risk, gambling,
 and innovative behavior, and these hypotheses are investigated in a series
 of experiments. Four well-known instruments are used to measure people's
 characteristic preference for stimulation, and SOL is operationally as a
 weighted composite of a person's score on these scales. The results of the
 study indicate that consumers' SOL is systematically related to
 curiosity-motivated consumer behaviors, variety seeking, and risk taking.

Title: 
 Tactile Stimulation and Consumer Response.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 449-58
Issue: 3
Volume: 19
Year: 1992
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 Tactile behavior is a basic communication form as well as an expression
 of interpersonal involvement. This article presents three studies offering
 evidence for the positive role of casual interpersonal touch on consumer
 behavior. More specifically, it provides initial support for the view that
 tactile stimulation in various consumer behavior situations enhances the
 positive feeling for and evaluation of both the external stimuli and the
 touching source. Further, customers touched by a requester tend to comply
 more than customers in no-touch conditions. Implications for consumer
 behavior theory and research are discussed.
