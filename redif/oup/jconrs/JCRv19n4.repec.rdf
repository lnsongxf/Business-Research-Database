Title: 
 Caution in the Use of Difference Scores in Consumer Research.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 655-62
Issue: 4
Volume: 19
Year: 1993
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 This article illustrates the common use of difference scores in consumer
 research and discusses a number of potential problems with using them.
 Difference scores often have problems in the areas of reliability, discus
 validity, spurious correlations, and variance restriction. The article
 concludes that difference scores should generally not be used in consumer
 research and offers alternatives that overcome their limitations.

Title: 
 Assessing the Cross-National Applicability of Consumer Behavior Models: A Model of Attitude toward Advertising in General.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 626-36
Issue: 4
Volume: 19
Year: 1993
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 Examining the cross-national applicability of consumer behavior
 constructs and models is becoming increasingly more important. In this
 study, procedures for testing the cross-national applicability of models
 are illustrated. Specifically, the authors specify a model of attitude
 toward advertising in general and test its cross-national applicability
 with data from the United States, New Zealand, Denmark, Greece and India.
 The results suggest that the relationships proposed in the model are
 applicable and similar in strength across the five countries.

Title: 
 Historical Method in Consumer Research: Developing Causal Explanations of Change.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 595-610
Issue: 4
Volume: 19
Year: 1993
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 Historical research provides a qualitative interpretive method uniquely
 formulated to explain the causes of change through time. As such, it
 offers considerable potential for expanding our current understanding of
 inherently dynamic and volatile consumer phenomena. Despite recent
 interest in interpretive approaches among consumer researchers, the
 historical consumer behavior literature reveals that this method's
 potential has not been fully realized. We argue that this underutilization
 derives from the absence of a full explication of history's methodological
 assumptions and requirements, which are substantially different from those
 that have traditionally dominated consumer research. We address this
 problem by providing a conceptual and methodological review of historical
 research methods and by demonstrating the application of historical method
 to the study of change in consumer behavior.

Title: 
 Feminist Thought: Implications for Consumer Research.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 518-36
Issue: 4
Volume: 19
Year: 1993
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 This article applies three distinct feminist perspectives to critique
 scientific objectivity, and the problematic, theories, methods of data
 collection, and methods of data analysis in consumer research. Each
 feminist perspective helps heighten sensitivity to gender biases in
 current research and offers insights on new directions for consumer
 scholarship.

Title: 
 Feminist Literary Criticism and the Deconstruction of Ads: A Postmodern View of Advertising and Consumer Responses.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 556-66
Issue: 4
Volume: 19
Year: 1993
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 This article examines test and consumer responses from the perspective of
 post-modern feminist literary criticism. It uses a feminist framework to
 incorporate the issues of advertising as gendered text and consumer
 responses as gendered readings into consumer research. The article begins
 with a brief background discussion of feminist literary theory to
 introduce the concept of gendered text and to set forth the "reading"
 methodology developed to identify it. Next, this method is demonstrated in
 a feminist reading of two advertising figures--the Marlboro Man and the
 Dakota Woman. Then, the article presents a feminist perspective on
 gendered reading--different male and female reading styles relevant to
 consumers and ads. Last, ideas about gendered texts and readers are
 integrated into ongoing consumer research on attitude toward the ad,
 inference, and empathy.

 Ideology in Consumer Research, 1980 and 1990: A Marxist and Feminist Critique.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 537-55
Issue: 4
Volume: 19
Year: 1993
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 This article presents textual evidence drawn from the 1980 and 1990
 volumes of the Journal of Consumer Research (NCR) to demonstrate the
 dominance of masculine ideology in consumer research. Through both Marxist
 and feminist perspectives, it argues for the recognition and inclusion of
 previously muted voices and invisible constituencies, especially those of
 groups currently excluded from achieving social and economic equality.

 A Longitudinal Study of Product Form Innovation: The Interaction between Predispositions and Social Messages.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 611-25
Issue: 4
Volume: 19
Year: 1993
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 In this article we simplify and apply our 1978 contingency model of
 adoption, in the simplified model, an individual's predisposition to
 innovate is modified by socially transmitted messages about the
 innovation, as well as by other situation specific factors. This model is
 used to make predictions about the future behavior of a sample of
 consumers that are tested with data collected during the diffusion of six
 innovations. While our findings support the model, especially with respect
 to the role of innovative individuals, they also demonstrate the need to
 develop explanations of rejection.

Title: 
 Female Labor Force Participation and Time-Saving Household Technology: A Case Study of the Microwave from 1978 to 1989.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 567-79
Issue: 4
Volume: 19
Year: 1993
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 American households are facing severe time constraints as women increase
 their participation in the wage economy. The implications of this
 situation for the adoption of time-saving technology in the home are not
 well understood. Previous research suggest several scenarios regarding the
 consequences of female labor force participation for the purchase of
 time-saving technology: (1) there may be no effect, (2) female labor force
 participation may have a direct effect, (3) female labor force
 participation may have an indirect effect through income, or (4) direct
 effects emerge over time. This article evaluates these hypotheses with a
 case study of the microwave oven, through proprietary cross-sectional
 surveys of married-couple households conducted from 1978 to 1989.

Title: 
 Toward a Theory of Agenda Setting in Negotiations.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 637-54
Issue: 4
Volume: 19
Year: 1993
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 To date, negotiation research in two-party situations has largely focused
 on single issues or on multiple issues bargained simultaneously. In this
 paper, we develop from a behavioral perspective, a conceptual framework
 and an associated set of propositions concerning the influence and
 interaction of a number of factors on agenda setting. We examine the
 consequences of negotiating multiple issues sequentially as opposed to
 discussing them simultaneously. Specifically, we posit (a) conditions
 under which sequential versus simultaneous negotiations are advantageous,
 (b) conditions that promote and inhibit integrative agreements between
 parties involved in sequential negotiations, and (c) conditions that
 foster greater utility and timeliness to the negotiating parties. In
 addition, directions for future research and methodological guidelines for
 testing the propositions are discussed.

Title: 
 A Conceptual and Empirical Comparison of Alternative Household Life Cycle Models.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 580-94
Issue: 4
Volume: 19
Year: 1993
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 In this article we conceptually and empirically compare a number of
 alternative family life cycle models, ranging from traditional to
 "modernized." These comparisons evaluate each model's ability to identify
 homogeneous categories, maximize between-group variation, classify nearly
 all households, and result in a reasonably small number of sufficient size
 categories. Our empirical comparisons consist of a number of between- and
 within-category a priori contrasts related to these criteria, as well as
 overall tests of each model's ability to capture attitudinal, leisure
 activity, and consumption differences. While the model of M. C. Lilly and
 B. M. Enis outperformed other models overall, we suggest potential
 modifications based on our a priori comparison findings. We also provide
 recommendations for future research to determine how to best incorporate
 nontraditional family forms.

 Discovery-Oriented Consumer Research.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 489-504
Issue: 4
Volume: 19
Year: 1993
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 The Journal of Consumer Research and the Association for Consumer
 Research initiated a new discipline, intended to embrace divergent topics,
 methods, concepts, data, motives, partners, and ideas. Over the years,
 that vision has faded. Now the discipline faces inward, toward a narrower
 range of issues, and away from the real world. Five guidelines seek to
 redirect the discipline toward its original goals. These guidelines
 advocate wider horizons, a larger audience, a different talent mix, more
 emphasis on discover, more attention to consumers, and more single-minded
 dedication to meaningful results.
