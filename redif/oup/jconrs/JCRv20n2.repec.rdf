Title: 
 A Model of Consumers' Preventive Health Behaviors: The Role of Health Motivation and Health Ability.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 208-28
Issue: 2
Volume: 20
Year: 1993
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 This article develops and tests a model of the individual and joint
 effects of various consumer characteristics on health information
 acquisition behaviors (e.g., using media sources) and health maintenance
 behaviors (e.g., restricting diet). Theory development overviews the
 interdisciplinary literature on health and proposes that health motivation
 independently influences consumers' preventive health behaviors while the
 effect of health ability on health behaviors is moderated by the level of
 health motivation. This theory is tested in a survey of 404 consumers.
 Results indicate that the interaction of health ability and health
 motivation affects consumers' health behaviors. However, mixed results
 suggest that high levels of ability and motivation are not always critical
 precursors of health behaviors; instead, the impact of these
 characteristics depends on the particular health behavior and the specific
 health ability characteristic. Implications for theory and practice are
 discussed.

Title: 
 The Influence of Classical Conditioning Procedures on Subsequent Attention to the Conditioned Brand.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 171-89
Issue: 2
Volume: 20
Year: 1993
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 Three experiments are used to investigate the influence of conditioning
 procedures on attention to a conditioned stimulus. In experiment 1, scenes
 presented in a sequence that is consistent with prescribed conditioning
 procedures are shown to encourage attention to the advertised brands in
 subsequent product displays. Experiment 2 suggests that differential
 attention to conditioned brands can be attributed to the signaling
 properties the brand acquires as a consequence of conditioning. Evidence
 from a third experiment raises the possibility that semantic conditioning
 may be responsible for the effects observed in experiments 1 and 2. The
 findings suggest that current prescriptions on the use of conditioning
 procedures may need to be updated.

Title: 
 The Effects of Argument Structure and Affective Tagging on Product Attitude Formation.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 294-302
Issue: 2
Volume: 20
Year: 1993
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 How do structural and affective elements in a persuasive message
 influence consumers' product beliefs and attitudes? In this article, we
 examine how the logical structure of arguments (provided through warrants)
 influences consumers' beliefs about product claims. Next, we examine how
 explicit statements about product claim desirability (provided through
 affective tag sentences) influence product attitude. Our results show that
 argument structure has a strong effect on consumers' beliefs. More
 important, our results suggest that consumers' product attitudes are based
 on their beliefs about product claims, but only when the desirability of
 those claims is made explicit.

Title: 
 Young Children's Processing of a Televised Narrative: Is a Picture Really Worth a Thousand Words?

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 281-93
Issue: 2
Volume: 20
Year: 1993
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 This article examines why young children often exhibit superior knowledge
 acquisition when televised information is presented in an audiovisual
 format than when an audio mode of transmission is used. The results
 indicate that an audio televised presentation promotes learning equivalent
 to that of an audiovisual presentation when the audio transmission
 facilitates both the learning of individual acts or items and the learning
 of the causal and temporal connections between these acts. In addition,
 knowledge acquisition differences between older and younger children for
 audio televised information are eliminated when both types of learning are
 facilitated.

Title: 
 Goal-Oriented Experiences and the Development of Knowledge.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 190-207
Issue: 2
Volume: 20
Year: 1993
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 This research investigates the learning that occurs throughout several
 information acquisition and choice experiences. The effects of three
 factors that may naturally vary in consumer experiences are studied: a
 consumer's goals, how much the consumer knows about the product's features
 prior to information acquisition and choice, and the content of feedback
 received after choice. Results show that the information consumers learn
 is organized in memory around the goal(s) that drives the experiences.
 Further, higher levels of prior feature knowledge result in more accurate
 knowledge after experience, but, contrary to predictions, subjects with no
 prior feature knowledge are quite adept at focusing on their goal in the
 choice process and learning goal-appropriate information. The presence of
 feedback and its consistency with a consumer's goal are also shown to
 affect the goal orientation and organization of brand and feature
 knowledge gained during choice experiences.

Title: 
 The Effects of Mood, Involvement, and Quality of Store Experience on Shopping Intentions.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 271-80
Issue: 2
Volume: 20
Year: 1993
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 This article proposes that consumer mood, involvement level, and the
 quality of the shopping experience have significant effects on shopping
 intentions. Results from a laboratory experiment reveal that mood
 interacts with involvement and shopping experience. Involved subjects are
 found to magnify their evaluations of the shopping experience, subjects in
 good moods evaluate good experiences still better, and a bad shopping
 experience appears to cause mood-protection mechanisms to fail. Finally,
 consumer mood is shown to be affected by a bad shopping experience.

Title: 
 Interpreting Interactions: Raw Means or Residual Means?

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 330-38
Issue: 2
Volume: 20
Year: 1993
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 Interpreting interactions is important in analyzing data generated by the
 NOVA family of techniques. In this article, we examine how to specify the
 cell means used to describe an interaction. Although most researchers
 utilize the raw means that are the output of most analysis packages, R.
 Rosenthal and R. L. Rosnow suggest an alternative procedure, removing the
 treatment effects (and possibly the grand means) from the group means and
 then examining the interaction in isolation. We examine why and under what
 circumstances it is appropriate to use residual means to examine
 interactions. How the use of raw means versus residual means affects
 interpreting interactions is examined in the context of a demonstration
 experiment. After that, a procedure for interpreting interactions is
 presented.

Title: 
 Gift Selection for Easy and Difficult Recipients: A Social Roles Interpretation.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 229-44
Issue: 2
Volume: 20
Year: 1993
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 Using interpretive techniques, we explore the meaning underlying
 Christmas shoppers' description of some recipients as "easy" or
 "difficult," in terms of gift selection. We argue that recipients are
 described as such because they either help or hinder givers' attempts to
 express specific social roles through exchange. We identify six such roles
 that givers express alone or in combination to each recipient on their
 gift lists. These are the pleaser, the provider, the compensator, the
 socializer, the acknowledger, and the avoider. We discuss the implications
 of our findings and suggest areas worthy of further research.
