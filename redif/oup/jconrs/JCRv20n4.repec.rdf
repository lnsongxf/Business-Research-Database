Title: 
 Consumers and Their Animal Companions.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 616-32
Issue: 4
Volume: 20
Year: 1994
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 Despite the widespread practice of keeping companion animals, virtually
 no consumer behavior studies have been conducted on this phenomenon. The
 present inquiry uses detailed depth interviews with consumers to expand
 three a priori themes--animals as friends, animals as self, and animals as
 family members--and to discuss two emergent themes: (1) companion animals'
 mediation between nature and culture, and (2) the socialization of
 consumers' companion animal preference patterns. Building on this
 knowledge, several directions for future research on companion animals are
 discussed.

Title: 
 Inductive Inference and Replications: A Bayesian Perspective.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 633-43
Issue: 4
Volume: 20
Year: 1994
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 A probabilistic model is proposed to assess the value of replications.
 The corroboration of a theory is shown to be a function of the number of
 replications, the number of successful outcomes, and our initial beliefs.
 An adaptive control model provides the optimal policy for continuing
 replications, given the accumulated evidence for the theory, the precision
 deemed necessary, and the cost of replicating.

Title: 
 Spokesperson Fame and Vividness Effects in the Context of Issue-Relevant Thinking: The Moderating Role of Competitive Setting.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 520-34
Issue: 4
Volume: 20
Year: 1994
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 Primarily on the basis of research from noncompetitive settings, it is
 generally believed that nonsubstantive advertising features are
 ineffective when consumers engage in issue-relevant thinking. Experiment 1
 of the current study replicated prior research. Neither spokesperson fame
 nor the vividness of advertising copy influenced attitudes in
 noncompetitive settings. However, these same features proved effective in
 the context of balanced competition. When brands were homogenous
 (experiment 2), or characterized by large price-quality trade-offs
 (experiment 3), nonsubstantive features improved attitudes and choice
 probabilities despite issue-relevant thinking. When trade-offs were small,
 however, nonsubstantive features were again ineffective. The results
 suggest that balanced competition can neutralize the effects of
 substantive features, increase indecision, and promote perceptual
 contrast. These effects then empower nonsubstantive features to serve as
 heuristics and/or reduce the risk of postpreference regret.

Title: 
 The Impact of Airbag Adoption on Relative Personal Injury and Absolute Collision Insurance Claims.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 657-62
Issue: 4
Volume: 20
Year: 1994
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 This article examines the impact of airbag adoption on the relative
 injury and absolute collision loss data experiences of automotive vehicle
 lines. The data set consists of every automobile model for which overall
 injury data was published by the Highway Loss Data Institute (HLD) for the
 1989-1991 model years. The empirical analysis in the article indicates
 that both relative injury and absolute collision losses are never
 mitigated and usually worsen significantly for airbag-equipped cars
 relative to belt-only equipped models after airbag adoption. These results
 are consistent both with the Peltzman hypothesis of driver behavioral
 changes and at-risk consumers' shifting preference for airbag-equipped
 models.

Title: 
 An Integrative Framework for Understanding Two-Sided Persuasion.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 561-74
Issue: 4
Volume: 20
Year: 1994
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 This article develops a framework that encompasses past two-sided
 persuasion research and incorporates additional theory and research on
 optimal arousal and attitude toward the ad to provide explanations for
 inconsistencies in previous findings. In particular, explanations are
 provided for the following: (1) when credibility gains will be enhanced,
 (2) when refutation is needed, (3) how the message should be structured
 (in terms of amount and placement of negative information), and (4) what
 types of attributes should be discounted (in terms of importance, type,
 and correlation with other attributes). In addition, directions for future
 research are discussed.

Title: 
 The Effects of Multiple Product Endorsements by Celebrities on Consumers' Attitudes and Intentions.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 535-47
Issue: 4
Volume: 20
Year: 1994
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 This research investigated the effects of number of products endorsed by
 a celebrity and number of exposures to the celebrity on consumers'
 attitudes and purchase intentions. In study 1, using print ads as the
 stimuli, the results revealed that, as the number of products endorsed
 increases consumers' perceptions of celebrity credibility, celebrity
 likability and attitude toward the ad become less favorable. These results
 were independent of the number of exposures to the celebrity. Study 2
 explored underlying attribution processes associated with consumers'
 perceptions of multiple product endorsers using depth interviews. The
 findings are discussed from attribution and repetition theory
 perspectives.

Title: 
 Work and/or Fun: Measuring Hedonic and Utilitarian Shopping Value.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 644-56
Issue: 4
Volume: 20
Year: 1994
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 Consumer researchers' growing interest in consumer experiences has
 revealed that many consumption activities produce both hedonic and
 utilitarian outcomes. Thus, there is an increasing need for scales to
 assess consumer perceptions of both hedonic and utilitarian values. This
 article describes the development of a scale measuring both values
 obtained from the pervasive consumption experience of shopping. The
 authors develop and validate the scale using a multistep process. The
 results demonstrate that distinct hedonic and utilitarian shopping value
 dimensions exist and are related to a number of important consumption
 variables. Implications for further applications of the scale are
 discussed.

Title: 
 The Role of Labeling Processes in Elderly Consumers' Responses to Age Segmentation Cues.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 503-19
Issue: 4
Volume: 20
Year: 1994
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 This investigation explores labeling processes underlying age
 segmentation cue effects on discount usage intentions. Depth interviews
 regarding participants' experiences using senior-citizen-type discounts
 reveal three levels of responsiveness to consumer offerings promoted with
 age segmentation cues: rejecting senior citizen discounts to avoid
 self-devaluation, rejecting senior citizen discounts to avoid
 stigmatization, and assigning positive meanings to the status that
 promotes senior citizen discount usage. An experimental investigation,
 undertaken to assess the sequential ordering of these levels of
 responsiveness, reveals that self-devaluation and perceived stigma mediate
 age segmentation cue effects on discount usage intention only for
 younger-aged elderly. Results lend support for a stage model of consumers'
 progression through phases of responsiveness to "senior citizen" labeling.

Title: 
 Comparing Consumers' Recall of Prepurchase and Postpurchase Product Evaluation Experiences.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 548-60
Issue: 4
Volume: 20
Year: 1994
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 This study explores the phenomenon of postpurchase product evaluations
 primarily by comparing consumers' recalled postpurchase evaluation
 experiences with the recalled prepurchase evaluation experiences. Personal
 interviews and retrospective verbalizations were employed so that
 respondents could describe the phenomena in their own experiences and
 words. A secondary comparison was also made between consumers'
 postpurchase evaluation experiences in general versus those specifically
 cued by the terms "satisfaction" and "dissatisfaction." While some
 similarities exist, the results show important differences between
 respondents postpurchase thoughts versus those from both prepurchase and
 satisfaction. Significant implications of these results for theory,
 measurement, and future research are discussed.

Title: 
 Process Tracing of Emotional Responses to TV Ads: Revisiting the Warmth Monitor.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 586-600
Issue: 4
Volume: 20
Year: 1994
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 Because of the transient nature of some emotions stimulated during TV
 commercials, measurement of emotional reactions at various points during
 an ad requires process tracing. This research discusses the analysis of
 process-tracing data using the Warmth Monitor as an illustration. We show
 that the establishment of the reliability and validity of process-tracing
 measures hinges on a suitable choice of the relevant domain of
 (co)variance in the data. The Warmth Monitor is shown to provide a
 reliable measure of warmth, but questions remain regarding the construct's
 meaning and valid measurement.

 Classical and Vignette Television Advertising Dramas: Structural Models, Formal Analysis, and Comsumer Effects.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 601-15
Issue: 4
Volume: 20
Year: 1994
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 This article identifies and analyzes two types of television advertising
 dramas: classical and vignette. Drama criticism in theater, film and
 television is the source used to identify the elements of advertising
 dramas--narration, plot, story, and character--and to propose models of
 the two different types. The two models are employed in an empirical
 analysis of an advertising sample. Consumer effects of classical and
 vignette dramas are proposed in terms of the attribution theory of
 persuasion and the elicitation of empathy versus sympathy responses.
