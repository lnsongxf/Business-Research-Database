Title: 
 Adolescent Skepticism toward TV Advertising and Knowledge of Advertiser Tactics.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 165-75
Issue: 1
Volume: 21
Year: 1994
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 A longitudinal study of middle school students examined adolescents'
 skepticism toward advertising and their beliefs about the persuasive
 tactics advertisers employ. Comparisons across grade levels and over the
 course of the school year indicated that knowledge about advertiser
 tactics developed in the direction of adult understanding. Skeptical
 attitudes toward advertisers' motives showed no differences across grade
 levels; however, students generally became more disbelieving of
 advertising claims as the school year progressed. The level of skepticism
 toward advertising was high and was positively related to having a more
 adult understanding of advertising tactics.

Title: 
 Consumer Knowledge Assessment.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 71-82
Issue: 1
Volume: 21
Year: 1994
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 The results of studies reported in this article suggest that
 product-related experience has a greater influence on self-assessed
 knowledge judgments than does stored product class information and that
 this greater influence is due to greater accessibility in memory. In
 addition, stored product class information was found to be a more
 important determinant of objective than self-assessed knowledge, while
 product-related experience was a more important determinant of
 self-assessed than objective knowledge. We discuss implications of these
 results for the relationship between self-assessed and objective knowledge
 and for future research involving consumer knowledge constructs.

Title: 
 Advertising Repetition and Variation Strategies: Implications for Understanding Attitude Strength.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 176-89
Issue: 1
Volume: 21
Year: 1994
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 We argue that researchers need to move beyond the simple measure of
 attitude extremity to more clearly assess the impact of various
 advertising repetition strategies on consumer attitude. In study 1, we
 show that different advertising variation strategies can lead to the
 development of equally positive attitudes, even though the basis of the
 attitudes is quite different. In study 2, we show that, despite the
 appearance of equal effectiveness on the dimensions of extremity,
 persistence, and confidence, type of advertising repetition strategy
 differentially influences the extent to which individuals resist change in
 the face of a counterpersuasive attack. Coauthors are David W. Schumann,
 Wendy L. Schneier, and Wendy L. Warren.

Title: 
 Message Order Effects in Persuasion: An Attitude Strength Perspective.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 205-18
Issue: 1
Volume: 21
Year: 1994
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 Contemporary research on attitude change processes is reviewed for
 implications regarding the relative influence of successive opposing
 messages on final judgements. Based on this review, extent of message
 relevant elaboration is offered as a moderator of primacy versus recency
 effects in prior research. Support for this view is derived from the
 ability to explain the results of pervious studies and from two
 experiments in which message presentation order and personal relevance of
 the topic are manipulated in a factorial design. We find that situations
 that foster high levels of message elaboration lead to greater influence
 of an initial message on final judgments (a primacy effect) whereas
 situations that foster low levels of message relevant elaboration lead to
 greater influence of a second message on final judgments (a recency
 effect).

Title: 
 The Persuasion Knowledge Model: How People Cope with Persuasion Attempts.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 1-31
Issue: 1
Volume: 21
Year: 1994
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 In theories and studies of persuasion, people's personal knowledge about
 persuasion agents' goals and tactics, and about how to skillfully cope
 with these, has been ignored. We present a model of how people develop and
 use persuasion knowledge to cope with persuasion attempts. We discuss what
 the model implies about how consumers use marketers' advertising and
 selling attempts to refine their product attitudes and attitudes toward
 the marketers themselves. We also explain how this model relates to prior
 research on consumer behavior and persuasion and what it suggests about
 the future conduct of consumer research.

Title: 
 How Ambiguous Cropped Objects in Ad Photos Can Affect Product Evaluations.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 190-204
Issue: 1
Volume: 21
Year: 1994
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 Research in both the consumer and aesthetics literatures suggests that
 the ambiguity created by a cropped or incomplete object may prompt people
 to seek closure by supplying the missing part. In turn, this process of
 resolving the ambiguity can enhance affect. Applying this notion to
 advertisements, a study is reported that examines whether and when severe
 cropping of key objects in ads will influence people's product
 evaluations. The results indicate that severe cropping of objects in ads
 can enhance product evaluations if people are sufficiently motivated to
 complete the cropped object and the cropped object does not impede
 people's attempts to verify the ad claims.

Title: 
 Accepted Risk and Alcohol Use during Pregnancy.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 135-44
Issue: 1
Volume: 21
Year: 1994
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 Risk perceptions have been employed to understand consumers' use of
 hazardous products. However, there has been little research linking risk
 perceptions to actual product use (i.e., risk acceptance). This study
 examined risk perceptions and alcoholic beverage consumption of 409 women
 during pregnancy. The survey included a variety of demographic,
 information search, risk perception, and attitudinal measures. Compared to
 abstainers, women who continued to drink during pregnancy were less likely
 to view consuming alcohol in moderation as risky and were less likely to
 believe that consuming alcohol during pregnancy would harm the unborn
 child. Drinkers were also older and had less difficulty getting pregnant
 than abstainers.

Title: 
 Restructuring: Constructive Processing of Information Displays in Consumer Choice.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 83-99
Issue: 1
Volume: 21
Year: 1994
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 This research examines the construction of information displays by
 consumers. This aspect of constructive processing, in which data may be
 transformed, edited, or inferred, is termed "restructuring." Subjects'
 notes and verbal protocols generated during a study are used to examine
 restructuring behavior when making choices among brands. These methods
 enable the examination of restructuring and its effect on evaluative
 processing throughout the course of making a choice. Results demonstrate
 that consumers do restructure, that restructuring is done in a contingent,
 opportunistic manner, and that restructuring may influence the type of
 choice heuristic used (e.g., alternative-based vs. attribute-based).

Title: 
 A Model of Perceived Risk and Intended Risk-Handling Activity.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 119-34
Issue: 1
Volume: 21
Year: 1994
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 On the basis of previous reviews of the perceived-risk concept, a model
 of risk perception and its effects on consumers' risk-handling behavior is
 formulated. Hypotheses derived from this model are empirically tested and
 indicate that, for the setting studied (women purchasing a dress), the
 intended use of risk-handling activity increases with higher levels of
 perceived risk. This relationship is more pronounced after the level of
 risk exceeds the individual's acceptable level of risk. Also of importance
 in determining the use of a risk-handling activity are the perceived
 benefit of the type of risk-handling activity and the consumer's inability
 to absorb a monetary loss.

 Atravesando Fronteras/Border Crossings: A Critical Ethnographic Exploration of the Consumer Acculturation of Mexican Immigrants.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 32-54
Issue: 1
Volume: 21
Year: 1994
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 This article critically examines the consumption experiences of Mexican
 immigrants in the United States. An empirical model of Mexican immigrant
 consumer acculturation is derived that consists of movement, translation,
 and adaptation processes leading to outcomes of assimilation, maintenance,
 resistance, and segregation. By drawing attention to the ways in which
 international movements of people, companies, and products intersect
 within existing subcultural relations, this research provides a more
 satisfactory account of the complex dynamic processes through which
 Mexican immigrants adapt to the consumer environment in the United States.
