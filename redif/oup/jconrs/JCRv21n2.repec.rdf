Title: 
 Adolescent Influence in Family Decision Making: A Replication with Extension.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 332-41
Issue: 2
Volume: 21
Year: 1994
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 In this article, we replicate and extend several elements of E. Foxman,
 P. Tansuhaj, and K. Ekstrom's 1989 study of adolescent influence, while
 providing an integrative model of teenager influence and a new scale of
 perceived relative influence. Further, we examine the effect of parental
 employment status on teens' influence, as well as gender-based differences
 in perceptions. Motivational aspects, including product importance and
 usage, provided the strongest and most consistent explanations of
 teenagers' perceived relative influence across stages and purchase
 situations. In addition, parental employment status positively influenced
 teens' perceived influence of durable family purchases. Mothers and
 daughters generally did not differ in their rating of the daughters'
 perceived influence in the durable purchase decision-making process, while
 fathers' and sons' ratings did differ.

Title: 
 Tracing the Impact of Item-by-Item Information Accessing on Uncertainty Reduction.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 291-303
Issue: 2
Volume: 21
Year: 1994
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 The impact of item-by-item information accessing on uncertainty reduction
 is studied under self-selected and researcher-constrained information
 accessing. Study 1 showed that, at both the aggregate and the individual
 level, subjective uncertainty reduction assumes several distinct patterns,
 with the dominant pattern conforming to an accelerating or linear power
 function. Study 2 revealed that different subjective-uncertainty-reduction
 patterns tend to be associated with within-options versus
 within-properties searches. Implications of the findings and the procedure
 are discussed. Coauthors are James J. Jaccard, Imran Currim, Alfred Kuss,
 Asim Ansari, and Tracy Troutman.

Title: 
 The Effects of Antismoking and Cigarette Advertising on Young Adolescents' Perceptions of Peers Who Smoke.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 236-51
Issue: 2
Volume: 21
Year: 1994
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 Prior research suggests that young adolescents' perceptions of smokers
 are strongly associated with smoking initiation. Thus, we experimentally
 investigated the effects of antismoking and cigarette advertising on
 nonsmoking youths' perceptions (evaluative judgments) of a peer who
 smokes. Results suggest that exposure to the antismoking ads made salience
 our seventh-grade subjects' pre-existing beliefs that smokers foolishly
 endanger their health, which resulted in even less favorable evaluations
 of the smoker's common sense and personal appeal. Further, unlike subjects
 who saw unrelated (control) ads, those who saw the antismoking ads judge
 the smoker to be relatively immature and unglamorous. Exposure to the
 cigarette ads did not significantly affect scale ratings of, but resulted
 in more favorable thoughts about, the smoker.

Title: 
 Country of Origin as a Stereotype: Effects of Consumer Expertise and Attribute Strength on Product Evaluations.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 354-65
Issue: 2
Volume: 21
Year: 1994
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 This research identifies consumer expertise and the type of attribute
 information as moderating the effects of country of origin on product
 evaluations. When attribute information was unambiguous, experts based
 their evaluations on attribute strength, whereas novices relied on country
 of origin. When attribute information was ambiguous, both experts and
 novices used country of origin in evaluations. Also, experts and novices
 used county of origin differently in evaluations. Experts used country of
 origin to selectively process and recall attribute information, whereas
 novices used it to differentially interpret subsequent attribute
 information. The findings are discussed within the framework of
 stereotyping.

Title: 
 How Buyers Evaluate Product Bundles: A Model of Anchoring and Adjustment.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 342-53
Issue: 2
Volume: 21
Year: 1994
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 Bundling, the joint offering of two or more items, is a common selling
 strategy, yet little research has been conducted on buyers' evaluation of
 bundle offers. We developed and tested a model of bundle evaluation in
 which the buyers anchored their evaluation on the item perceived as most
 important and then made adjustments on the basis of their evaluations of
 the remaining bundle items. The results of two computerized laboratory
 experiments suggested that people tend to examine bundle items in a
 decreasing order of perceived importance and make adjustments to form
 their overall evaluation of the bundle.

Title: 
 A Meta-analysis of Cronbach's Coefficient Alpha.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 381-91
Issue: 2
Volume: 21
Year: 1994
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 Despite some limitations, Cronbach's coefficient alpha remains the most
 widely used measure of scale reliability. The purpose of this article was
 to empirically document the magnitudes of alpha coefficients obtained in
 behavioral research, compare these obtained values with guidelines and
 recommendations set forth by individuals such as Nunnally (1967, 1978),
 and provide insights into research design characteristics that may
 influence the size of coefficient alpha. Average reported alpha
 coefficients ranged from .70 for values and beliefs to .82 for job
 satisfaction. With few exceptions, there were no substantive relationships
 between the magnitude of coefficient alpha and the research design
 characteristics investigated.

Title: 
 The Influence of Prior Beliefs, Frequency Cues, and Magnitude Cues on Consumers' Perceptions of Comparative Price Data.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 219-35
Issue: 2
Volume: 21
Year: 1994
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 A widespread practice in grocery store advertising is to compare the
 advertised store's prices to a competitor's prices on multiple items. An
 important, but largely unexplored, issue is how this information is
 processed and used in conjunction with prior beliefs to influence price
 perceptions. In our initial studies we manipulated prior beliefs and two
 data-based cues--frequency of price advantage and magnitude of price
 advantage--to determine their relative influence on consumer price
 perceptions. Results indicate that prior beliefs affected price
 perceptions but that the frequency cue exerted a dominating influence.
 Several follow-up studies demonstrate the robustness of this phenomenon
 across a variety of presentational and instructional conditions. Coauthors
 are Susan M. Broniarczyk, Terence A. Shimp, and Joel E. Urbany.

Title: 
 An Eye-Fixation Analysis of Choice Processes for Consumer Nondurables.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 274-90
Issue: 2
Volume: 21
Year: 1994
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 The nature of the choice process for commonly purchased nondurables was
 examined by tracking eye fixations in a laboratory simulation of
 supermarket shelving. The observed process contains three stages that were
 interpreted as (1) orientation, (2) evaluation, and (3) verification.
 Orientation consisted of an overview of the product display, although some
 initial screening out of alternatives also occurred. The evaluation stage,
 the longest by far, was dominated by direct comparisons between two or
 three alternative products. The last stage, devoted to verification of the
 tentatively chosen brand-size, mainly examined alternatives with few or no
 previous fixations. Greater familiarity with a product category led to a
 choice process that was shorter and that focused on fewer alternatives,
 but these effects were confined to the evaluation stage. The findings are
 fully compatible with the general view that the choice process is
 constructed to adapt to the immediate purchase environment.

Title: 
 Effects of Hispanic Ethnic Identification on Marital Roles in the Purchase Decision Process.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 319-31
Issue: 2
Volume: 21
Year: 1994
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 The research reported in this article investigated the relationship
 between Hispanic ethnic identification and marital roles as couples
 proceed through the purchase decision process. Significant differences
 were found among the Hispanic ethnic identification groups in most of the
 decision stages for a variety of product categories, even after the
 effects of social class and length of marriage were removed. The findings
 of this study revealed a significant positive relationship between ethnic
 identification and husband dominance in decision making. However, because
 ethnic identification and product class interact with role specialization
 and relative influence in decision making, generalizations cannot be made
 about Hispanic marital roles in the decision-making process. Furthermore,
 the effect of ethnic identification on marital roles in decision making
 interacts with the phase of the purchase decision process.

Title: 
 An Exploratory Study of the Responses and Relationships Involved in the Evaluation of, and in the Intention to Purchase New Rock Music.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 366-80
Issue: 2
Volume: 21
Year: 1994
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 Recorded music is a multibillion dollar industry, yet little consumer
 research has addressed the decision-making process behind its purchase.
 This study examined the responses new rock music creates in the listener
 and how those responses influenced the intention to later buy the music.
 Experimental findings revealed that the sensorial, emotional, imaginal,
 and analytical responses to music all had direct effects on the affective
 and experimental responses, which in turn influenced purchase intention.
 The strongest indicator of purchase intention was the need to
 re-experience the music. Liking the music (e.g., affective response) was
 not as strong an indicator of purchase intention as was the experimental
 response, which measures the music's ability to create an absorbing
 experience.
