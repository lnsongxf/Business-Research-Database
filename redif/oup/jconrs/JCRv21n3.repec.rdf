Title: 
 An Empirical Analysis of Latitude of Price Acceptance in Consumer Package Goods.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 408-18
Issue: 3
Volume: 21
Year: 1994
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 Scanner panel data analyses for sweetened and unsweetened drink
 categories (with four brands in each) support the presence of a region of
 price insensitivity around a reference price. The analyses also suggest
 that consumers with higher average reference price have a wider latitude
 of price acceptance. Consumers with a higher frequency of purchase (i.e.,
 shorter average interpurchase time interval) are found to have a narrower
 latitude of price acceptance, because they are more aware of the range of
 price distributions. Finally, consumers with a higher average brand
 loyalty have a wider latitude of price acceptance, demonstrating greater
 tolerance of price fluctuations.

Title: 
 The Role of Consumers' Intuitions in Inference Making.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 393-407
Issue: 3
Volume: 21
Year: 1994
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 Traditional explorations of inference making have examined consumers'
 reactions to product descriptions that lack information about salient
 attributes. Such studies frequently report systematically lower
 evaluations of incompletely described alternatives along with a generally
 low incidence of unprompted attribute-to-attribute inference. We argue
 that the nature and likelihood of an inference are dependent on the cues
 available at the time of decision making, and that some cues may exert a
 disproportionate influence on inference behavior. In several experiments
 in which subjects were presented with competing cues that implied
 different values of a missing attribute, we show that intuitive beliefs
 about the relationships between attributes are perceived as a particularly
 reliable basis for interattribute inference. Strong beliefs appear capable
 of superseding other compelling cues and may induce consumers to generate
 inferences spontaneously.

Title: 
 Analysis and Interpretation of Qualitative Data in Consumer Research.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 491-503
Issue: 3
Volume: 21
Year: 1994
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 This article presents a framework for thinking about the fundamental
 activities of inference--data analysis and interpretation--by researchers
 using qualitative data. I contrast these two activities. For analysis I
 describe seven operations: categorization, abstraction, comparison,
 dimensionalization, integration, iteration, and refutation. For
 interpretation I suggest metaphor and other literary devices as models for
 understanding the meanings of others, identifying patterns in these
 meanings, and representing how systems of meanings reproduce culture. The
 purpose of these descriptions is to suggest a vocabulary for and stimulate
 discussion about how researchers using qualitative analytical techniques
 arrive at conclusions and make sense of data.

Title: 
 Memory-Based Product Judgments: Effects of Involvement at Encoding and Retrieval.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 534-47
Issue: 3
Volume: 21
Year: 1994
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 Two experiments investigated the proposition that memory retrieval is
 affected by consumer involvement with a product at the time product
 information is first received as well as when a memory-based judgment is
 formed. Results suggest that involvement at the time of a memory-based
 judgment increases the intensity of search for judgment-relevant
 information in memory. Further, subjects seemed to base their memory-based
 judgment on a prior evaluation (stored in memory) when involvement was
 either low at the time of memory-based judgment or high both at the time
 of this judgment and when the prior evaluation was formed. In contrast,
 subjects recalled (and presumably used) specific product information when
 their level of involvement at the time of judgment increased relative to
 when the prior evaluation was constructed. These findings are consistent
 with the cognitive economy principle. Implications for the role of memory
 in product judgment and evaluation are discussed.

Title: 
 Language and Consumer Memory: The Impact of Linguistic Differences between Chinese and English.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 419-31
Issue: 3
Volume: 21
Year: 1994
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 Languages of the Asia-Pacific region, such as Chinese, are based on
 ideographic writing systems which are radically different from the
 alphabetic systems used in Western languages, such as English. We propose
 that structural differences between Chinese and English affect mental
 representations which, in turn, influence consumer memory of verbal
 information. Specifically, unaided brand recall should be differentially
 affected in Chinese and English when it is spoken compared with when it is
 written. Furthermore, recognition should be differentially affected in
 Chinese and English when brand names are learned auditorily compared with
 when they are learned visually. Results of a cross-cultural experiment
 conducted in China and in the United States confirm predictions for
 unaided brand recall and partially confirm predictions for recognition.

Title: 
 The Bridge from Text to Mind: Adapting Reader-Response Theory to Consumer Research.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 461-80
Issue: 3
Volume: 21
Year: 1994
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 Consumer research on advertising response has gradually separated the act
 of reading an ad from the acquisition of brand information. Because the
 advertising text is the pathway through which brand information is
 accessed, current models truncate the process that leads to response in a
 way that distorts our view of both advertising and the mind that reads it.
 This author proposes that reader-response theory would help researchers
 study the process of reading as an essential link between advertising text
 and consumer response. Reader-response theory is a movement within
 literary criticism that emphasizes the study of reading over formal
 textual analysis.

Title: 
 The Spoken and the Unspoken: A Hermeneutic Approach to Understanding the Cultural Viewpoints That Underlie Consumers' Expressed Meanings.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 432-52
Issue: 3
Volume: 21
Year: 1994
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 This article draws on the philosophical concept of the hermeneutical
 circle to explore the cultural viewpoints that underlie the meanings
 expressed by consumers. Phenomenological interviews were conducted with
 adult female consumers. The interviews are interpreted first by the
 identification of an exemplary image or event that we describe as a
 symbolic metaphor. We show that these symbolic metaphors highlight key
 personal meanings that each participant ascribed to her consumer
 experiences. We then use a hermeneutic logic known as intertextual
 analysis to show that these personal meanings reflect more general
 cultural viewpoints that are implicitly conveyed in language. These
 intertextual interpretations offer insights into the sociocultural
 meanings that underlie skeptical, nostalgic, and pragmatic consumer
 orientations. A concluding discussion is given to key implications and
 areas for future research that follow from this hermeneutic approach.

Title: 
 Effects of Presentation Order and Communication Modality on Recall and Attitude.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 481-90
Issue: 3
Volume: 21
Year: 1994
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 Previous consumer research has attributed differences in persuasion
 between communication modes (e.g., audio vs. print) to differences in the
 audience's control over the pace of argument presentation. It is argued in
 this article that communication modes also differ in the extent to which
 argument order is an important determinant of persuasion. The results of
 two studies show that, while order of argument presentation affects
 persuasion with audio messages, order is unimportant with print messages.
 These differences appear to be due to a first-in-first-out retrieval
 strategy employed in response to audio presentations but not in response
 to visual presentations. Implications of the research for understanding
 how consumers process messages and how to develop effective communications
 are discussed.

Title: 
 Revitalizing the Critical Imagination: Unleashing the Crouched Tiger.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 559-65
Issue: 3
Volume: 21
Year: 1994
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 The purpose of this article is to further the "critical imagination
 project" that we began in 1991. The goal of this project has always been
 to inspire researchers to engage in action-oriented programs of research
 aimed at improving society and the lives of consumers. On the basis of a
 dialogue with Hetrick and Lozada's thoughtful work, we suggest that the
 critical imagination project can still empower both consumers and consumer
 researchers. Toward this end, we respond to four important issues: First,
 what is a reasonable interpretation of critical theory? Second, does an
 accurate interpretation of critical theory necessarily involve a
 capitalist critique? Third, what are the core ideas of critical theory?
 And finally, what kinds of methods will justify a critical theory?

 Valuing Things: The Public and Private Meanings of Possessions.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 504-21
Issue: 3
Volume: 21
Year: 1994
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 Consumers own objects for the value they provide. This article argues
 that the value of possessions resides in their meanings and further makes
 a distinction between the public and private meanings of possessions. The
 nature of these meanings is elaborated, and three studies are described
 that assess the public and private meanings of the possessions consumers
 value most. Similarities and differences between the two sorts of meaning
 are examined, and implications of meaning for the understanding of
 consumer behavior are discussed.

Abstract:

 The following article offers a critique of the "critical imagination"
 thesis espoused by Murray and Ozanne in a recent article published in the
 "Journal of Consumer Research." Also provided is a commentary on the
 proposed utilization of the Frankfurt Circle version of critical theory as
 a groundwork for consumer research. The possibility of emancipatory action
 stemming from critical consumer research is broadly discussed. Diversions
 on these themes are offered as potential areas for theory building and for
 the formulation of alternative conceptions of critical consumer research.
