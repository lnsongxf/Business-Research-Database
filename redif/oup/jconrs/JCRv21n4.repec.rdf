Title: 
 Toward a Reconciliation of Market Power and Information Theories of Advertising Effects on Price Elasticity.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 644-59
Issue: 4
Volume: 21
Year: 1995
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 Prior work on the economic effects of advertising has presented
 conflicting views. Some authors have suggested that advertising creates
 market power by artificially differentiating brands and thereby lowering
 price elasticity. Others have viewed advertising as an efficient source of
 information about the existence of substitutes, arguing that advertising
 increases price elasticity. The present research proposes a unifying
 theoretical model in which advertising affects price elasticity through
 its influence on two mediating constructs: the size of the consideration
 set and the relative strength of preference. Pretests 1 and 2 examine the
 effects of advertising on these two constructs. Results from the main
 experiment show that, in accordance with the theoretical framework, the
 same advertisements that increased price elasticity in some decision
 environments decreased it in others.

Title: 
 Trait Aspects of Vanity: Measurement and Relevance to Consumer Behavior.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 612-26
Issue: 4
Volume: 21
Year: 1995
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 In this article, trait aspects of vanity are defined and scales measuring
 these aspects are developed. Extensive validation procedures are employed,
 including assessing the relationships between the vanity scales and
 numerous consumer-related attitudes and behaviors. Five studies,
 encompassing seven samples, are reported. Studies related the vanity
 measures to various constructs and behaviors for samples that included
 individuals selected for "Who's Who in America," players from a nationally
 ranked NCAA Division I football team, professional fashion models, and
 samples from the general population.

Title: 
 Rational and Adaptive Performance Expectations in a Customer Satisfaction Framework.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 695-707
Issue: 4
Volume: 21
Year: 1995
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 This article develops and tests alternative models of market-level
 expectations, perceived product performance, and customer satisfaction.
 Market performance expectations are argued to be largely rational in
 nature yet adaptive to changing market conditions. Customer satisfaction
 is conceptualized as a cumulative construct that is effected by market
 expectations and performance perceptions in any given period and is
 affected by past satisfaction from period to period. An empirical study
 that supports adaptive market expectations and stable market satisfaction
 using data from the Swedish Customer Satisfaction Barometer is reported.

Title: 
 A Bayesian Analysis of the Information Value of Manipulation and Confounding Checks in Theory Tests.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 581-95
Issue: 4
Volume: 21
Year: 1995
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 Past discussions of manipulation checks and related measures have
 produced disagreement about their role in tests of theoretical
 explanations of consumer behavior. We use a Bayesian analysis to examine
 what such measures contribute to researchers' beliefs about competing
 theories and suggest when and why manipulation and confounding checks add
 to the ability to differentiate among alternative theoretical explanations
 of empirical results. We first focus on the case in which a statistically
 significant between-group difference on the dependent variable is
 augmented by information from a single indicator of the intended
 manipulation and a single indicator of a possible confound. We then
 examine the implications of multiple indicators and the use of a Bayesian
 analysis of continuous effect sizes.

Title: 
 Copywriters' Implicit Theories of Communication: An Exploration.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 596-611
Issue: 4
Volume: 21
Year: 1995
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 Advertising copywriters, in common with other craftspeople, seemingly
 work without theories, even though their work exhibits insights about
 consumer motivation and behavior. This research explored the existence of
 implicit theories of communication among a sample of copywriters. The
 findings indicated that copywriters do articulate a common set of informal
 theories that are based on perceptions of the writing of advertising as an
 internal dialogue. Aspects of these implicit theories differ from many
 assumptions and findings of current formal theories of advertising. These
 differences exist in the areas of the nature of affect toward advertising,
 the nature of the connection between advertising and the brand advertised,
 and involvement with the advertising message. These implicit theories form
 the basis for suggesting changes in understanding copywriters' work and
 for academic and applied research on advertising and marketing.

Title: 
 Marketing and Seduction: Building Exchange Relationships by Managing Social Consensus.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 660-76
Issue: 4
Volume: 21
Year: 1995
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 We distinguish seduction from persuasion and other ways to draw consumers
 into exchange relationships. A legal case involving the prosecution of a
 mail fraud known as Chonda-Za is used to illustrate seduction, and the
 concept is defined in terms of social constructionist theory. We identify
 five stages in the unfolding of a seduction and draw parallels and
 contrasts to the formation of a normal exchange relationship. We explore
 the enrollment stage in more detail and model it as a matter of inducing
 consumers to accept progressively more involving role agreements. The
 distinction between legitimate and illegitimate seduction is also
 examined.

Title: 
 Abortion in America: A Consumer-Behavior Perspective.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 677-94
Issue: 4
Volume: 21
Year: 1995
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 Abortion is the most frequently performed surgical procedure in this
 country, yet its provision to consumers remains one of the most
 contentious issues within our society. The purpose of this article is to
 broaden our understanding of this problem by examining abortion from a
 consumer-behavior perspective. The phenomenological study described in
 this article revealed that (1) a wide gap exists between the language of
 the public debate and that of private decision making, (2) the language of
 private decision making reflects a moral standard used frequently by women
 yet virtually ignored in the public debate, and (3) women who take charge
 of their own decisions cope better with the emotional aftermath, whether
 their decision is for birth or for abortion. The article closes with a
 discussion of policy implications that arise from this feminist look at
 the abortion dilemma as well as broader implications for consumer
 behavior.

Title: 
 Communication Effects of Advertising versus Direct Experience When Both Search and Experience Attributes Are Present.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 708-18
Issue: 4
Volume: 21
Year: 1995
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 Previous research has predicted that direct product experience will be
 superior to advertising in communicating information about products. In
 experiment 1 of the present study, claims about search attributes were
 better recognized and beliefs about search attributes were more accessible
 and more confidently held after exposure to ads in comparison with direct
 experience of two inexpensive packaged products. Experiment 2 replicated
 the above effects on claim recognition, belief accessibility, and
 confidence for two consumer durables under low-involvement conditions. It
 also showed that search attributes were more frequently mentioned and were
 rated as more important after exposure to advertising than after direct
 experience; the opposite was true for experience attributes. These effects
 on frequency of mention and attribute importance were significantly weaker
 under high-involvement than under low-involvement conditions.

Title: 
 A Rational Reconstruction of the Compromise Effect: Using Market Data to Infer Utilities.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 627-33
Issue: 4
Volume: 21
Year: 1995
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 This article explores the possibility that consumers use market data to
 make inferences about product utilities. The argument is made by means of
 an example based on the "compromise effect" found in extant experimental
 data. This phenomenon is generally looked at as a manifestation of
 deviations from rationality in choice. However, assuming full rationality,
 I describe a decision rule that is based on consumers' inferences about
 their information about their own relative tastes. Through a number of
 examples, I will argue that consumers often use this or similar decision
 rules to make inferences about utility. I then show that the decision rule
 may generate compromise effects in experiments and that it may be
 sustainable. The compromise effect could therefore be seen as preliminary
 evidence that consumers make such inferences.
