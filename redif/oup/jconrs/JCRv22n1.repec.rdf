Title: 
 Effects of Self-Referencing on Persuasion.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 17-26
Issue: 1
Volume: 22
Year: 1995
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 Two experiments manipulate self-referencing by varying copy writing
 strategy. It is found that increasing self-referencing increases message
 elaboration and can increase persuasion when message arguments are strong.
 However, when self-referencing is increased in the presence of other
 variables that also enhance elaboration, the favorable effect of
 self-referencing on persuasion is moderated or reversed. A two-factor
 explanation is employed to generate predictions and account for results.

Title: 
 Creating Consumers in the 1930s: Irna Phillips and the Radio Soap Opera.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 75-89
Issue: 1
Volume: 22
Year: 1995
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 The 1930s marked an important stage in the evolution of a mass consumer
 society in the United States. The current article examines the roles that
 Irna Phillips and the early radio soap opera played in that process.
 Through the daytime serial, Phillips developed a program format that
 appealed to American housewives, who were the likely purchasers of most
 household products. She adjusted story lines to meet the selling needs of
 her sponsors; she used soap opera characters as effective product
 spokespersons; and she designed program promotions to stimulate product
 sales. However, at the same time that her programs sold products
 contributing to social change, they also reinforced traditional
 expectations about the roles of women as housewives and mothers.

Title: 
 Household Life-Cycle Stages, Transitions, and Product Expenditures.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 27-42
Issue: 1
Volume: 22
Year: 1995
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 Data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics' Consumer Expenditure
 Survey provide empirical verification of changes in household spending
 across a wide variety of products as households pass from one stage of the
 household life cycle to another. Three spending patterns emerged: (1) a
 generalized inverted U pattern, with spending rising sharply as households
 shift from young single to young married, then remaining relatively high,
 and falling sharply at the older married and/or older single stages, (2)
 generally increasing expenditures across stages until the last one or two
 stages, and (3) generally decreasing expenditures across the life cycle.
 Expenditures are especially influenced by the presence of young children
 in the household.

Title: 
 How Consumers Consume: A Typology of Consumption Practices.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 1-16
Issue: 1
Volume: 22
Year: 1995
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 This article examines what people do when they consume. In recent
 interpretive consumer research, three research streams have emerged, each
 portraying how people consume through a distinctive metaphor: consuming as
 experience, consuming as integration, and consuming as classification. The
 research reported here - a two-year observational case study of baseball
 spectators in Chicago's Wrigley Field bleachers - builds on this
 literature to systematically detail the universe of actions that
 constitute consuming. The resulting topology refines, extends, and
 synthesizes the three existing approaches to consuming and adds a fourth
 dimension - consuming as play - to yield a comprehensive vocabulary for
 describing how consumers consume. The usefulness of the topology is
 demonstrated by applying it to develop an alternative conception of
 materialism as a style of consuming.

Title: 
 Mental Accounting and Changes in Price: The Frame Dependence of Reference Dependence.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 90-97
Issue: 1
Volume: 22
Year: 1995
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 Mental accounting principles for multiple events were replicated and then
 extended to pricing situations that were designed to moderate these
 principles if reference dependence is proportional (i.e., if consumers
 evaluate events in terms of proportional deviations from reference states
 rather than raw deviations). Prices were stated with or without popular
 percentage-based pricing frames such as "33 percent off." Mental
 accounting principles generally prevailed in the absence of
 percentage-based frames. However, percentage-based frames altered two
 principles and increased tendencies toward the others. The findings
 demonstrate that mental accounting principles, price perception, and
 reference dependence are sensitive to the ways in which deviations from
 reference states are framed.

Title: 
 Decision Ambiguity and Incumbent Brand Advantage.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 98-109
Issue: 1
Volume: 22
Year: 1995
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 This article examines the role of decision ambiguity in judgments that
 consumers make about an incumbent (the brand a consumer currently uses)
 versus an attack brand (a new, superior competitor). It is hypothesized
 that decision ambiguity creates an advantage for the incumbent. A
 conceptualization of decision ambiguity is offered. In three experiments,
 factors that can cause decision ambiguity are manipulated and their
 effects on preference for the incumbent are investigated. The results
 underscore the role of decision ambiguity in incumbent brand advantage. In
 two other experiments, boundary conditions are examined.

Title: 
 Persuasion Knowledge: Lay People's and Researchers' Beliefs about the Psychology of Advertising.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 62-74
Issue: 1
Volume: 22
Year: 1995
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 What do lay people believe about the psychology of advertising and
 persuasion? How similar are the beliefs of lay people to those of consumer
 researchers? In this study we explore the content of people's conceptions
 of how television advertising influences its audience. The findings
 suggest that lay people and researchers share many basic beliefs about the
 psychology of persuasion but also indicate some dissimilarities in these
 groups' persuasion knowledge. We discuss what the findings imply about the
 existence of cultural folk knowledge and its effect on persuasion.
