Title: 
 Behavioral Frequency Judgments: An Accessibility-Diagnosticity Framework.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 212-28
Issue: 2
Volume: 22
Year: 1995
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 Marketing research surveys often elicit behavioral frequency reports.
 When estimating the number of times a respondent engages in a behavior,
 s/he may use information about the behavior stored in memory, information
 provided by the response context, or both. Based on an
 accessibility-diagnosticity framework, we theorize that the probability of
 using context-based information in forming a frequency judgment is
 inversely proportional to the diagnosticity of the alternative inputs
 accessible in memory. That is, when memory-based information is accessible
 and diagnostic, contextual information is not used; when memory-based
 information is accessible but not diagnostic, the use of contextual
 information depends on its perceived diagnosticity. Finally, when
 memory-based information is not accessible, contextual information is used
 even when its diagnosticity is questionable. The results of three
 experiments support this model. Theoretical implications and
 recommendations for questionnaire design are discussed.

Title: 
 Affect Intensity: An Individual Difference Response to Advertising Appeals.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 154-64
Issue: 2
Volume: 22
Year: 1995
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 The Affect Intensity Measurement (AIM) scale assesses the strength of the
 emotions with which individuals respond to an affect-laden stimulus. This
 study investigated the extent to which individual differences in affect
 intensity influence the message recipient's responses to emotional
 advertising appeals. In two experiments high affect intensity individuals,
 compared with those who scored low on the AIM scale, (1) manifested
 significantly stronger emotional responses to the emotional advertising,
 appeal and (2) showed no differences in emotional response intensity when
 exposed to a nonemotional appeal. Both negative and positive emotions
 mediated the influence of affect intensity on attitude formation.

Title: 
 Understanding the Socialized Body: A Poststructuralist Analysis of Consumers' Self-Conceptions, Body Images, and Self-Care Practices.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 139-53
Issue: 2
Volume: 22
Year: 1995
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 The present inquiry examines the psychosocial meanings and processes that
 shape consumers' sense of body image and the consumption behaviors
 motivated by those perceptions. Poststructuralist interpretive procedures
 were used to analyze interviews with 30 male and female consumers, aged
 6-54. This discourse analysis led to the development of three
 process-oriented themes: (1) the ideology of self-control, (2) the social
 processes of normalization and problematization, and (3) the operation of
 the disciplinary gaze. The systematic manifestations of these themes are
 illustrated across a range of consumer experiences and body-focused
 perceptions, implications of these themes for the theoretical
 conceptualizations of body image and the nature of self-concept in
 contemporary consumer culture are discussed.

Title: 
 What's in a Name? A Complimentary Means of Persuasion.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 200-211
Issue: 2
Volume: 22
Year: 1995
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 Three experiments demonstrate that remembering someone's name facilitates
 their compliance with a purchase request made by the rememberer.
 Experiment 1 shows that name remembrance increases request compliance, but
 name forgetting does not cause a decrease in compliance. Experiments 2 and
 3 show that name remembrance is perceived as a compliment by the person
 remembered, which mediates compliance with the purchase request.
 Experimental manipulations of the likelihood of name remembrance
 (experiment 2) and need for self-enhancement (experiment 3) provide
 results consistent with a complimentary explanation for the findings.

Title: 
 Reasons for Substantial Delay in Consumer Decision Making.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 186-99
Issue: 2
Volume: 22
Year: 1995
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 This study proposes a typology of reasons why people substantially delay
 important consumer decisions. The delay reasons we study are drawn from
 delay typologies identified in other contexts as well as from the product
 diffusion literature. Two studies reported here examine why subjects delay
 consumer decisions. These support most of the reasons in the proposed
 typology, while some unanticipated delay reasons also emerge. We find that
 the delay reasons are related to the reasons consumers stop delaying, a
 process that we call delay closure, and are also related to the amount of
 time that consumers spend in different stages of the decision-making
 process. A final study supports a conceptual framework to classify these
 delay reasons based on the two dimensions of internal versus external
 locus of causation, and whether the purpose of delay is related to the
 decision or to unrelated activities.

Title: 
 There's Something in the Air: Effects of Congruent or Incongruent Ambient Odor on Consumer Decision Making.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 229-38
Issue: 2
Volume: 22
Year: 1995
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 Pleasant ambient odors are found to affect consumer decision making
 depending on whether the scents are congruent or incongruent with the
 target product class. Two different choice contexts are examined. In
 experiment 1, in a static-choice context, subjects in conditions in which
 the odor is congruent with the product class are found to spend more time
 processing the data, are more holistic in their processing, are more
 likely to go beyond the information given, are more likely to spread their
 choices evenly over the whole choice set than are subjects in the
 incongruent-odor conditions. In experiment 2, in a dynamic-choice context,
 subjects in the congruent conditions are more likely to exhibit behavior
 that is consistent with variety seeking than are subjects in the
 incongruent conditions.

Title: 
 Understanding the Effects of Color: How the Correspondence between Available and Required Resources Affects Attitudes.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 121-38
Issue: 2
Volume: 22
Year: 1995
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 The impact of presenting full-color, black-and-white, and
 color-highlighted ad photos is examined under different processing
 resource conditions. When viewers devote few resources to processing, ads
 with some color outperform black-and-white ads. However, when viewers
 engage in more effortful ad processing, attitudes are sensitive to the
 match between available and required resources. When the substantial
 resources devoted to ad processing are inadequate of thorough ad scrutiny,
 black-and-white ads or those that color highlight aspects highly relevant
 to ad claims are more persuasive. By contrast, when available resources
 better approximate those required for extensive ad scrutiny, full-color
 ads or ads that color highlight ad photo elements that are highly relevant
 to the ad claims are more persuasive than either black-and-white ads or
 ads that color highlight aspects of low relevance to ad claims. These
 outcomes are interpreted by extending notions offered by
 elaboration-likelihood and resource theories.

Title: 
 Consumer Myths: Frye's Taxonomy and the Structural Analysis of Consumption Text.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 165-85
Issue: 2
Volume: 22
Year: 1995
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 This article presents a structural analysis of myths in consumption text,
 using Northrop Frye's taxonomy of mythoi to assign consumer narratives and
 selected advertisements to four categories of mythic plots: comedy,
 romance, tragedy, and irony. Frye's categorization scheme derives from
 literature, and the plot types embody structural links between consumption
 myths and those found in other cultural texts. Each mythos also
 incorporates values encoded in the plot that reappear in consumption
 narratives and in advertising appeals using mythic patterns and
 characterization. Frye's taxonomy is first applied to a reanalysis of
 Thanksgiving narratives in Wallendorf and Arnould's " 'We Gather
 Together': Consumption Rituals of Thanksgiving Day" and next to an
 analysis of pre-Thanksgiving food advertising coupons. The analysis
 demonstrates that the Thanksgiving narratives and related advertising
 exemplars fit into conventional plot structures that serve as organizing
 devices for both the articulation of consumption experience and the design
 of consumer appeals.
