Title: 
 Two Forms of Compulsive Consumption: Comorbidity of Compulsive Buying and Binge Eating.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 296-304
Issue: 3
Volume: 22
Year: 1995
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 Several authors have articulated the need for broader theories or models
 to account for multiple forms of compulsive or addictive consumption.
 Development of these broader theories requires more information regarding
 the overlap and interrelationship of specific consumption disorders. Two
 studies are presented here to examine the comorbidity of compulsive buying
 and eating disorders involving binge eating. Study 1 found that women
 diagnosed as having binge eating disorder had significantly greater
 compulsive buying tendencies than nonbinge eaters of similar weight. Study
 2 showed that complwive buyers were more likely to have engaged in binge
 eating, had more symptoms characteristic of both binge eating disorder and
 bulimia nervosa, and were more likely to be clinically diagnosed as having
 an eating disorder than a matched control group. Coauthors are Gary A.
 Christenson, Martina de Zwaan, and James Mitchell.

Title: 
 Assessing the Domain Specificity of Deal Proneness: A Field Study.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 314-26
Issue: 3
Volume: 22
Year: 1995
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 Results of two studies designed to assess the manner in which the deal
 proneness construct is best conceptualized are presented. On the basis of
 a review of the sales promotion literature, three alternatives are
 identified: (1) deal proneness is a general construct that encompasses
 various deal types (i.e., a single deal proneness construct), (2) deal
 proneness is a domain-specific construct (e.g., coupon proneness, sale
 proneness, rebate proneness), or (3) deal proneness is a construct that
 includes only certain types of deals (e.g., price-oriented deals,
 active-oriented deals). Across both studies, operationalizations
 consistent with each of the alternatives are developed, confirmatory
 factor models consistent with each are comapred, and the predictive
 validity of the alternatives is assessed by relating operationalizations
 consistent with each alternative to a variety of deal-responsive behaviors
 collected unobtrusively in natural field settings. Results support
 treating deal proneness as a domain-specific construct.

Title: 
 Normative Influences on Impulsive Buying Behavior.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 305-13
Issue: 3
Volume: 22
Year: 1995
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 Although consumer researchers have investigated impulse buying for nearly
 50 years, almost no research has empirically examined its normative
 aspects. This article presents conceptual and empirical evidence that
 consumers' normative evaluations (i.e., judgments about the
 appropriateness of engaging in impulse buying behavior) moderate the
 relationship between the impulse buying trait and consumers' buying
 behaviors. Specifically, the relationship between the buying impulsiveness
 trait and realted buying behaviors is significant only when consumers
 believe that acting on impulse is appropriate. The findings from two
 studies across student and retail customer samples converge and support
 the hypothesized moderating role of consumers' normative evaluations.

Title: 
 The Impact of Context on Variety Seeking in Product Choices.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 285-95
Issue: 3
Volume: 22
Year: 1995
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 One reason consumers seek variety in product choices is to satisfy a need
 for stimulation. It is suggested that consumers may try to achieve an
 optimal level of stimulation by balancing the stimulation sought from
 product choice with the stimulation available from the choice context. Two
 laboratory experiments are conducted that show that causing changes in the
 choice context (thus increasing stimulation) decreases the amount of
 variety seeking subjects exhibit in product choices. Specifically, the
 results of the experiments suggest that consumers' needs for stimulation
 may be met by providing variety in a different product category or in
 other aspects of the choice context. A limiting condition to this finding
 is also examined. If positive affect is induced along with stimulation,
 then the reduction in variety-seeking behavior is mitigated.
