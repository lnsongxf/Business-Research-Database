Title: 
 Cue Representation and Selection Effects of Arousal on Persuasion.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 373-87
Issue: 4
Volume: 22
Year: 1996
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 A popular prediction in persuasion research is that decreased ability to
 process information increases reliance on peripheral cues and decreases
 reliance on central claims. This article explains why this prediction does
 not necessarily hold when processing capacity is impaired by high arousal.
 Three experiments suggest that two types of processes underlie arousal
 effects on persuasion. Arousal induces selective processing of cues that
 are diagnostic at the expense of cues that are nondiagnostic--the
 selection effect. Arousal may also dilute the influence of cues that are
 capacity demanding--the representation effect. It is therefore important
 to disentangle the diagnosticity of persuasion cues from their processing
 demands.

Title: 
 Microcultural Analysis of Variation in Sharing of Causal Reasoning about Behavior.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 346-72
Issue: 4
Volume: 22
Year: 1996
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 This article explores the relation of culture to consumption by
 investigating individual, social, and cultural sources of variation in the
 sharing of causal reasoning about behavior in two microcultures. The
 results suggest (1 ) the importance of intracultural variation in the
 study of culture, (2) differences between experts and novices as a robust
 source of this variation, (3) novel insights into the relationship between
 expertise and sociocultural phenomena, and (4) the potential for
 investigating attitude structure, categorization, and attribution as
 products of causal reasoning originating from cultural belief systems. The
 study also demonstrates the synergy created by diverse research methods.

Title: 
 Cognitive Moderators of Negative-Emotion Effects: Implications for Understanding Media Context.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 439-47

Volume: 22

Abstract:

 This study examines how emotions elicited by television programs
 influence viewers' liking for the programs. An experiment using actual
 television programs found that positive emotions directly enhance program
 liking, while negative emotions have a deleterious effect. However, the
 latter effect diminishes when viewers believe that the negative emotions
 elicited by the programs do not signal threats to their well-being. These
 findings support the theory that positive emotions influence evaluations
 via simple decision heuristics, while negative emotions motivate detailed
 analyses of the emoting event or stimulus.

Title: 
 Moderators of the Impact of Self-Reference on Persuasion.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 408-23
Issue: 4
Volume: 22
Year: 1996
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 This article examines two related issues: how variation in the level of
 self-reference in which people engage affects their persuasion and what
 factors may moderate self-reference effects. Respondents viewed ads that
 varied on two dimensions intended to influence the use of self-reference,
 namely, the wording of the ad copy and the perspective from which the ad
 photo was shot. Results indicated that an initial (moderate) increase in
 self-referencing enhanced persuasion, while a further (extreme) increase
 undermined persuasion. These effects emerged, however, only when subjects
 were highly motivated to attend to the ad. When ad recipients' motivation
 was low, self-referencing had no effect.

Title: 
 Increasing the Persuasiveness of Fear Appeals: The Effect of Arousal and Elaboration.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 448-59
Issue: 4
Volume: 22
Year: 1996
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 We investigate the conditions under which messages that prompt low and
 high levels of fear are likely to be effective. Our premise is that when a
 low level of fear is ineffective, it is because there is insufficient
 elaboration of the harmful consequences of engaging in the destructive
 behavior. By contrast, when appeals arousing high levels of fear are
 ineffective, it is because too much elaboration on the harmful
 consequences interferes with processing of the recommended change in
 behavior. We find support for these expectations in the context of a
 communication advocating that people stop smoking. The
 elaboration-enhancing interventions used, self-reference and imagery
 processing, increased the persuasiveness of a low-fear appeal by prompting
 elaboration on the harmful consequences of smoking, whereas the use of two
 elaboration-suppressing interventions, reference to others and objective
 processing, increased the persuasiveness of a high-fear appeal by
 decreasing the extent to which consumers deny harmful consequences.

Title: 
 Figures of Rhetoric in Advertising Language.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 424-38
Issue: 4
Volume: 22
Year: 1996
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 A rhetorical figure can be defined as an artful deviation in the form
 taken by a statement. Since antiquity dozens of figures have been
 cataloged, ranging from the familiar (rhyme, pun) to the obscure
 (antimetabole). Despite the frequent appearance of rhetorical figures in
 print advertisements, their incorporation into advertising theory and
 research has been minimal. This article develops a framework for
 classifying rhetorical figures that distinguishes between figurative and
 nonfigurative text, between two types of figures (schemes and tropes), and
 among four rhetorical operations that underlie individual figures
 (repetition, reversal, substitution, and destabilization). These
 differentiations in the framework are supported by preliminary validation
 data and are linked to suggested consumer responses. The article also
 considers the theoretical import of the proposed framework for future
 research on rhetorical structure in advertising.

Title: 
 Caring Consumers: Gendered Consumption Meanings and the Juggling Lifestyle.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 388-407
Issue: 4
Volume: 22
Year: 1996
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 This article explores the meanings that consumption experiences hold for
 professional working mothers engaged in the culturally prominent lifestyle
 known as "juggling." A discussion is given to prior research documenting
 the cultural and historical processes that gave rise to this lifestyle
 pattern. These analyses suggest that "jugglers" of the baby boom
 generation have been socialized in a common system of conflicting cultural
 ideals, beliefs, and gender ideologies. A hermeneutic research approach is
 used to explicate the emic consumer meanings that arise in relation to the
 participants' salient life concerns and their sense of personal history.
 An etic framework is then derived that further analyzes these perceptions
 in the context of issues related to the social construction of feminine
 identities and cultural conceptions of motherhood. The conceptual and
 methodological implications of the emic and etic frameworks for consumer
 research are discussed.
