Title: 
 The Price of Safety.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 12-25
Issue: 1
Volume: 23
Year: 1996
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 This article presents a simple economic model to assess consumers'
 valuation of safety features. In particular, we model the benefit from
 safety as the reduction in the probability of death and the associated
 economic value of this reduction. We then apply this theoretical model to
 investigate market valuation of antilock brakes and airbags via the
 specification and estimation of a hedonic price equation. Results indicate
 that consumers behave in a manner consistent with the economic model we
 develop.

Title: 
 The Effect of Measuring Intent on Brand-Level Purchase Behavior.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 1-11
Issue: 1
Volume: 23
Year: 1996
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 Previous research has demonstrated that merely asking consumers purchase
 intent questions has a significant impact on their actual purchase
 incidence in the category. Our article extends this research to explore
 the impact of the "mere-measurement" effect at the brand level. We
 hypothesize that there are predictable patterns of brand-level purchase
 effects that depend on whether a consumer has previously made a purchase
 in the product category. The results demonstrate that current owners of
 cars are more likely to repurchase the brands they currently own when they
 are asked intent questions. In addition, the purchase behavior of current
 car owners is more consistent with their brand attitudes when they are
 asked intent questions. First-time car buyers, on the other hand, are more
 likely to purchase brands that have large market shares when asked intent
 questions. Finally, we discuss both the implications of these results and
 opportunities for future research.

Title: 
 Interactive Effects of Presentation Modality and Message-Generated Imagery on Recall of Advertising Information.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 81-88
Issue: 1
Volume: 23
Year: 1996
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 We argue that imaging is a cognitive process that uses the same mental
 resources as perception. Therefore, when imaging and perception compete
 for the same resources, message elaboration and learning should be
 undermined. Two experiments are reported that provide support for this
 theorizing. In the first experiment, the learning of visual or auditory
 imagery-provoking information is adversely affected by reading or
 listening, respectively. In the second experiment, information with high
 levels of visual imagery is found to be learned better than information
 with low levels of visual imagery when the information is presented
 auditorily, but the reverse occurs when information is present visually.

Title: 
 Mental Budgeting and Consumer Decisions.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 40-52
Issue: 1
Volume: 23
Year: 1996
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 Consumers often set budgets for categories of expenses (e.g.,
 entertainment) and track expenses against their budget. Because budgets
 cannot perfectly anticipate consumption opportunities, people may earmark
 too much or too little money for a particular category. This leads them to
 overconsume or underconsume goods in that category. The results of three
 studies suggest that consumers do indeed set budgets and that budgeting
 may lead to underconsumption. To show that consumers track expenses, the
 studies demonstrate that budgeting effects are larger for purchases that
 are highly typical of their category. Such purchases reduce the amount
 people spend in a category and block the purchase of other typical items.
 The studies control for satiation and income effects; thus, budgeting adds
 predictive power to standard economic consumer theory.

Title: 
 Predicting Preferences: An Examination of Agent Learning.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 68-80
Issue: 1
Volume: 23
Year: 1996
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 Agent decision making occurs when an individual acts as a purchasing
 agent for another. Effective agent decision making requires that the agent
 learn to predict the target's preferences. Two experimental studies
 demonstrate the impact of providing agents veridical feedback. The results
 further our understanding of interpersonal prediction and learning from
 experience. Agents who are given the opportunity to learn from their own
 successes and failures do not exhibit the false consensus effect, or
 projection, that has been demonstrated in previous research. Any
 facilitative effect of similarity in tastes on predictive accuracy
 disappears when feedback is provided. Information theory is used to
 establish the informational value of individual instances, as well as an
 overall distribution of feedback. The results of the studies reported in
 the present article indicate that agents spend significantly more time
 considering informative than uninformative feedback, which improves their
 predictive accuracy.
