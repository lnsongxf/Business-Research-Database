Title: 
 Deconstructive Strategy and Consumer Research: Concepts and Illustrative Exemplar.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 136-47
Issue: 2
Volume: 23
Year: 1996
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 This article introduces the application of deconstruction to consumer
 research by addressing three questions: What is it? How does one do it?
 and What contribution can it make? It briefly summarizes deconstruction's
 French origins and entry in American criticism and examines the key term
 "differance"- difference and deference. The article demonstrates the role
 of deconstructive criticism as an agent provocateur by first presenting
 interpretations of an advertising exemplar--Joe Carmel--from the
 perspectives of the New Criticism and structuralism and then performing a
 deconstructive reading that subverts these interpretations. It ends with
 the implications of deconstruction for enlivening consumer research
 discourse.

Title: 
 Communicating Price Information through Semantic Cues: The Moderating Effects of Situation and Discount Size.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 148-55
Issue: 2
Volume: 23
Year: 1996
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 While several studies have examined how the specific wording (i.e.,
 semantic cue) used to communicate a price offer affects consumers'
 perceptions of value, this area of research has not produced a set of
 consistent findings. To resolve the apparent inconsistencies, the current
 article builds on past research and explains why a consumer's response to
 a semantic cue depends on the situation (or decision context) and the
 discount size. The results of two studies are reported. The first
 experiment provides evidence that the relative effectiveness of two widely
 used types of semantic cues depends on both consumers' decision context
 and the level of processing evoked by the discount size. The second
 experiment replicates the semantic cue by situation interaction and
 demonstrates the robustness of this effect across store familiarity.

Title: 
 Trend Effects and Gender Differences in Retrospective Judgments of Consumption Emotions.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 156-62
Issue: 2
Volume: 23
Year: 1996
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 A field study performed at the end of multiday hospital stays
 investigated trend effects on retrospective global judgments of emotions.
 Subjects (43 women and 50 men) reported instances of their positive and
 negative emotions, retrospective global judgments of these emotions, and
 satisfaction with hospital services. Retrospective global judgments of
 positive and negative emotions were a positive function of the increase or
 decrease of the instances of emotions over time. Consistent with
 predictions based on the literature on gender differences in information
 processing, men's retrospective judgments of positive emotions were highly
 sensitive to trend effects but no trend effect was found for negative
 emotions. In contrast, women demonstrated trend effects primarily in
 judgments of negative emotions. Trends in positive and negative emotions,
 however, did not significantly contribute to satisfaction judgements for
 men and women. Theoretical and managerial implications of the results are
 discussed.

Title: 
 Consumption Vocabulary and Preference Formation.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 120-35
Issue: 2
Volume: 23
Year: 1996
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 Consumers' understanding of their own preferences can be aided by a
 "consumption vocabulary"--a taxonomy or framework that facilitates
 identifying the relation between a product's features and one's evaluation
 of the product. In the absence of such a vocabulary, consumers'
 understanding of their own preferences will require more extensive
 experience and may never fully develop. The effect of such a vocabulary is
 tested in two experiments in which subjects provided with a vocabulary (1)
 exhibit better-defined and more consistent preferences than control
 subjects, (2) show improved cue discovery, and (3) show learning (i.e.,
 increases in consistency over time). All results hold regardless of the
 functional form of the model used to assess subjects' preference
 formation.

Title: 
 Are Studies of Dark Side Variables Confounded by Socially Desirable Responding? The Case of Materialism.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 106-19
Issue: 2
Volume: 23
Year: 1996
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 Socially desirable responding (SDR) is the tendency of individuals to
 make themselves look good according to current cultural norms when
 answering researchers' questions. For over 50 years in the social
 sciences, SDR has been a complex and controversial issue, typically viewed
 as a contaminating response bias. Meanwhile, most consumer researchers
 have neglected SDR, including those studying sensitive "dark side" topics
 where SDR could have an especially detrimental impact on research
 conclusions. This article reviews conceptual, measurement, and statistical
 analysis issues related to SDR. Two surveys are then reported that explore
 the effect of SDR on testing propositions about the nomological network
 surrounding the materialism value. Implications and recommendations are
 discussed for investigating SDR in consumer research, including
 opportunities for future contributions.
