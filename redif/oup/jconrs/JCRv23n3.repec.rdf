Title: 
 The Moderating Role of Prior Knowledge in Schema-Based Product Evaluation.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 177-92
Issue: 3
Volume: 23
Year: 1996
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 Recent evidence suggests that a new product is evaluated more favorably
 when its attributes are moderately incongruent with an activated product
 category schema than when its attributes are either congruent or extremely
 incongruent with the schema. We extend this finding by showing that it
 obtains when consumers have limited knowledge about the product category.
 When consumers possess elaborate knowledge about the category, their
 evaluations are unaffected by the level of congruity but rather are
 influenced by their schema-based associations to specific product
 attributes. These findings are discussed in terms of current theorizing
 related to schema congruity and schema-based inferencing.

Title: 
 Notes toward an Application of McCracken's "Cultural Categories" for Cross-Cultural Consumer Research.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 204-18
Issue: 3
Volume: 23
Year: 1996
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 The importance to cross-cultural consumer research of an encompassing yet
 intricate approach to evaluating the role of culture has been broadly
 recognized. This article charts a procedure for operationalizing the
 descriptive term "cultural categories" for this purpose. By analyzing the
 acceptance, use, and meaning-attachment patterns of selected goods or
 services in a given environment, culture-exclusive (and nonexclusive)
 categories can be discerned and labeled. Explanation and illustration of
 this approach are drawn from a field investigation conducted in western
 Japan.

Title: 
 Preschoolers' Learning of Brand Names from Visual Cues.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 251-61
Issue: 3
Volume: 23
Year: 1996
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 This research addresses the question of how perceptual cues affect
 preschoolers' learning of brand names. It is found that when visual cues
 are provided in addition to brand names that are prior-associated in
 children's memory structures, children better remember the brand names.
 Although two cues (a picture and a color) improve memory over the
 imposition of a single cue, extensive visual cues may overtax young
 children's processing abilities. The study contributes to our
 understanding of how visual cues increase the effectiveness of nonverbal
 communication.
