Title: 
 Family Structure, Materialism, and Compulsive Consumption.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 312-25
Issue: 4
Volume: 23
Year: 1997
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 Despite the rapid and dramatic changes in the structure of the American
 family over the past thirty years (e.g., divorce, single parenting),
 consumer researchers have largely neglected the issue of how alternative
 family forms influence consumer behavior. The authors' initial inquiry
 into this area finds that young adults reared in disrupted families are
 more materialistic and exhibit higher levels of compulsive consumption
 than young adults reared in intact families. Furthermore, they show that
 the relationship between family structure and compulsive consumption is
 partially mediated by both the amount of resources available within the
 family and the degree of family stress. The authors also find that the
 impact of family disruption on family stress is moderated by socioeconomic
 status. They conclude by proposing an agenda for future research that
 considers the antecedents, processes, and consequences of alternative
 family structures as they relate to consumer behavior.

Title: 
 All Cues Are Not Created Equal: Obtaining Attitude Persistence under Low-Involvement Conditions.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 351-61
Issue: 4
Volume: 23
Year: 1997
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 Attitude persistence research in consumer behavior has been predominantly
 associated with high- rather than low-involvement processing. Advertising,
 however, is most often processed as a low-involvement communication. The
 authors predict that different low-involvement cues lead to different
 degrees of attitude persistence. Consistent with this prediction, they
 find that under low-involvement conditions, when both related and
 unrelated peripheral cues evoke similar initial attitudes, only when the
 cue is related to the product category do attitudes persist over time. The
 results of two studies attest to the robustness of the phenomenon and add
 to current models of attitude persistence by showing that peripherally
 processed advertising cues (e.g., brand names and celebrity endorsers) may
 lead to persistence if they are related to the product being endorsed.

Title: 
 The Effect of Common Features on Brand Choice: Moderating Role of Attribute Importance.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 304-11
Issue: 4
Volume: 23
Year: 1997
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 In this article, the effect of common features on brand choice and the
 moderating role of attribute importance are examined. It is argued that
 when brand attributes differ in importance, common features are likely to
 enhance consumer preferences for the option with the best value on the
 most important attribute, thus further polarizing brands' choice shares.
 In contrast, when attributes are similar in their importance, common
 features are likely to have an opposite effect, equalizing brands' shares.
 The data provide support for these propositions.

Title: 
 Consumer Memory for Television Advertising: A Field Study of Duration, Serial Position, and Competition Effects.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 362-72
Issue: 4
Volume: 23
Year: 1997
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 The authors simultaneously analyze the impact on consumer memory of the
 duration and serial position of a commercial and of the number of
 competing commercials in a block using a marketplace database of 2,677
 television commercials. Their results indicate that duration, competition,
 and the time lag until the onset of a commercial in a block have large
 effect sizes, while primacy and recency have only modest effect sizes. By
 decomposing serial position into its ordinal and time-lag aspects, this
 study shows that recency effects are masked by the time until the onset of
 a commercial in a block. The findings suggest that, given comparable costs
 and a goal to maximize brand recall, placing a commercial first is better
 than placing it last. In addition, the analyses identify several
 significant and previously undocumented interactions.

Title: 
 Consumer Information Search Revisited: Theory and Empirical Analysis.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 263-77
Issue: 4
Volume: 23
Year: 1997
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 A comprehensive theoretical framework for understanding consumers'
 information search behavior is presented. Unlike previous research, our
 model identifies not only what factors affect consumers' search behavior
 but also how these factors interact with each other. In particular, the
 model emphasizes the effect of prior brand perceptions on the search
 process. We argue that when consumers have brand-specific prior
 distributions of utility, the existence of relative uncertainty among
 brands is necessary for search to be useful. Thus, we explain why product
 class involvement or low search costs may not be sufficient to induce
 large amounts of search activity and why there may be an inverted-U-shaped
 relationship between search activity and experience. We test our theory on
 consumers' search behavior for new automobiles, using data collected
 contempraneously with consumers' actual decision process. Our data support
 our theory.
