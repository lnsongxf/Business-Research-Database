Title: 
 An Empirical Analysis of Price Endings with Scanner Data.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 57-67
Issue: 1
Volume: 24
Year: 1997
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 Several consumer behavior theories have been offered to explain the
 preponderance of prices that end in the digit 9. This study attempts to
 incorporate these proposed behaviors into the implicit utility function of
 consumer choice models, resulting in both a more accurate tool for
 managerial decision making and additional insights into how consumers
 actually behave toward price endings. An attempt is made to compensate for
 both level effects (those effects in which consumers may underestimate the
 value of a price) and image effects (those effects in which consumers may
 infer meaning from the right-hand digits). The models are estimated using
 scanner panel data for two frequently purchased products, tuna and yogurt.
 The results support the importance of accounting for the digits in
 consumer choice models, providing evidence for both image effects and
 level effects.

Title: 
 The Role of Inference in Context Effects: Inferring What You Want from What Is Available.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 118-25

Abstract:

 It has recently been suggested that a number of experimental findings of
 context effects in choice settings can be explained by the ability of
 subjects to draw choice-relevant inferences from the stimuli. We aim to
 measure the importance of this explanation. To do so, inferences are
 assessed in an experiment using the basic context-effect design,
 supplemented by direct measures of inferred locations of available
 products on the price-quality Hotelling line. We use these measures to
 estimate a predicted context effect due to inference alone. For our
 stimuli, we find that the inference effect accounts for two-thirds of the
 average magnitude of the context effect and for about one-half of the
 cross-category context-effect variance.

Title: 
 The Effects of Incidental Ad Exposure on the Formation of Consideration Sets.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 94-104
Issue: 1
Volume: 24
Year: 1997
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 This study extends research on incidental ad exposure by examining
 whether incidental exposure to an ad increases the likelihood that a
 product depicted in the ad will be included in a consideration set.
 Incidental ad exposure implies that an ad receives minimal attentional
 resources while other more relevant information is being processed.
 Results suggest that the incidental exposure effect is fairly robust,
 occurring across a variety of factors (when the consideration set
 formation context was memory or stimulus based, when the buying situation
 was familiar or unfamiliar, and across two different product classes).
 Further, these effects were found despite subjects' lack of explicit
 memory for the ads.

Title: 
 Toward an Understanding of Consumer Ambivalence.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 80-93
Issue: 1
Volume: 24
Year: 1997
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 A case study of wedding planning is used to explore the concept of
 consumer ambivalence. Focus groups, in-depth interviews, and shopping
 trips were employed to generate text. A formal definition of consumer
 ambivalence is provided. Our analysis revealed four antecedents of
 consumer ambivalence: expectation versus reality, overload, role conflict
 with purchase influences, and custom and value conflict. These antecedents
 were then linked to particular coping strategies that informants employed
 to manage the ambivalence that was generated. Suggestions of how future
 research might explore consumer ambivalence are offered.

Title: 
 Mere-Possession Effects without Possession in Consumer Choice.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 105-17
Issue: 1
Volume: 24
Year: 1997
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 In this article we examine whether and why preferences for a good
 produced by its mere and arbitrary possession (i.e., a mere-possession
 effect) occurs even in the absence of actual possession. In two
 experiments, we demonstrate that merely possessing a coupon for a product,
 as opposed to the actual product, can increase consumers' preference for
 that option over its competitors' in real choices from meaningfully
 comparable choice sets. In addition, a characterization of the cognitive
 processes underlying this phenomenon, and its variation with individual
 perceptions of task meaningfulness, provides support for a loss-aversion
 account of consumers' possession-induced preferences for goods they do not
 actually possess.
