Title: 
 Evaluating Persuasion-Enhancing Techniques from a Resource-Matching Perspective.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 178-91
Issue: 2
Volume: 24
Year: 1997
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 This article examines how two ad execution characteristics intended to
 heighten persuasion can influence the resources required to process an ad
 under high and low motivation conditions. These ad execution
 characteristics include (1) whether the ad copy is narrative or factual
 and (2) whether the ad layout either physically integrates or separates
 the ad picture and ad claims. Results reveal that under low motivation,
 persuasion is unaffected by these two execution characteristics but
 instead is affected by heuristic aspects of the ad photo. Under high
 motivations whether persuasion is heightened or undermined appears to
 depend on the extent to which the ad execution characteristics render the
 resources needed to process the ad equal to, in excess of, or inadequate
 compared with those that motivated viewers have available for processing
 the ad.

Title: 
 Measuring Emotions in the Consumption Experience.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 127-46
Issue: 2
Volume: 24
Year: 1997
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 Although consumption-related emotions have been studied with increasing
 frequency in consumer behavior, issues concerning the appropriate way to
 measure these emotions remain unresolved This article reviews the emotion
 measures currently used in consumer research and the theories on which
 they are based; it concludes that the existing measures are unsuited for
 the purpose of measuring consumption-related emotions. The article
 describes six empirical studies that assess the domain of
 consumption-related emotions, that identify an appropriate set of
 consumption emotion descriptors (the CES), and that compare the usefulness
 of this descriptor set with the usefulness of other measures in assessing
 consumption-related emotions.

Title: 
 There Are Many Reasons to Drive a BMW: Does Imagined Ease of Argument Generation Influence Attitudes?

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 170-77
Issue: 2
Volume: 24
Year: 1997
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 The effects of imagined versus actual ease of self-generating
 product-related information were investigated. An ad invited recipients to
 name either one reason or 10 reasons for (against) choosing a BMW over a
 Mercedes. Participants who complied with the task experienced the
 retrieval of one reason as easier than the retrieval of 10 reasons.
 Participants who did not comply nevertheless imagined the former as easier
 than the latter. Independent of whether ease was actually experienced or
 merely imagined participants evaluated BMW more (less) favorably and
 Mercedes less (more) favorably when the retrieval was easy rather than
 difficult.

Title: 
 Adolescent-Parent Interaction in Family Decision Making.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 159-69
Issue: 2
Volume: 24
Year: 1997
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 This article presents a classification of both adolescent influence
 strategies and parental response strategies, developed from in-depth
 interviews with adolescents, mothers, and fathers. In addition, the
 perceived effectiveness of adolescent influence strategies is examined,
 revealing that adolescents are most successful in their influence attempts
 when they emulate adult strategies. Implications of these findings for
 future research are discussed.

Title: 
 Patterns of Rightmost Digits Used in Advertised Prices: Implications for Nine-Ending Effects.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 192-201
Issue: 2
Volume: 24
Year: 1997
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 Analysis of the rightmost digits of selling prices in a sample of retail
 price advertisements confirmed past findings indicating the
 overrepresentation of the digits 0, 5, and 9. The high cognitive
 accessibility of round numbers can account for the overrepresentation of
 0- and 5-ending prices and suggests the existence of two effects that
 could account for the overrepresentation of 9-ending prices: (1) a
 tendency of consumers to perceive a 9-ending price as a round-number price
 with a small amount given back and (2) a tendency of consumers to
 underestimate a 9-ending price by encoding it as the first round number
 evoked during incomplete left-to-right processing. Analysis of the
 patterns of rightmost digits observed in the sample provides supportive
 evidence particularly for the second of these two 9-ending effects.
