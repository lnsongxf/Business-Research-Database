Title: 
 Consumer Learning by Analogy: A Model of Internal Knowledge Transfer.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 266-84
Issue: 3
Volume: 24
Year: 1997
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 Although knowledge transfer has been found to be an important learning
 mechanism in several consumer behavior domains, our understanding of the
 nature and scope of the transfer process is still in its infancy. In this
 article, we develop a conceptual model to explain how previously acquired
 knowledge is transferred in the process of consumer learning. Augmenting
 analogical learning theory with research on expertise effects and
 conceptual development, our model details the underlying stages in the
 process of knowledge transfer and identifies key factors influencing the
 nature and outcome of each stage. Applying our model to several consumer
 behavior contexts, we demonstrate its utility both as a tool for enhancing
 our understanding of knowledge transfer and as a productive guide to
 future research on consumer learning.

Title: 
 Vividness Effects: A Resource-Matching Perspective.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 295-304
Issue: 3
Volume: 24
Year: 1997
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 The authors present a resource-matching perspective to explain the
 relationship between vividness and persuasion. Three experiments confirm
 the predicted inverted-U relationship between resource allocation and
 persuasion for vivid information, and a positive linear relationship
 between resource allocation and persuasion for nonvivid information when
 vivid information is less resource demanding than nonvivid information.
 This persuasion pattern is reversed in experiment 4, where nonvivid
 information is less resource demanding than vivid information; that is,
 there is an inverted-U relationship for nonvivid information, and a
 positive linear relationship for vivid information. The contrasting
 persuasion functions for vivid and nonvivid information can predict when
 vivid information will be more versus less persuasive than nonvivid
 information.

Title: 
 Contingent Processes of 
Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 249-65
Issue: 3
Volume: 24
Year: 1997
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 Effective communication requires that consumers attribute the message
 content to its intended source. The proposed framework distinguishes four
 types of source identification processes--cued retrieval, memory-trace
 refreshment, schematic inferencing, and pure guessing--and delineates
 their contingencies. Two experiments examine portions of the framework,
 and experiment 2 introduces a new methodology for decomposing multiple
 processes. Findings suggest that when cued retrieval fails, consumers try
 to refresh the original memory trace for the learning episode--a process
 that is effortful. They invoke schematic inferencing only if the original
 memory trace cannot be refreshed. Reliance on cued retrieval seems to
 require little processing capacity. If there is some motivation for
 accuracy, pure guessing appears to be invoked only as a last resort.

Title: 
 Visual Attention to Advertising: A Segment-Level Analysis.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 305-14
Issue: 3
Volume: 24
Year: 1997
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 We propose a methodology to study the effects of physical ad properties
 on consumers' visual attention to advertising that accounts for
 heterogeneity in these effects across consumers. In an illustrative
 experiment, we monitor consumers' eye movements during naturalistic
 exposure to a consumer magazine, in which experimentally designed ads are
 inserted. A latent class regression model accounting for heterogeneity
 across consumers through unobserved segments is used to analyze the eye
 movement data in detail. Three consumer segments are identified that
 exhibit distinct patterns of visual attention as well as different
 profiles of product involvement, brand attitude, and advertising recall.
 Implications for visual attention theory and for advertising research are
 discussed.

Title: 
 Age Differences in Consumers' Processing Strategies: An Investigation of Moderating Influences.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 329-42
Issue: 3
Volume: 24
Year: 1997
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 Relative to younger adults, older adults appear to exhibit greater use of
 schema-based, as opposed to detailed, processing strategies. This
 relationship is investigated in an experimental study that examines the
 moderating influences of two marketing-relevant variables, incongruity of
 message items and optimal time of day. Signal detection analysis performed
 on recognition measures serves as basis for assessing strategy use. Both
 older and younger adults, during their optimal times of day (morning and
 evening respectively) engage in detailed processing, but this tendency is
 particularly pronounced for the elderly when exposed to high-incongruity
 cues. By contrast, during their nonoptimal time of day, older adults seem
 to rely on schema-based processing regardless of the level of incongruity,
 whereas younger adults remain relatively detailed in their processing
 strategies. Theoretical and practical implications for marketing are
 discussed.

Title: 
 The Effect of Cultural Orientation on Persuasion.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 315-28
Issue: 3
Volume: 24
Year: 1997
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 The objective of this research is to assess the cross-cultural
 generalizability of persuasion effects predicted by dual process models.
 In two experiments, the impact of motivation, congruity of persuasive
 communication and the diagnosticity of heuristic cues on the processing
 strategies and product evaluations of members of a collectivist culture
 were compared with findings documented in past research in individualist
 cultures. This research supports the view that perceptual differences in
 cue diagnosticity account for systematic differences in persuasive effects
 across cultures. It is also suggested that existing theoretical
 frameworks, specifically the dual process models of persuasion, are robust
 across cultures and can help predict and explain cultural differences.

Title: 
 Factors Affecting the Impact of Negatively and Positively Framed Ad Messages.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 285-94
Issue: 3
Volume: 24
Year: 1997
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 This article examines the effects of negative and positive framing of ad
 claims on consume~s choices and attitudes. Propositions about how the
 extent of processing before choice affects the relative impact of
 claims-related versus advertising tactics-related cognitions are tested in
 three experiments. Findings suggest that when processing is limited,
 claims-related cognitions have a greater impact on choice, which results
 in the sponsoring brand being chosen more often when the ad claims are
 negatively framed than when they are positively framed. When respondents
 engage in more extensive processing before choice, tactics-related
 cognitions become more accessible and, if perceived to be unfair, result
 in an attenuation of the advantage of negative framing over positive
 framing. A different pattern of results is obtained when one examines
 brand attitudes rather than brand choice.
