Title: 
 The Effects of Television Consumption on Social Percrptions: The Use of Priming Procedures to Investigate Psychological Processes.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 447-58
Issue: 4
Volume: 24
Year: 1998
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 Two studies investigated the extent to which heavy television viewing
 affects consumers perceptions of social reality and the cognitive
 processes that underlie these effects. Both studies found evidence heavy
 viewers beliefs about social reality are more consistent with the content
 of television programming than are those of light viewers. The use of a
 priming methodology provided support for the notion that television is a
 causal factor in the formation of these beliefs and that a failure to
 discount television-based exemplars in forming these beliefs accounts for
 its influence. Implications of these results for a heuristic processing
 model of television effects are discussed.

Title: 
 Donations to Charity as Purchase Incentives: How Well They Work May Depend on What You Are Trying to Sell.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 434-46
Issue: 4
Volume: 24
Year: 1998
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 This article focuses on the bundling of products with promised
 contributions to charity. Two lab experiments and one field study are
 conducted that compare the effectiveness of promised donations to charity
 in promoting "practical necessities" (e.g., a box of laundry detergent) to
 their effectiveness in promoting "frivolous luxuries" (e.g., a hot fudge
 sundae). The results suggest that charity incentives are more
 effective-in-promoting frivolous products than in promoting practical
 products. This research extends prior work on the effects of bundling
 complementary positive outcomes into the domain of affect-based
 complementarity with product-charity bundles.

Title: 
 Pennies-a-Day: The Effect of Temporal Reframing on Transaction Evaluation.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 395-408
Issue: 4
Volume: 24
Year: 1998
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 To increase transaction compliance, marketers sometimes temporally
 reframe the cost of a product from an aggregate one-time expense to a
 series of small ongoing expenses, often in spite of the fact that the
 physical payments remain aggregated. This temporal reframing is identified
 in this article as the "pennies-a-day" (PAD) strategy. A two-step consumer
 decision-making process of (1) comparison retrieval and (2) transaction
 evaluation is posited to explain effectiveness of this strategy. In a
 series of laboratory studies, general support for PAD effectiveness across
 a range of product categories and specific support for the proposed
 two-step model was found. The PAD framing of a target transaction is shown
 to systematically foster the retrieval and consideration of small ongoing
 expenses as the standard of comparison, whereas an aggregate framing of
 that same transaction is shown to foster the retrieval and consideration
 of large infrequent expenses. This difference in retrieval is shown to
 significantly influence subsequent transaction evaluation and compliance.

Title: 
 The Influence of Unity and Prototypicality on Aesthetic Responses to New Product Designs.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 374-94
Issue: 4
Volume: 24
Year: 1998
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 Unity and prototypicality are important visual aspects of product design.
 These design principles were operationalized by modifying line drawings of
 existing products. The results of four experiments provide evidence that
 these two factors positively affect aesthetic response. These effects were
 strongest when visual properties were the sole basis of judgment and when
 design variations were easily compared. However, they persisted when
 aesthetic aspects were combined with other product information and when
 comparing design features was difficult. The effect of unity was found to
 be superadditive, suggesting that it has a relational, "all-or-none"
 character. Finally, regression analyses show that direct effects of the
 design modifications on aesthetic response exist in addition to possible
 indirect effects that are mediated by perceived typicality.

Title: 
 The Effect of Delay Type and Service Stage on Consumers' Reactions to Waiting.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 469-79
Issue: 4
Volume: 24
Year: 1998
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 This study considers the interaction effect of service stage
 (conceptualized as the distance to the goal state of the service
 encounter) and delay type (procedural, correctional, and unknown) on
 consumers' reactions to waiting. Field theory suggests that the further
 away a delay occurs from the goal state of the service encounter, the more
 negative its impact will be on consumers. The anticipatory model, however,
 suggests that the direction of the impact should be the other way around.
 Results obtained from an experimental study confirm that the nature of the
 delay, in terms of whether it constitutes a threat to the successful
 completion of a task or not, moderates the impact of service stage (i.e.,
 how close to the goal state the delay occurs) on consumers reactions to
 the wait.

Title: 
 Product Category Familiarity and Preference Construction.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 459-68
Issue: 4
Volume: 24
Year: 1998
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 Marketers often base decisions about marketing strategies on the results
 of research designed to elicit information about consumers' preferences. A
 large body of research indicates, however, that preferences often are
 labile. That is, preferences can be reversed depending on factors such as
 how the preference is elicited. In three studies, we examine the effect of
 familiarity in two preference elicitation tasks, choice and matching
 judgments. We provide evidence of an interaction between familiarity and
 response mode (choice or matching) in each study. In study 3, we test the
 explanation that preference reversals may occur when the interaction of
 response mode with product-category familiarity leads to systematic
 changes in attribute weighting.
