Title: 
 Knowledge, Information Mode, and the Attraction Effect.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 64-77
Issue: 1
Volume: 25
Year: 1998
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 This article focuses on the complex role of category knowledge in context
 effects by examining how knowledge interacts with the mode of information
 presentation (verbal vs. numerical) to moderate the magnitude of the
 attraction effect. On the basis of Chakravarti and Lynch's framework for
 understanding context effects and prior research on consumer knowledge we
 delineate two distinct influences of knowledge on the choice process and
 demonstrate that the moderating influence of knowledge on the attraction
 effect varies with the information mode. When the choice set information
 is presented numerically, greater category knowledge attenuates the
 attraction effect, but when information is presented verbally, greater
 knowledge actually increases the size of the attraction effect. The
 implications of these findings for the role of knowledge in consumer
 context effects are discussed.

Title: 
 Integrating Multiple Opinions: The Role of Aspiration Level on Consumer Response to Critic Consensus.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 38-51
Issue: 1
Volume: 25
Year: 1998
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 Four studies examine the process by which consumers integrate critic
 opinions and attribute information into their product evaluations and how
 critic consensus affects this process. A reference-dependent model is
 proposed such that consumer response to consensus depends on whether the
 average critic rating for an alterative is above or below an aspiration
 level. Consensus is shown to be preferred for alternatives above an
 aspiration level, whereas critic disagreement is preferred for
 alternatives below an aspiration level. Consumers exhibited a tendency to
 prefer critic disagreement for high-priced products or decisions
 associated with high social risk because most alternatives fell below
 their high aspiration levels.

Title: 
 Assessing Measurement Invariance in Cross-National Consumer Research.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 78-90
Issue: 1
Volume: 25
Year: 1998
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 Assessing the applicability of frameworks developed in one country to
 other countries is an important step in establishing the generalizability
 of consumer behavior theories. In order for such comparisons to be
 meaningful, however, the instruments used to measure the theoretical
 constructs of interest have to exhibit adequate cross-national
 equivalence. We review the various forms of measurement invariance that
 have been proposed in the literature, organize them into a coherent
 conceptual framework that ties different requirements of measure
 equivalence to the goals of the research, and propose a practical,
 sequential testing procedure for assessing measurement invariance in
 cross-national consumer research. The approach is based on multisample
 confirmatory factor analysis and clarifies under what conditions
 meaningful comparisons of construct conceptualizations. construct means,
 and relationships between constructs are possible. An empirical
 application dealing with the single-factor construct of consumer
 ethnocentrism in Belgium, Great Britain, and Greece is provided to
 illustrate the procedure.
