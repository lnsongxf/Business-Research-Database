Title: 
 Payment Depreciation: The Behavioral Effects of Temporally Separating Payments from Consumption.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 160-74
Issue: 2
Volume: 25
Year: 1998
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 Research suggests that individuals mentally track the costs and benefits
 of a consumer transaction for the purpose of reconciling those costs and
 benefits on completion of the transaction (Prelec and Loewenstein 1998;
 Thaler 1980,1985). In transactions where costs precede benefits, this can
 lead to a systematic and economically irrational attention to sunk costs
 (Arkes and Blumer 1985; Thaler 1980). In this article, we consider
 economic exchanges in which costs significantly precede benefits, as with
 many prepayment types of consumer transactions. We predict a consumer will
 gradually adapt to a historic cost with the passage of time, thereby
 decreasing its sunk-cost impact on the consumption of a pending benefit.
 We label this process of gradual adaptation to costs 'payment
 depreciation." In a series of experiments, we find evidence of payment
 depreciation across a range of consumer transactions and offer insight
 into the behavioral implications of temporally separating costs from
 benefits.

Title: 
 Will Products Look More Attractive When Presented Separately or Together?

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 175-86
Issue: 2
Volume: 25
Year: 1998
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 This research examines whether each of two different options of
 comparable overall quality will be perceived more positively when
 presented in isolation and evaluated separately (separate evaluation) or
 when juxtaposed and evaluated side by side (joint evaluation). Six
 studies, involving either judgment or choice as the dependent variable,
 reveal a general principle: If the focal options are already attractive
 (relative to their natural reference) in separate evaluation, then
 subjecting these options to joint evaluation will hurt their
 attractiveness. If the focal options are unattractive (relative to their
 reference) in separate evaluation, subjecting them to joint evaluation
 will enhance their attractiveness.

Title: 
 Paradoxes of Technology: Consumer Cognizance, Emotions, and Coping Strategies.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 123-43
Issue: 2
Volume: 25
Year: 1998
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 Although technological products are unavoidable in contemporary life,
 studies focusing on them in the consumer behavior field have been few and
 narrow. In this article, we investigate consumers' perspectives, meanings,
 and experiences in relation to a range of technological products,
 emphasizing lengthy and repeated interviews with 29 households, including
 a set of first-time owners. We draw on literatures spanning from
 technology, paradox, and postmodernism to clinical and social psychology,
 and combine them with data collection and analysis in the spirit of
 grounded theory. The outcome is a new conceptual framework on the
 paradoxes of technological products and their influences on emotional
 reactions and behavioral coping strategies. We discuss the findings in
 terms of implications for theories of technology, innovation diffusion,
 and human coping, and an expanded role for the paradox construct in
 consumer research.

Title: 
 Representativeness, Relevance, and the Use of Feelings in Decision Making.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 144-59
Issue: 2
Volume: 25
Year: 1998
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 It has been suggested that evaluations may be based on a
 "How-do-I-feel-about-it?" heuristic, which involves holding a
 representation of the target in mind and inspecting feelings that this
 representation may elicit. Previous studies have shown that reliance on
 such feelings depends on whether or not they are believed to be
 representative of the target. This article argues that reliance on
 feelings also depends on whether feelings toward the target are regarded
 as relevant. Consistent with this thesis, findings from three experiments
 indicate that reliance on the "How-do-I-feel-about-it?" heuristic is more
 likely when the decision maker has consummatory as opposed to instrumental
 motives. Results also suggest that subtle feelings toward the target are
 indeed instantiated in the process, and that the process may be more
 likely among individuals with a propensity to process information in a
 visual and sensory manner.

Title: 
 Language Structure and Categorization: A Study of Classifiers in Consumer Cognition, Judgment, and Choice.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 108-22
Issue: 2
Volume: 25
Year: 1998
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 Using classifiers--lexical items that depict perceptual and conceptual
 properties of object---six cross-cultural experiments were conducted in
 the People's Republic of China, Hong Kong, Japan, and the United States to
 investigate how structural features of languages affect mental structures
 and, in turn, consumer behavior. Experiments 1-4 show how classifiers
 affect the perceived similarity between objects, attribute accessibility,
 and concept organization. Experiment 5 shows how classifier-based schemata
 result in inferences about product features. Experiment 6 provides
 evidence for the effect of classifiers on judgment and choice via
 assimilation and contrast processes and affect transfer. We discuss our
 findings in light of the Whorfian hypothesis and argue for the
 incorporation of structural components of languages into models of
 consumer behavior.
