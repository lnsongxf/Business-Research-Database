Title: 
 Empathy versus Pride: The Influence of Emotional Appeals across Cultures.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 241-61
Issue: 3
Volume: 25
Year: 1998
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 This research examines the persuasive effect of emotional appeals on
 members of collectivist versus individualist cultures. The results of two
 experiments demonstrate that ego-focused (e.g., pride, happiness) versus
 other-focused (e.g., empathy, peacefulness) emotional appeals lead to more
 favorable attitudes for members of a collectivist culture, while
 other-focused versus ego-focused emotional appeals lead to more favorable
 attitudes for members of an individualist culture. Experiment 2 was
 conducted to examine the psychological mechanism underlying these effects.
 The results indicated that the generation of and elaboration on a
 relatively novel type of thought (individual thoughts for members of a
 collectivist culture, collective thoughts for members of an individualist
 culture) account for the persuasive effects found in this research. These
 results are interpreted within an ability-motivation framework, and
 theoretical implications involving cross-cultural persuasion effects are
 discussed.

Title: 
 The Effects of Recognition and Group Need on Volunteerism: A Social Norm Perspective.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 262-75
Issue: 3
Volume: 25
Year: 1998
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 The significance of volunteering for both individuals and society has
 lead to numerous studies on this behavior across the social sciences.
 However, virtually no prior research has evaluated how and to what extent
 organizations can effectively encourage individuals to contribute time to
 a worthy cause. The present research uses a social norm perspective to
 examine the conditions under which promotional appeals based on group need
 and promises of recognition affect volunteerism. The perspective suggests
 that norm compliance can be expected only when the prescribed behavior is
 both important to the group's welfare and subject to group-mediated
 rewards. Consequently, we hypothesize that promotional appeals based on
 group need and promised recognition are effective only when they are used
 in combination. Results of a laboratory and a field experiment are
 consistent with this hypothesis and provide insights into the process by
 which the appeals affect individuals' decisions to help. The results also
 have implications for understanding and promoting other socially desirable
 behaviors such as recycling, energy conservation, litter reduction, and
 the purchase of "green" products.

Title: 
 Constructive Consumer Choice Processes.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 187-217
Issue: 3
Volume: 25
Year: 1998
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 Consumer decision making has been a focal interest in consumer research,
 and consideration of current marketplace trends ( e.g., technological
 change, an information explosion) indicates that this topic will continue
 to be critically important. We argue that consumer choice is inherently
 constructive. Due to limited processing capacity, consumers often do not
 have well-defined existing preferences, but construct them using a variety
 of strategies contingent on task demands. After describing constructive
 choice, consumer decision tasks, and decision strategies, we provide an
 integrative framework for understanding constructive choice, review
 evidence for constructive consumer choice in light of that framework, and
 identify knowledge gaps that suggest opportunities for additional
 research.

Title: 
 The Effect of Ownership History on the Valuation of Objects.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 276-89
Issue: 3
Volume: 25
Year: 1998
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 Previous work on the endowment effect has demonstrated that current
 ownership status affects object valuation and that this effect occurs
 instantaneously on possession of an object. The current work presents
 findings from four studies which indicate that the history of past
 ownership can also affect object valuation. For objects currently in one's
 possession, we find that valuation increases with duration of ownership.
 For objects not in one's possession, previous ownership experience
 increases valuation, and the increase appears to be related to the
 duration of ownership before loss. In addition, the perceived
 attractiveness of objects, although not instantly affected by endowment,
 is found to increase with duration of ownership.

Title: 
 The Influence of Display Characteristics on Visual Exploratory Search Behavior.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 290-301
Issue: 3
Volume: 25
Year: 1998
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 Visual information search is a combination of two distinct types of
 behavior. Goal-directed search behavior occurs when consumers use stored
 search routines to collect information in a deliberate manner. In
 contrast, exploratory search behavior occurs when consumers are confronted
 with multiple pieces of information but have little stored knowledge about
 how to proceed with the information gathering. This article reports on an
 investigation into exploratory search behavior and attempts to establish a
 connection between the layout of objects in a display and the amount of
 attention devoted to each of these objects. The research has implications
 for catalog page layout and visual merchandising.
