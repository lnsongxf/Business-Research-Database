Title: 
 A Range Theory Account of Price Perception.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 353-68
Issue: 4
Volume: 25
Year: 1999
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 It is well accepted in the behavioral pricing literature that a
 consumer's perception of the attractiveness of a market price depends on a
 comparison of the market price to an internal reference price. The
 rationale underlying this dynamic has its roots in Adaptation-Level
 Theory. However, consistent with Range Theory, we postulate that a
 consumer's assessment of the attractiveness of a market price may also
 depend on a comparison of the market price to the endpoints of the evoked
 price range. Four experiments provide evidence that variance in the width
 of the evoked price range affects price-attractiveness judgments in the
 absence of any variance in the internal reference price. Of theoretical
 importance, findings from the present article suggest that pricing theory
 is in need of augmentation in order to account for this effect. Of
 managerial relevance, these findings suggest that changes in context can
 bring about changes in the evoked price range and perceptions of the
 attractiveness of a market price.

Title: 
 Postexperience Advertising Effects on Consumer Memory.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 319-34
Issue: 4
Volume: 25
Year: 1999
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 Past research suggests that marketing communications create expectations
 that influence the way consumers subsequently learn from their product
 experiences. Since postexperience information can also be important and is
 widespread for established goods and services, it is appropriate to ask
 about the cognitive effects of these efforts. The postexperience
 advertising situation is conceptualized here as an instant
 source-forgetting problem where the language and imagery from the recently
 presented advertising become confused with consumers' own experiential
 memories. It is suggested that, through a reconstructive memory process,
 this advertising information affects how and what consumers remember.
 Consumers may come to believe that their past product experience had been
 as suggested by the advertising. Over time this postexperience advertising
 information can become incorporated into the brand schema and influence
 future product decisions.

Title: 
 Gift Receipt and the Reformulation of Interpersonal Relationships.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 385-402
Issue: 4
Volume: 25
Year: 1999
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 Sherry (1983) defines reformulation as the final stage of gift exchange,
 during which a newly presented gift can impact the relationship between
 giver and recipient. To date no one has examined exactly how gifts can
 affect relationships or what aspects of gift exchange contribute to
 realignment of the giver/recipient relationship. Using depth interviews
 and critical-incident surveys, our study explores how the recipient's
 perceptions of the existing relationship, the gift, the ritual context,
 and his or her emotional reactions converge to affect relationship
 realignment. We identify six relational effects of gift-receipt
 experiences. Further, we examine gift-receipt experiences that have a
 consistent impact in the short and long term, and those where the meanings
 and relational effects appear to change over time. Implications for future
 research are also discussed.

Title: 
 Culture Swapping: Consumption and the Ethnogenesis of Middle-Class Haitian Immigrants.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 303-18
Issue: 4
Volume: 25
Year: 1999
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 By means of an ethnographic study of a Haitian family in the midwestern
 United States, this article demonstrates how ethnic consumers "culture
 swap," using goods to move between one cultural identity and another as
 they negotiate relations between home and host cultures. This
 interpretation of consumer behavior is grounded in a semiotics of
 performance, emphasizing the dynamic and mutable nature of self, social
 identity, and cultural identification in global consumer culture.
