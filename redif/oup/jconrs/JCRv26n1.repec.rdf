Title: 
 Lifestyle of the Tight and Frugal: Theory and Measurement.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 85-98
Issue: 1
Volume: 26
Year: 1999
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 Who has not known a tightwad? Yet this pervasive consumer trait--being
 frugal--has been ignored in the scholarly consumer behavior literature.
 This research articulates the nature of this overlooked consumer trait and
 then develops, evaluates, and empirically applies a multi-item scale of
 frugality. The results from a six-study program of empirical research are
 reported. These studies describe (1) the psychometric properties of a
 frugality measure, (2) demonstrations of how frugality assists the
 empirical study of consumer usage and acquisition behaviors, and (3)
 frugality scale norms from a probability sample of the general adult
 population.

Title: 
 Visual Rhetoric in Advertising: Text-Interpretive, Experimental, and Reader-Response Analyses.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 37-54
Issue: 1
Volume: 26
Year: 1999
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 Text interpretations, two experiments, and a set of reader-response
 interviews examine the impact of stylistic elements in advertising that
 form visual rhetorical figures parallel to those found in language. The
 visual figures examined here--rhyme, antithesis, metaphor, and
 pun--produced more elaboration and led to a more favorable attitude toward
 the ad, without being any more difficult to comprehend. Interviews
 confirmed that several of the meanings generated by informants
 corresponded to those produced by an a priori text-interpretive analysis
 of the ads. However, all of these effects diminished or disappeared for
 the visual tropes (metaphor and pun) in the case of individuals who lacked
 the cultural competency required to adequately appreciate the contemporary
 American ads on which the studies are based. Results are discussed in
 terms of the power of rhetorical theory and cultural competency theory
 (Scott 1994) for illuminating the role played by visual elements in
 advertising. Overall, the project demonstrates the advantages of
 investigating visual persuasion via an integration of multiple research
 traditions.

Title: 
 Contextual Effects on the Revision of Evaluative Judgments: An Extension of the Omission-Detection Framework.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 70-84
Issue: 1
Volume: 26
Year: 1999
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 When consumers are presented with negative information about a brand that
 they have evaluated positively earlier, the extent to which they change
 their initial evaluation may depend on the formats in which information is
 presented (noncomparative vs. comparative) at the two stages. In four
 experiments, we manipulate the format in which information is presented at
 an initial and at a challenge stage and investigate their effects on the
 degree of revision in evaluative judgments. The results of the four
 experiments suggest that when consumers receive initial information in a
 noncomparative format, a comparative challenge causes a greater degree of
 revision in the evaluative judgments than does a noncomparative challenge.
 However, when the initial information is presented in a comparative
 format, this pattern reverses, and a greater degree of revision occurs
 under a noncomparative challenge than under a comparative challenge. We
 demonstrate that sensitivity to missing information in either of the two
 stages is the process by which these effects obtain. In a fifth experiment
 we examine a boundary condition for these effects.

Title: 
 Choosing Less-Preferred Experiences for the Sake of Variety.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 1-15
Issue: 1
Volume: 26
Year: 1999
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 Data from several experiments show that, contrary to traditional models
 of variety seeking, individuals choose to switch to less-preferred options
 even though they enjoy those items less than they would have enjoyed
 repeating a more-preferred option. Two explanations for this finding are
 tested. Results indicate no evidence of a benefit to more-preferred
 options due to the contrast to less-preferred alternatives. However, the
 results of three studies suggest that retrospective global evaluations
 favor varied sequences that also include less-preferred items as opposed
 to sequences that only include more-preferred items, even though these
 more varied sequences result in diminished enjoyment during consumption.
