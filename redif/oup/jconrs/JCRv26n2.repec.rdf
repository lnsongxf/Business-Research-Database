Title: 
 Responses to Information Incongruency in Advertising: The Role of Expectancy, Relevancy, and Humor.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 156-69
Issue: 2
Volume: 26
Year: 1999
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 Two studies examining the effects of expectancy, relevancy, and humor on
 attitude formation are presented. Following previous research, expectancy
 refers to the degree to which an item or a piece of information falls into
 some predetermined pattern or structure evoked by an ad. Relevancy refers
 to the degree to which an item or a piece of information contributes to
 the identification of the primary message communicated by the ad. Across
 two studies that examined immediate response, we found that information
 expectancy and relevancy interact to produce different levels of attitude
 favorability. Although ads with unexpected-relevant information elicited
 more favorable attitudes than did ads with expected-relevant information,
 ads with unexpected-irrelevant information yielded less favorable
 attitudes than did ads with expected-relevant information. Furthermore,
 humor and relevancy interact where a humorous execution was found to have
 a favorable effect in ads with unexpected-irrelevant information but not
 in ads with unexpected-relevant information. In addition, the second study
 further examined delayed responses in which the findings revealed a
 different pattern. Particularly noteworthy is a sleeper effect for ads
 with unexpected-irrelevant information where attitudes for both the ad and
 the brand improved over time. We conclude with implications and
 suggestions for future research.

Title: 
 The Effects of Positive Mood on Memory.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 115-27
Issue: 2
Volume: 26
Year: 1999
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 The results of four studies examining the effect of mood on the learning
 of brand names show that a positive mood enhances the learning of brand
 names in relation to a neutral mood. Respondents' clustering of the brand
 names they recalled suggests that a positive mood fosters relational
 elaboration by prompting the classification of brands on the basis of
 their category membership, which then serves as an effective cue for brand
 name retrieval. Results also suggest that mood can affect the rehearsal of
 the specific brand names. These findings add to the growing evidence that
 mood affects the strategies used to process information and demonstrate
 for the first time that mood affects brand rehearsal as well as relational
 elaboration. These findings also question the adequacy of theoretical
 accounts for mood effects based on the notion that a positive mood reduces
 the processing of stimulus information.

Title: 
 The Role of Internal Reference Points in the Category Purchase Decision.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 128-43
Issue: 2
Volume: 26
Year: 1999
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 The authors study the role that reference effects play in the category
 purchase decision for consumer nondurable products. Category purchase
 behavior is represented by a nested logit model that is estimated on
 purchase records of shoppers in two Universal Product Code (UPC) scanner
 panels. A series of hypotheses are developed, modeled, and tested
 regarding the effects that internal reference points for product category
 attractiveness are likely to have on the decision to buy in a product
 category on a store visit. The authors hypothesize that the difference
 between a shopper's reference point for category attractiveness and the
 current level of category attractiveness will affect the purchase
 decision. In particular, the extent of purchase postponement caused by a
 loss (i.e., a negative discrepancy) should exceed the acceleration caused
 by a gain (i.e., a positive discrepancy). Reference effects on the
 category purchase decision are also hypothesized to interact with the
 shopper's familiarity with the store visited on a given trip. In
 particular, the impact of losses is predicted to be higher in unfamiliar
 than in familiar stores. The authors present model estimates and test
 results from two product categories (saltine crackers and liquid laundry
 detergent) and find all hypotheses to be supported.

Title: 
 Popular Appeal versus Expert Judgments of Motion Pictures.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 144-55
Issue: 2
Volume: 26
Year: 1999
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 Cultural commentators addressing the differences between high art and
 mere entertainment have suggested that the standards of popular appeal
 governing the tastes of ordinary consumers differ from the criteria for
 excellence employed by professional critics in rendering expert judgments.
 These concerns appear in discussions of the cultural hierarchy
 (distinguishing among levels of tastes) and in claims that commercialism
 tends to degrade cultural objects (by catering to tastes that represent
 the lowest common denominator). However, such attacks make assumptions
 that are generally left untested and that raise at least two key research
 questions: (RQ1) Do the determinants of popular appeal versus expert
 judgments suggest differing or common standards of evaluation for
 consumers versus critics? (RQ2) Do discrepant (shared) tastes produce a
 negative (positive) correlation between popular appeal and expert
 judgments? The present study addresses these research questions for the
 case of motion pictures. The findings suggest that, at least in the case
 of films, ordinary consumers and professional critics do emphasize
 different criteria in the formation of their tastes but that we have
 reason to question critiques based on the implicit assumption of a
 negative correlation between popular appeal and expert judgments.

Title: 
 The Effect of Discount Frequency and Depth on Consumer Price Judgments.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 99-114
Issue: 2
Volume: 26
Year: 1999
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 The intensity of price discounting by retailers and manufacturers raises
 important questions about consumer price judgments. In the extreme,
 discounting can take the form of frequent but shallow discounts or deep
 but infrequent discounts. The research reported here explores the effects
 of these strategies on consumer estimation of price levels for competing
 stores and brands. In an initial experiment in which subjects made brand
 choices over time, a depth effect was observed that contrasted with the
 frequency effect found in previous research. Subsequent experiments
 identified the conditions under which depth (vs. frequency)
 characteristics of price data dominate consumers' price-estimation
 judgments. Frequency information is more influential when sets of
 interstore or interbrand comparative prices exhibit complex and
 overlapping distributions (hence creating processing difficulty); in
 contrast, a depth bias occurs when prices have a simpler, dichotomous
 distribution. These results place pragmatically meaningful limitations on
 the influence of frequency information and illustrate the importance of
 context in determining consumer price judgments in a promotional
 environment.
