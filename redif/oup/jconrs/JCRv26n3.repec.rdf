Title: 
 Consumer Socialization of Children: A Retrospective Look at Twenty-Five Years of Research.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 183-213
Issue: 3
Volume: 26
Year: 1999
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 Twenty-five years of consumer socialization research have yielded an
 impressive set of findings. The purpose of our article is to review these
 findings and assess what we know about children's development as
 consumers. Our focus is on the developmental sequence characterizing the
 growth of consumer knowledge, skills, and values as children mature
 throughout childhood and adolescence. In doing so, we present a conceptual
 framework for understanding consumer socialization as a series of stages,
 with transitions between stages occurring as children grow older and
 mature in cognitive and social terms. We then review empirical findings
 illustrating these stages, including children's knowledge of products,
 brands, advertising, shopping, pricing, decision-making strategies,
 parental influence strategies, and consumption motives and values. Based
 on the evidence reviewed, implications are drawn for future theoretical
 and empirical development in the field of consumer socialization.

Title: 
 Trying to Be Cosmopolitan.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 214-41
Issue: 3
Volume: 26
Year: 1999
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 Cosmopolitanism is often heralded as a cultural orientation ideally
 suited to the sociocultural and economic complexities emanating from the
 accelerating pace of globalization. In this study, we analyze the
 consumption stories of expatriate professionals who are trying to enact a
 cosmopolitan identity. For these participants, trying to be cosmopolitan
 precipitates a nexus of salient experiential tensions and conflicts that
 are negotiated through their consumption and leisure practices. Although
 these expatriates identify with dominant cosmopolitan ideals of nomadic
 mobility and cultural adaptability, their consumer stories reveal a host
 of countervailing tensions deriving from emotional and interpersonal ties
 to home, desires for communal affiliations, and enduring preferences for
 familiar goods and places. We trace the history of colonial and
 patriarchal meanings that form the ideological underpinnings to these
 tensions. We propose that these ideological complexities and
 contradictions foster a paradoxical effacement of the conventional
 boundaries between work and leisure and between touristic practices and
 everyday consumer experiences. We discuss the implications of our analysis
 for theoretical conceptions of postmodern consumption and for consumer
 research on consumption goals.

Title: 
 Avoidance or Vigilance? The Psychology of False-Positive Test Results.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 242-59
Issue: 3
Volume: 26
Year: 1999
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 The influence of false-positive results on consumers' decisions to get
 retested in high-stakes domains is examined. Findings across four
 laboratory experiments indicate that a false-positive outcome increases
 perceptions of vulnerability and test inaccuracy, even holding constant
 test-error base rates. Increased perceived vulnerability appears to be
 directly related to the testing event, as the effects are not replicated
 by simply asking subjects to imagine having the malady. The findings also
 show that a false-positive result increases planned compliance if there
 are poor alternatives to testing or if the value of test-initiated
 treatment is high but does not affect compliance if good testing
 alternatives are available or the treatment value is low. Using a pooled
 analysis across multiple studies, the results of a false-positive outcome
 on compliance are shown to be partially mediated by changes in perceived
 vulnerability and test inaccuracy. Public-policy implications regarding
 individual decision behavior and professional test administration are
 discussed.

Title: 
 The Social Uses of Advertising: An Ethnographic Study of Adolescent Advertising Audiences.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 260-77
Issue: 3
Volume: 26
Year: 1999
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 Advertising research has focused exclusively on the solitary subject at
 the expense of understanding the role that advertising plays within the
 social contexts of group interaction. We develop a number of explanations
 for this omission before describing the results of an ethnographic study
 of advertising's contribution to the everyday interactions of adolescent
 informants at a number of English high schools. The study reveals a series
 of new, socially related advertising-audience behaviors. Specifically,
 advertising meanings are shown to possess social uses relating to textual
 experience, interpretation, evaluation, ritual use, and metaphor. The
 theoretical and managerial implications of these social uses are then
 discussed.

Title: 
 Heart and Mind in Conflict: The Interplay of Affect and Cognition in Consumer Decision Making.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 278-92
Issue: 3
Volume: 26
Year: 1999
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 This article examines how consumer decision making is influenced by
 automatically evoked task-induced affect and by cognitions that are
 generated in a more controlled manner on exposure to alternatives in a
 choice task. Across two experiments respondents chose between two
 alternatives: one (chocolate cake) associated with more intense positive
 affect but less favorable cognitions, compared to a second (fruit salad)
 associated with less favorable affect but more favorable cognitions.
 Findings from the two experiments suggest that if processing resources are
 limited, spontaneously evoked affective reactions rather than cognitions
 tend to have a greater impact on choice. As a result, the consumer is more
 likely to choose the alternative that is superior on the affective
 dimension but inferior on the cognitive dimension (e.g., chocolate cake).
 In contrast, when the availability of processing resources is high,
 cognitions related to the consequences of choosing the alternatives tend
 to have a bigger impact on choice compared to when the availability of
 these resources is low. As a result, the consumer is more likely to choose
 the alternative that is inferior on the affective dimension but superior
 on the cognitive dimension (e.g., fruit salad). The moderating roles of
 the mode of presentation of the alternatives and of a personality variable
 related to impulsivity are also reported.

Title: 
 Comparison Effects on Preference Construction.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 293-306
Issue: 3
Volume: 26
Year: 1999
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 Consumers frequently compare alternatives to make similarity and
 preference judgments. Recent research suggests that the construction of
 both similarity and preference judgments can be captured by a
 feature-matching model that allows for shifts in the relative weights
 assigned to the various features of the alternatives being compared. An
 implication of this model is that engaging in one comparative process
 (e.g., similarity) can influence the relative weight assigned to the
 features that are considered in a second comparative judgment (e.g.,
 preference). Our main proposition that the type and direction of the
 initial comparison process has a systematic effect on subsequent
 preference judgments and choice was tested in a series of studies. One
 study, which focused on alternatives about which consumers have
 information in memory, shows that the direction of an initial comparison
 task that elicits differences between two options systematically alters
 their relative attractiveness in a subsequent preference task. In two
 subsequent studies, the effect of engaging in an initial comparison task
 on subsequent preference judgments was tested for stimulus-based choice
 sets. The results on choice deferral and choice satisfaction were
 consistent with the notion that engaging in similarity/dissimilarity
 comparisons altered the relative weight assigned to common and unique
 features for the two alternatives. Mouselab was used to support the
 decision mechanisms underlying the effect of the initial
 similarity/dissimilarity judgments. An additional study examined how the
 effect of adding common features on subsequent preference was also
 contingent on the initial comparison task. We conclude with a study
 involving real consequences and a discussion of the theoretical and
 practical goals of our findings.
