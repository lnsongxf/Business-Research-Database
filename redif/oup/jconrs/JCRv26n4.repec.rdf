Title: 
 Intimate Exchanges: Using Computers to Elicit Self-Disclosure from Consumers.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 323-39
Issue: 4
Volume: 26
Year: 2000
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 This investigation examines the dynamics associated with soliciting
 intimate information from consumers via computers. Experiment 1 identifies
 two factors--reciprocity and sequence--that affect the likelihood that
 people will reveal intimate information about themselves via a computer.
 Experiment 2 provides evidence that intimate information exchanges can
 affect how consumers behave in subsequent interactions. Implications for
 marketing research and practice are discussed.

Title: 
 Consumer Researchers: Take a Hike!

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 423-28
Issue: 4
Volume: 26
Year: 2000
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 Consumer research needs broader intellectual peripheral vision. This
 requires learning to see relevance in seemingly distant fields and taking
 ignorance as a friend. A particularly challenging but highly relevant
 topic concerns the (un)conscious mind and the essential unity of body,
 brain, mind, and society. The two books discussed here are exciting
 journeys into the biology of the (un)conscious mind and how it is
 ultimately shaped by society.

Title: 
 Accessibility or Diagnosticity? Disentangling the Influence of Culture on Persuasion Processes and Attitudes.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 340-57
Issue: 4
Volume: 26
Year: 2000
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 This research explores the extent to which differences in perceived
 diagnosticity as compared with differences in the accessibility of
 associations embedded in persuasion appeals better account for the
 attitudinal differences found in the culture and persuasion literature.
 Experiment 1 replicates basic findings showing that high culture-distinct
 associations lead to more favorable attitudes for individuals in the
 target culture relative to a nontarget culture, while low culture-distinct
 associations lead to more attitudinal similarities across cultural
 boundaries. Experiments 2 and 3 explore two potential explanations for
 these effects. Convergent evidence, provided through within-culture and
 across-culture mediation analysis, is more supportive of the differential
 accessibility explanation. That is, high culture-distinct associations may
 be valued in the nontarget culture but are relatively inaccessible in
 memory at an individual level. The results of these experiments help to
 reconcile conflicting findings in the consumer psychology literature, shed
 insight on why cultural differences might occur, and add to the growing
 body of research that identifies conditions under which cultural
 similarities in persuasion processes and effects may be found.

Title: 
 The Influence of Positive Mood on Brand Extension Evaluations.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 386-400
Issue: 4
Volume: 26
Year: 2000
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 The current research examines how positive mood influences consumer
 evaluations of brand extensions. As a means of addressing this issue, we
 integrate findings from prior research on brand extensions with those
 concerning the effect of mood on similarity and evaluative judgments. Our
 results indicate that positive mood primarily enhances evaluations of
 extensions viewed as moderately similar (as opposed to very similar or
 dissimilar) to a favorably evaluated core brand. This pattern of effects
 prevailed in separate studies using two different types of mood
 manipulations. The evidence supports a mood process in which the influence
 of positive mood on extension evaluations is mediated by its effects on
 perceptions of the similarity between the core brand and the extension as
 well as the perceived competency of the marketer in producing the
 extension. Implications of these findings for marketing managers are
 presented along with suggestions for further research.

Title: 
 Why Is the Trivial Important? A Reasons-Based Account for the Effects of Trivial Attributes on Choice.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 372-85
Issue: 4
Volume: 26
Year: 2000
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 Consumers sometimes treat trivial attributes as though they were
 critically important in the sense that they have a significant impact on
 choice. We propose a reasons-based account to explain the valuation of
 trivial attributes and in particular why valuation is in some cases
 positive and in others negative. We suggest that consumers treat trivial
 attributes as though they had value when such valuation is instrumental,
 that is, helps accomplish a task goal. The valence of the effect can
 depend on whether a positive or negative reason provides a clearer
 justification for preferring a single brand over its competitors. Thus the
 same trivial attribute can generate a positive or negative valuation
 depending on the choice setting. Such valuation is not always driven by
 inferences about the attribute itself but can reflect transitory reasoning
 about the brand as a whole, based on the way it is differentiated from its
 competitors. Results from two experiments support the reasons-based model
 and help resolve some apparently conflicting effects previously reported
 for trivial attributes.

Title: 
 Regret: A Model of Its Antecedents and Consequences in Consumer Decision Making.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 401-17
Issue: 4
Volume: 26
Year: 2000
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 The article develops a model of regret and tests it via four studies.
 Study 1 develops a multi-item measure of regret and distinguishes it from
 satisfaction. It also shows that, while satisfaction directly influences
 both repurchase and complaint intentions, regret directly influences only
 repurchase intentions, and its effect on complaint intentions is fully
 mediated via satisfaction. Study 2 examines the antecedents and moderators
 of regret. It shows that regret is experienced even in the absence of
 information on a better-foregone outcome. Furthermore, the moderating
 effect of three situation-specific characteristics (outcome valence,
 status quo preservation, and reversibility of the outcome) is examined.
 Studies 3 and 4 examine the cognitive process underlying the experiencing
 of regret in the absence of information on a better-foregone outcome.
 Generation of counterfactuals is identified as the cognitive mechanism
 that engenders regret. Results show that counterfactuals are most likely
 to be generated when the chosen outcome is negative and not the status
 quo.

Title: 
 Motivated Reasoning: A Depth-of-Processing Perspective.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 358-71
Issue: 4
Volume: 26
Year: 2000
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 We show how motivation affects reasoning through reliance on a biased set
 of cognitive processes. We manipulate the level of brand preference
 experimentally and expose subjects to a message that is either consistent
 or inconsistent with their manipulated preference. Further, the message
 contains either strong or weak arguments. In two experiments, we find that
 preference-inconsistent information is processed more systematically and
 is counter argued more than preference-consistent information. In
 addition, experiment 2 shows that strong arguments are more persuasive
 than weak arguments in the preference-inconsistent condition. We employ
 the heuristic-systematic model of persuasion and its sufficiency principle
 as a framework to understand the psychological mechanism that underlies
 the biased processing of preference-inconsistent information.

Title: 
 The Moral Complexion of Consumption.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 418-22
Issue: 4
Volume: 26
Year: 2000
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 Vigorous consumption is the sign of a prosperous and confident society.
 Some critics, however, find a high level of consumption morally
 objectionable. To see what is valid in these objections, one needs to
 understand the connection between consumption and the characteristic
 pattern of technology that is highlighted by the device paradigm and gives
 rise to paradigmatic consumption. Such consumption induces disengagement
 from reality and a decline of excellence. The response to these debilities
 is to accept paradigmatic consumption in some areas of life and to make
 room for focal things and practices in others. Research is needed to
 determine the social reality, and to probe the common awareness, of
 paradigmatic consumption and focal practices.

Title: 
 The Use of Concurrent Disclosures to Correct Invalid Inferences.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 307-22
Issue: 4
Volume: 26
Year: 2000
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 In four experiments we examine the ability of simple concurrent
 disclosures to correct invalid inferences about brand quality based on
 advertising claims. We ensure that the disclosure is always encoded, yet
 we find that it is utilized to correct invalid inferences only under
 high-capacity conditions. Across the experiments, cognitive capacity is
 operationalized as opportunity to process (time), ability (explicitness of
 disclosure), and motivation (accuracy incentive). Two experiments use
 open-ended brand-claim recall and cognitive responses to establish that
 elaboration on the qualified claim and disclosure mediates its utilization
 in updating quality judgments. Given an impression-formation goal, such
 elaboration can occur on-line at the time of processing brand information
 or at the time of judgment, provided that the disclosure is internally or
 externally available. Practical strategies for facilitating the use of
 disclosures to correct inference errors are offered.
