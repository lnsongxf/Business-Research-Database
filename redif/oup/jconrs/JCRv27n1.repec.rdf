Title: 
 Consumer Learning and Brand Equity.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 1-16
Issue: 1
Volume: 27
Year: 2000
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 A series of experiments illustrates a learning process that enhances
 brand equity at the expense of quality-determining attributes. When the
 relationship between brand name and product quality is learned prior to
 the relationship between product attributes and quality, inhibition of the
 latter may occur. The phenomenon is shown to be robust, but its influence
 appears sensitive to contextual variations in the learning environment.
 Tests of process are inconsistent with attentional explanations and
 popular models of causal reasoning, but they are supportive of associative
 learning models that portray learners as inherently forward looking.

Title: 
 Qualitative Steps toward an Expanded Model of Anxiety in Gift-Giving.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 84-95
Issue: 1
Volume: 27
Year: 2000
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 Previous investigations of interpersonal gift giving have uncovered
 feelings of anxiety among gift givers. The anxious moments that givers
 often experience stand in stark contrast to the festive atmospheres and
 joyous celebrations that surround many gift occasions. Why is gift-giving
 such a torturous endeavor for so many people? What conditions coincide
 with the anxious moments that givers often experience? What factors drive
 this anxiety? These questions are explored in this article, which develops
 a model based on a self-presentational theory and two sets of qualitative
 data. The results show that givers become anxious when they are highly
 motivated to elicit desired reactions from their recipients but are
 pessimistic about their prospects of success. This article identifies
 characteristics of recipients, givers, and gift situations that appear to
 precipitate these anxious moments.

Title: 
 Understanding the Trade Winds: The Global Evolution of Production, Consumption, and the Internet.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 115-22
Issue: 1
Volume: 27
Year: 2000
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 The purpose of this article is to encourage research on the evolution of
 consumer behavior within and across nations by illustrating how
 super-diffusion technologies spawn and drive great surges in economic
 innovation that profoundly change consumer behavior that leads to further
 economic innovation and progress that plays out over centuries. Economic
 history can be used as a frame for understanding past, present, and future
 consumer behavior, particularly in thinking about the likely impact of
 cyberspace technology on global consumer behavior. A systems-dynamic
 perspective is recommended to fully appreciate the intended and unintended
 winds of economic change that are now blowing around the globe. In the
 right hands, systems-dynamic feedback maps may become as valuable today as
 were the treasured maps that described the trade winds 500 years ago.

Title: 
 Determinants of Country-of-Origin Evaluations.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 96-108
Issue: 1
Volume: 27
Year: 2000
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 Two experiments examined the factors that influence and the psychological
 processes that underlie country-of-origin evaluations. Subjects received
 attribute information that was either condensed in a single product or
 dispersed across several products manufactured in a country with
 relatively unfavorable associations. When consumers use country of origin
 as a basis for judgment under low motivation, or when the processing goal
 is to evaluate the country of origin, they focus on the country-of-origin
 information. Under such conditions, relevant evidence about the country of
 origin provided by dispersed information is likely to affect
 country-of-origin evaluations. In contrast, if consumers do not focus on
 the country of origin, such as under high motivation, or if their
 processing goal directs their attention away from country-of-origin
 information, any evidence about the country of origin is less likely to be
 utilized in their judgments. Findings from two experiments are consistent
 with this theorizing and highlight the central role of motivational
 intensity and direction in moderating the effect of information type on
 country-of-origin evaluations.

Title: 
 Consumers' Use of Persuasion Knowledge: The Effects of Accessibility and Cognitive Capacity on Perceptions of an Influence Agent.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 69-83
Issue: 1
Volume: 27
Year: 2000
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 This article examines conditions that influence consumers' use of
 persuasion knowledge in evaluating an influence agent, such as a
 salesperson. We propose that persuasion knowledge is used when consumers
 draw an inference that a persuasion motive may underlie a salesperson's
 behavior. These motive inferences then affect perceptions of the
 salesperson. We propose that two factors, the accessibility of persuasion
 motives and the cognitive capacity of the consumer, affect whether
 consumers use persuasion knowledge. When an ulterior persuasion motive is
 highly accessible, both cognitively busy targets and unbusy observers use
 persuasion knowledge to evaluate the salesperson. When an ulterior motive
 is less accessible, cognitively busy targets are less likely to use
 persuasion knowledge, evaluating the salesperson as more sincere than are
 cognitively unbusy observers. Several experiments find support for the
 predictions.

Title: 
 Children, Advertising, and Product Experiences: A Multimethod Inquiry.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 31-48
Issue: 1
Volume: 27
Year: 2000
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 Although the prepurchase effects of advertising on children are well
 documented, little is known about advertising's impact in conjunction with
 children's product usage experiences. Two studies, one using
 experimentation and the other using depth interviews, were undertaken to
 examine this issue. In addition to informational effects, special emphasis
 was placed on the role affective constructs play in shaping children's
 impressions. Experimental results indicated that both product trial and
 advertising have influences, but also that the interplay of these
 influences differs between older children (10-11-year-olds) and younger
 children (seven-eight-year-olds). Depth interviews offered further
 insights into these age differences such that our overall understanding of
 how older and younger children relate to advertisements and product
 consumption has been advanced.

Title: 
 Indexicality and the Verification Function of Irreplaceable Possessions: A Semiotic Analysis.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 17-30
Issue: 1
Volume: 27
Year: 2000
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 Many researchers have noted that special possessions can represent
 personally relevant events, people, places, and values. Semiotics provides
 a useful theoretical base for understanding the representation processes
 that support these meanings. We apply the semiotic concept of indexicality
 to extend our understanding of how meanings are embedded in irreplaceable
 special possessions. The results of two empirical studies support the
 proposition that these possessions establish a semiotic linkage, which
 enables consumers to verify self-selected moments from their personal
 history. Our research also reemphasizes the value of semiotic frameworks
 as applied to research on possession ownership and sheds additional light
 on the value of authenticity to consumers.

Title: 
 Standing on the Shoulders of Ancients: Consumer Research, Persuasion, and Figurative Language.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 109-14
Issue: 1
Volume: 27
Year: 2000
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 Ours is an age of consumerism, and the study of persuasion is a central
 topic of consumer research. Over time our knowledge of most persuasive
 topics has grown, but on a few topics knowledge has been lost. One lost
 topic is the persuasion effect of using figurative language (tropes,
 rhetorical figures) in communications, which had been a popular issue in
 earlier ages of persuasion but in our own era has been largely ignored.
 This neglect can be corrected by our "standing on the shoulders of
 ancients" and exploiting the progress made during earlier rhetorical ages
 in identifying and classifying tropes and hypothesizing how inclusion of
 such rhetorical figures affects perceptions and impacts of communications.
 A program of research on the effects of figurative language is described
 as an example of how giving greater consideration to ancient wisdom can
 enhance our understanding of persuasive communication and consumer
 behavior, especially in the creative hypothesis-generating phase of
 research.
