Title: 
 Controlling the Information Flow: Effects on Consumers' Decision Making and Preferences.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 233-48
Issue: 2
Volume: 27
Year: 2000
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 One of the main objectives facing marketers is to present consumers with
 information on which to base their decisions. In doing so, marketers have
 to select the type of information system they want to utilize in order to
 deliver the most appropriate information to their consumers. One of the
 most interesting and distinguishing dimensions of such information systems
 is the level of control the consumer has over the information system. The
 current work presents and tests a general model for understanding the
 advantages and disadvantages of information control on consumers' decision
 quality, memory, knowledge, and confidence. The results show that
 controlling the information flow can help consumers better match their
 preferences, have better memory and knowledge about the domain they are
 examining, and be more confident in their judgments. However, it is also
 shown that controlling the information flow creates demands on processing
 resources and therefore under some circumstances can have detrimental
 effects on consumers' ability to utilize information. The article
 concludes with a summary of the findings, discussion of their application
 for electronic commerce, and suggestions for future research avenues.

Title: 
 Place, Technology, and Representation.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 273-78
Issue: 2
Volume: 27
Year: 2000
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 Three challenges of intellectual, political, and moral significance
 confront our discipline in the new millennium. First, a thorough
 understanding of sense of place must be harnessed in the service of
 ecolate dwelling. Second, our inquiry into materiality must expand to
 encompass the numinous dimension of technology. Finally, we must resolve
 the crisis of representation that limits our ability to express the
 insights we achieve in our research into consumer behavior. In this essay,
 these challenges are framed and responses imagined in light of a set of
 literatures from disciplines contiguous to our own.

Title: 
 The Impact of Anticipating Satisfaction on Consumer Choice.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 202-16
Issue: 2
Volume: 27
Year: 2000
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 How do preferences change when consumers focus on the anticipated
 satisfaction with a purchase rather than choice? In a series of three
 studies, we show that preferences, both expressed and revealed, change
 depending on the degree to which anticipated satisfaction is evoked. These
 shifts in preferences arise because, compared to choice, anticipated
 satisfaction elicits a mental-imaging processing strategy that is both
 more effort intensive and qualitatively different. By providing direct
 evidence from thought protocols and by presenting evidence suggesting that
 these shifts in preferences vanish when mental imagery is discouraged or
 made more difficult, we show that the effect arises out of a processing
 strategy that requires effortful mental imagery of one or more of the
 options in the decision-making task. Finally, we demonstrate the
 uniqueness of the effect by showing that it cannot be generated with
 heightened processing or by an orientation that is directed toward the
 extent to which the options are liked.

Title: 
 The Costs and Benefits of Consuming.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 267-72
Issue: 2
Volume: 27
Year: 2000
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 Consuming is defined as behavior whereby entropy is increased in exchange
 for existential or experiential rewards. Existential rewards are well
 known for example, the satisfaction of Maslowian needs. But experiential
 rewards are perhaps just as important: these refer to the temporary
 improvement in positive mood people experience when they are acting in
 goal-directed, purposeful ways. Consuming is one way for obtaining such
 experiences. It is suggested that in order to evaluate the impact of
 consuming it is necessary to measure the entropy costs of the behavior
 balanced against the psychic benefits it provides.

Title: 
 Consumer Response to Stockouts.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 249-66
Issue: 2
Volume: 27
Year: 2000
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 Consumer responses to stockouts, both in terms of consumer satisfaction
 with the decision process and in terms of subsequent store choice
 behavior, are explored. Four laboratory experiments involving stockouts in
 a consumer choice context are run. The results suggest that consumer
 response to stockouts is driven in large part by two factors: the effect
 of a stockout on the difficulty of making a choice from the set and the
 degree of personal commitment to the out-of-stock alternative. The results
 show that personal commitment to an out-of-stock choice option is a
 function of preference for the option, whether the option is included in
 the consumer's consideration set, and the degree to which the stockout
 announcement is personally directed. As personal commitment to the
 out-of-stock option increases, consumers react substantially and
 negatively to the stockout they report lower satisfaction with the
 decision process and show a higher likelihood of switching stores on
 subsequent shopping trips. However, under conditions in which personal
 commitment to the out-of-stock option is low and the stockout leads to a
 decrease in the difficulty of making a product selection, consumer
 response to the stockout can actually be positive.

Title: 
 Knowledge Calibration: What Consumers Know and What They Think They Know.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 123-56
Issue: 2
Volume: 27
Year: 2000
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 Consumer knowledge is seldom complete or errorless. Therefore, the
 self-assessed validity of knowledge and consequent knowledge calibration
 (i.e., the correspondence between self-assessed and actual validity) is an
 important issue for the study of consumer decision making. In this article
 we describe methods and models used in calibration research. We then
 review a wide variety of empirical results indicating that high levels of
 calibration are achieved rarely, moderate levels that include some degree
 of systematic bias are the norm, and confidence and accuracy are sometimes
 completely uncorrelated. Finally, we examine the explanations of
 miscalibration and offer suggestions for future research.
