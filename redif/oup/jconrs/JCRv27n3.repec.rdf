Title: 
 Asymmetric Competition in Choice and the Leveraging of Competitive Disadvantages.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 291-308
Issue: 3
Volume: 27
Year: 2000
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 Studies of grocery sales show that consumers of store brands switch to
 (price) discounted national brands more than consumers of national brands
 switch to discounted store brands. Such asymmetric price competition can
 be explained with numerous mechanisms proposed here and elsewhere. We
 report a choice experiment that replicates asymmetric price competition
 favoring higher-quality competitors and demonstrates asymmetric quality
 competition favoring lower-quality competitors. Also demonstrated are
 multiple mechanisms contributing to competitive asymmetries, where
 dominance involving the otherwise preferred brand is particularly potent
 (e.g., when a higher-quality competitor matches the price of an otherwise
 preferred lower-quality brand). The findings implicate modifications to
 (1) theories of decision making when extended to repeat choice, (2)
 empirical models of secondary purchase data, and (3) strategies for
 positioning and attacking brands. Whereas improving competitive
 disadvantages often attracts consumers from competitors more than does
 improving competitive advantages, this benefit must be weighed against the
 differentiation sacrificed by improving competitive disadvantages
 (improving competitive advantages, in contrast, increases
 differentiation).

Title: 
 Attributional Thoughts about Consumer Behavior.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 382-87
Issue: 3
Volume: 27
Year: 2000
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 Two fundamental principles from attribution theory were examined for the
 role they might play in the psychology of the consumer. They are: (1)
 perceptions of causality along a stability dimension influence the
 anticipated likelihood of product satisfaction, and (2) perceptions of
 causality along a controllability dimension influence judgments of
 responsibility and retributive actions. Comments about the longevity of an
 attributional framework, methodological recommendations, and the heuristic
 value of the theory also are included.

Title: 
 On the Concept of Intentional Social Action in Consumer Behavior.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 388-96
Issue: 3
Volume: 27
Year: 2000
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 The purpose of this article is to encourage research on the social
 aspects of consumer behavior, particularly as found in groups of consumers
 and manifested through group action. Based on work by leading contemporary
 philosophers, a new concept of social facts is presented that is grounded
 in the way members of a group see themselves and the implications of this
 for group action. Group action, in turn, is shown to require different
 conceptual schemes than commonly used for individual action or
 interpersonal and macro social perspectives. Among other ideas, the notion
 of what it means for a group member to intend that the group act and how
 individual intentions are contributory to group action are discussed.

Title: 
 Mood-Driven Distortion of Product Information.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 345-59
Issue: 3
Volume: 27
Year: 2000
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 During the consumer choice process, predecisional distortion is the
 biased evaluation of new product information to support a tentatively
 preferred brand. An experiment revealed that creating a good mood by the
 unexpected gift of a bag of candy doubled the magnitude of this bias.
 Furthermore, information that seemed to preserve the good mood but
 disconfirmed the tentative preference (by being positive about the
 trailing brand) had greater impact than did mood-disrupting, negative
 information about the leading brand. The results, especially those for the
 disconfirming information, were compatible with the goal of mood
 management.

Title: 
 Sequential Choice in Group Settings: Taking the Road Less Traveled and Less Enjoyed.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 279-90
Issue: 3
Volume: 27
Year: 2000
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 Many individual decisions take place in a group context wherein group
 members voice their choices sequentially. In this article we examine the
 impact of this dynamic decision process on individuals' choices and
 satisfaction with their outcomes. We propose that choices reflect a
 balancing of two classes of goals: goals that are strictly individual and
 goals that are triggered by the existence of the group. The latter
 sometimes results in choices that undermine personal satisfaction and
 increase regret. We find support for goal balancing in three studies in
 which we tracked consumers' orders of dishes and drinks. In the Lunch
 study we found that real groups (tables) choose more varied dishes than
 would be expected by random sampling of the population of all individual
 choices across all tables. The Beer study demonstrates that this
 group-level variety seeking is attributable to the interaction implicit or
 explicit among group members, and can be dissipated when the group is
 forced to "disband" and its members make strictly individual choices.
 Finally, the Wine study demonstrated that individual choices in a group
 context are also aimed at satisfying goals of information gathering and
 self-presentation in the form of uniqueness.

Title: 
 The Effects of Extensions of the Family Brand Name: An Accessibility-Diagnosticity Perspective.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 371-81
Issue: 3
Volume: 27
Year: 2000
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 Previous research has led to mixed findings regarding the effect of
 extensions on the family brand name. This research identifies
 "accessibility of extension information" as a factor that moderates the
 effects of the valence of extension information and extension category on
 brand evaluations. Under higher accessibility, negative information about
 the extension led to dilution and positive information led to enhancement
 of the family brand regardless of extension category. Under lower
 accessibility, extension information affected evaluations based on
 category diagnosticity. Negative information about a close (vs. far)
 extension led to dilution and positive information about a far (vs. close)
 extension led to enhancement.
