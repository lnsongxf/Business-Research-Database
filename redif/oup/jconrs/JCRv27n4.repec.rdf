Title: 
 The Impact of Common Features on Consumer Preferences: A Case of Confirmatory Reasoning.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 475-88
Issue: 4
Volume: 27
Year: 2001
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 This article examines how confirmatory reasoning moderates the impact of
 attractive and unattractive common features on consumer preferences.
 Building on the existing research on confirmatory information processing
 and the motivated reasoning framework, I propose that consumers evaluate
 common features in a way that supports their already established
 preferences. In a series of three studies, I show that the impact of
 common features is moderated by their attractiveness and the strength of
 individuals' already established preferences. In the context of a choice
 task, only attractive features were found to enhance individuals' already
 established preferences, and this effect was more pronounced for consumers
 with already established brand preferences compared to consumers who were
 indifferent to the options. The effect of attractive and unattractive
 features was reversed in the context of a rejection rather than a
 selection task. These findings are interpreted in the context of
 consumers' confirmatory reasoning aimed at reaching a consistent and
 readily justifiable decision.

Title: 
 Consumer Research for Consumers.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 499-504
Issue: 4
Volume: 27
Year: 2001
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 This article outlines a consumer-focused approach for the study of
 consumer behavior. I argue that much of the existing literature, by
 developing knowledge that focuses on the determinants of consumer
 purchasing, is implicitly biased toward a marketing perspective of
 consumer behavior. In contrast, I propose the need for a consumer-focused
 approach that would advance knowledge aimed at helping consumers make
 wiser purchases. This approach should address the most important and
 challenging consumer decisions, describe consumer behavior in a manner
 that leads to prescriptions, consider the actions of other parties in the
 marketplace, and identify biases unique to or exacerbated by the consumer
 context. This article then illustrates what such a consumer-focused
 approach would imply for consumer research in three areas: negotiations,
 financial services, and auctions.

Title: 
 Effects of Payment Mechanism on Spending Behavior: The Role of Rehearsal and Immediacy of Payments.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 460-74
Issue: 4
Volume: 27
Year: 2001
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 Past expenses have been shown to influence future spending behavior by
 depleting available budgets. However, a prerequisite for this relationship
 is the accurate recall of past payments and the experiencing of the full
 aversive impact associated with them. This article shows that the use of
 different payment mechanisms influences both these factors and hence
 moderates the effects of past payments on future spending. Specifically,
 past payments strongly reduce purchase intention when the payment
 mechanism requires the consumer to write down the amount paid (rehearsal)
 and when the consumer's wealth is depleted immediately rather than with a
 delay (immediacy). Two experiments show support for the proposed
 theoretical framework.

Title: 
 The Economics of Consumer Knowledge.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 397-411
Issue: 4
Volume: 27
Year: 2001
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 While approaches to measuring the state of a consumer's knowledge are
 well developed, much less is known about the relationship between
 knowledge and consumer choice and information search. The purpose of this
 article is to explore these relationships by treating consumer knowledge
 as human capital, which affects the full price of consumption and search
 activities. Using this framework, models are presented to explain life
 cycle consumption patterns, lifestyles, brand loyalty, choice of features,
 and search behavior. This economic perspective is compared and contrasted
 to other consumer research on these topics, including recent qualitative
 research that examines consumption behavior.

Title: 
 Literally Literacy.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 505-11
Issue: 4
Volume: 27
Year: 2001
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 Literacy is a continuous, multidimensional indicator of proficiency in
 using written language. This essay reviews several recent books on
 literacy, and suggests some profound theoretical issues about consumer
 behavior inspired by a sociocultural perspective on literacy. In
 particular, ties between literacy and six diverse research programs on
 consumer behavior are highlighted: responses to persuasion; affect and
 decision making; the meanings of products and brands; social marketing of
 health behaviors; consumption, identity, and resistance; and the impact of
 the internet on consumer behavior. In addition, questions both interesting
 and troubling about the impact of consumption on literacy are raised in
 the hope of encouraging future research.

Title: 
 Avoiding Future Regret in Purchase-Timing Decisions.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 447-59
Issue: 4
Volume: 27
Year: 2001
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 When deciding when to make a purchase, people often compare their
 outcomes to those that would have occurred had they purchased earlier or
 later. In this article, we examine how pre- and postpurchase comparisons
 affect regret and satisfaction, and whether consumers learn to avoid
 decisions that result in regret. In the first two experiments, we show
 that information learned after the purchase has a greater impact on
 satisfaction than information learned before the purchase. In addition,
 negative price comparisons have a greater impact on satisfaction than
 positive comparisons. These results imply that if consumers who receive
 postpurchase information wish to avoid future feelings of regret, they
 should defer their purchases longer. Our second two experiments
 demonstrate this phenomenon: Subjects who were exposed to postchoice
 information set higher decision thresholds, consistent with the
 minimization of future regret. Paradoxically, providing subjects with
 additional postchoice information resulted in decreased average earnings,
 suggesting that consumers may try to avoid future regret even when doing
 so conflicts with expected value maximization.

Title: 
 Brand Community.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 412-32
Issue: 4
Volume: 27
Year: 2001
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 This article introduces the idea of brand community. A brand community is
 a specialized, non-geographically bound community, based on a structured
 set of social relations among admirers of a brand. Grounded in both
 classic and contemporary sociology and consumer behavior, this article
 uses ethnographic and computer mediated environment data to explore the
 characteristics, processes, and particularities of three brand communities
 (those centered on Ford Bronco, Macintosh, and Saab). These brand
 communities exhibit three traditional markers of community: shared
 consciousness, rituals and traditions, and a sense of moral
 responsibility. The commercial and mass-mediated ethos in which these
 communities are situated affects their character and structure and gives
 rise to their particularities. Implications for branding, sociological
 theories of community, and consumer behavior are offered.

Title: 
 "What Is It?" Categorization Flexibility and Consumers' Responses to Really New Products.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 489-98
Issue: 4
Volume: 27
Year: 2001
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 To understand really new products, consumers face the challenge of
 constructing new knowledge structures rather simply changing existing
 ones. Recent research in categorization suggests that one strategy for
 creating representations for these new products is to use information
 already contained in familiar product categories. While knowledge from
 multiple existing categories may be relevant, little research has examined
 how (and if) consumers process information drawn from more than one
 domain. We use two experiments to demonstrate how consumers use cues from
 multiple categories to develop expectations about and preferences for new
 products. Our findings suggest that the first plausible category label
 provided to the consumer significantly influences their categorizations,
 expectations, and preferences. Only when advertisers place limits on the
 type of information to transfer from each existing category can consumers
 use information from multiple categories effectively.
