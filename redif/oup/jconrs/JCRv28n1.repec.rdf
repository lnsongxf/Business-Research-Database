Title: 
 The Desperate Need for Replications.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 149-58
Issue: 1
Volume: 28
Year: 2001
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 An overemphasis on creativity for evaluating research has lead to a
 serious devaluation of replication studies. However, we need a total
 sample size of N = 153,669 to estimate a causal effect to two digits,
 which is quite rare for a single study. The only way to get accurate
 estimation is to average across replications. If the average sample size
 were as high as N = 200, we would need over 700 replication studies.
 Scientific replications are more problematic than pure statistical
 replications, and so we need even more replications to achieve reasonable
 accuracy.

Title: 
 Opportunities for Improving Consumer Research through Latent Variable Structural Equation Modeling.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 159-66
Issue: 1
Volume: 28
Year: 2001
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 This article discusses several advantages of latent variable structural
 equation modeling (LVSEM), and the potential it has for solving some
 fundamental problems hindering research in the field. The advantages
 highlighted include the ability to control for measurement error; an
 enhanced ability to test the effects of experimental manipulations; the
 ability to test complex theoretical structures; the ability to link micro
 and macro perspectives; and more powerful ways to assess measure
 reliability and validity. My hope is to sensitize researchers to some of
 the key limitations of currently used alternative methodologies, and
 demonstrate how LVSEM can help to improve theory testing and development
 in our discipline.

Title: 
 "I" Seek Pleasures and "We" Avoid Pains: The Role of Self-Regulatory Goals in Information Processing and Persuasion.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 33-49
Issue: 1
Volume: 28
Year: 2001
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 In four experiments, we show that goals associated with approach and
 avoidance needs influence persuasion and that the accessibility of
 distinct self-views moderates these effects. Specifically, individuals
 with an accessible independent self-view are more persuaded by
 promotion-focused information that is consistent with an approach goal. In
 contrast, individuals whose interdependent self-view is more accessible
 are more persuaded by prevention focused information that is consistent
 with an avoidance goal. When the persuasive appeal is compatible with
 self-regulatory focus, individuals demonstrate greater recall of the
 message content and are more discerning regarding argument strength. These
 findings provide convergent evidence that central processing under goal
 compatible conditions underlies the persuasion effects.

Title: 
 Consumer's Need for Uniqueness: Scale Development and Validation.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 50-66
Issue: 1
Volume: 28
Year: 2001
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 Consumers acquire and display material possessions for the purpose of
 feeling differentiated from other people and, thus, are targeted with a
 variety of marketing stimuli that attempt to enhance self-perceptions of
 uniqueness. Because the pursuit of differentness (or counterconformity
 motivation) varies across individuals to influence consumer responses, we
 develop and validate a trait measure of consumers' need for uniqueness.
 Consumers' need for uniqueness is defined as an individual's pursuit of
 differentness relative to others that is achieved through the acquisition,
 utilization, and disposition of consumer goods for the purpose of
 developing and enhancing one's personal and social identity. Following
 assessments of the scale's latent structure, a series of validation
 studies examines the scale's validity. The presentation of empirical work
 is followed by a discussion of how consumers' need for uniqueness could be
 used in better understanding consumer behavior and the role consumption
 plays in people's expression of identity.

Title: 
 Sometimes It Just Feels Right: The Differential Weighting of Affect-Consistent and Affect-Inconsistent Product Information.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 1-17
Issue: 1
Volume: 28
Year: 2001
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 An affect-confirmation process is proposed to explain the conditions in
 which information that is similar in valence (i.e., evaluatively
 consistent) with a person's mood is weighted more heavily in product
 judgments. Specifically, the affect that participants experience as a
 result of a transitory mood state may appear to either confirm or
 disconfirm their reactions to product information, leading them to give
 this information more or less weight when evaluating the product as a
 whole. This affective confirmation typically occurs when hedonic criteria
 are considered more important in evaluation than utilitarian criteria.
 Four experiments confirmed implications of this conceptualization.

Title: 
 The Influence of Task Complexity on Consumer Choice: A Latent Class Model of Decision Strategy Switching.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 135-48
Issue: 1
Volume: 28
Year: 2001
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 The literature indicating that person-, context-, and task-specific
 factors cause consumers to utilize different decision strategies has
 generally failed to affect the specification of choice models used by
 practitioners and academics alike, who still tend to assume an utility
 maximizing, omniscient, indefatigable consumer. This article (1)
 introduces decision strategy selection, within a maintained compensatory
 framework, into aggregate choice models via latent classes, which arise
 because of task complexity; (2) it demonstrates that within an
 experimental choice task, the model reflects changing aggregate
 preferences as choice complexity changes and as the task progresses. The
 import of these findings for current practice, model interpretation, and
 future research needs is examined.

Title: 
 Effects of Brand Logo Complexity, Repetition, and Spacing on Processing Fluency and Judgment.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 18-32
Issue: 1
Volume: 28
Year: 2001
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 It is generally accepted that repeated exposure to an advertisement can
 influence liking for an advertisement and for the brand names and product
 packages included in the advertisement. Although it has often been assumed
 that repeated exposure leads to a direct affective response, more recent
 evidence suggests that prior exposure leads to processing fluency at the
 time of judgment. It is a misattribution about the source of this
 processing fluency that results in preference for the stimulus. To date,
 the majority of research on the processing fluency/attribution hypothesis
 has focused on when people will make fluency-based attributions, while
 assuming the amount of the processing fluency is a direct function of
 exposure. In this article, we propose that stimulus characteristics and
 presentation factors will interact with repetition to determine the amount
 of processing fluency associated with a stimulus at various levels of
 exposure. Four studies are used to test whether two-factor theory or
 dual-process theory provides a better account of the source of the
 processing fluency. Implications for logo design are discussed.

Title: 
 Consumer Self-Confidence: Refinements in Conceptualization and Measurement.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 121-34
Issue: 1
Volume: 28
Year: 2001
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 The development and validation of measures to assess multiple dimensions
 of consumer self-confidence are described in this article.
 Scale-development procedures resulted in a six-factor correlated model
 made up of the following dimensions: information acquisition,
 consideration-set formation, personal outcomes, social outcomes,
 persuasion knowledge, and marketplace interfaces. A series of studies
 demonstrate the psychometric properties of the measures, their
 discriminant validity with respect to related constructs, their construct
 validity, and their ability to moderate relationships among other
 important consumer behavior variables.
