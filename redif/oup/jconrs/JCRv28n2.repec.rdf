Title: 
 Gift Giving in Hong Kong and the Continuum of Social Ties.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 239-56
Issue: 2
Volume: 28
Year: 2001
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 This article explores gift-giving practices using data collected through
 interviews in Hong Kong. I argue that Chinese culture promotes the
 familial over the private self and that the attainment of family-oriented
 goals represents an important measure of self-realization and
 self-fulfillment. Although each individual also has a private or inner
 self (chi), it is also subject to the collective will. This idea is in
 keeping with Confucian ideals that encourage the individual to focus on
 developing internal moral constraints and conquering selfishness in the
 pursuit of social propriety. Furthermore, the boundaries of the familial
 self are permeable and may include others, such as important romantic
 partners and, occasionally, close friends who become "like family." In
 family and like-family contexts, reciprocity is discouraged, and there is
 no need to build relationships through gift giving. Our research also
 suggests, however, that there are various gradations of intimacy in gift
 relationships against the backdrop of important cultural rules such as
 reciprocity, sentiment, and face. Using the categories provided by our
 participants, the gift continuum includes "close friends," "good friends,"
 "just friends"/"hi-bye friends," and the "romantic other."

Title: 
 Emotional Contagion Effects on Product Attitudes.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 189-201
Issue: 2
Volume: 28
Year: 2001
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 Two experiments examine the existence of, and explanation for, emotional
 contagion effects on product attitudes. In the first experiment, emotional
 contagion occurred among "receivers" who "caught" a happy emotion from
 "senders" whom the receivers liked. The relationship between the emotion
 experienced by senders and receivers was found to be mediated by receivers
 mimicking smiling on the part of senders. Exposing receivers to happy
 senders they liked also resulted in receivers having a positive
 attitudinal bias toward a product. The happiness experienced by receivers
 via contagion was found to mediate the effects of sender emotion and
 receiver liking of the sender on receiver product attitudes. The second
 experiment replicated the first while demonstrating that observation of
 the facial expressions of senders by receivers, thus allowing mimicking of
 smiling, was a necessary condition for emotional contagion to occur. The
 relevance of emotional contagion for understanding consumer behavior
 across various substantive domains is discussed.

Title: 
 A Consumer Perspective on Price-Matching Refund Policies: Effect on Price Perceptions and Search Behavior.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 296-307
Issue: 2
Volume: 28
Year: 2001
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 Although price-matching refund policies are common in many retail
 environments, the impact of such policies on consumers has largely been
 ignored. This article reports the results of three studies that examine
 price-matching policies from a consumer perspective. Study 1 shows that
 consumers perceive price-matching policies as signals of low store prices
 and that the presence of a refund increases the likelihood of
 discontinuing price search. Contrary to the predictions based on signaling
 theory in information economics, studies 2 and 3 show that when search
 costs are low, the number of stores searched increases in the presence
 versus absence of a price-matching policy. When search costs are high,
 consumers appear to accept the price-matching signal at face value and
 search less in the presence of a refund. The article concludes by
 discussing the theoretical implications of the findings and suggesting
 directions for future research.

Title: 
 Moderators of Language Effects in Advertising to Bilinguals: A Psycholinguistic Approach.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 284-95
Issue: 2
Volume: 28
Year: 2001
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 This article examines a psycholinguistic model of bilingual concept
 organization and extends it to the processing of advertisements by
 bilingual consumers. The model suggests that second-language (L2) messages
 result in inferior memory as compared with first-language (L1) stimuli.
 These language asymmetries in memory are thought to occur because
 processing an L2 message at a conceptual level is less likely than
 processing an L1 message conceptually. Applying this notion to
 advertisements, this research examines picture-text congruity as a
 potential moderator of language effects in memory. The results suggest
 that a high level of congruity between picture and text facilitates
 conceptual processing of L2 messages, increasing memory for
 second-language ads and thereby reducing the impact of language
 asymmetries on memory.

Title: 
 Improving Parameter Estimates and Model Prediction by Aggregate Customization in Choice Experiments.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 273-83
Issue: 2
Volume: 28
Year: 2001
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 We propose aggregate customization as an approach to improve individual
 estimates using a hierarchical Bayes choice model. Our approach involves
 the use of prior estimates to build a common design customized for the
 average respondent. We conduct two simulation studies to investigate
 conditions that are most conducive to aggregate customization. The
 simulations are validated by a field study showing that aggregate
 customization results in better estimates of individual parameters and
 more accurate predictions of individuals' choices. The proposed approach
 is easy to use, and a simulation study can assess the expected benefit
 from aggregate customization prior to its implementation.

Title: 
 Nonconscious and Contaminative Effects of Hypothetical Questions on Subsequent Decision Making.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 224-38
Issue: 2
Volume: 28
Year: 2001
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 In this article we examine the impact of asking hypothetical questions on
 respondents' subsequent decision making. Across several experiments we
 find that even though such questions are purely hypothetical, respondents
 are unable to prevent a substantial biasing effect on their behavior.
 Further, we find that an increase in cognitive elaboration increases the
 contaminative effects of hypothetical questions and that this increase
 occurs primarily when the hypothetical information is relevant. In-depth
 poststudy interviews with a subset of the participants suggest that the
 effects of hypothetical questions on choice occur beyond awareness and, as
 a result, are quite difficult to counteract.

Title: 
 Two Ways of Learning Brand Associations.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 202-23
Issue: 2
Volume: 28
Year: 2001
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 Four studies show that consumers have not one but two distinct learning
 processes that allow them to use brand names and other product features to
 predict consumption benefits. The first learning process is a relatively
 unfocused process in which all stimulus elements get cross-referenced for
 later retrieval. This process is backward looking and consistent with
 human associative memory (HAM) models. The second learning process
 requires that a benefit be the focus of prediction during learning. It
 assumes feature-benefit associations change only to the extent that the
 expected performance of the product does not match the experienced
 performance of the product. This process is forward looking and consistent
 with adaptive network models. The importance of this two-process theory is
 most apparent when a product has multiple features. During HAM learning,
 each feature-benefit association will develop independently. During
 adaptive learning, features will compete to predict benefits and, thus,
 feature-benefit associations will develop interdependently. We find
 adaptive learning of feature-benefit associations when consumers are
 motivated to learn to predict a benefit (e.g., because it is perceived to
 have hedonic relevance) but find HAM learning when consumers attend to an
 associate of lesser motivational significance.

 Digitizing Consumer Research.

Month:  September 
Abstract:

 How will the widespread diffusion of information technology change
 consumer research? I argue that information technology will profoundly
 change the way knowledge is generated and disseminated. In generating
 knowledge, consumer researchers will see the diminishing use of student
 subjects, an increase in the use of global samples, panels, secondary
 data, and information acquisition techniques. In disseminating knowledge,
 I suggest the possibility of self-organizing journals that would use the
 ratings of selected readers to determine the status of submitted research.

Title: 
 The Moderating Effect of Knowledge and Resources on the Persuasive Impact of Analogies.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 257-72
Issue: 2
Volume: 28
Year: 2001
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 Four experiments were conducted to examine the persuasive impact of new
 product appeals containing an analogy. An analogy highlights the
 similarity in the benefits offered by a familiar base product and an
 unfamiliar target product. This device is found to be persuasive when (a)
 message recipients have the ability to map attribute relations from some
 base category to understand the benefits of a target product, and (b) they
 allocate the substantial resources needed to complete this mapping. In the
 absence of either of these conditions, the persuasive impact of an analogy
 is more limited. A variety of devices, including expertise with the base
 product, training in how to process base information, and a positive mood,
 are shown to improve the comprehension of an analogy and to enhance its
 persuasiveness.
