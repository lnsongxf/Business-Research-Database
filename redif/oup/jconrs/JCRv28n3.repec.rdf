Title: 
 Consuming the American West: Animating Cultural Meaning and Memory at a Stock Show and Rodeo.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 369-98
Issue: 3
Volume: 28
Year: 2001
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 This ethnographic research examines consumers' cultural production at a
 cattle trade show and rodeo. Consumers recreate western cultural meanings
 and memories related to competition, naturalism, freedom/independence, and
 family tradition in their interactions with ranchers, booth exhibitors,
 animals, and artifacts of western history. Consumers' cultural production
 processes are documented at four levels: consumer behavior, situational
 positioning, subcultural interactions, and market interactions.
 Implications elaborate the significance of consumers' active, yet
 constrained production processes; the role of cultural meanings as market
 mediators; and issues in consuming another culture.

Title: 
 The Creative Destruction of Decision Research.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 499-505
Issue: 3
Volume: 28
Year: 2001
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 The most recent wave of decision research goes beyond the usual critiques
 of linear probability weighting, exponential discounting, and other
 specialized assumptions, and challenges some of the most basic assumptions
 of the decision-making paradigm itself. In response to these challenges,
 decision researchers have proposed alternative accounts of behavior, some
 of which bear little resemblance to decision making as it is commonly
 conceived. I provide an overview of some of the challenges confronting the
 decision-making paradigm, and I present the broad outline of what I see as
 an emerging alternative perspective.

Title: 
 Embarrassment in Consumer Purchase: The Roles of Social Presence and Purchase Familiarity.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 473-81
Issue: 3
Volume: 28
Year: 2001
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 Two field studies investigate the importance of social presence (real and
 imagined) and familiarity with the purchase act in producing embarrassment
 in the context of an embarrassing product purchase. The results indicate
 that awareness of a social presence during purchase selection and
 commitment, whether real or imagined, is a motivating factor in creating
 embarrassment for the consumer. Further, our results show that the more
 familiar consumers are with an embarrassing product purchase, the less
 embarrassed they are likely to feel. Familiarity with an embarrassing
 product purchase is also shown to have implications for the effect of
 social presence. That is, familiarity with purchase acts as a moderator
 for the relationship of real social presence and embarrassment by reducing
 the influence of the social presence. In the context of an imagined social
 presence, purchase familiarity is shown to reduce the likelihood of
 imagining. These findings are integrated into a discussion of the
 theoretical implications and the potential avenues for future research in
 the area.

Title: 
 Reference Price and Price Perceptions: A Comparison of Alternative Models.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 339-54
Issue: 3
Volume: 28
Year: 2001
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 Reference price effects on consumer price perceptions are often explained
 by Helson's adaptation-level theory, in which the cognitive representation
 of reference price is the prototype of the relevant category. However,
 recent conceptualizations and empirical evidence suggest the possibility
 of an exemplar model, which may be specified using Volkmann's range theory
 or Parducci's range-frequency theory. In two experiments, these three
 contextual models of reference price effects are pitted against one
 another. Based on the MANOVA and model fitting, range-frequency theory
 accounted for reference price effects that the other theories could not,
 suggesting that consumers compare the target price against specific
 members of the category rather than the category prototype. A third
 experiment demonstrated that range and frequency effects are moderated by
 the stimulus presentation condition, suggesting that consumers place
 greater weight on extreme prices anchoring the range for internal
 reference prices than for external reference prices.

Title: 
 What If Consumer Experiments Impact Variances as Well as Means? Response Variability as a Behavioral Phenomenon.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 506-11
Issue: 3
Volume: 28
Year: 2001
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 This essay discusses the fact that in many cases means and variances of
 probability distributions are confounded and cannot be separated, which
 poses particular problems for analysis and interpretation of behavioral
 response data in consumer research. The discussion focuses on random
 utility theory to show that the confoundment of means and variances poses
 problems for published research in many areas of consumer behavior.
 Examples are provided to show why and how reported empirical differences
 in means may in fact be differences in variability. Ways to deal with the
 problem empirically are discussed.

Title: 
 Withholding Consumption: A Social Dilemma Perspective on Consumer Boycotts.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 399-417
Issue: 3
Volume: 28
Year: 2001
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 This article draws on social dilemma theory and reference group theory to
 understand the individual boycott decision and tests the predictions
 stemming from this conceptualization in two experiments. Consistent with
 our predictions, consumers' likelihood of participating in both economic
 and social-issue boycotts is jointly determined by their perceptions of
 the boycott's likelihood of success, their susceptibility to normative
 social influences, and the costs they incur in boycotting. Consumers'
 success perceptions are, in turn, determined by their expectations of
 overall participation and efficacy, as well as the message frame inherent
 in proboycott communications. Two key determinants of consumers'
 boycotting costs are their preference for the boycotted product and their
 access to its substitutes. More specifically, consumers who are more
 susceptible to the normative influence exerted by the reference group of
 potential boycotters are more influenced by expected overall participation
 rates in their boycott likelihood.

Title: 
 On the Use of College Students in Social Science Research: Insights from a Second-Order Meta-analysis.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 450-61
Issue: 3
Volume: 28
Year: 2001
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 A second-order meta-analysis was conducted to assess the implications of
 using college student subjects in social science research. Four
 meta-analyses investigating response homogeneity (cumulative N > 650,000)
 and 30 meta-analyses reporting effect sizes for 65 behavioral or
 psychological relationships (cumulative N > 350,000) provided comparative
 data for college student subjects and nonstudent (adult) subjects for the
 present research. In general, responses of college student subjects were
 found to be slightly more homogeneous than those of nonstudent subjects.
 Moreover, effect sizes derived from college student subjects frequently
 differed from those derived from nonstudent subjects both directionally
 and in magnitude. Because there was no systematic pattern to the
 differences observed, caution must be exercised when attempting to extend
 any relationship found using college student subjects to a nonstudent
 (adult) population. The results augur in favor of, and emphasize the
 importance of, replicating research based on college student subjects with
 nonstudent subjects before attempting any generalizations.

Title: 
 Scripted Thought: Processing Korean Hancha and Hangul in a Multimedia Context.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 482-93
Issue: 3
Volume: 28
Year: 2001
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 We compare the cognitive processing of words written in alphabetic
 scripts with the cognitive processing of words written in logographic
 scripts. We suggest that the processing of words written in alphabetic
 scripts relies more heavily on the storage of--and the serial rehearsal
 properties of--short-term memory's phonological loop. In contrast, the
 processing of words written in logographic scripts relies more on the
 storage of--and the spatial-relational rehearsal properties of--visual
 short-term memory. A series of three experiments investigates implications
 of these processing differences within a single language, Korean, where
 words can be written in the alphabetic Hangul or in the logographic
 Hancha. These experiments examine contextual interference from auditory
 and visual stimuli, relational memory between brand names and auditory and
 visual brand identifiers, and two qualitative processing outcomes,
 serial-order memory and spatial-relational memory.

Title: 
 The Effect of Novel Attributes on Product Evaluation.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 462-72
Issue: 3
Volume: 28
Year: 2001
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 Many technological innovations introduce attributes that are novel or
 completely unknown to a large number of consumers. For example, recently
 introduced attributes such as GPS in cars or I-Link in computers are
 likely to have been novel to many consumers. Past research suggests that
 the addition of novel attributes is likely to improve product evaluation
 and sales, since consumers interpret these attributes as additional
 benefits provided by the manufacturer. However, this article demonstrates
 that the positive effect of novel attributes holds only in the case of
 low-complexity products. In the case of high-complexity products, the
 addition of novel attributes can actually reduce product evaluation
 because of negative learning-cost inferences about these attributes.
 Further, the positive and negative effects of novel attributes on product
 evaluation are accentuated by external search for information when the
 information discovered through search is ambiguous in nature. Finally, it
 is shown that the negative effect of novel attributes on the evaluation of
 high-complexity products can persist even after consumers are given
 explicit information about the benefits of novel attributes. A key
 marketing implication of these findings is that novel attributes may
 contribute to technophobia, or consumer resistance toward technological
 innovation.

Title: 
 The Moderating Effect of Perceived Risk on Consumers' Evaluations of Product Incongruity: Preference for the Norm.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 439-49
Issue: 3
Volume: 28
Year: 2001
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 Research supports the existence of a "moderate incongruity effect" such
 that an option that is moderately inconsistent with an evoked product
 category schema is sometimes preferred to a congruent option. We propose
 that perceived risk is an important situational factor that moderates the
 impact of congruity on evaluations. Three studies show that the positive
 evaluation of moderately incongruent products, relative to congruent ones,
 does not appear when there is risk associated with product selection. When
 consumers perceive high risk associated with a purchase, the moderate
 incongruity effect is reversed such that the congruent is preferred to the
 moderately incongruent product. Only in conditions where subjects
 perceived no real risk did the positive effect of moderate incongruity
 appear. The limiting effect of perceived risk appears to be due to
 consumers' "preferences for the norm" under high-risk conditions. The set
 of findings are discussed as they relate to and extend current thinking
 about the effects of moderate incongruity on evaluations.

Title: 
 Walking the Hedonic Product Treadmill: Default Contrast and Mood-Based Assimilation in Judgments of Predicted Happiness with a Target Product.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 355-68
Issue: 3
Volume: 28
Year: 2001
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 Consumers often browse through many products (a product context) before
 evaluating a particular target product. We examine the influence of four
 product context characteristics on happiness with a target product:
 pleasantness, sequence, domain match with target (i.e., whether products
 in the context set belong to the same category as the target), and context
 set size. When context and target match, pleasant and improving (compared
 to less pleasant and worsening) contexts induce less happiness with the
 target product. When there is domain mismatch, however, the results are
 reversed. Furthermore, the assimilation effects are significantly
 influenced by set size, but the contrast effects are not. While the
 contrast effects appear to occur by default and appear to be driven by a
 process of comparison, the assimilation effects appear to be driven by
 mood. These effects hold even when perception of domain match is
 manipulated via instructional framing.
