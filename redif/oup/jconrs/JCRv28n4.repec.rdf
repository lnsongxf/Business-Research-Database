Title: 
 Can Mixed Emotions Peacefully Coexist?

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 636-49
Issue: 4
Volume: 28
Year: 2002
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 This research sheds insight on the psychological impact of mixed emotions
 on attitudes. In three experiments, we show that persuasion appeals that
 highlight conflicting emotions (e.g., both happiness and sadness) lead to
 less favorable attitudes for individuals with a lower propensity to accept
 duality (e.g., Anglo Americans, younger adults) relative to those with a
 higher propensity (e.g., Asian Americans, older adults). The effect
 appears to be due to increased levels of felt discomfort that arise for
 those with a lower, but not higher, propensity to accept duality when
 exposed to mixed emotional appeals. Theoretical implications regarding
 boundary conditions of emotional dissonance and distinctions between
 emotional and cognitive dissonance are discussed.

Title: 
 Combinatory and Separative Effects of Rhetorical Figures on Consumers' Effort and Focus in Ad Processing.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 589-602
Issue: 4
Volume: 28
Year: 2002
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 Previous research demonstrates that rhetorical figures differentially
 affect the extent of ad processing. Specifically, tropes (a type of
 figure) deviate more from expected language use than schemes, with the
 greater deviation yielding more extensive ad processing. We extend
 previous research in two ways by focusing on the incongruity differences
 that exist between schemes and tropes. Study 1 uses syndicated data
 (Starch readership scores) to test how figures combine to affect the
 extent of processing. Results show that when figures leverage unique
 mechanisms (i.e., schemes and tropes), their combination yields
 incremental processing gains. Alternatively, when figures leverage
 redundant mechanisms (e.g., multiple tropes), their combination yields no
 incremental processing. Study 2 is an experiment that tests how figures
 separate in affecting the focus of ad processing. Results show that
 schemes generate a generalized focus on the entire ad, including both
 ad-stylistic and message-related aspects, while tropes generate a more
 selective focus on message-related aspects.

Title: 
 Counterfactual Thinking and Advertising Responses.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 650-58
Issue: 4
Volume: 28
Year: 2002
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 This article examines the effects of counterfactual thinking on
 information processing. We conceptualize counterfactual thinking--a
 process of mentally undoing the outcome of an event by imagining alternate
 antecedent states--as a problem-solving process that will increase
 scrutiny of subsequently encountered information. Results from two studies
 indicate that measures of persuasion are more sensitive to the quality of
 message arguments when counterfactual thinking precedes message exposure.
 This research raises the possibility that counterfactual thinking may be
 an underappreciated cognitive determinant of ad responses. This research
 also represents a first attempt at striking a relationship between
 counterfactual thinking and information processing.

Title: 
 Consumer Value Systems in the Age of Postmodern Fragmentation: The Case of the Natural Health Microculture.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 550-71
Issue: 4
Volume: 28
Year: 2002
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 This article extends postmodern theories of consumption-oriented
 microcultures by analyzing the natural health value system and the
 microcultural meanings through which it is constructed. We first compare
 our theoretical approach to the conventional, Rokeachian view of the
 consumer value system. Drawing from a range of cultural and postmodern
 theories, we argue that the Rokeachian view is not sufficiently attuned to
 the meaning-based aspects of consumer value systems. Furthermore, it
 largely ignores the intracultural diversity among consumer value systems
 that arises from the fragmentation of postmodern consumer culture into
 diverse consumption microcultures. Our analysis focuses on the narratives
 that natural health consumers use to articulate the values manifest in
 their wellness-oriented consumption outlooks and practices. These
 narratives reveal the meaning-based linkages between these articulated
 values and the consumption goals being pursued through natural health
 practices. We further contextualize the natural health value system by
 highlighting four higher-order postmodern orientations that are inflected
 in this microculture. We discuss the implications of our analysis for
 conceptualizations of the fragmented postmodern marketplace, means-end
 analyses of consumer values, and generative theories of consumer goal
 formation.

Title: 
 Factors Affecting Encoding, Retrieval, and Alignment of Sensory Attributes in a Memory-Based Brand Choice Task.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 603-17
Issue: 4
Volume: 28
Year: 2002
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 Sensory attributes, such as sound quality ascertained by listening to a
 stereo, are often ambiguous and therefore difficult to encode and
 retrieve. Despite this, consumers often place more weight on these
 attributes compared to verbally described market information when making
 brand choice decisions. Results from two studies demonstrate that
 providing criteria to evaluate the sound quality of competing brands of
 stereos facilitates the encoding, retrieval, and alignment of the sensory
 attribute in a brand choice task. Study 1 shows that without criteria to
 evaluate sound quality during trial, memory for this attribute is poor.
 Further, perceptions of sound quality assimilate to conflicting market
 information, which adversely affects decision performance. The reverse is
 true when evaluative criteria and a scheme to rate the criteria are
 provided: memory for sound quality improves, perceptions of sound quality
 contrast with conflicting market information, more weight is placed on
 sound quality when decision making, and better choices are made. Study 2
 shows that providing evaluative criteria during product trial enhances
 performance through improvement in the encoding process.

Title: 
 Automatic Construction and Use of Contextual Information for Product and Price Evaluations.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 572-88
Issue: 4
Volume: 28
Year: 2002
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 The context in which a product is seen influences the internal standard
 that consumers use to judge both this and other products. Two experiments
 showed that a product was judged as less expensive in a high-priced
 context than in a low-priced context even though the product's actual
 price was recalled as higher in the first condition than in the second.
 This effect of the initial context carried over to a new product
 encountered 48 hours later and also influenced price estimates of products
 from other categories. Additional experiments demonstrated that the
 standard that people use to evaluate products can be influenced by
 exposure to high and low stimulus values that are below participants'
 perceptual thresholds. Thus, the effects of internal standards on product
 judgments can occur without an awareness of the conditions that led to the
 construction of this standard.

Title: 
 Toward a Theory of Consumer Choice as Sociohistorically Shaped Practical Experience: The Fits-Like-a-Glove (FLAG) Framework.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 515-32
Issue: 4
Volume: 28
Year: 2002
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 This article presents an ethnographic investigation into choice for
 postsecondary education. Findings from the investigation highlight choice
 experience during which the consumer finds the object of choice to be a
 perfect fit or to fit like a glove. The article seeks to expand consumer
 research's repertoire of choice models to grasp more effectively such
 choices. Practice theory, which emphasizes the sociohistorical and
 embodied qualities of everyday experience, is used to develop the
 Fits-Like-a-Glove (FLAG) framework of choice. Overall, the data suggest
 that FLAG choice entails an embodied, holistic experience of perfect fit
 arising during a consumer's in situ encounter with an object of choice.
 FLAG choice is explained by highlighting the sociohistorical shaping of
 this encounter. By comparing and contrasting it with dominant models of
 choice in consumer research, the implications of the FLAG framework of
 choice are brought into relief.

Title: 
 Consumers' Beliefs about Product Benefits: The Effect of Obviously Irrelevant Product Information.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 618-35
Issue: 4
Volume: 28
Year: 2002
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 When consumers try to assess the performance of a product on a key
 benefit, their information search often reveals both diagnostic
 information and irrelevant information. Although one would expect
 irrelevant information to have little impact on predictions of product
 performance, we present evidence that the irrelevant information
 systematically weakens consumers' beliefs that the product will provide
 the benefit. We show that this dilution effect persists after subjects
 have acknowledged the irrelevance of the additional information but that
 it does depend on whether the product information is processed with the
 desired benefit in mind. We conclude that consumers are selectively
 looking for information that suggests the product will deliver the desired
 benefit and that they categorize any additional evidence, be it irrelevant
 or disconfirming, as not confirming. As a consequence, irrelevant
 information weakens consumers' beliefs in the product's ability to deliver
 the benefit.
