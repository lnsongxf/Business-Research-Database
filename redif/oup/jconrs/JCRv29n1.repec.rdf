Title: 
 An Experimental Investigation of the Joint Effects of Advertising and Peers on Adolescents' Beliefs and Intentions about Cigarette Consumption.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 5-19
Issue: 1
Volume: 29
Year: 2002
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 Ninth graders were randomly exposed to one of eight slice-of-life
 videotapes showing stimulus advertising (cigarette, antismoking, both,
 neither) and unfamiliar peers who either did or did not smoke cigarettes.
 The findings indicate that the cigarette advertising primed positive
 smoker stereotypes, which caused subjects to seek out favorable
 information about the peers shown smoking. Subjects' beliefs and
 intentions about cigarette consumption were thereby enhanced by the joint
 effects of advertising and peers. However, an antismoking advertisement
 shown in conjunction with cigarette advertising made salient negative
 smoker stereotypes, evoked unfavorable thoughts about peers shown smoking,
 and prevented cigarette advertising from promoting smoking.

Title: 
 Regret in Repeat Purchase versus Switching Decisions: The Attenuating Role of Decision Justifiability.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 116-28
Issue: 1
Volume: 29
Year: 2002
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 The decision-making literature has consistently reported that decisions
 to maintain the status quo tend to be regretted less than decisions to
 change it. We examine the consequences of repeat purchasing (maintaining
 the status quo) versus switching in the context of information regarding
 the reason for the decision (e.g., prior consumption episode, brand
 history), and we argue that there are situations in which repeat
 purchasing may cause as much or even more regret than switching. We
 contend that this effect depends on whether or not there is a justifiable
 basis for the decision. In a series of four studies, we show that if there
 is sufficient motivation to warrant a switch, consumers will feel less
 regret in the face of a subsequent negative outcome realized via a switch
 than in one realized via a repeat purchase. Our results imply that
 feelings of regret are mitigated when the consumer reflects and concludes
 that the decision was appropriate under the circumstances.

Title: 
 Why Do Brands Cause Trouble? A Dialectical Theory of Consumer Culture and Branding.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 70-90
Issue: 1
Volume: 29
Year: 2002
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 Brands are today under attack by an emerging countercultural movement.
 This study builds a dialectical theory of consumer culture and branding
 that explains the rise of this movement and its potential effects. Results
 of an interpretive study challenge existing theories of consumer
 resistance. To develop an alternative model, I first trace the rise of the
 modern cultural engineering paradigm of branding, premised upon a consumer
 culture that granted marketers cultural authority. Intrinsic
 contradictions erased its efficacy. Next I describe the current postmodern
 consumer culture, which is premised upon the pursuit of personal
 sovereignty through brands. I detail five postmodern branding techniques
 that are premised upon the principle that brands are authentic cultural
 resources. Postmodern branding is now giving rise to new contradictions
 that have inflamed the antibranding sentiment sweeping Western countries.
 I detail these contradictions and project that they will give rise to a
 new post-postmodern branding paradigm premised upon brands as
 citizen-artists.

Title: 
 Can Consumers Escape the Market? Emancipatory Illuminations from Burning Man.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 20-38
Issue: 1
Volume: 29
Year: 2002
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 This ethnography explores the emancipatory dynamics of the Burning Man
 project, a one-week-long antimarket event. Practices used at Burning Man
 to distance consumers from the market include discourses supporting
 communality and disparaging market logics, alternative exchange practices,
 and positioning consumption as self-expressive art. Findings reveal
 several communal practices that distance consumption from broader
 rhetorics of efficiency and rationality. Although Burning Man's
 participants materially support the market, they successfully construct a
 temporary hypercommunity from which to practice divergent social logics.
 Escape from the market, if possible at all, must be conceived of as
 similarly temporary and local.

Title: 
 Anticipating Discussion about a Product: Rehearsing What to Say Can Affect Your Judgments.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 101-15
Issue: 1
Volume: 29
Year: 2002
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 This research examines one aspect of the common but relatively
 understudied consumer behavior context of group interaction. We argue and
 demonstrate that the mere anticipation of group discussion can influence
 people's product attitudes. This occurs because anticipating discussion
 shifts people's focus toward the criteria dominating what they are
 mentally rehearsing to discuss. Such a shift is important because people
 commonly refer primarily to less important information when they explain
 or prepare to discuss their attitudes. Three studies demonstrate that when
 people are forming an attitude toward a product while anticipating
 discussion, this focus on less important information substantially affects
 people's attitudes toward the product. As a result, depending on the
 evaluative implications of what is rehearsed, anticipating group
 discussion can lead to attitudes that are more extreme, more moderate, or
 similar to those of people not anticipating discussion. Moreover, when the
 criteria predominantly rehearsed for discussion do not represent how
 consumers typically evaluate the products, attitudes affected by the
 group-anticipation context do not correspond to product judgments made
 outside of the group-anticipation context.

Title: 
 The Ego Factor in Tourism.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 146-51
Issue: 1
Volume: 29
Year: 2002
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 Tourists travel the entire globe to be in the presence of peoples,
 places, and objects they cannot buy or otherwise take possession of except
 in a spiritual sense. This essay explores the noneconomic relation at the
 heart of tourism, which is now said to be the largest economic sector in
 the world. The dominant way commercially successful destinations have
 organized touristic experience has been to model themselves as closely as
 possible on the ego. Other commodities sold on the basis of their
 intangible qualities may be implicated in the same narcissistic ego
 structure. Some questions are raised about the sustainability of ego-based
 consumption.

Title: 
 Effects of Inconsistent Attribute Information on the Predictive Value of Product Attitudes: Toward a Resolution of Opposing Perspectives.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 39-56
Issue: 1
Volume: 29
Year: 2002
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 This article examines the effects of evaluative inconsistencies in
 product attribute information on the strength of the resultant attitude,
 as manifested in its predictive ability. The existing literature makes
 opposing predictions regarding the effects of information inconsistency on
 attitude strength. We seek to resolve this dilemma by investigating the
 likelihood of inconsistency reconciliation--that is, whether or not people
 elaborate on inconsistencies with the goal of achieving an integrated
 evaluation. A strengthening effect should result when the processing goal
 is conducive to reconciliation and goal-facilitating factors are present
 in the environment; however, a weakening effect should be obtained when
 conditions are unfavorable to inconsistency reconciliation. Results from
 three experiments provide support for this conceptualization and offer a
 possible resolution of the opposing theoretical perspectives present in
 the literature.
