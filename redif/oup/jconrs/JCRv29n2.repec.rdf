Title: 
 The Scope and Persistence of Mere-Measurement Effects: Evidence from a Field Study of Customer Satisfaction Measurement.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 159-67
Issue: 2
Volume: 29
Year: 2002
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 Self-generated validity research has demonstrated that responding to
 survey questions changes subsequently measured judgments and behavior. We
 examine the scope and persistence of the effect of measuring satisfaction
 on customer behavior over time. In a field experiment conducted in a
 financial services setting, we hypothesize and find that measuring
 satisfaction (a) changes one-time purchase behavior, (b) changes
 relational customer behaviors (likelihood of defection, aggregate product
 use, and profitability), and (c) results in effects that increase for
 months afterward and persist even a year later. These results raise
 questions concerning the design, interpretation, and ethics in the conduct
 of applied marketing research studies.

Title: 
 The Impact of Private versus Public Consumption on Variety-Seeking Behavior.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 246-57
Issue: 2
Volume: 29
Year: 2002
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 Three experiments demonstrate that people incorporate more variety into
 their consumption decisions when their behavior is subject to public
 scrutiny. Studies 1 and 2 indicate that consumers expect others to
 evaluate their decision more favorably if they choose variety and that
 this sometimes leads individuals to incorporate more variety into their
 public than private decisions. Results of study 2 confirm predictions that
 a relevant individual difference variable (self-monitoring) moderates the
 effects of expected evaluation on variety seeking. The final study
 demonstrates that pressure to choose variety in public is eliminated when
 a social cue signals the appropriateness of consuming one's favorites.

Title: 
 Toward a Personology of the Customer.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 286-92
Issue: 2
Volume: 29
Year: 2002
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 Personality research has long been a fringe player in the study of
 consumer behavior. Little research is directly devoted to personality
 issues, and if consumer personality is investigated at all, it tends to be
 from the narrow perspective of developing yet another individual
 difference measure in an already crowded field of personality scales or
 considering the moderating effects of a given trait on some relationship
 of interest. Understanding the individual person in his or her role as a
 consumer should be a key issue in the study of consumer behavior, but in
 order to realize this vision the scope of personality research has to be
 broadened. In this essay I discuss recent work in personality psychology
 that may serve as the foundation for the development of a personology of
 the consumer, in which people are seen as dispositional, goal-striving,
 and narrative entities engaged in consumption in the broadest sense.

Title: 
 Taking Stock of Stockbrokers: Exploring Momentum versus Contrarian Investor Strategies and Profiles.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 188-98
Issue: 2
Volume: 29
Year: 2002
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 Two studies were conducted among professional security analysts to
 explore their patterns of decision making while managing investment
 portfolios. In study 1, a computer-based simulation, the analysts' styles
 differed markedly, with most exhibiting either a momentum or contrarian
 approach, as indicated by responses to portfolio stock price changes.
 Study 2 used a verbal protocol procedure and semistructured depth
 interviews to probe the analysts' thought processes. Momentum and
 contrarian investors were found to differ on a number of dimensions
 including price expectations, age, experience, raw performance, risk
 propensity, cognitive style, knowledge calibration, and strategy
 adaptivity. Implications and limitations are discussed.

Title: 
 When Web Pages Influence Choice: Effects of Visual Primes on Experts and Novices.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 235-45
Issue: 2
Volume: 29
Year: 2002
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 This article extends the idea that priming can influence preferences by
 making selected attributes focal. Our on-line experiments manipulate the
 background pictures and colors of a Web page, affecting consumer product
 choice. We demonstrate that these effects occur for both experts and
 novices, albeit by different mechanisms. For novices, priming drives
 differences in external search that, in turn, drive differences in choice.
 For experts, we observe differences in choice that are not mediated by
 changes in external search. These findings confirmed that on-line
 atmospherics in electronic environments could have a significant influence
 on consumer choice.

Title: 
 A Role for Poetry in Consumer Research.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 218-34
Issue: 2
Volume: 29
Year: 2002
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 Consumer researchers are wrestling with the crisis of representation that
 has challenged contiguous disciplines over the past decade. Traditional or
 conventional prose articles seem increasingly insufficient as vessels for
 representing our understandings and experiences. In this article, we
 demonstrate how poetry contributes to the research enterprise. We use our
 own experiences as researcher-poets to illustrate how the writing and
 close reading of poetry can take us directly to the heart of consumption.
 Our essay is intended to provide a philosophical basis for the inclusion
 of poetry between the covers of this journal.

Title: 
 How Prevalent Is the Negativity Effect in Consumer Environments?

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 270-79
Issue: 2
Volume: 29
Year: 2002
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 The negativity effect, or the greater weighing of negative as compared
 with equally extreme positive information in the formation of overall
 evaluations, is widely believed by media planners and appears to be a
 well-proven phenomenon in consumer psychology. Although this effect has
 been extensively documented under conditions of moderate to high
 processing involvement in the literature, its robustness in consumer
 environments may be overstated. Specifically, there are important
 differences between the experimental settings in which this effect has
 typically been obtained and marketplace conditions. For instance, subjects
 in past studies have typically evaluated unknown or hypothetical targets
 with the goal of forming an accurate impression. In the marketplace,
 consumers may be familiar with brands and likely to process brand-related
 information with a variety of other processing goals, such as impression
 and defense motivation. Using two experiments, this re-inquiry delineates
 conditions under which the negativity effect is likely to emerge and those
 under which it may be less likely to occur.

Title:   Source and Nonsource Cues in Advertising and Their Effects on the Activation of Cultural and Subcultural Knowledge on the Route to Persuasion.
Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 258-69
Issue: 2
Volume: 29
Year: 2002
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 This article examines how ads with different combinations of source and
 nonsource cues activate culture-bound cognitions among members of a
 dominant culture and members of a subculture within that dominant culture.
 As participants in both the dominant culture and their own subculture,
 members of subcultures are posited to possess knowledge of both groups. As
 such, their reactions to mainstream advertising are expected to be similar
 to those of members of the dominant culture. However, because members of
 the dominant culture are not as familiar with the subculture, their
 reactions to cues contained in subculture-targeted ads will differ from
 those of members of the subculture. Results of an experiment show that
 dominant culture source cues activate highly internalized dominant
 cultural models for all participants, leading to self-referencing and
 favorable ad attitudes. However, subculture source and nonsource cues
 interact to activate subcultural knowledge, induce self-referencing, and
 enhance ad attitudes only among members of the subculture.

Title: 
 Losing Consciousness: Automatic Influences on Consumer Judgment, Behavior, and Motivation.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 280-85
Issue: 2
Volume: 29
Year: 2002
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 Consumer research has largely missed out on two key developments in
 social cognition research: the growing evidence that much of social
 judgment and behavior occur without conscious awareness or intent and the
 substantial moderating influence of social- and self-related goal pursuits
 on basic cognitive and reasoning processes. This evidence is described and
 its implications are drawn for nonconscious--including
 subliminal--influences on consumer behavior. The consumer research domain
 appears ideal for the necessary next wave of this research: the assessment
 of how much of a role nonconscious influences play in real life in
 decisions and behavior that are of real consequence to the individual.

Title: 
 The Propositon-Probability Model of Argument Structure and Message Acceptance.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 168-87
Issue: 2
Volume: 29
Year: 2002
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 Drawing on aspects of logic, classical rhetoric, psycholinguistics,
 social psychology, and probability theory, this article develops the
 proposition-probability model (PPM) of argument structure and message
 acceptance in which verbal arguments are decomposed into arrays of three
 types of propositions: (a) product claims, (b) data supporting those
 claims, and (c) conditional rules specifying the relationship between the
 data and the claims. The propositions making up a given argument can be
 stated, entailed, presupposed, conversationally implicated, and/or
 linguistically signaled. Message acceptance is based on the formation
 and/or modification of beliefs corresponding to the propositions in a
 given argument. For purposes of making precise predictions regarding the
 effectiveness of various argument structures, these beliefs are
 represented in terms of probabilities associated with each proposition.
 Several postulates are derived from the PPM, and directions for future
 research on communication and persuasion are discussed.
