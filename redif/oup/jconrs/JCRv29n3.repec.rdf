Title: 
 The Influence of Level of Processing on Advertising Repetition Effects.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 371-82
Issue: 3
Volume: 29
Year: 2002
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 This research examines whether or not repetition of features of a
 stimulus are subject to wear-out effects that have until now only been
 tested for the stimulus as a whole. When consumers process features in
 either a shallower or deeper manner, the level of processing performed
 dictates the effect of repeated feature exposure on their judgments. When
 repeated exposures to features are processed in a shallower fashion, there
 is an enhancement in evaluations with no subsequent downturn, whereas
 repeated exposure to features that are processed more deeply results in
 evaluations that exhibit the classic inverted U-shaped pattern.

Title: 
 Inherent Rule Variability in Consumer Choice: Changing Rules for Change's Sake.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 293-305
Issue: 3
Volume: 29
Year: 2002
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 The present research demonstrates that consumers tend to vary their use
 of decision rules independent of option and set characteristics. In five
 experiments, increased choice of a particular option (e.g., lower price,
 brand name, or compromise option) was associated with relatively decreased
 choice of that same (generic) option on occasions that followed. Results
 indicate that this inherent rule variability is not an effect of
 background contrast but instead relates to consumers' favorable valuation
 of decision change itself. This research implies that the idea of
 contingent decision making applies not only to decision outcomes but also
 to decision processes.

Title: 
 Investigating the Effectiveness of Product Placements in Television Shows: The Role of Modality and Plot Connection Congruence on Brand Memory and Attitude.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 306-18
Issue: 3
Volume: 29
Year: 2002
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 This article develops and tests a conceptual framework for the practice
 of product placement. The empirical testing introduces a controlled
 experimental approach called the theater methodology. Results show that
 the modality of presentation (visual and auditory) of the placements and
 the degree of connection between a brand and the plot of the show interact
 to influence memory and attitude change. Memory improves when modality and
 plot connection are incongruent but persuasion is enhanced by congruency.
 While congruous placements appear natural, incongruent placements
 adversely affect brand attitudes because they seem out of place and are
 discounted.

Title: 
 Product Experience Is Seductive.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 448-54
Issue: 3
Volume: 29
Year: 2002
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 Product experience seduces consumers into believing that they learn more
 than is actually so. There are several reasons for this. First, experience
 is more engaging than most attempts at education, both more vivid and
 intentional, and consequently more memorable. Second, experience is viewed
 as nonpartisan, devoid of the didacticism of formal education and the
 self-serving interests of advertisers. Third, much of experience is
 ambiguous, but not recognized as such. Experience supports a
 pseudodiagnosticity that draws the consumer in as a willing partner in the
 seduction. Finally, the endogeneity of tastes allows consumers to
 accommodate to chosen alternatives and results in infrequent regrets about
 being seduced.

Title: 
 Coping with Ambivalence: The Effect of Removing a Neutral Option on Consumer Attitude and Preference Judgments.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 319-34
Issue: 3
Volume: 29
Year: 2002
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 This article examines how the exclusion of a neutral or fence-sitting
 option changes an expressed attitude or preference judgment. Over a series
 of six studies, we find that the exclusion of a neutral response option
 (1) affects the judgment of extreme options (strong positive and negative
 features) more significantly than the judgment of options that are average
 on all features, (2) results in respondents favoring the option superior
 on the more important attribute, and (3) results in more risk aversion. We
 also provide evidence for the underlying process and show that our
 findings are moderated by individual differences on need for cognition and
 tolerance for ambiguity.

Title: The Politics of Consumption: A Re-inquiry on Thompson and Haytko's (1997) "Speaking of Fashion."
Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 427-40
Issue: 3
Volume: 29
Year: 2002
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 This article explores Thompson and Haytko's (1997) interpretation of
 fashion discourses by bringing together two opposing perspectives on
 consumers' use of objects as signs. The first perspective assumes that the
 consumer has free reign in the play of signs (i.e., the consumer is
 constituting). The second assumes that the consumer is imprisoned by the
 signs and codes of the historical moment (i.e., the consumer is
 constituted). The dialectical and discursive tension between these two
 perspectives is used as an orienting framework in the hermeneutic analyses
 of 14 phenomenological interviews. Thompson and Haytko's (1997)
 findings/claims remain pertinent in a professional, middle-class context.
 In addition, this research contributes to their lived hegemony premise by
 emphasizing the dominating tendencies of marketing systems.

 Valves of Desire: A Historian's Perspective on Parents, Children, and Marketing.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 441-47
Issue: 3
Volume: 29
Year: 2002
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 This historical analysis on marketing to children argues that the
 communications linkage between advertiser and child is more problematic
 than contemporary research models suggest. Cultural reactions to modern
 market society have led to constructions of childhood innocence that have
 both restricted and expanded consumption. Over the last century, this
 ambiguous response has produced repeated efforts to regulate advertising
 and has led to adult spending to restore wonder through giving to
 children. The implications of this analysis for marketing and consumer
 research is discussed.

Title: 
 Effect of Face Value on Product Valuation in Foreign Currencies.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 335-47
Issue: 3
Volume: 29
Year: 2002
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 This article examines systematic differences in people's spending
 behavior when using foreign currencies. Rather than overspend or
 underspend in general, we show that individuals' valuation of a product in
 an unfamiliar foreign currency is biased toward its nominal value--its
 face value--with inadequate adjustment for the exchange rate. This leads
 to underspending when the face value of a foreign currency is a multiple
 of an equivalent unit of a home currency (e.g., 4 Malaysian ringgits = 1
 U.S. dollar) and overspending when it is a fraction (e.g., .4 Bahraini
 dinar = 1 U.S. dollar). Four studies demonstrate the robustness of the
 face value effect across different currencies, exchange rate frames, and
 with samples from two countries, and two studies show that ability-related
 factors such as time pressure and experience moderate the face value
 effect. The article concludes by discussing the theoretical implications
 of the findings.

Title: 
 The Effect of Group Membership Salience on the Avoidance of Negative Outcomes: Implications for Social and Consumer Decisions.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 400-415
Issue: 3
Volume: 29
Year: 2002
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 Calling consumers' attention to their cultural identity can make them
 aware of their membership in a group and, therefore, can induce a group
 mind-set. This mind-set, in turn, leads them to make decisions that
 minimize the risk of negative outcomes to both themselves and others. The
 effects of this mind-set generalize over both group and individual choice
 situations. These possibilities were confirmed in a series of six
 experiments. Results showed that making people feel part of an ad hoc
 group increased not only their use of equality as a basis for allocating
 resources to themselves and others, but also their tendency to compromise
 in individual consumer choice situations. Moreover, calling Asian and
 Western participants' attention to their cultural identity also induced
 feelings of being part of a group and, as a result, had analogous effects
 on decisions in both group and consumer choice situations.

Title: 
 Prior Knowledge and Complacency in New Product Learning.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 416-26
Issue: 3
Volume: 29
Year: 2002
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 Our research examines the role of prior knowledge in learning new product
 information. Three studies demonstrate that, compared to consumers with
 lower prior knowledge, those with higher prior knowledge learn less about
 a new product. Further, higher knowledge consumers are able to learn more
 but learn less due to motivational deficits; inferior learning of new
 product information by those with higher prior knowledge is caused by
 inattention at encoding rather than reconstructive errors at retrieval.
 These results hold both when prior knowledge is manipulated experimentally
 (studies 1 and 2) and when it is an individual difference factor (study
 3).

Title: 
 Materialism and Well-Being: A Conflicting Values Perspective.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 348-70
Issue: 3
Volume: 29
Year: 2002
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 Over the past decade, materialism has emerged as an important research
 topic. Materialism is generally viewed as the value placed on the
 acquisition of material objects. Previous research finds that high levels
 of material values are negatively associated with subjective well-being.
 However, relatively little is known about the relationship between
 materialism and well-being within the broader context of an individual's
 value system. In this article, we examine the relationship between
 material values and other important life values. In addition, we draw on
 values theory to examine a novel conceptualization of why materialism is
 antithetical to well-being. Specifically, our theory proposes that the
 individual orientation of material values conflicts with
 collective-oriented values, such as family values and religious values.
 This state of values conflict creates psychological tension, and this
 tension is associated with a reduced sense of well-being. Using both a
 survey sample of 373 adults from across the United States and an
 experimental study of 120 college students, we find considerable support
 for this conflicting values perspective.

Title: 
 The Protean Quality of Subcultural Consumption: An Ethnographic Account of Gay Consumers.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 383-99
Issue: 3
Volume: 29
Year: 2002
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 Previous work on subcultural consumption presents structure, ethos, and
 subcultural boundaries as key theoretical aspects. These concepts are
 critically reconsidered through examining and interpreting ethnographic
 fieldwork and the consumer accounts of 44 gay men interviewed during a
 study of a gay urban community. Original insights are developed in
 relation to consuming in a subcultural context. The findings include
 consideration of the following key aspects of subcultural consumption: (1)
 contested meanings of gay subcultural consumption, (2) consuming and
 constructing subcultural boundaries, and (3) negotiating individual
 distinction with consumption practices. Overall, findings indicate that
 the oppositional character of subcultural consumption is captured well by
 the proposed theoretical framework that takes into account contested
 meaning clusters; fluid subcultural boundaries; flexible subcultural,
 interpretive frameworks for consuming; and negotiation of individual
 tastes through subcultural consumption.
