Title: 
 Locus of Equity and Brand Extension.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 539-50
Issue: 4
Volume: 29
Year: 2003
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 Prevailing wisdom assumes that brand equity increases when a brand touts
 its desirable attributes. We report conditions under which the use of
 attribute information to promote a product can shift the locus of equity
 from brand to attribute, thereby reducing the attractiveness of extension
 products. This effect is moderated by the degree of ambiguity in the
 learning environment, such that prevailing wisdom is refuted when
 ambiguity is low but is supported when ambiguity is high.

Title: 
 Individual Differences in the Centrality of Visual Product Aesthetics: Concept and Measurement.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 551-65
Issue: 4
Volume: 29
Year: 2003
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 This research conceptualizes and develops a scale to measure individual
 differences in the centrality of visual product aesthetics (CVPA), defined
 as the level of significance that visual aesthetics hold for a particular
 consumer in his/her relationship with products. Three related dimensions
 of product aesthetics centrality emerged from the research: value, acumen,
 and response intensity. A series of eight studies provided evidence that
 the CVPA measure possesses satisfactory reliability and validity.
 Additionally, this research illuminates important differences between high
 and low CVPA consumers in product-design-related evaluations and behaviors
 and provides suggestions for future research employing the scale.

Title: 
 Why Do People Suggest What They Do Not Want? Using Context Effects to Influence Others' Choices.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 492-506
Issue: 4
Volume: 29
Year: 2003
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 Previous research has demonstrated that people's preferences for an
 alternative can be reliably influenced by the other alternatives with
 which it is considered. This article examines the role of context effects
 in interactive decision making. Three studies examine people's intuitive
 abilities to influence others by leveraging context effects and their
 reactions when they believe others are manipulating the choice context to
 influence them. Experimental results show that people use context effects
 systematically when trying to influence others and, that under certain
 conditions, the perception of influence may enhance rather than decrease
 the effectiveness of this persuasion tactic.

Title: 
 Looking Back: Exploring the Psychology of Queuing and the Effect of the Number of People Behind.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 517-30
Issue: 4
Volume: 29
Year: 2003
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 Queues are a ubiquitous phenomenon. This research investigates consumers'
 affective experiences in a queue and their decisions to leave the queue
 after having spent some time in it (reneging). In particular, we find in
 our first two studies that, as the number of people behind increases, the
 consumer is in a relatively more positive affective state and the
 likelihood of reneging is lower. While a number of explanations may
 account for this effect, we focus on the role of social comparisons. In
 particular, we expect consumers in a queue to make downward comparisons
 with the less fortunate others behind them. We propose that three types of
 factors influence the degree of social comparisons made and thus moderate
 the effect of the number behind: (a) queue factors that influence the ease
 with which social comparisons can be made, (b) individual factors that
 determine the personal tendency to make social comparisons, and (c)
 situational factors that influence the degree of social comparisons
 through the generation of counterfactuals. Across three studies, we find
 support for each moderating effect. We conclude with a discussion on
 theoretical implications and limitations, and we propose avenues for
 future research.

Title: 
 The Devaluation Effect: Activating a Need Devalues Unrelated Objects.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 463-73
Issue: 4
Volume: 29
Year: 2003
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 It is commonly assumed that an object capable of satisfying a need will
 be perceived as subjectively more valuable as the need for it intensifies.
 For example, the more active the need to eat, the more valuable food will
 become. This outcome could be called a valuation effect. In this article,
 we suggest a second basic influence of needs on evaluations: that
 activating a focal need (e.g., to eat) makes objects unrelated to that
 need (e.g., shampoo) less valuable, an outcome we refer to as the
 devaluation effect. Two existing studies support the existence of a
 devaluation effect using manipulations of the need to eat and to smoke and
 measuring attractiveness of consumer products and willingness to purchase
 raffle tickets. Furthermore, the evidence suggests that consumers are not
 aware of the devaluation effect and its influence on their preferences.

Title: 
 Consumer Perceptions of Price (Un)Fairness.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 474-91
Issue: 4
Volume: 29
Year: 2003
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 A series of studies demonstrates that consumers are inclined to believe
 that the selling price of a good or service is substantially higher than
 its fair price. Consumers appear sensitive to several reference
 points--including past prices, competitor prices, and cost of goods
 sold--but underestimate the effects of inflation, overattribute price
 differences to profit, and fail to take into account the full range of
 vendor costs. Potential corrective interventions--such as providing
 historical price information, explaining price differences, and cueing
 costs--were only modestly effective. These results are considered in the
 context of a four-dimensional transaction space that illustrates sources
 of perceived unfairness for both individual and multiple transactions.

Title: 
 Self-Reports in Consumer Research: The Challenge of Comparing Cohorts and Cultures.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 588-94
Issue: 4
Volume: 29
Year: 2003
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 Self-reports are a key source of information in consumer research.
 Unfortunately, self-reports are highly context dependent, and this problem
 is compounded when comparisons across cohorts or cultures are of interest.
 Age-related changes in cognitive functioning and cultural differences in
 cognition and communication influence the response process, resulting in
 differential context effects that may reverse the ordinal placement of
 cohorts or cultures on the measure of interest. Any observed difference
 between age groups or cultures may therefore reflect a meaningful
 difference in attitudes or behaviors, a difference in the response
 process, or an unknown mix of both.

Title: 
 Cognitive Determinants of Consumers' Time Perceptions: The Impact of Resources Required and Available.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 531-38
Issue: 4
Volume: 29
Year: 2003
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 This study examines cognitive processes believed to be responsible for
 systematic distortions in the subjective experience of time. In two
 experiments, subjects were exposed to mock radio ads containing congruent
 or incongruent information and asked to estimate the ads' durations
 retrospectively. Consistent with a resource-matching hypothesis, perceived
 time depended on the interplay of cognitive resources required and
 available. When cognitive resources required match cognitive resources
 available (at either high or low levels), time estimates were longer than
 when resources were mismatched. Evidence also suggests that durations may
 be inferred from the amount of information reconstructed from and linked
 to a time interval.

Title: 
 The Time Course and Impact of Consumers' Erroneous Beliefs about Hedonic Contrast Effects.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 507-16
Issue: 4
Volume: 29
Year: 2003
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 Results from four experiments indicate that people expect to enjoy an
 experience more when it will follow a worse experience. We find that
 consumers expect hedonic contrast effects even when they do not experience
 such effects. Whereas individuals remember the absence of contrast effects
 after a short delay (study 1), individuals reporting retrospective
 judgments after a long delay (study 2) recalled that they had experienced
 contrast effects. These biased memories about contrast effects are
 eliminated when individuals focus on enjoyment during the experience. The
 present experiments document the time course of erroneous beliefs about
 contrast effects, mechanisms underlying their resistance to change, and
 the impact of these expectations about contrast effects on consumer
 choice.

Title: 
 Brand Synthesis: The Multidimensionality of Brand Knowledge.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 595-600
Issue: 4
Volume: 29
Year: 2003
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 The increased priority placed on branding by marketers in recent years
 offers an opportunity for consumer researchers to provide valuable
 insights and guidance. In particular, in highly competitive marketplaces,
 marketers often must link their brands to other entities, for example,
 people, places, things, or other brands, as a means to improve their brand
 equity. Understanding this leveraging process requires understanding
 consumer brand knowledge and how it changes from such associations. In
 this essay, I identify some promising and productive current research on
 this topic, and I suggest some important issues for future research. I
 conclude that adopting broader, more holistic perspectives that synthesize
 the multidimensionality of brand knowledge is critical to advance branding
 theory and practice, both in general and with brand leveraging in
 particular.

Title: 
 Visual and Verbal Rhetorical Figures under Directed Processing versus Incidental Exposure to Advertising.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 579-87
Issue: 4
Volume: 29
Year: 2003
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 This re-inquiry examines the robustness of research showing that
 rhetorical figures such as rhyme and metaphor can have a positive impact
 on consumer response to advertising. Prior empirical research explicitly
 directed subjects to process the ads and generally examined either visual
 or verbal rhetoric, but not both. We embedded ads containing visual and
 verbal figures in a 32-page magazine designed to be interesting to
 subjects and manipulated directed processing or incidental exposure to the
 ads. Ads with figures were recalled more often and liked better. Visual
 figures were more effective regardless of processing condition, whereas
 verbal figures performed better only when subjects were directed to
 process the ads.

Title: 
 Sympathy and Empathy: Emotional Responses to Advertising Dramas.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 566-78
Issue: 4
Volume: 29
Year: 2003
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 This research examines differences in consumers' sympathy and empathy
 responses to televised drama commercials. The research framework is
 multidisciplinary, for construct definition from humanities disciplines
 (aesthetics and philosophy) grounds the empirical testing of sympathy and
 empathy responses to advertising. Valid and reliable measurement
 instruments are developed to test relationships between sympathy and
 empathy as responses to classical and vignette advertising dramas. Results
 of two experiments indicate that sympathy responses mediate the effect of
 a drama advertisement's form on empathy responses, with both sympathy and
 empathy directly enhancing positive attitudes to an advertisement.
