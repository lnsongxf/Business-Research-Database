Title: 
 Smart Agents: When Lower Search Costs for Quality Information Increase Price Sensitivity.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 56-71
Issue: 1
Volume: 30
Year: 2003
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 Recent consumer research suggests that lowering search costs for quality
 information reduces consumer price sensitivity by creating greater
 perceived differentiation among brands (e.g., Kaul and Wittink 1995; Lynch
 and Ariely 2000). We argue that lowering quality search costs by smart
 agents can have the opposite effect on differentiation and price
 sensitivity. Smart agents screen through a universe of alternatives,
 recommending only a handful well-matched to the customer's quality
 preferences. In this research, we ask and answer the following questions:
 In markets in which price and quality are uncorrelated, will the use of
 screening agents increase or decrease prices paid compared to searching
 from an unordered list of options? Will increasing the size of the store's
 underlying assortment increase or decrease prices paid when options have
 been screened on quality? In markets where higher priced goods have higher
 quality, will the use of screening agents increase or decrease prices paid
 and quality selected? Experiments 1 and 2 test the effect of quality
 screening when price and quality are uncorrelated. We then present an
 analytic model for markets in which price and quality are correlated. We
 deduce that ordering can cause price and quality to increase or decrease
 depending on the slope of the price-quality relationship in comparison
 with the relative importance of price in the utility function. We find
 support for this model in experiment 3.

Title: 
 The Formation of Market-Level Expectations and Its Covariates.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 115-24
Issue: 1
Volume: 30
Year: 2003
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 A formal model of market-level expectations is developed and used to
 identify testable hypotheses. The empirical findings indicate that
 market-level expectations are more adaptive in nature than previously
 thought. The study also provides the first systematic investigation of
 cross-industry variation in the formation of market-level expectations.
 Several factors, including advertising, word-of-mouth, market growth, and
 purchase frequency, are found to have a significant moderating influence
 on the adaptation rate. Finally, we find that market-level expectations
 adjust faster when perceived quality declines, suggesting that negativity
 biases manifest at a macrolevel--a phenomenon that has not been previously
 observed.

Title: 
 Shifting Selves and Decision Making: The Effects of Self-Construal Priming on Consumer Risk-Taking.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 30-40
Issue: 1
Volume: 30
Year: 2003
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 This research illustrates how risk domain moderates the effects of
 priming the interdependent self versus the independent self on consumers'
 risk-taking. Experiment 1 showed that individuals whose interdependent
 selves were activated were more risk-seeking in their financial choices
 and less risk-seeking in their social choices than were those whose
 independent selves were activated. The size of the consumer's social
 network mediated these effects. Experiment 2 replicated these results
 using audiovisual movie clips as manipulations.

Title: 
 The Effect of Expected Variability of Product Quality and Attribute Uniqueness on Family Brand Evaluations.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 105-14
Issue: 1
Volume: 30
Year: 2003
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 This research investigates the processes by which consumers evaluate a
 family brand on the basis of information about its products. Findings from
 three experiments suggest that the expected variability of individual
 product quality within the brand and attribute uniqueness systematically
 influence information processing and family brand evaluations. On-line
 (vs. memory-based) processing of information to form family brand
 judgments is more likely when expected variability is low (vs. high) and
 when the attributes are shared (vs. unique) within the family brand. These
 different processes lead to differences in family brand evaluations due to
 primacy (on-line processing) and recency (memory-based processing)
 effects.

Title: 
 Medium Maximization.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 1-14
Issue: 1
Volume: 30
Year: 2003
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 A medium--for example, points or money--is a token people receive as the
 immediate reward of their effort. It has no value in and of itself, but it
 can be traded for a desired outcome. Experiments demonstrate that, when
 people are faced with options entailing different outcomes, the presence
 of a medium can alter what option they choose. This effect occurs because
 the medium presents an illusion of advantage to an otherwise not so
 advantageous option, an illusion of certainty to an otherwise uncertain
 option, or an illusion of linearity to an otherwise concave effort-outcome
 return relationship. This work has implications for how points influence
 consumer choice and how money influences human behavior.

Title: 
 Do Reverse-Worded Items Confound Measures in Cross-Cultural Consumer Research? The Case of the Material Values Scale.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 72-91
Issue: 1
Volume: 30
Year: 2003
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 Most measures of consumer behavior have been developed and employed in
 the United States. Thus, relatively little is known about the
 cross-cultural applicability of these measures. Using Richins and Dawson's
 (1992) Material Values Scale (MVS) as an exemplar, this article focuses on
 the problems researchers are likely to encounter when employing domestic
 mixed-worded scales (i.e., scales that contain both positive- and
 reverse-worded items) in cross-cultural applications. Through an initial
 study among over 800 adults from the United States, Singapore, Thailand,
 Japan, and Korea, we show that the cross-cultural measurement equivalence
 and construct validity of the MVS is challenged by its mixed-worded Likert
 format. Through a second study among approximately 400 Americans and East
 Asians, we find that other mixed-worded scales produce similar problems
 and that the cross-cultural applicability of such scales may be enhanced
 by replacing items posed as statements with items framed as questions.

Title: 
 The Effects of Time Constraints on Consumers' Judgments of Prices and Products.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 92-104
Issue: 1
Volume: 30
Year: 2003
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 This article examines how time constraints influence consumers' product
 evaluations over different levels of price information. To understand the
 effects of time constraints (time pressure), a conceptual framework
 incorporating both the motivational and the resource effects of time
 constraints on consumers' information processing is developed. Using price
 as the attribute information to be evaluated, specific hypotheses about
 the effects of time constraints on the relationship between price and
 consumers' perceptions of quality and monetary sacrifice are proposed. The
 results of a replicated experiment show that perceptions of quality and
 monetary sacrifice exhibit different response patterns depending on the
 time constraints, price levels, and subjects' motivations to process
 information. Additional analyses provide insights into how these two
 perceptions are integrated to form perceptions of value.

Title: 
 A Meta-analysis of the Spacing Effect in Verbal Learning: Implications for Research on Advertising Repetition and Consumer Memory.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 138-49
Issue: 1
Volume: 30
Year: 2003
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 The effects of repeated advertising exposures depend on the size of the
 interval, or space, between ad exposures. A meta-analysis of 97 verbal
 learning studies identified several stimulus characteristics and learning
 context factors that interact with stimulus spacing to facilitate memory
 for repeated information. The majority of the findings are consistent with
 the predictions of two enhanced processing explanations of learning--the
 retrieval hypothesis and the reconstruction hypothesis. These two
 hypotheses predict that an effective repetition strategy should encourage
 incidental processing during one presentation of the material and
 intentional processing during the other presentation of the material, but
 the hypotheses differ about the optimal order of these two types of
 processing. Thus, the most effective repetition strategy may be a
 combination of spaced exposures that alternate in terms of media that are
 involving (e.g., television commercials) and less involving (e.g.,
 billboards, product placements).

Title: 
 Do Not Go Cheaply into That Good Night: Death-Ritual Consumption in Asante, Ghana.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 41-55
Issue: 1
Volume: 30
Year: 2003
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 Theory on identity negotiations posits that a person's
 identity-construction project ceases upon death. We tested this
 proposition using death-ritual consumption experiences of consumers in
 Asante, Ghana, West Africa. We found that bereaved Asante consumers engage
 in conspicuous ritual consumption in pursuit of newer social identities
 for their deceased and themselves and that funerals involve a reciprocal
 and continuing relationship between the living and the dead. In addition,
 we found that terror-management theory is limited in its relevance for
 non-Western contexts. We also detected limits to the ability to transform
 global capital into local capital.

Title: 
 The Positivity Effect in Perceptions of Services: Seen One, Seen Them All?

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 125-37
Issue: 1
Volume: 30
Year: 2003
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 A series of studies show converging evidence of a positivity effect in
 consumers' inferences about service providers. When the consumer has
 little experience with a service, positive information about a single
 employee leads to inferences that the firm's other service providers are
 similarly positive to a greater extent than negative information leads to
 inferences that the firm's other service providers are similarly negative.
 Four studies were conducted that varied in the amount of information about
 the service provider, the firm, and the service. The positivity effect was
 supported despite differences across studies in methods as well as
 measures.

Title: 
 Option Attachment: When Deliberating Makes Choosing Feel Like Losing.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 15-29
Issue: 1
Volume: 30
Year: 2003
Month:  June 
Abstract:

 Common sense suggests that consumers make more satisfying decisions as
 they consider their options more closely. Yet we argue that such close
 consideration can have undesirable consequences because it may induce
 attachment to the options--a sense of prefactual ownership of the choice
 options. When consumers then select one option, they effectively lose this
 prefactual possession of the other, nonchosen options. This yields a
 feeling of discomfort ("choosing feels like losing") and an increase in
 the attractiveness of the forgone option, compared to its appeal before
 the choice. A series of nine experiments provides evidence of this
 phenomenon and support for our explanation.
