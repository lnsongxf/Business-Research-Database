Title: 
 Rethinking the Origins of Involvement and Brand Commitment: Insights from Postsocialist Central Europe.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 151-69
Issue: 2
Volume: 30
Year: 2003
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 Drawing on our work in two postsocialist countries, Hungary and Romania,
 we contribute to understanding product involvement and brand commitment.
 We demonstrate that prominent political-cultural discourses, cultural
 intermediaries, social influences, and life themes and projects
 collectively prompt product involvement. We introduce the concept of
 involvement with branded products and examine its origins within a
 sociohistorical context. We consider the origins of brand commitment and
 illustrate that consumers with little interest in either the product
 category or the idea of branded products may be committed to particular
 brands. Further, we contribute to understanding the relationships among
 product involvement, brand commitment, and brand experimentation.

Title: 
 Experiencing Products in the Virtual World: The Role of Goal and Imagery in Influencing Attitudes versus Purchase Intentions.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 184-98
Issue: 2
Volume: 30
Year: 2003
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 The research agenda for this article is to examine how individuals
 process information presented through virtual interaction with a product
 (object interactivity) and the impact that this has on their purchase
 intentions if they are looking for an aesthetic experience (browsers) or
 to find specific information (searchers). It is proposed that the
 congruency between users' goals and the delivery of product information
 will influence discursive processing and thus attitudes. However, what is
 most effective for creating favorable product attitudes is not necessarily
 most effective in raising purchase intentions. This is because imagery
 processing should play a more prominent role in affecting purchase
 intentions because, when estimating their own behavior, people likely run
 a mental simulation of themselves performing that behavior. It is
 predicted that object interactivity will evoke vivid mental images of
 product use regardless of the users' goals and thus increase intentions.
 The results of four experiments support these hypotheses.

Title: 
 When More Is Less and Less Is More: The Role of Ideal Point Availability and Assortment in Consumer Choice.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 170-83
Issue: 2
Volume: 30
Year: 2003
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 Contrary to the common wisdom that more choice is always better,
 selections made from large assortments can lead to weaker preferences.
 Building on the extant literature, this research identifies ideal point
 availability as a key factor moderating the impact of assortment on
 choice. It is proposed that, in the case of large assortments, ideal point
 availability can simplify choice, leading to a stronger preference for the
 selected alternative. In contrast, for choices made from smaller
 assortments, ideal point availability is proposed to have the opposite
 effect, leading to weaker preferences. Data obtained from four experiments
 lend support for the theory and the empirical predictions advanced in this
 article.

Title: 
 How to Construct a Test of Scientific Knowledge in Consumer Behavior.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 305-10
Issue: 2
Volume: 30
Year: 2003
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 Scientific knowledge in consumer behavior is defined as consisting of
 consumer behavior structural frameworks or models (microtheories) and
 well-supported empirical generalizations in various areas of consumer
 behavior (microfindings). This re-inquiry first examines a pioneering
 attempt to develop a test of scientific knowledge in consumer behavior,
 the Armstrong Test. The problems with that test are instructive in
 revealing threats to validity in test construction and analysis. Second,
 detailed steps are proposed for constructing a comprehensive, valid test
 of scientific knowledge in consumer behavior. Such a test should be useful
 for assessing the consumer behavior knowledge held by business educators,
 consultants, managers, market researchers, and business students.

Title: 
 When Competitive Interference Can Be Beneficial.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 283-91
Issue: 2
Volume: 30
Year: 2003
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 Prior research has viewed competitive interference as undesirable due to
 its negative effects on brand-attribute recall. We propose that
 competitive interference is not inherently bad but may be beneficial under
 certain conditions. In the context of an established brand promoting a new
 attribute, we show that the new attribute information is interfered with
 by the brand's old attributes, causing lower retrieval. However, in the
 presence of competitive advertising, old attribute information is
 suppressed, and new attribute information is successfully retrieved.

Title: 
 The Limits of Fungibility: Relational Schemata and the Value of Things.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 219-29
Issue: 2
Volume: 30
Year: 2003
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 Four experiments test predictions on endowment and mental accounting
 effects of a theoretical perspective that stresses the symbolic-relational
 significance for consumer transactions and that posits the placement of
 qualitative boundaries on fungibility. Although people accepted proposals
 to buy objects acquired in market-pricing relationships as routine, the
 same proposals in communal-sharing, authority-ranking, and
 equality-matching relationships triggered distress and erratically high
 dollar valuations. Symbolic ownership history also moderated valuations in
 a purely market setting, and the effects of symbolic-relational source of
 income extended even to spending decisions. Examination of the model's
 ordinal predictions revealed stronger effects for equality-matching than
 for authority-ranking relationships.

Title: 
 Speaking of Art as Embodied Imagination: A Multisensory Approach to Understanding Aesthetic Experience.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 259-82
Issue: 2
Volume: 30
Year: 2003
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 This article focuses on somatic experience--not just the process of
 thinking bodily but how the body informs the logic of thinking about art.
 We examine the links between embodiment, movement, and multisensory
 experience insofar as they help to elucidate the contours of art
 appreciation in a museum. We argue that embodiment can be identified at
 two levels: the phenomenological and the cognitive unconscious. At the
 first level, individuals are conscious of their feelings and actions
 while, at the second level, sensorimotor and other bodily oriented
 inference mechanisms inform their processes of abstract thought and
 reasoning. We analyze the consumption stories of 30 museum goers in order
 to understand how people move through museum spaces and feel, touch, hear,
 smell, and taste art. Further, through an analysis of metaphors and the
 use of conceptual blending, we tap into the participants' unconscious
 minds, gleaning important embodiment processes that shape their reasoning.

Title: 
 Ease-of-Retrieval as an Automatic Input in Judgments: A Mere-Accessibility Framework?

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 230-43
Issue: 2
Volume: 30
Year: 2003
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 The ease-of-retrieval hypothesis suggests that people use the ease with
 which information comes to mind as a heuristic in forming judgments
 (Schwarz et al. 1991). We examine the automaticity of the use of
 ease-of-retrieval as an input in judgments. We demonstrate that the
 ease-of-retrieval is used unintentionally, outside of awareness, and
 effortlessly, along with other consciously applied inputs, to make related
 judgments. Once experienced, its impact follows through to judgments, even
 when it is discredited as a source of information. Results across four
 studies suggest that an automatic source of information (viz., the
 ease-of-retrieval) may merely have to be accessible to be used in a
 judgment. We propose a mere-accessibility framework as a variant of
 Feldman and Lynch's (1988) accessibility-diagnosticity framework to
 explain these results.

Title: 
 Brand Familiarity and Advertising Repetition Effects.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 292-304
Issue: 2
Volume: 30
Year: 2003
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 A crucial communication task for unknown brands is to build the knowledge
 in consumers' minds necessary to become established. However,
 communication effectiveness may depend on prior familiarity of the
 advertised brand. The findings of two experiments using television ads and
 computer Internet ads revealed that brand familiarity influenced
 repetition effectiveness. In particular, repetition of advertising
 attributed to an unfamiliar brand showed decreased effectiveness; when the
 same advertising was attributed to a known, familiar brand, repetition
 wearout was postponed. Negative thoughts about tactic inappropriateness
 were seen to arise with repetition, particularly for an ad for an
 unfamiliar brand, driving, in part, the decreases in repetition
 effectiveness.

Title: 
 The Influence of Macro-level Motives on Consideration Set Composition in Novel Purchase Situations.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 244-58
Issue: 2
Volume: 30
Year: 2003
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 Consumers often have to create consideration sets when purchasing goals
 are not well defined. In these situations, the contents of a consideration
 set depend on a combination of two motives. First, consumers prefer to
 create a consideration set of easy-to-compare alternatives. It is easier
 to compare alternatives that have alignable attributes or alternatives
 that have overlapping features. Second, consumers prefer to create
 consideration sets that have a high likelihood of containing their optimal
 alternative. For example, when the set of available alternatives requires
 the consumer to make trade-offs between benefits (i.e., to be
 compensatory), the consumer often delays making a decision about which
 benefits are preferable, and the consideration set tends to contain a more
 diverse set of alternatives. We document several factors that influence
 the relative importance of one or the other motive in consideration set
 formation and discuss implications for brand managers.

Title: 
 A Critical Review of Construct Indicators and Measurement Model Misspecification in Marketing and Consumer Research.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 199-218
Issue: 2
Volume: 30
Year: 2003
Month:  September 
Abstract:

 A review of the literature suggests that few studies use formative
 indicator measurement models, even though they should. Therefore, the
 purpose of this research is to (a) discuss the distinction between
 formative and reflective measurement models, (b) develop a set of
 conceptual criteria that can be used to determine whether a construct
 should be modeled as having formative or reflective indicators, (c) review
 the marketing literature to obtain an estimate of the extent of
 measurement model misspecification in the field, (d) estimate the extent
 to which measurement model misspecification biases estimates of the
 relationships between constructs using a Monte Carlo simulation, and (e)
 provide recommendations for modeling formative indicator constructs.
