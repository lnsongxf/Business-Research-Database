Title: 
 The Moderating Effect of Product Knowledge on the Learning and Organization of Product Information.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 443-54
Issue: 3
Volume: 30
Year: 2003
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 This research examines how differences in the organization of brand
 information in memory between higher and lower knowledge consumers affects
 which brands are retrieved when consumers are provided with a usage
 situation. A spreading activation network model of memory is used to
 predict the results of an experiment where the usage situations were
 varied at encoding and repeated recall sessions. The results of the study
 indicate that lower knowledge consumers tend to learn only the brand
 information that is appropriate for a usage situation at encoding and do
 not organize brands by subcategory in memory. Consequently, lower
 knowledge consumers tend to retrieve the same set of brands regardless of
 the usage situation at retrieval. Alternatively, higher knowledge
 consumers learn brand information appropriate for different usage
 situations and organize this information by product subcategories. This
 allows higher knowledge consumers to retrieve the brands appropriate for
 the usage situation at retrieval, and to vary the set of retrieved brands
 as the usage situation changes.

Title: 
 The Fire of Desire: A Multisited Inquiry into Consumer Passion.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 326-51
Issue: 3
Volume: 30
Year: 2003
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 Desire is the motivating force behind much of contemporary consumption.
 Yet consumer research has devoted little specific attention to passionate
 and fanciful consumer desire. This article is grounded in consumers'
 everyday experiences of longing for and fantasizing about particular
 goods. Based on journals, interviews, projective data, and inquiries into
 daily discourses in three cultures (the United States, Turkey, and
 Denmark), we develop a phenomenological account of desire. We find that
 desire is regarded as a powerful cyclic emotion that is both discomforting
 and pleasurable. Desire is an embodied passion involving a quest for
 otherness, sociality, danger, and inaccessibility. Underlying and driving
 the pursuit of desire, we find self-seduction, longing, desire for desire,
 fear of being without desire, hopefulness, and tensions between seduction
 and morality. We discuss theoretical implications of these processes for
 consumer research.

Title: 
 Individual Differences in Haptic Information Processing: The "Need for Touch" Scale.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 430-42
Issue: 3
Volume: 30
Year: 2003
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 This research details the development of the "Need for Touch" (NFT) scale
 designed to measure individual differences in preference for haptic
 (touch) information. The 12-item NFT scale consists of autotelic and
 instrumental dimensions. Results are reported that support the scale's
 hypothesized internal structure as well as its reliability, convergent,
 discriminant, and nomological validity. Individual differences in chronic
 accessibility to haptic information across groups varying in NFT were also
 found in two experiments. Additionally, NFT moderated the relationship
 between direct experience and confidence in judgment.

Title: 
 How Much Do You Like It? Within-Alternative Conflict and Subjective Confidence in Consumer Judgments.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 464-72
Issue: 3
Volume: 30
Year: 2003
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 We seek to reinforce the importance of the notion of within-alternative
 conflict for consumer research. We replicate our own earlier findings that
 conflict associated with integrating an alternative's pros and cons
 influences responses to a judgment task. In the earlier work, we focused
 on test-retest reliability in judgment; here we extend the work by
 developing a measure of explicit preference uncertainty using subjective
 confidence intervals placed around evaluative judgments in consumer
 purchase contexts. We also extend the prior work by demonstrating an
 effect of within-alternative conflict on preferences expressed through
 evaluative ratings.

Title: 
 Bottoms Up! The Influence of Elongation on Pouring and Consumption Volume.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 455-63
Issue: 3
Volume: 30
Year: 2003
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 Although the effects of shapes on area perceptions have been widely
 investigated, we replicate, extend, and generalize one of the few studies
 to relate the effects of shapes to consumption volumes (Raghubir and
 Krishna 1999). While Raghubir and Krishna demonstrate the effect of the
 elongation of prepoured drinks on consumption volume, we have people pour
 their own drinks in a series of controlled field experiments. Two
 experiments in cafeterias show that both children and adults pour and
 consume more juice when given a short, wide glass compared to those given
 a tall, slender glass, but they perceive the opposite to be true. We
 conclude that the elongation of glasses negatively influences consumption
 volume in a single-serving context. A third potentially policy-relevant
 field experiment conducted with Philadelphia bartenders and liquor shows
 that the effect of elongation is moderated but not eliminated with pouring
 experience.

Title: 
 Time and Distance: Asymmetries in Consumer Trip Knowledge and Judgments.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 420-29
Issue: 3
Volume: 30
Year: 2003
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 We find that for shopping trip decisions, consumers' driving time
 knowledge (how long it takes to get there) is both more accessible from
 memory and more accurate than their corresponding driving distance
 knowledge. In memory-based judgments, chronically more accessible time
 knowledge had a dominant influence on distance judgments. Given a map,
 consumers still relied on their time knowledge to infer trip distance.
 Moreover, consumers' estimated time and distance judgments showed inflated
 correlations regardless of underlying actual correlations, which may
 approach zero in urban environments. Consequently, there appears to be an
 asymmetric reliance on time knowledge when making trip decisions.

Title: 
 Consumer and Market Drivers of the Trial Probability of New Consumer Packaged Goods.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 368-84
Issue: 3
Volume: 30
Year: 2003
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 We examine the effect of consumer and market factors on the trial
 probability of new consumer packaged goods. We distinguish between three
 sources of variation in consumer trial probability: (1) within new
 products, across consumers; (2) within new products, over time; and (3)
 across new products. Hypotheses are developed for the different variables
 concerning their likely effect on trial probability. The hypotheses are
 tested on weekly household-panel scanner data on the occurrence and timing
 of first purchases for 239 new consumer packaged goods over a 52-week
 period after introduction for a sample of over 3,500 consumers. We combine
 these household panel purchase data with consumer questionnaire data,
 retail scanner data, data on advertising expenditure, and expert ratings.
 We find support for most hypotheses. One of our main findings is that the
 effects of the consumers' personal makeup on the probability that they
 will try the new product are systematically moderated by elements of the
 marketing strategy associated with the new product and by category
 characteristics. The extensive data set provides a strong context for the
 generalizability of the findings.

Title: 
 How Good Gets Better and Bad Gets Worse: Understanding the Impact of Affect on Evaluations of Known Brands.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 352-67
Issue: 3
Volume: 30
Year: 2003
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 Participants experiencing positive or negative affect judged products
 described by brand and attribute information. Four studies using
 parameter-estimation and reaction-time procedures determined whether the
 impact of affect on brand name was the result of its influence on (a)
 participants' perception of its evaluative implications at the time of
 encoding or (b) the importance they attached to it while integrating it
 with other information to compute a judgment. Results showed that positive
 affect increased the extremity of the brand's evaluative implications
 (i.e., its scale value) rather than the importance (or weight) that
 participants attached to it. A fifth experiment demonstrated the
 implications of these findings for product choices made 24 hours after
 affect was induced.

Title: 
 The Intertemporal Dynamics of Consumer Lock-In.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 405-19
Issue: 3
Volume: 30
Year: 2003
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 This article examines how dynamic changes in information cost structure
 and time preferences affect consumers' search and switching behavior over
 time and lead to lock-in. The information cost structure is conceptualized
 as a trade-off of initial setup costs and ongoing usage costs. Lock-in is
 defined as consumers' decreased propensity to search and switch after an
 initial investment, which is determined both by a preference to minimize
 immediate costs and by an inability to anticipate the impact of future
 switching costs. The results of three experiments support the proposed
 mechanism. Experiment 1 shows that a small initial investment is
 sufficient to produce lock-in. Experiment 2 shows that the results of a
 prior investment on lock-in are not due to psychological commitment but to
 a shift in relative costs of incumbent and new options. Experiment 3 shows
 that respondents fail to anticipate how their prior investment will lock
 them in.

Title: 
 Different Scales for Different Frames: The Role of Subjective Scales and Experience in Explaining Attribute-Framing Effects.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 311-25
Issue: 3
Volume: 30
Year: 2003
Month:  December 
Abstract:

 Consumers respond more favorably to positively framed attribute
 information than to negatively framed attribute information, a finding
 that has been attributed to the affective associations evoked by each
 frame. We contend that framing effects also depend on the range and level
 of reference values used to evaluate attribute information. When the range
 of reference values is narrower for a positive frame than a negative
 frame, attribute values above expected performance levels favor the
 positively framed information and attribute values below expected
 performance levels favor the negatively framed information. When the range
 of reference values is wider for a positive frame than a negative frame,
 the opposite pattern emerges. Experience with a frame is one factor that
 reduces the range of reference values recruited to judge attribute
 information.
