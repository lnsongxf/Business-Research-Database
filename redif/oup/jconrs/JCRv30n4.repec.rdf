Title: 
 The Influence of Price Discount Framing on the Evaluation of a Product Bundle.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 534-46
Issue: 4
Volume: 30
Year: 2004
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 Bundle offers consisting of two or more products often include a price
 discount. The impact of the price discount on the perceived attractiveness
 of the bundle has been shown to depend on which product is discounted. It
 has been argued that discounts are more effective when they are assigned
 to the product that will receive the most weight in the overall evaluation
 of the bundle. We propose that the perceived value of the discount may
 also depend on a referent specific to each product. Six studies are used
 to provide evidence that (1) price discount framing effects can be
 explained by reference dependence and (2) that reference dependence and
 product importance independently contribute to price discount framing
 effects.

Title: 
 Asymmetric Association of Liking and Disliking Judgments: So What's Not to Like?

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 588-601
Issue: 4
Volume: 30
Year: 2004
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 We find that liking and disliking judgments appear asymmetrically linked
 in memory. In experiment 1 liking queries about objects were answered
 faster than disliking queries, irrespective of instructions to (1) simply
 examine the objects, (2) consider one's liking for the objects, (3)
 consider one's disliking for the objects, or (4) make an irrelevant
 judgment. Moreover, liking judgments appeared to be made spontaneously,
 while disliking judgments appeared to result from a more controlled
 process. Experiment 2 replicated these results with extremely dislikable
 and extremely likable stimuli. Experiment 3 revealed that disliking
 judgments prime liking judgments more than liking judgments prime
 disliking.

Title: 
 Reexamining Latitude of Price Acceptability and Price Thresholds: Predicting Basic Consumer Reaction to Price.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 612-21
Issue: 4
Volume: 30
Year: 2004
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 Behavioral pricing research has shown consumers to have lower and upper
 price thresholds, represented by an inverted U-shaped price acceptability
 function. We propose another basic reaction to price, namely, "lower price
 is better," represented by a decreasing acceptability function without a
 lower price threshold. A set of variables is hypothesized to predict
 consumer reaction to price. Price consciousness, price-quality relation,
 and product involvement are shown to influence the shape of the price
 acceptability function. A procedure and model to scale price acceptability
 and obtain acceptability functions are introduced and applied. The
 cumulative results suggest reliable acceptability scales along with
 evidence for convergent and construct validity.

Title: 
 Social Influences on Dyadic Giving over Time: A Taxonomy from the Giver's Perspective.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 547-58
Issue: 4
Volume: 30
Year: 2004
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 Most gift-giving research focuses on how aspects of the giver, recipient,
 or their relationship impact gift exchange. This longitudinal study of the
 Christmas giving of five informants demonstrates that givers strategically
 incorporate, or allow themselves to be influenced by, third parties when
 selecting gifts for recipients. Moreover, givers' motivations for
 incorporating these influences can change over time. Thus, seemingly
 personal gifts to recipients actually reflect givers' relationships with
 others in the social network. Our taxonomy of 10 social influences on
 givers' behavior, as well as givers' motivations and the relational
 processes associated with each, broadens the scope of current gift-giving
 research and begins exploring how social relationships impact gift
 exchange.

 The A[supercript 2]SC[superscript 2] Model: The Influence of Attitudes and Attitude Strength on Consideration and Choice.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 574-87
Issue: 4
Volume: 30
Year: 2004
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 This research investigates the influence of attitudes and attitude
 strength on consideration and choice. Three experiments provide support
 for the Attitude and Attitude Strength, Consideration and Choice (A2SC2)
 Model, which hypothesizes that (a) attitude strength moderates the
 influence of attitudes on consideration, such that attitudes guide
 consideration more for strongly held attitudes than for weakly held
 attitudes and (b) consideration of a brand mediates the influence of
 attitudes and attitude strength on choice.

Title: 
 The Influence of Generic Advertising on Brand Preferences.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 487-502
Issue: 4
Volume: 30
Year: 2004
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 More than a billion dollars is spent annually on generic advertisements
 that promote the consumption of commodity goods. Generic advertising is
 designed to increase primary demand, or the "size of the pie," without
 affecting selective demand, or the "share of the pie." We find evidence to
 the contrary generic advertising increases the consumer's sensitivity to
 changes in price and systematically alters brand preferences. These
 effects of generic advertising can be attributed to the tendency of
 generic ads to change the relative importance of the attributes used to
 evaluate the brands. The results have implications for the public policy
 issue of how to effectively implement generic advertising without
 differentially benefiting certain brands and the managerial issue of how
 to integrate generic and brand advertising in order to achieve product
 category and brand differentiation goals.

Title: 
 The Influence of Assortment Structure on Perceived Variety and Consumption Quantities.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 519-33
Issue: 4
Volume: 30
Year: 2004
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 Increasing the actual variety of an assortment has been shown previously
 to increase the quantity consumed. We show, however, that consumption
 quantities are also influenced by the perceived variety of an assortment.
 In combination, six lab and field studies show that the structure of an
 assortment (e.g., organization and symmetry or entropy) moderates the
 effect of actual variety on perceived variety. We further show that it is
 perceived variety that in turn influences consumption quantities through
 anticipated consumption utility. Making salient other consumption rules,
 such as size of the assortment, moderates this effect. These findings are
 of immediate relevance to interdisciplinary researchers and to consumers
 and health practitioners who wish to better control food consumption.

Title: 
 Effects of Seller-Supplied Prices on Buyers' Product Evaluations: Reference Prices in an Internet Auction Context.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 622-28
Issue: 4
Volume: 30
Year: 2004
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 A field experiment investigated the impact of two external reference
 points under the seller's control on the final price of an auction. When
 an item's seller specified a high external reference price (a reserve
 price), the final bid was greater than when the seller specified a low
 external reference price (a minimum bid). When the seller provided both
 high and low reference prices, the reserve influenced the final bid more.
 The low reference price led to a lower outcome compared to when the seller
 did not communicate any reference price. The number of bidders influenced
 outcomes in the absence of seller-supplied reference prices.

Title: 
 Self-Validation of Cognitive Responses to Advertisements.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 559-73
Issue: 4
Volume: 30
Year: 2004
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 Two studies tested the notion that the confidence consumers have in their
 cognitive responses to an ad can increase or decrease the favorability of
 product attitudes. Increasing confidence in positive thoughts enhanced
 advertisement effectiveness. Increasing confidence in negative thoughts
 reduced advertisement effectiveness. These self-validation effects
 occurred regardless of the type of product and regardless of whether
 thought confidence was measured or induced through an experimental
 manipulation. The present research also demonstrated that source
 credibility can influence consumer attitudes by affecting thought
 confidence. Finally, thought confidence was distinguished from other
 potentially related thought dimensions. Antecedents, moderators, and
 consequences of self-validation effects are described.

Title: 
 Decision Making in Information-Rich Environments: The Role of Information Structure.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 473-86
Issue: 4
Volume: 30
Year: 2004
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 Today's consumers are often overloaded with information. This article
 argues that traditional approaches to measuring the amount of information
 in a choice set fail to account for important structural dimensions of
 information and may therefore incorrectly predict information overload.
 Two experiments show that a structural approach to measuring information,
 such as information theory, is better able to predict information overload
 and that information structure also has important implications for
 information acquisition. A Monte-Carlo simulation, in which decision rules
 are applied to multiple information environments, shows that the amount of
 information processing mediates the relationship between information
 structure and information overload.

Title: 
 Memory Interference in Advertising: A Replication and Extension.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 602-11
Issue: 4
Volume: 30
Year: 2004
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 Memory for information in an ad can be detrimentally affected by exposure
 to another ad if the pictures in the two ads are similar. This has been
 termed contextual interference and has been shown to affect unfamiliar
 brands featured in an ad. Two studies were conducted to replicate the
 interference effect on unfamiliar brands and to examine whether familiar
 brands will be affected. The results replicate the interference effect on
 unfamiliar brands, demonstrating the robustness of the phenomenon. The
 results also show that claims about familiar brands are affected,
 qualifying previous research that shows that familiar brands are
 relatively impervious to competitive interference.

Title: 
 Ideals and Oughts and the Reliance on Affect versus Substance in Persuasion.

Journal: Journal of Consumer Research
Pages: 503-18
Issue: 4
Volume: 30
Year: 2004
Month:  March 
Abstract:

 Motivation research distinguishes two types of goals: (a) ideals, which
 relate to people's hopes, wishes, and aspirations, and (b) oughts, which
 relate to people's duties, obligations, and responsibilities. We propose
 that, in persuasion, the accessibility of ideals increases consumers'
 reliance on their subjective affective responses to the ad relative to the
 substance of the message, whereas the accessibility of oughts increases
 consumers' reliance on the substance of the message relative to their
 subjective affective responses. This phenomenon is accompanied by a
 relative change in the perceived diagnosticity of the two types of
 information under accessible ideals versus oughts a change that can be
 related to the distinct modes of self-regulation that ideals and oughts
 trigger. The phenomenon appears to be unrelated to the kind of change in
 depth-of-processing posited by the Elaboration Likelihood Model and the
 Heuristic-Systematic Model.
