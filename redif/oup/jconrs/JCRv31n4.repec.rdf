Title: Gender Differences in Responses to Emotional Advertising: A Social Desirability Perspective 
Abstract:
 Two studies examine gender differences in responses to advertising with
 emotional content that varies on agency-a fundamental component of the
 male, but not female, stereotype. As hypothesized, males reported a less
 pleasant viewing experience and a less favorable attitude toward the
 advertisement (A_ad) when a low-agency emotion (i.e.,
 stereotype-incongruent) ad was viewed with another male, while their
 responses were not affected by the presence of another person when they
 were exposed to a high-agency emotion (i.e., stereotype-congruent) ad.
 Males' and females' private responses were not significantly different,
 and females' responses were invariant across social contexts and type of
 ad. (c) 2005 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Searching Ordered Sets: Evaluations from Sequences under Search 
Abstract:
 Consumers often search for and choose from ordered sets, commonly from
 options listed from best to worst. Normatively, such declining orderings
 maximize expected value from search and should lead to more positive
 evaluations of the experience compared to searching improving orderings.
 We demonstrate, however, that amount of search moderates consumers'
 evaluations of declining versus improving orderings. Search from different
 orderings exposes consumers to sequences of options characterized by
 different key psychological moments (trend and end) as well as to
 different levels of average quality. Greater search can lead to more
 positive evaluations for improving versus declining orderings because
 consumers experience more positive moments on which to base their
 evaluation. Supporting the proposed model, we show that overall
 evaluations are influenced by differences in these key moments over and
 above quality changes of the set. (c) 2005 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Advertising to Bilingual Consumers: The Impact of Code-Switching on Persuasion 
Abstract:
 Building on a sociolinguistic framework, our research explores the impact
 of code-switching on the persuasiveness of marketing messages.
 Code-switching refers to mixing languages within a sentence, a common
 practice among bilingual consumers. We investigate how responses to
 different types of code-switched messages can provide insight into
 bilingual consumers' persuasion processes. A pilot study reveals a
 code-switching direction effect such that minority-language slogans
 switching to the majority language result in greater persuasion than
 majority-language slogans switching to the minority language. The effect
 is attributed to the salience of the code-switched word in the slogan.
 Study 1 explores this code-switching direction effect in more detail and
 shows that when associations toward the minority language are positive,
 the code-switching direction effect is reversed. (c) 2005 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: The Effects of Self-Construal and Commitment on Persuasion 
Abstract:
 Past research examining the effect of self-construal on persuasion has
 shown that advertising appeals that are consistent with consumers'
 chronically accessible (chronic) self-construal as well as appeals that
 are consistent with the temporarily accessible (latent) self-construal are
 both persuasive. In two studies, we identify brand commitment as a
 moderating variable that determines the effectiveness of appeals
 consistent with the consumers' chronic or latent self-construal. Under
 high commitment, appeals consistent with the chronic self-construal were
 more effective. In contrast, under low commitment, appeals consistent with
 the primed (independent or interdependent) self-construal were more
 effective. These findings were robust across independent and
 interdependent self-construal contexts. (c) 2005 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Motivated Reasoning in Outcome-Bias Effects 
Abstract:
 In this research, we examine the conditions under which outcomes bias
 judgments, and we provide insights on the processes underlying such bias
 effects. A series of three studies identified motivated reasoning as a
 major determinant of when outcomes would bias judgments. The processes
 underlying outcome bias effects also varied depending on the motivational
 goal. Accuracy goals minimized outcome bias based on objective
 elaboration. Defense goals enhanced outcome bias by promoting selective
 processing of the outcome when it was preference consistent. Finally,
 impression goals increased the perceived diagnosticity of outcomes and
 biased the subsequent systematic processing resulting in outcome-biased
 judgments. (c) 2005 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: How Warnings about False Claims Become Recommendations 
Abstract:
 Telling people that a consumer claim is false can make them misremember it
 as true. In two experiments, older adults were especially susceptible to
 this "illusion of truth" effect. Repeatedly identifying a claim as false
 helped older adults remember it as false in the short term but
 paradoxically made them more likely to remember it as true after a 3 day
 delay. This unintended effect of repetition comes from increased
 familiarity with the claim itself but decreased recollection of the
 claim's original context. Findings provide insight into susceptibility
 over time to memory distortions and exploitation via repetition of claims
 in media and advertising. (c) 2005 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Self-Schema Matching and Attitude Change: Situational and Dispositional Determinants of Message Elaboration 
Abstract:
 Research indicates that messages or products matching individuals'
 self-schemata are viewed more favorably, but little is known about how or
 when such effects occur. Experiment 1 indicates that messages matched to
 participants' level of extroversion lead to larger argument quality
 effects on attitudes than do mismatched messages. In experiment 2, these
 effects are replicated with the self-schema of need for cognition. Across
 studies, matching messages to recipients' self-schemata leads to increased
 or decreased persuasion, depending on the advertisement's argument
 quality. The interaction of self-schema matching with argument quality
 along with participants' pattern of cognitive responses suggests an
 elaboration-based account. (c) 2005 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Religiosity in the Abandoned Apple Newton Brand Community 
Abstract:
 This research explores the grassroots brand community centered on the
 Apple Newton, a product that was abandoned by the marketer. Supernatural,
 religious, and magical motifs are common in the narratives of the Newton
 community, including the miraculous performance and survival of the brand,
 as well as the return of the brand creator. These motifs invest the brand
 with powerful meanings and perpetuate the brand and the community, its
 values, and its beliefs. These motifs also reflect and facilitate the many
 transformative and emancipatory aspects of consuming this brand. Our
 findings reveal important properties of brand communities and, at a deeper
 level, speak to the communal nature of religion and the enduring human
 need for religious affiliation. (c) 2005 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Three Paths to Disposition: The Movement of Meaningful Possessions to Strangers 
Abstract:
 Our interpretive research treats meaningful possessions as vessels of
 public and private meanings. From this perspective, we unpack consumer
 disposition of meaningful possessions to strangers at garage sales and
 online auctions. We reveal how a range of valences of self-extension and
 self-references other than the ideal self shape a meaningful possession's
 journey from self to other. We identify a new iconic transfer divestment
 ritual, deepen and reinterpret other divestment rituals, and uncover how a
 shared sense of self allows possessions to migrate across seller-buyer
 boundaries. We present and discuss the implications of a model depicting
 three paths to disposition. (c) 2005 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Giving Firms an "E" for Effort: Consumer Responses to High-Effort Firms 
Abstract:
 This research shows that consumers reward firms for extra effort. More
 specifically, a series of three laboratory experiments shows that when
 firms exert extra effort in making or displaying their products, consumers
 reward them by increasing their willingness to pay, store choice, and
 overall evaluations, even if the actual quality of the products is not
 improved. This rewarding process is defined broadly as general
 reciprocity. Consistent with attribution theory, the rewarding of
 generally directed effort is mediated by feelings of gratitude. When
 consumers infer that effort is motivated by persuasion, however, they no
 longer feel gratitude and do not reward high-effort firms. (c) 2005 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Consumer Culture Theory (CCT): Twenty Years of Research 
Abstract:
 This article provides a synthesizing overview of the past 20 yr. of
 consumer research addressing the sociocultural, experiential, symbolic,
 and ideological aspects of consumption. Our aim is to provide a viable
 disciplinary brand for this research tradition that we call consumer
 culture theory (CCT). We propose that CCT has fulfilled recurrent calls
 for developing a distinctive body of theoretical knowledge about
 consumption and marketplace behaviors. In developing this argument, we
 redress three enduring misconceptions about the nature and analytic
 orientation of CCT. We then assess how CCT has contributed to consumer
 research by illuminating the cultural dimensions of the consumption cycle
 and by developing novel theorizations concerning four thematic domains of
 research interest. (c) 2005 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: National Aggregate Consumer Sentiment toward Marketing: A Thirty-Year Retrospective and Analysis 
Abstract:
 An annual survey of U.S. consumers' sentiment toward the institution of
 marketing has been conducted for the past two decades. This report
 describes the measuring instrument (which produces a summary index number
 for each year), the sample, and the longitudinal trend of survey
 results-the upshot of which is a pattern of slightly improving consumer
 sentiment toward marketing practice. When also incorporating the findings
 of similar research done prior to this study, a 30 yr. historical record
 emerges. Finally, examination of secondary data reveals that selected
 macroeconomic variables relate strongly to the consumer marketing
 sentiment index. (c) 2005 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Where There Is a Will, Is There a Way? Effects of Lay Theories of Self-Control on Setting and Keeping Resolutions 
Abstract:
 We demonstrate the effect of consumers' lay theories of self-control on
 goal-directed behavior as evidenced by New Year's and other resolutions.
 Across three studies, we find that individuals who believe that
 self-control is a malleable but inherently limited (vs. unlimited)
 resource tend to set fewer resolutions. Using respondents' own idiographic
 resolutions, this result is shown to hold in general as well as in
 consumption-specific domains regardless of whether lay theories are
 measured or manipulated. The effect is reversed if respondents contrast
 beliefs regarding their own levels of self-control with their lay
 theories. The final field experiment shows that "limited self-control
 theorists" are less likely to succeed at their resolutions if they have
 low (vs. high) self-efficacy. (c) 2005 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Promotion Reactance: The Role of Effort-Reward Congruity 
Abstract:
 Incentives may simultaneously entice consumers and arouse reactance. It is
 proposed that consumers reaffirm their autonomy by choosing rewards that
 are congruent with the promoted consumption effort (choosing reward x over
 reward y, given effort x). Such congruity allows consumers to construe
 their behavior as intrinsically motivated rather than externally induced,
 because the effort is its own reward. Supporting this conceptualization,
 the results indicate that preferences for effort-congruent rewards are
 attenuated among consumers with lower psychological reactance, after a
 reactance-reduction manipulation, when rewards are independent of personal
 effort, and when rewards are a by-product rather than the intention of
 effort. (c) 2005 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Social Class, Market Situation, and Consumers' Metaphors of (Dis)Empowerment 
Abstract:
 This article explores the role of (dis)empowerment as a central phenomenon
 of social class. Experience of power is found to shape self-concept, which
 affects everyday consumption practices. Self-perceptions were found to
 range from potent actor through to impotent reactor, and expectations for
 the future ranged from one of opportunity through to threat. These
 self-perceptions have been imbued as personal values that guide preferred
 ways of doing and being. They flow into the financial domain, with
 professionals setting themselves up for opportunity and growth, taking a
 very broad perspective on investing, and engaging in more elaborate budget
 planning. (c) 2005 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Negative Returns on Positive Emotions: The Influence of Pride and Self-Regulatory Goals on Repurchase Decisions 
Abstract:
 Contrary to the common assumption that positive emotions generally lead to
 favorable behavioral intentions, feelings of pride can decrease consumers'
 repurchase intentions. Results from three experimental studies demonstrate
 that the impact of pride on repurchase intentions is contingent on
 consumers' self-regulatory goals but that this is so only among consumers
 with high levels of pride. Specifically, consumers with high prevention
 pride are less likely to repurchase than those with high promotion pride,
 whereas no difference arises between consumers with low promotion pride
 and those with low prevention pride. These effects generalize across
 situational and chronic differences in self-regulatory goals and are
 accompanied by differences in consumers' information requirements. (c) 2005 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Feature Complementarity and Assortment in Choice 
Abstract:
 This research argues that the purchase probability from a given choice set
 is contingent on the complementarity of the features differentiating its
 options. In particular, two types of features are distinguished:
 complementary features, which are characterized by the additivity of their
 utilities, and noncomplementary features, which are characterized by
 nonadditive utilities. In this context, it is argued that assortments in
 which options are differentiated by noncomplementary features are likely
 to be associated with a greater probability of purchase than assortments
 with options differentiated by complementary features. This prediction is
 supported by data from three experimental studies. The article concludes
 with a discussion of the theoretical implications and offers directions
 for further research. (c) 2005 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..
