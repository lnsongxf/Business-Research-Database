Title: Let Us Eat and Drink, for Tomorrow We Shall Die: Effects of Mortality Salience and Self-Esteem on Self-Regulation in Consumer Choice 
Abstract:
 We examine how making mortality salient affects consumer choices. We
 develop a new theoretical framework predicting when consumer behaviors
 will be more (less) indulgent when mortality is salient, arguing that
 individuals focus more of their limited self-regulatory resources on
 domains that are important sources of self-esteem and less on domains that
 are not important sources. In two domains, food choice and charitable
 donations/socially conscious consumer behaviors, high mortality salience
 led to less indulgent choices among participants for whom that domain was
 an important source of esteem and more indulgent choices for participants
 for whom the domain was not an important esteem source. (c) 2005 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: The Low Literate Consumer 
Abstract:
 Almost half of all consumers read below a sixth-grade level, yet we know
 little about how these consumers get their needs met in the marketplace.
 The goal of this qualitative study was to examine the intersection of
 literacy skills and consumption activities and identify the coping
 strategies that low literate consumers employ. Those informants who could
 challenge the stigma of low literacy and employ a range of coping skills
 were better able to get their needs met. Thus, consumer literacy is
 conceptualized as a social practice that includes reading and writing
 skills but also involves the ability to manage one's identity and leverage
 personal, situational, and social coping skills. (c) 2005 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Beyond the Extended Self: Loved Objects and Consumers' Identity Narratives 
Abstract:
 This article investigates the possessions and activities that consumers
 love and their role in the construction of a coherent identity narrative.
 In the face of social forces pushing toward identity fragmentation,
 interviews reveal three different strategies, labeled "demarcating,"
 "compromising," and "synthesizing" solutions, for creating a coherent
 self-narrative. Findings are compared to Belk's "Possessions and the
 Extended Self." Most claims from Belk are supported, but the notion of a
 core versus extended self is critiqued as a potentially confusing
 metaphor. The roles of loved objects and activities in structuring social
 relationships and in consumer well-being are also explored. (c) 2005 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Penny Wise and Pound Foolish: The Left-Digit Effect in Price Cognition 
Abstract:
 Through five experiments, we provide a cognitive account of when and why
 nine-ending prices are perceived to be smaller than a price one cent
 higher. First, this occurs only when the leftmost digits of the prices
 differ (e.g., $2.99 vs. $3.00). Second, the left-digit effect also depends
 on the numerical and psychological distances between the target price and
 a competing product's price. The closer the two prices being compared, the
 more likely is the left-digit effect. Third, the left-digit effect is not
 restricted to the domain of prices; it also manifests with other
 multidigit numbers. (c) 2005 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Information Accessibility as a Moderator of Judgments: The Role of Content versus Retrieval Ease 
Abstract:
 We hypothesize that the accessibility of task-relevant knowledge
 determines whether judgments reflect the substance of the information that
 is brought to mind or the ease of generating and retrieving such
 information. Our findings indicate that when relevant knowledge is highly
 accessible or not at all accessible, judgments are based on the content of
 the information considered. Between these extremes in knowledge
 accessibility, judgments are based on the perceived ease with which
 information can be retrieved. This perceived ease is a function of both
 the number of reasons requested and the wording of the retrieval request. (c) 2005 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Postassimilationist Ethnic Consumer Research: Qualifications and Extensions 
Abstract:
 Data collected among Greenlandic immigrants in Denmark fuel a critical
 examination of the postassimilationist model of ethnic consumer behavior
 in a non-North American context. We find that Greenlandic consumer
 acculturation is broadly supportive of the postassimilationist model.
 However, acculturative processes in the Danish context lead immigrants to
 adopt identity positions not entirely consistent with those reported in
 previous postassimilationist consumer research. Further, we identify
 transnational consumer culture as an acculturative agent not identified in
 previous research on consumer ethnicity and question the performative
 model of culture swapping. Finally, the analysis supports ideas about
 postassimilationist ethnicity as culture consumed. (c) 2005 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Shades of Meaning: The Effect of Color and Flavor Names on Consumer Choice 
Abstract:
 Building on Grice's (1975) theory of "conversational implicature," we
 propose that consumers will react favorably to unusual color or flavor
 names (e.g., blue haze or Alpine snow) because they expect marketing
 messages to convey useful information. If the message is not informative
 or does not conform to expectations, consumers search for the reason for
 the deviation. This search results in additional (positive) attributions
 about the product, and thus, a more favorable response. The results of a
 series of experiments provide empirical support for our proposal and rule
 out some alternative explanations for the success of ambiguous naming
 strategies. (c) 2005 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Designing the Solution: The Impact of Constraints on Consumers' Creativity 
Abstract:
 Across a variety of domains, consumers often choose to act as the designer
 of their own solution, sourcing the necessary components and assembling
 the parts to meet their specific goals. While thinking creatively is an
 integral part in the daily life of every consumer, surprisingly little
 research in marketing has examined the factors influencing such processes.
 In our research, we examine how input and time constraints influence the
 way in which consumers process information during a creative task and how
 those processes, in turn, influence the creativity of the solution.
 Paradoxically, we find that input constraints encourage more creative
 processing, provided the individual is not under significant time
 constraints. (c) 2005 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: The Effect of Multiple Extrinsic Cues on Quality Perceptions: A Matter of Consistency 
Abstract:
 Building on past research, this article illustrates when a price-quality
 relationship holds in the presence of multiple extrinsic cues. When
 intrinsic information is scarce, the relationship is more pronounced when
 a positive price cue is paired with a positive second cue (e.g., strong
 warranty, positive country of origin, or strong brand). When the two cues
 are inconsistent, consumers find the negative cue more salient and
 overweight it in their evaluations. This interaction is moderated by the
 presence of abundant levels of intrinsic attribute information. Our
 predictions are replicated across five studies, and the underlying process
 is supported. (c) 2005 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: The Development of Self-Brand Connections in Children and Adolescents 
Abstract:
 Individuals use brands to create and communicate their self-concepts,
 thereby creating self-brand connections. Although this phenomenon is well
 documented among adult consumers, we know very little about the role of
 brands in defining, expressing, and communicating self-concepts in
 children and adolescents. In this article, we examine the age at which
 children begin to incorporate brands into their self-concepts and how
 these self-brand connections change in qualitative ways as children move
 into adolescence. In three studies with children 8-18 yr. of age, we find
 that self-brand connections develop in number and sophistication between
 middle childhood and early adolescence. (c) 2005 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Using Stylistic Properties of Ad Pictures to Communicate with Consumers 
Abstract:
 Many researchers claim that pictures can impart descriptive concepts
 through their choice of stylistic properties, such as the orientation of
 depicted objects or the camera angle used. Yet little empirical research
 has explored if this is so, how readily or when such concepts are
 discerned, and/or whether these concepts can affect viewers' perceptions.
 In two studies we show that stylistic properties of ad pictures can
 communicate descriptive concepts that affect perceptions. However, this
 appears to occur only when viewers engage in ample processing of the ad
 and the accessibility of an appropriate descriptive concept is heightened,
 independent of the stylistic property. (c) 2005 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Invisible Brands: An Ethnography of Households and the Brands in Their Kitchen Pantries 
Abstract:
 This article investigates "invisible brands." An invisible brand is a
 brand that is considered mundane and blends into the household
 environment. Much as someone might purchase a brand for other reasons
 (e.g., family lineage, low price), people strive for brands that can be
 made invisible in their lives. A 16 mo. ethnography of households and
 their kitchen pantries yields insights into the process that shapes the
 invisible brand. The locus of meaning is in the process of brand storage,
 not in the consumer's identity or in a well-defined consumer-brand
 relationship. The data also suggest that the households use storage
 strategies that parallel camouflaging strategies in nature. (c) 2005 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Understanding Consumer Evaluations of Mixed Affective Experiences 
Abstract:
 This research examines the influence of final trend, temporal proximity,
 and source similarity on consumers' overall retrospective evaluations of
 sequential mixed affective experiences comprised of positive, negative,
 and neutral affective responses. Findings from the first experiment
 indicate that when consumers make comparisons based on similarities among
 affective responses, evaluations tend to be influenced by final trend. In
 contrast, when consumers make comparisons based on differences, temporal
 proximity influences evaluations. A second experiment shows that novelty
 of the experience attenuates these effects. This research is discussed in
 view of research on sequential single as well as simultaneous mixed
 affective experiences. (c) 2005 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Incidental and Task-Related Affect: A Re-Inquiry and Extension of the Influence of Affect on Choice 
Abstract:
 We examine the interplay between incidental affect and task-related affect
 in the context of consumer choice. Specifically, we examine the
 differential impact of two discrete negative affective states-anger and
 sadness-vis--vis a neutral affective state. We replicate Luce's (<xref
 ref-type="bibr" rid="rf13">1998</xref>) finding that people are more
 likely to rely on a status quo option when they have to make emotionally
 difficult trade-offs. However, incidental affect moderates this effect
 such that angry individuals are more influenced by task-related affect,
 while sadness is less influenced by it. These findings support our thesis
 that consumers experiencing different negative emotions display
 differential reliance on avoidance choice strategies such as choosing the
 status quo. (c) 2005 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Credit Cards as Lifestyle Facilitators 
Abstract:
 Credit cards are an increasingly essential technology, but they carry with
 them the paradoxical capacity to propel consumers along lifestyle
 trajectories of marketplace freedom or constraint. We analyze accounts
 provided by consumers, credit counselors, and participants in a credit
 counseling seminar in order to develop a differentiated theory of
 lifestyle facilitation through credit card practice. The skills and tastes
 expressed by credit card practice help distinguish between the lifestyles
 of those with higher cultural capital relative to those with lower
 cultural capital. Differences in lifestyle regulation practice are posited
 to originate in cultural discourses related to entitlement and frugality. (c) 2005 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Coping: A Multidimensional, Hierarchical Framework of Responses to Stressful Consumption Episodes 
Abstract:
 This research explores a phenomenon that pervades many realms of consumer
 behavior-the various ways that consumers cope with stress and negative
 emotions. In study 1, I generate and test a multidimensional scale to
 measure the coping construct, revealing a more diverse set of strategies
 than accounted for in the consumer literature on coping. I test competing
 theories about the hierarchical structure of the coping construct. Study 2
 validates these findings and begins to establish theoretical links between
 the coping dimensions and their antecedent relationships with discrete
 emotions. In contrast to extant research linking emotions and coping,
 which has only investigated main effect hypotheses, I conceptualize and
 find empirical evidence for a model in which emotions interact with
 appraisals jointly to enact coping strategies. This research contributes
 to the emerging consumer coping literature by enriching existing
 theoretical conceptualizations of consumer coping processes and by
 validating a scale that should prove useful in consumer research. (c) 2005 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..
