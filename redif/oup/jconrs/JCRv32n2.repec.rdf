Title: The Influence of a Mere Social Presence in a Retail Context 
Abstract:
 While the majority of consumer research that has studied social influences
 has focused on the impact of an interactive social presence, in this
 research we demonstrate that a noninteractive social presence (i.e., a
 mere presence) is also influential. We conduct two field experiments in a
 retail setting to show when and how a noninteractive social presence that
 differs in size and proximity impacts consumers' emotions and
 self-presentation behaviors. In doing so, we refine Social Impact Theory
 by identifying boundary conditions under which the theory does not hold. (c) 2005 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Losers, Winners, and Biased Trades 
Abstract:
 When faced with sequential information, consumers tend to fall prey to one
 of two well-known heuristics: the hot (or cold) hand and the gambler's
 fallacy. The authors relate these two traditionally separate heuristics to
 differences in accepting (buy) versus rejecting (sell) decisions. They
 identify trend length as a contextual moderating variable and show an
 asymmetry between buying and selling frames. When applied to a stock
 market context, a consistent finding is that consumers prefer to buy past
 winners and sell past losers even when neither should be preferred. This
 behavior violates the normative rule of buy low and sell high. (c) 2005 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Context Effects without a Context: Attribute Balance as a Reason for Choice 
Abstract:
 This article extends the notion of context effects beyond the relational
 properties of choice alternatives to include attribute balance as a reason
 for choice. The data reported in two experiments demonstrate that
 attribute balance has a significant impact on extremeness-aversion and
 trade-off-contrast effects reported in prior research. The proposition
 that consumers use attribute balance as a reason for choice is further
 supported by the finding that attribute balance moderates the impact of
 justification on the strength of extremeness aversion and trade-off
 contrast. These findings offer a new perspective on the decision processes
 underlying context effects in choice. (c) 2005 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Achieving Your Goals or Protecting Their Future? The Effects of Self-View on Goals and Choices 
Abstract:
 We show that encouraging consumers to think about themselves as
 independent or interdependent, making either promotion or prevention goals
 salient, has a systematic effect on inferred risk preferences.
 Interdependent self-view consumers, who are more interested in avoiding
 losses than in achieving gains, choose less risky alternatives than
 independent self-view consumers. However, because of asymmetric
 preferences for status quo alternatives, information about previous
 choices moderates the goal-mediated effect of self-view on choice. (c) 2005 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Inferences about the Brand from Counterstereotypical Service Providers 
Abstract:
 We compared effects of information about a stereotypical service provider
 with that about a counterstereotypical service provider on inferences
 about the similarity of employees within the firm and the firm's
 similarity to other firms (across-brand differentiation). Our three
 experiments varied the provider's gender so that it was either
 stereotypical or counterstereotypical for an occupation. Consistent with
 previous research, information about a counterstereotypical employee whose
 behavior violated expectancies decreased the perception of similarity
 between the individual and other employees compared with when the employee
 was stereotypical. However, that same information increased the perception
 that the firm was superior to other firms. (c) 2005 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Posting versus Lurking: Communicating in a Multiple Audience Context 
Abstract:
 Two experiments examined public and private responding in a
 multiple-audience context-a context in which members have varying
 opinions. I propose and find that posters (those communicating their
 experience to others) are influenced only by another's negative opinion
 because it triggers such social concerns as appearing indiscriminate.
 Consequently, they adjust their public attitudes downward.
 Self-presentational concerns appear to cause this negativity bias: lurkers
 (those not posting their opinion) were less affected by another's negative
 opinion. Furthermore, posters presented more than one side when publicly
 explaining their attitudes. These effects persisted despite posters'
 favorable product experiences and commitment to these attitudes. (c) 2005 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Effects of Participative Pricing on Consumers' Cognitions and Actions: A Goal Theoretic Perspective 
Abstract:
 Using a goal theoretic approach we examine how goal-related mind-sets
 influence consumers' reactions to participative pricing mechanisms (where
 consumers participate in price determination; e.g., auctions) relative to
 economically equivalent, fixed price offers. We show that the congruence
 between individuals' notions of high-perceived control over shopping
 situations and participative price environments produces an
 implementation-oriented mind-set that influences cognitions and
 intentions. In the absence of such congruence, we can independently create
 implemental mind-sets that replace the natural deliberative thinking of
 consumers contemplating a purchase. Demonstrating the subtle yet powerful
 role mind-sets play in dictating thought and action is a unique
 contribution of this research. (c) 2005 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Resource Allocation in Households with Women as Chief Wage Earners 
Abstract:
 Resource theory and the human capital argument remain the dominant
 theoretical perspectives for understanding household choice. Yet
 households in which wives earn more than their husbands do not reflect
 either one, possibly due to the assumption in these perspectives that all
 resources are pooled. Two studies investigated household resource
 allocation. The first found that when the woman was the chief wage earner,
 joint pools of money were used to cover routine expenses but separate
 pools were also used for several reasons. The second study investigated
 the apparent differences in wife-as-chief-earner households and
 husband-as-chief-earner households and found support for the results of
 the first. (c) 2005 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: The Center Cannot Hold: Consuming the Utopian Marketplace 
Abstract:
 This article draws upon the utopian studies literature to integrate two
 strands of contemporary consumer research, the study of place and space
 and the analysis of consumer/marketer relations. Based on a longitudinal
 study of a festival shopping mall, we provide an emergent theory of how
 the utopian marketplace is experienced, a theory that hinges around three
 interlinked conceptual categories: sensing displace, creating playspace,
 and performing artscape, which are subverted by the center management's
 maladroit refreshment of the retail offer. The relevance of this
 theorization for place-based scholarship, together with its implications
 for researchers of consumer/marketer relations, is also discussed. (c) 2005 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Examining the Spacing Effect in Advertising: Encoding Variability, Retrieval Processes, and Their Interaction 
Abstract:
 Recall of print material benefits from spacing repetitions of that
 material, an effect often attributed to varied encodings induced by
 changes in contextual cues. We examined an alternative explanation:
 retrieving earlier presentations during later presentations strengthens
 memory traces, the more so the greater the difficulty of such retrieval.
 In four experiments we found that (a) study-phase retrieval contributes to
 the benefits of spacing and (b) inducing variation via changes in ad
 formatting and content can be counterproductive at long spacing intervals,
 apparently because such changes decrease the likelihood that earlier
 presentations will be retrieved during later presentations. (c) 2005 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Revisiting the Effect of Positive Mood on Variety Seeking 
Abstract:
 Prior research indicates that variety seeking (VS) behaviors increase in
 the presence of mild positive mood. However, extant studies are not
 informative about VS outcomes with more extreme positive moods. It is
 theorized that extreme positive moods may often be associated with
 decreases in VS, because the rather moderate stimulation to be gained from
 VS is not sufficient to meet the demands of an extreme positive mood. Two
 experiments and two pilot tests are consistent with an updated theoretical
 account of positive mood and VS that is proposed. (c) 2005 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Consumer Risk Perceptions in a Community of Reflexive Doubt 
Abstract:
 Prior studies have shown that consumers often misjudge their health risks
 owing to a number of well-documented cognitive biases. These studies
 assume that consumers have (or should have) trust in the expert systems
 that culturally define safe and risky behaviors. Consequently, this
 research stream does not address choice situations where consumers have
 reflexive doubts toward prevailing expert risk assessments and gravitate
 toward alternative models of risk reduction. This study explores how
 dissident health risk perceptions are culturally constructed in the
 natural childbirth community, internalized by consumers as a compelling
 structure of feeling, and enacted through choices that intentionally run
 counter to orthodox medical risk-management norms. (c) 2005 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Paradox and the Consumption of Authenticity through Reality Television 
Abstract:
 We position reality television within the broader category of consumer
 practices of authenticity seeking in a postmodern cultural context. The
 study draws on relevant perspectives from consumer research, literary
 criticism, sociology, and anthropology to argue that viewers of reality
 television encounter three elements of paradox in the process of
 constructing authenticity. The negotiation of each paradox exceeds the
 process of coping with or resolving their inherent contradictions to
 encompass the creation of new values. We argue that consumers blend
 fantastic elements of programming with indexical elements connected to
 their lived experiences to create a form of self-referential
 hyperauthenticity. (c) 2005 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Extended Self and Possessions in the Workplace 
Abstract:
 This study of the meanings of possessions displayed in the offices of
 employees in a high technology firm suggests extensions to the concept of
 extended self. Work self and home self contend for dominance in these
 displays. Employees must decide which aspects of the self belong to the
 domain of work and which belong elsewhere. In these ongoing negotiations
 self may be extended, but it may also be retracted and hidden.
 Furthermore, although possessions can serve to stabilize the self, they
 also facilitate shifting among various self-aspects in response to
 workplace events. We explicate these processes and discuss implications
 for extended self theory. (c) 2005 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Linguistic Gender Marking and Categorization 
Abstract:
 Gender markers provide syntactic structure and a categorization schema to
 language. Brand name gender is a function of both formal, structural
 aspects of the brand name and semantic properties of the brand's product
 class. In the formal gender system of Spanish, consistent formal gender
 marking enhances brand recall, whereas semantic product associations drive
 brand evaluation. In the semantic gender system of English, formal cues
 determine initial brand name gender, but congruent semantic associations
 between brand name and product category drive improved brand evaluations
 and brand recall. Three studies across two languages demonstrate that
 gender's role as a categorization tool underlies these effects. (c) 2005 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Shopping for Colleges When What We Know Ain't 
Abstract:
 The cost of attending a 4-yr. private university can easily top $150,000,
 making education one of the most expensive purchases we make.
 Unfortunately, the sorts of informed opinions and objective comparisons
 that are widely available for other large consumer purchases, like
 automobiles, are lacking in education. Instead we must make due with ad
 hoc indexes like that published annually by U.S. News and World Report. A
 recent alternative to this index using preference rankings was proposed.
 In this essay I discuss the challenges facing this index, and other survey
 instruments, caused by nonignorable missing data. My conclusion is not
 optimistic. (c) 2005 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..
