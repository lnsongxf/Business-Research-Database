Title: Goals as Excuses or Guides: The Liberating Effect of Perceived Goal Progress on Choice 
Abstract:
 Consumer choices are often driven by multiple goals (e.g., career and
 family), each of which if viewed in isolation may appear to suggest
 conflicting choices. This article examines the effect of initial goal
 pursuit on consumers' interest in pursuing unrelated or even conflicting
 goals. Four studies were conducted to test whether perceived goal progress
 hinders the pursuit of the focal goal. These studies demonstrate that in
 the course of self-regulation progress along one goal liberates people to
 pursue inconsistent goals. Furthermore, merely planning to make goal
 progress in the future may facilitate incongruent choice of immediate
 action. (c) 2005 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Fluency of Consumption Imagery and the Backfire Effects of Imagery Appeals 
Abstract:
 Existing research and widespread commercial usage suggest that appeals
 urging consumers to imagine the product experience have powerful effects
 on product preferences. Three studies examined the mediating role of
 imagery accessibility and demonstrated that the difficulty of imagery
 generation can reverse the generally observed positive effects of imagery
 appeals. When participants were low in imagery abilities or when the
 product was not presented in a vivid way, imagery appeals were not only
 ineffective but even had a negative effect on product preferences.
 Providing evidence for its subjective nature, this imagery fluency effect
 was more likely for individuals attuned to their internal experiences. (c) 2005 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Decision Difficulty: Effects of Procedural and Outcome Accountability 
Abstract:
 We propose that accountability type moderates the perceived difficulty of
 choosing from worse than reference or better than reference options. Study
 1 demonstrates that the difference in perceived difficulty for deciding
 between such options is attenuated under procedural accountability but
 enhanced under outcome accountability. Study 2 shows that the differential
 effect accountability type is stronger under low attractiveness than under
 high attractiveness. Collectively, they show the importance of
 distinguishing procedural and outcome accountability in consumer
 decisions. (c) 2005 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Television's Cultivation of Material Values 
Abstract:
 Prior research has shown that television viewing cultivates perceptions of
 the prevalence of societal affluence through a memory-based process that
 relies on the application of judgmental heuristics. This article extends
 this research by examining (1) whether cultivation effects generalize to
 consumer values such as materialism and (2) whether these values judgments
 are also processed in a heuristic manner. Data from both a survey and an
 experiment suggest that television cultivates materialism through an
 online process in which television's influence is enhanced by active
 (rather than heuristic) processing during viewing. This finding stands in
 contrast to the cultivation of prevalence judgments, which are attenuated
 by active processing during judgment elicitation. (c) 2005 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Name Letter Branding: Valence Transfers When Product Specific Needs Are Active 
Abstract:
 Respondents in five experiments were more likely to choose a brand when
 the brand name started with letters from their names than when it did not,
 a choice phenomenon we call "name letter branding." We propose that during
 a first stage an active need to self-enhance increases the positive
 valence of name letters themselves and that during stage 2 positive name
 letter valence transfers to product-specific attributes (e.g., taste of a
 beverage). Accordingly, when respondents form a brand preference (e.g., of
 beverages), activating a product-specific need (e.g., need to drink)
 boosts the influence of this (transferred) valence. (c) 2005 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: The Endowment Effect: Rose-Tinted and Dark-Tinted Glasses 
Abstract:
 The endowment effect, predicted by prospect theory, is a robust finding in
 behavioral decision theory. Extending recent examinations of the
 underlying processes, we present evidence for differential perceptions of
 the traded item, with sellers focusing more on positive features and less
 on negative features, relative to buyers. In experiment 1, sellers and
 buyers access information of differing valence in a free recall task.
 Experiment 2 utilizes error rates and response latencies to demonstrate
 systematic, and differing, patterns of errors and biases in reactions to
 valenced stimuli. Experiment 3 utilizes contrast effects to manipulate
 these foci, thereby moderating the endowment effect. (c) 2005 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Implicit Assimilation and Explicit Contrast: A Set/Reset Model of Response to Celebrity Voice-Overs 
Abstract:
 An experiment reveals that the relationship between celebrity attitude and
 attitude toward brands paired with the celebrity's voice is moderated by
 identification of the celebrity but only when attitude is measured
 explicitly. Using explicit measures, celebrity attitude was positively
 (negatively) related to brand attitude change when the evaluator could not
 (could) identify the celebrity. This finding is attributed to "resetting,"
 a correction of the perceived influence from irrelevant cues. On implicit
 measures, a positive relationship between celebrity and brand attitude was
 observed regardless of celebrity identification. The disassociation
 between the explicit and implicit results suggests that resetting requires
 explicit evaluation. (c) 2005 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Goal-Relevant Emotional Information: When Extraneous Affect Leads to Persuasion and When It Does Not 
Abstract:
 We investigate how extraneous or incidental emotions influence product
 evaluations as a function of consumers' salient goals. By manipulating
 specific emotions that correspond closely to two basic categories of human
 goals (achievement vs. protection), we extend affect-as-information theory
 and show that product judgments are a function not simply of the valence
 of extraneous emotions but also of the correspondence between specific
 emotions and salient goals. When consumers' achievement goals are salient,
 achievement-related emotions (cheerfulness and dejection) are more
 informative for evaluations than protection-related emotions (quiescence
 and agitation); the opposite is true when consumers' protection goals are
 salient. (c) 2005 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Attribute Evaluability and the Range Effect 
Abstract:
 We examine situations in which (a) consumers choose between options that
 vary on two attributes that are different in their evaluability and (b)
 the ranges for both attributes change simultaneously. As the ranges widen,
 the range effect makes perceptual differences on both attributes look
 smaller. However, our framework suggests that the attributes' evaluability
 influences the strength of the range effect and that perceptual judgments
 of the two attributes are affected to different degrees. This changes the
 relative preference between the options. We found that when the range is
 wide, preference shifts toward the option having a greater amount of the
 high evaluability attribute. (c) 2005 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Goal Fulfillment and Goal Targets in Sequential Choice 
Abstract:
 This article examines the effect of goal fulfillment on choices made in
 the context of an ongoing sequence of experiences. We find that a good
 first experience produces an upward shift in the target level of goal
 achievement. When a higher level of goal attainment is offered by a risky
 option, that option will be preferred more following a good experience
 than following a bad experience. Several studies show that this pattern
 applies only to risk related to the content of the active goal and only to
 risk that offers the possibility of a higher level of goal achievement
 than a riskless option. (c) 2005 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Self-Construal, Reference Groups, and Brand Meaning 
Abstract:
 We propose that consumers purchase brands in part to construct their
 self-concepts and, in so doing, form self-brand connections. We focus on
 reference groups as a source of brand meaning. Results from two studies
 show that brands with images consistent with an ingroup enhance self-brand
 connections for all consumers, whereas brands with images that are
 consistent with an outgroup have a stronger negative effect on independent
 versus interdependent consumers. We propose that this differential effect
 is due to stronger self-differentiation goals for consumers with more
 independent self-concepts. We also find greater effects for more symbolic
 than for less symbolic brands. (c) 2005 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Role of Relationship Norms in Processing Brand Information 
Abstract:
 In the present research, we propose relationship norms as a moderator of
 the specific information-processing strategy adopted by consumers when
 evaluating a brand. Two types of relationships are examined: communal
 relationships, in which concern for a partner's need is paramount, and
 exchange relationships, in which a matched benefit is expected back from
 the partner. Across three studies, we test the hypothesis that norms of a
 communal relationship lead to brand attributes being evaluated at a higher
 level of abstraction relative to those of an exchange relationship.
 Dependent variables ranging from product evaluations, memory measures, and
 feature listings provide converging evidence to support the overall
 hypothesis. (c) 2005 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: A Reexamination of Frequency-Depth Effects in Consumer Price Judgments 
Abstract:
 Previous research has shown that when there are multiple possible prices
 for two brands, the brand that is discounted frequently but at shallow
 levels is perceived to have a lower average price than the brand that is
 discounted infrequently but at deeper levels (the "frequency effect").
 However, when there are only two possible prices for each brand, the brand
 discounted infrequently but at deeper levels is perceived to have a lower
 average price (the "depth effect"). Over a series of experiments, we
 demonstrate that these frequency and depth effects do not generalize to
 other temporal price distributions. (c) 2005 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Age-Related Differences in Responses to Emotional Advertisements 
Abstract:
 This research investigated motivational influences associated with age on
 responses to emotional advertisements. Experiment 1 showed increased
 liking and recall of emotional ads among older consumers and that time
 horizon perspective moderates these age-related differences. Experiment 2
 revealed influences of age and time horizon perspective on responses to
 different types of emotional ads. Ads focusing on avoiding negative
 emotions were liked and recalled more among older consumers and among
 young consumers made to have a limited time horizon perspective. This
 research illustrates the importance of considering age-related differences
 in information processing due to motivational as well as to cognitive
 changes. (c) 2005 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Behavioral Consequences of Affect: Combining Evaluative and Regulatory Mechanisms 
Abstract:
 The proposed model integrates two streams of research on affect by
 specifying how evaluative and regulatory mechanisms interact to guide
 behavior. Two experiments demonstrate that when no mood changes are
 expected, the affective evaluation mechanism guides behavior, leading to a
 monotonic increase in behavioral intentions as affect conditions shift
 from negative to positive. When participants expect the behavioral
 activity to change their current affective states, a combination of affect
 regulation and affective evaluation produces a U-shape pattern when a
 mood-lifting cue is present (experiment 1) and an inverted U-shape pattern
 when a mood-threatening cue is present (experiment 2). (c) 2005 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Structural Constraints in Code-Switched Advertising 
Abstract:
 Code switching, the use of mixed-language expressions, is gaining
 prominence in advertising targeting linguistic minorities. Two studies
 investigate the existence of linguistic rules governing the use of code
 switching and identify situations in which those rules have a greater
 impact on persuasion. The studies extend Myers-Scotton's 1995 model of
 code switching by revealing an interaction between linguistic correctness
 and type of processing. More specifically, breaking the linguistic rules
 of code switching results in less persuasive messages but only when
 consumers process the ads in a highly data-driven mode. When consumers do
 not engage in highly data-driven processing, breaking linguistic rules
 does not influence persuasion. (c) 2005 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..
