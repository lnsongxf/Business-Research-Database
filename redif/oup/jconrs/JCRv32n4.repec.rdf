Title: Interaction of Senses: The Effect of Vision versus Touch on the Elongation Bias 
Abstract:
 We highlight the role of interacting senses on consumer judgment.
 Specifically, we focus on the role of the visual and haptic (touch) senses
 on the elongation bias, which predicts that the taller of two equivolume
 objects will appear bigger. We show that sensory modality will affect the
 extent (and even direction) of the elongation bias-with visual cues alone
 and with bimodal "visual and haptic cues" (seeing and handling the
 objects), we obtain the elongation bias; however, with haptic cues alone
 (handling the objects blindfolded) and in bimodal judgments with visual
 load, we obtain a reversal of the elongation bias. (c) 2006 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: The Effects of Information Processing Mode on Consumers' Responses to Comparative Advertising 
Abstract:
 We demonstrate that matching ad format to a consumer's mode of information
 processing enhances advertising effectiveness. Relative to noncomparative
 ads, comparative ads are more effective when consumers use analytical
 processing. Conversely, noncomparative ads are more effective than
 comparative ads when consumers use imagery processing. When ad format is
 compatible with processing mode, information processability is enhanced,
 making the message more persuasive and ad evaluations, brand evaluations,
 and purchase intentions more favorable than when ad format and processing
 mode are incompatible. (c) 2006 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Exemplars or Beliefs? The Impact of Self-View on the Nature and Relative Influence of Brand Associations 
Abstract:
 This research examines whether various forms of brand associations-overall
 brand beliefs (e.g., Sony is high quality) versus exemplars of the brand
 (e.g., Sony TV)-are differentially accessible for individuals with
 independent self-views and those with an interdependent self-view. Since
 independents emphasize the "traitedness" of behavior and tend to focus on
 attributes of objects, brand beliefs are relatively more accessible than
 exemplars to them. Conversely, since interdependents focus more on the
 role of contextual factors and the interrelatedness of events, exemplars
 are relatively more accessible to them than brand beliefs. Further,
 examination of the implications of this difference on brand attitudes and
 brand extension evaluations occurs. (c) 2006 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Self-Accountability Emotions and Fear Appeals: Motivating Behavior 
Abstract:
 We examine the role of high self-accountability emotions in enhancing
 compliance with fear appeals. In two field experiments, we find that
 relative to straight fear appeals (negative) or adding hope (positive),
 which ascribes low accountability to the self, action-facilitative coping,
 intentions, and behaviors (using sunscreen, eating high fiber foods) are
 enhanced by adding guilt, regret (both negative), or challenge (positive),
 all of which induce feelings of high self-accountability. In addition, we
 find that cold perceptions of high accountability are necessary but
 insufficient to influence actual behaviors and that the corresponding
 emotion is an essential driver of behaviors. (c) 2006 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Leader-Driven Primacy: Using Attribute Order to Affect Consumer Choice 
Abstract:
 Leader-driven primacy uses initial product information to install a
 targeted brand as the early leader in a choice between two brands. Biased
 evaluation of subsequent attributes builds support for the targeted brand,
 causing the choice itself to be biased. Study 1 finds evidence of this
 effect in choices between two equally attractive brands. Study 2 extends
 the finding to a situation where one brand is inferior and to conditions
 where participants do not explicitly identify their leader. Study 3 shows
 how leader-driven primacy can be reduced by encouraging brand-based
 processing. (c) 2006 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Self-Monitoring and Susceptibility to the Influence of Self-Prophecy 
Abstract:
 Having people predict whether they will perform a socially normative
 behavior increases their probability of performing that target action.
 Recent empirical evidence supports a dissonance-based theoretical
 explanation for this self-prophecy effect. While the effect is robust, few
 boundary conditions have been identified. We report two experiments within
 the dissonance paradigm providing theory-relevant evidence for the
 moderating effects of self-monitoring on people's susceptibility to
 self-prophecy. In particular, low self-monitors are more likely than high
 self-monitors to be influenced by self-prediction regarding normative
 behaviors. Implications for theory and the practice of social influence
 are provided. (c) 2006 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: The Endowed Progress Effect: How Artificial Advancement Increases Effort 
Abstract:
 This research documents a phenomenon we call the endowed progress effect,
 whereby people provided with artificial advancement toward a goal exhibit
 greater persistence toward reaching the goal. By converting a task
 requiring eight steps into a task requiring 10 steps but with two steps
 already complete, the task is reframed as one that has been undertaken and
 incomplete rather than not yet begun. This increases the likelihood of
 task completion and decreases completion time. The effect appears to
 depend on perceptions of task completion rather than a desire to avoid
 wasting the endowed progress. Moderators include the reason, if any,
 offered for the endowment and the currency in which progress is recorded. (c) 2006 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Positive and Negative Media Image Effects on the Self 
Abstract:
 We examine several factors that determine whether exposure to thin (or
 heavy) media images positively or negatively affects consumers' appearance
 self-esteem. We find that the effects of exposure to models in
 advertisements depend on two moderating factors: (1) the extremity of the
 model's thinness or heaviness, and (2) the method by which self-esteem is
 measured (free responses vs. rating scales). We also establish the
 underlying role of self-knowledge activation by examining response
 latencies in a lexical decision task. (c) 2006 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Money: A Bias for the Whole 
Abstract:
 We document the phenomenon of "bias for the whole," wherein greater value
 is perceived for money in the form of a whole (large denomination) than
 for equivalent amounts of money in parts (smaller denominations),
 resulting in a lower inclination to spend with the whole. We demonstrate
 across four experiments that the bias arises from greater processing
 fluency experienced in processing the whole as opposed to parts. This
 processing fluency is hedonically marked and generates positive affect
 that is attributed to the money, which results in an overvaluation of the
 whole, making one reluctant to spend with the whole. (c) 2006 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Indeterminacy and Live Television 
Abstract:
 Why would consumers prefer live television, even when tape-delayed
 broadcasts provide the same sensory experience? We propose that
 indeterminacy is a key reason. Indeterminate consumption experiences (such
 as watching sports competitions live on television) unfold in ways that
 are not decided ex ante. This makes them more exciting than equivalent
 determinate experiences (such as watching recorded broadcasts). We offer
 empirical evidence for this proposition: independently of other
 differences between live and taped broadcasts, the indeterminacy of events
 made watching them live more exciting and correspondingly preferable. We
 conclude by discussing implications of the indeterminacy concept for
 consumer research. (c) 2006 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Do You Know Me? Consumer Calibration of Friends' Knowledge 
Abstract:
 A consumer's decision to rely on a friend to act as an agent depends, in
 part, on beliefs about the friend's knowledge. Three studies examine the
 role of motivational and cognitive biases in estimating friends'
 personalized knowledge (e.g., knowledge of one's movie preferences).
 Results show that estimates of close friends' knowledge are less accurate
 than those of less close friends for personalized but not for impersonal
 knowledge. Specifically, the studies show more overestimation of
 personalized knowledge and more bias in integrating new information for
 close as opposed to less close friends, supporting a motivational
 explanation for miscalibration of personalized knowledge. (c) 2006 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Informational Properties of Anxiety and Sadness, and Displaced Coping 
Abstract:
 Replicating Raghunathan and Pham (<xref ref-type="bibr"
 rid="rf13">1999</xref>), results from two experiments confirm that while
 anxiety triggers a preference for options that are safer and provide a
 sense of control, sadness triggers a preference for options that are more
 rewarding and comforting. Results also indicate that these effects are
 driven by an affect-as-information process and are most pervasive when the
 source of anxiety or sadness is not salient. Finally, our results document
 a previously unrecognized phenomenon we term displaced coping, wherein
 affective states whose source is salient influence decisions that are
 seemingly-but not directly-related to the source of these affective
 states. (c) 2006 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Habitual Behavior in American Eating Patterns: The Role of Meal Occasions 
Abstract:
 Based on literatures in cognitive resource conservation and contextual cue
 consistency, we study two types of habits-carryover and baseline-in the
 consumption of food nutrients. Carryover habit obtains when the level of a
 nutrient consumed in preceding meals influences its consumption in the
 current meal. Baseline habit obtains when a nutrient's consumption
 systematically differs across meals. We test our hypotheses via a
 hierarchical linear model using a food consumption diary panel. Findings
 support our carryover habit and baseline habit dichotomy, as well as our
 predictions that carryover habit is stronger at breakfast and that
 within-meal carryover effects are stronger than across-meal carryover
 effects. (c) 2006 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Variety-Seeking Tendency in Choice for Others: Interpersonal and Intrapersonal Causes 
Abstract:
 Ratner and Kahn demonstrated that individuals believed that others would
 seek more variety than they themselves would seek. Building on this
 finding, we expected the variety-seeking tendency to be greater when
 people made choices for others, and we examined the mechanisms of this
 phenomenon. Study 1 explored an interpersonal mechanism and demonstrated
 that variety seeking for others became stronger when individuals were held
 accountable for their choices. Studies 2 and 3 explored an intrapersonal
 mechanism and showed that because of "focusing," people expected satiation
 with repeated consumption to occur more quickly for others than for self.
 Implications and future research are discussed. (c) 2006 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..
