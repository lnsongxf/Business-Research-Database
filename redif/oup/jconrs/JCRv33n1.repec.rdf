Title: What's In and What's Out: Questions on the Boundaries of the Attitude Construct 
Abstract:
 While reasonably comprehensive in nature, Cohen and Reed's integrative
 attitude model may benefit from an articulation of the boundaries of the
 attitude construct. As evidence, the present comment focuses on the extent
 to which attitudes can or should account for hot affect-based brand
 relationships and stronger forms of behaviors consumers reveal with
 brands. The authors recommend that the boundary conditions of the attitude
 construct can be elucidated by differentiating attitudes from a construct
 termed "emotional attachment." Potential differences between these two
 constructs are articulated. (c) 2006 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Regulatory Focus and Efficacy of Health Messages 
Abstract:
 Two studies support the premise that a person's regulatory focus
 determines the salience of self-efficacy (perceived ease) or response
 efficacy (perceived effectiveness) of health behaviors. The findings
 indicate greater regulatory-efficacy fit (experiment 1) and higher
 intentions to perform the advocated behaviors (experiment 2) when
 self-efficacy features are paired with promotion focus and when response
 efficacy features are paired with prevention focus. The data support the
 premise that self-efficacy is weighed more than response efficacy when the
 regulatory focus is promotion, whereas the reverse is true in prevention
 regulatory focus. (c) 2006 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Does the Frame of a Comparative Ad Moderate the Effectiveness of Extrinsic Information Cues? 
Abstract:
 This research investigates how framing moderates the use of message cues
 on performance risk evaluations. Understanding the moderating impact of
 the frame is important from a theoretical perspective as the frame is a
 critical contingency factor in how evaluations are formed. This research
 extends previous results by testing whether framing affects the use of
 other extrinsic cues, determining the effect when there are multiple
 extrinsic cues, determining the impact when extrinsic information is not
 explicitly provided, and providing evidence that positively framed
 messages engender more thorough analysis of message cues than negatively
 framed messages and affect how extrinsic cues are used. (c) 2006 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: How Nothing Became Something: White Space, Rhetoric, History, and Meaning 
Abstract:
 We seek to advance visual theory in the domain of commercial rhetoric
 (advertising) by demonstrating how objects and symbols derive meaning from
 their histories. We do this by examining a single visual trope common in
 advertising, white space. The choice of white space was purposeful in that
 it is not a picture and its history is both accessible and traceable. Our
 sociohistorical theory is supported by showing how specific movements and
 social forces acted upon the meaning of this particular visual rhetorical
 device and how this meaning is today shared and understood by both
 producers of ads (ad agency creative directors) and the readers of ads
 (ordinary consumers). We conclude with a discussion of the implications of
 this approach to rhetorical and other major theoretical formulations. (c) 2006 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Attitude Research: Between Ockham's Razor and the Fundamental Attribution Error 
Abstract:
 Attitudes are hypothetical constructs invented by researchers to explain
 phenomena of interest. Their appeal reflects the common preference for
 dispositional explanations. Construal models account for the same
 phenomena without assuming enduring predispositions and are better suited
 to accommodate a core requirement of any adaptive system of evaluation,
 namely, high context sensitivity. (c) 2006 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Beauty and the Beholder: Toward an Integrative Model of Communication Source Effects 
Abstract:
 We present a framework applicable to market communications that
 prominently feature the message source, with little or no argumentation.
 Based on dual-process theories and the recent literatures on resource
 matching and bias correction, we argue that source effects occur through
 one or more of the following three processes: peripheral/heuristic
 processing of source as a cue, central/systematic processing of source as
 product arguments, and correction of source biases. This three-process
 model sets boundary conditions for the existing source models (i.e.,
 main-effect models and source-by-product interaction models) and explains
 negative source effects. (c) 2006 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Accessibility-Diagnosticity and the Multiple Pathway Anchoring and Adjustment Model 
Abstract:
 I discuss how the Multiple Pathway Anchoring and Adjustment model is
 similar to and different from the Feldman and Lynch
 accessibility-diagnosticity model, elaborated as an anchoring and
 adjustment model by Lynch, Marmorstein, and Weigold. Cohen and Reed's
 concept of representational sufficiency embraces both attitude coherence
 and retrieval fluency; these map to prior operationalizations of
 diagnosticity in past accessibility-diagnosticity research. Cohen and
 Reed's functional sufficiency maps closely to Lynch et al.'s notion of a
 comparison of cumulative diagnosticity to a diagnosticity threshold in an
 anchoring and adjustment process. I identify differences between the two
 models and call for research to distinguish their predictions. (c) 2006 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: When More May Be Less: The Effects of Regulatory Focus on Responses to Different Comparative Frames 
Abstract:
 We examined the consequences of regulatory focus on exposure to two types
 of comparative advertising frames-a maximal claim ("brand A is superior to
 brand B") and a minimal claim ("brand A is equivalent or similar to brand
 B")-in three experiments. In experiment 1, we manipulated these frames,
 basing the sponsor brand's claim on comparison with an existing brand. In
 experiment 2, we operationalized the frames using a comparison featuring a
 sponsor brand targeting an established standard (Food and Drug
 Administration guidelines). A third experiment provided convergent
 evidence for the process underlying these effects. Consistent with
 theoretical reasoning, we found that promotion-focused individuals were
 more persuaded by maximal comparisons while prevention-focused individuals
 were either equally persuaded by the two frames or more persuaded by
 minimal frames. For prevention-focused individuals, maximal frames
 represented either a "no loss" or a "deviation from the norm." The no loss
 representation led to maximal and minimal frames being equally persuasive.
 The deviation from the norm representation led to greater negative
 elaboration on maximal frames, making them less persuasive than minimal
 frames. For promotion-focused people, a maximal frame simply represented a
 gain over a minimal frame, and hence it induced more favorable elaboration
 and greater persuasion. (c) 2006 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: A Multiple Pathway Anchoring and Adjustment (MPAA) Model of Attitude Generation and Recruitment 
Abstract:
 The Multiple Pathway Anchoring and Adjustment (MPAA) model integrates
 prior research on attitude formation, accessibility, strength, and
 attitude-behavior relationships and responds to key challenges to the
 traditional view of attitudes as enduring predispositions that guide
 behavior. The MPAA model emphasizes multiple pathways to attitude
 formation, including outside-in (object-centered) and inside-out
 (person-centered) pathways. The model also provides a nonoverlapping
 cognitions rationale for the coexistence of competing attitudes. The MPAA
 model introduces two subjective assessment criteria (representational and
 functional sufficiency) to explain how an anchoring and adjustment process
 functions to permit attitudes to guide behavior. (c) 2006 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: A Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Study of Neural Dissociations between Brand and Person Judgments 
Abstract:
 Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to investigate
 whether semantic judgments about products and persons are processed
 similarly. Our results suggest they are not: comparisons of neural
 correlates of product versus human descriptor judgments indicated greater
 activation in the medial prefrontal cortex regions for persons; for
 products, activation was greater in the left inferior prefrontal cortex,
 an area known to be involved in object processing. These findings serve to
 challenge the view that processing of products and brands is akin to that
 of humans and set a precedent for the use of fMRI techniques in consumer
 neuroscience studies. (c) 2006 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Decision Focus and Consumer Choice among Assortments 
Abstract:
 This research examines an empirical paradox documented by prior research:
 when choosing among assortments, consumers opt for the variety offered by
 larger assortments; however, consumers often are less confident in choices
 made from larger rather than from smaller assortments. By implying that
 consumers cannot always accurately predict their need for variety, this
 preference inconsistency also raises the question of what factors
 influence consumers' tendency to overestimate their need for the
 flexibility offered by larger assortments. Building on the view of choice
 as a hierarchical decision process, this research posits that choice among
 assortments is a function of consumers' decision focus and, in particular,
 the degree to which the subsequent task of making a choice from the
 selected assortment is salient to consumers. The data from four
 experiments offer converging evidence for the moderating role of decision
 focus on choice among assortments. (c) 2006 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Debiasing Insights from Process Tests 
Abstract:
 Most of the articles appearing in JCR that are characterized as behavioral
 decision theory (BDT) address some kind of bias or deviation from
 normative decision making. In addition to pointing out biases, these
 articles often examine underlying decision processes. We leverage
 approaches that researchers have used to understand process for insights
 into when and how biases can be corrected. We argue that some of these
 biases can be corrected by directly altering the decision maker's
 conscious processes, while other biases can be corrected more indirectly
 by altering the decision environment. (c) 2006 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Effects of Prototype and Exemplar Fit on Brand Extension Evaluations: A Two-Process Contingency Model 
Abstract:
 The brand extension literature suggests that consumers will favorably
 evaluate a brand extension when (a) it has high fit with the brand and (b)
 the brand has positive evaluations. We suggest that when a brand operates
 in multiple product domains, extension evaluations are more complex than
 have been conceptualized, and favorable consumer responses may result even
 in the absence of the above two conditions. Our two-process contingency
 model proposes two dimensions of fit (brand prototype fit and product
 exemplar fit) and two evaluative processes (top-down and parallel attitude
 transfer) that drive extension evaluations in different ways, depending on
 the level of cognitive resources. Three empirical studies found consistent
 support for the model. (c) 2006 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: MAPping the Frontiers: Theoretical Advances in Consumer Research on Memory, Affect, and Persuasion 
Abstract:
 Information processing research published in the Journal of Consumer
 Research has produced theoretical advances in our understanding of
 consumer behavior. This article highlights two themes that have emerged in
 consumer research over the past 15 years. These are the interplay between
 motivation and cognition and the impact of implicit processes on consumer
 behavior. We examine these themes in three core areas of information
 processing research-memory, affect, and persuasion. We also discuss
 methodological innovations that have enabled theory building and conclude
 with suggestions for future theoretical work in consumer research. (c) 2006 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Does Marketing Products as Remedies Create "Get Out of Jail Free Cards"? 
Abstract:
 Our research investigates the marketing of preventive and curative
 "remedies" (products and services that offer ways of mitigating risk by
 decreasing either its likelihood or severity). Examples include debt
 consolidation loans and smoking cessation aids. Like risk-avoidance
 messages, advertisements for remedies aim to reduce risk-by advocating the
 use of the branded product or service promoted by the marketer. In a
 series of experiments, we demonstrate that remedy messages undermine risk
 perceptions and increase risky behavioral intentions as consumer problem
 status rises. Ironically, remedies undermine risk avoidance among those
 most at risk-a boomerang effect with negative consequences for consumer
 welfare. (c) 2006 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Social Comparison Theory and Deception in the Interpersonal Exchange of Consumption Information 
Abstract:
 Four experiments demonstrate that self-threatening social comparison
 information motivates consumers to lie. Factors related to self-threat,
 including relevance of the social comparison target (i.e., the importance
 of the comparison person), comparison discrepancy (i.e., the magnitude of
 the performance difference), comparison direction (i.e., whether one
 performs better or worse), nature of the information (i.e., whether the
 comparison is social or objective), and perceived attainability (i.e., the
 possibility of achieving the compared performance), influenced consumers'
 willingness to engage in deception. Results extend social comparison
 theory by demonstrating that comparisons that threaten public and private
 selves have implications for lying behaviors. (c) 2006 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: A Metacognitive Model of Attitudes 
Abstract:
 The Cohen and Reed model of attitudes provides a useful addition to the
 literature. This article relates their framework to a metacognitive model
 of attitudes suggesting that attitude objects are associated not only with
 positive and/or negative evaluative tags but also with validity tags.
 According to this model, an attitude can be described as univalent (either
 positive or negative associations exist), explicitly ambivalent (both
 positive and negative associations exist and are endorsed), or implicitly
 ambivalent (one evaluative association is endorsed, and the opposite
 exists but is rejected). (c) 2006 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Shopping Goals, Goal Concreteness, and Conditional Promotions 
Abstract:
 We propose a two-stage model to describe the increasing concreteness of
 consumers' goals during the shopping process, testing the model with a
 series of field experiments at a convenience store. Using a number of
 different process measures (experiment 1), we first established that
 consumers are less certain of their shopping goals and construe products
 in less concrete terms when they are in the first (vs. second) stage of
 the shopping process. The results of experiments 2 and 3 next demonstrate
 that goal-evoking marketing promotions (e.g., conditional coupons) are
 more effective in influencing consumers' spending when consumers' goals
 are less concrete. (c) 2006 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..
