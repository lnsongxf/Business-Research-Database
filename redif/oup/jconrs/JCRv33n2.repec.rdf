Title: Effect of Response Time on Perceptions of Bargaining Outcomes 
Abstract:
 This research reports three studies that examine how cues which emerge
 from the bargaining environment, such as the time taken by an opponent to
 respond to an offer, influence perceptions of bargaining outcomes. Study 1
 finds that bargainers were more satisfied with outcomes when an offer was
 accepted after a delay than when accepted immediately. Study 2 shows that
 inferences of the level of conflict within the opponent underlie the
 effect of response time on perceptions of bargaining outcomes. Study 3
 shows that the presence of an objective (or diagnostic) referent moderates
 the influence of response time. (c) 2006 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Complaining to the Masses: The Role of Protest Framing in Customer-Created Complaint Web Sites 
Abstract:
 Consumers who once might have voiced their dissatisfaction with a firm to
 a few friends and acquaintances are now constructing Web sites to tell the
 world about their dissatisfaction. Protest-framing theory reveals the
 interlocking rhetorical tactics (injustice, identity, and agency framing)
 consumers use to mobilize mass audiences against a firm, contributing
 important insights to our understanding of negative word of mouth.
 Moreover, an analysis of protest sites reveals that consumers "frame"
 their corporate betrayal to the public to demonstrate their power to
 influence others and gain revenge. As a result, a community of discontent
 may arise in which both individual and social identities appear to be
 constructed and affirmed. (c) 2006 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Media Transportation and Advertising 
Abstract:
 Advertising is commonly presented in the context of media articles or
 programs that are intended to engage the consumer. An important aspect of
 this engagement is media transportation, where a person not only attends
 to information but also is absorbed into the narrative flow of a story in
 a pleasurable and active way. This research examines the effects of the
 transportation experience produced by the media context on the impact of
 ads that appear in that context. Three studies show that transportation
 can have both positive and negative effects on advertising. Intrusion of
 the ad into the transportation process is shown to mediate the negative
 effects, which occurs independently of involvement. (c) 2006 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Price Fairness: Good and Service Differences and the Role of Vendor Costs 
Abstract:
 Prior research suggests that consumers are forgiving of a price increase
 that is commensurate with increased vendor costs. We argue that the
 perceived fairness of the price increase will also depend on the
 alignability of the cost and price increases, such that alignable
 increases will be perceived as more acceptable than nonalignable
 increases. Moreover, we predict that when a cost increase is nonalignable,
 consumers will be more receptive to a service price increase than a goods
 price increase. Evidence from a series of experiments supports both
 predictions. (c) 2006 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Differentiation and Parity in Assortment Pricing 
Abstract:
 Are consumers more likely to purchase an item from an assortment in which
 options are priced at parity or from an assortment in which options vary
 in price? This research examines the influence of parity-pricing and
 differentiation-pricing strategies on consumer choice and identifies
 conditions in which parity pricing facilitates choice, as well as
 conditions in which choice is facilitated by differential pricing. In a
 series of three experiments, the impact of assortment pricing on choice is
 shown to be a function of the uncertainty associated with consumers'
 preferences and the consistency of these preferences with options' prices. (c) 2006 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: The Glocalization of Youth Culture: The Global Youth Segment as Structures of Common Difference 
Abstract:
 In this article we present an analysis of global youth cultural
 consumption based on a multisited empirical study of young consumers in
 Denmark and Greenland. We treat youth culture as a market ideology by
 tracing the emergence of youth culture in relation to marketing and how
 the ideology has glocalized. This transnational market ideology is
 manifested in the glocalization of three structures of common difference
 that organize our data: identity, center-periphery, and reference to youth
 cultural consumption styles. Our study goes beyond accounts of global
 homogenization and local appropriation by showing the glocal structural
 commonalities in diverse manifestations of youth culture. (c) 2006 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Consumers' Immediate Memory for Prices 
Abstract:
 We examine the cognitive mechanics involved in keeping prices in
 short-term memory for subsequent recall. Consumers code and store prices
 verbally, visually, and in terms of the prices' magnitude. The encoding
 used influences immediate recall performance. The memorability of prices
 depends on their verbal length, usualness, and on the other prices to be
 memorized simultaneously. The performance of consumers is affected by
 their auditory and visual recall ability, their pronunciation speed, and
 price abbreviation habits. Overall, consumers recall prices better than
 suggested by previous digit span studies with simple numbers. (c) 2006 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: When Choosing Is Not Deciding: The Effect of Perceived Responsibility on Satisfaction 
Abstract:
 Prior research has found differences in satisfaction for choosers and
 nonchoosers of the same outcome. Two studies show that differentiability
 of the choice-set options moderates this effect. When options are more
 differentiated, choice enhances consumers' satisfaction with positive and
 dissatisfaction with negative outcomes; when options are less
 differentiated, choosers experience the same level of satisfaction as
 nonchoosers, regardless of the option valence. We test the hypothesis that
 the effect of outcome differentiability is due to differences in perceived
 responsibility and subsequent self-credit and self-blame for the decision
 outcome. A third study separates the effects of differentiability from
 random choice. (c) 2006 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: From Labeling Possessions to Possessing Labels: Ridicule and Socialization among Adolescents 
Abstract:
 This research explores ridicule as a mechanism through which adolescents
 exchange information about consumption norms and values. The author finds
 that adolescents use ridicule to ostracize, haze, or admonish peers who
 violate consumption norms. Targets and observers learn stereotypes about
 avoidance groups, consumption norms of aspirational groups, the use of
 possessions to communicate social linkages and achieve acceptance goals,
 and social consequences of nonconformity. As a result, many targets and
 observers of ridicule alter their perceptions, acquisition, use, and
 disposition of objects in order to avoid unwanted attention. (c) 2006 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Determinants of Trademark Dilution 
Abstract:
 A hierarchical Bayes associative network model for brand information is
 developed and tested to measure the extent of harm from trademark
 dilution. In the proposed model, category activation thresholds are
 modeled in terms of brand/category familiarity, activation flows are
 modeled in terms of relative category knowledge, and consumer confusion
 and its correlates are used to capture the asymmetric effects of dilution
 on retrieval probabilities for first and second users. (c) 2006 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Spoken and Typed Expressions of Repeated Attitudes: Matching Response Modes Leads to Attitude Retrieval versus Construction 
Abstract:
 Speaking and typing recruit different cognitive, motor, and perceptual
 systems that result in the encoding of differentiated memory traces. These
 factors did not affect the expression of stimulus-based attitudes.
 However, matching response modes resulted in more consistent repeated
 attitudes in experiment 1 and more predictable choice behaviors in
 experiment 2 than mismatching response modes. Judgment-confidence and
 recall data in experiment 3 indicate that matching (mismatching) response
 modes leads to attitude retrieval (construction). These findings are of
 growing relevance to marketers and opinion pollsters who assess attitudes
 expressed orally and, increasingly, in typed form over the Internet. (c) 2006 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Repenting Hyperopia: An Analysis of Self-Control Regrets 
Abstract:
 This article proposes that supposedly farsighted (hyperopic) choices of
 virtue over vice evoke increasing regret over time. We demonstrate that
 greater temporal separation between a choice and its assessment enhances
 the regret (or anticipated regret) of virtuous decisions (e.g., choosing
 work over pleasure). We argue that this finding reflects the differential
 impact of time on the affective determinants of self-control regrets. In
 particular, we show that greater temporal perspective attenuates emotions
 of indulgence guilt but accentuates wistful feelings of missing out on the
 pleasures of life. We examine alternative explanations, including action
 versus inaction regrets and levels of construal. (c) 2006 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: The Role of Arousal in Commitment: An Explanation for the Number of Counterarguments 
Abstract:
 This article identifies arousal as the motivating variable that helps high
 commitment consumers generate more counterarguments resulting in
 resistance to attitude change. Two studies examine the role of arousal on
 high and low commitment participants. In the first study, arousal is
 externally manipulated, and the effects of increased arousal are examined
 for high and low commitment participants. In study 2, the effect of
 sufficient versus insufficient elaboration on a message is examined in the
 context of arousal reduction. The relationship between the two types of
 arousal-tense and energy-is also examined. (c) 2006 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Consumer Gift Systems 
Abstract:
 This article develops a critique of the dyadic model of consumer gift
 giving and an extension of the classic paradigm of gift giving as
 elaborated in fundamental anthropological and sociological texts. I
 conceptualize and present empirical evidence for the notion of a consumer
 gift system, a system of social solidarity based on a structured set of
 gift exchange and social relationships among consumers. Social
 distinctions, norm of reciprocity, and rituals and symbolisms are defined
 as key characteristics of a consumer gift system and are shown to be
 present in peer-to-peer music file sharing at Napster. Implications for
 extant research on solidarity, gift giving, and consumption are discussed,
 and future research directions are provided. (c) 2006 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..
