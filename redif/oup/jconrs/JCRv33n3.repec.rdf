Title: Consistency and Validity Issues in Consumer Judgments 
Abstract:
 Prior research has traced poor judgment quality to poor calibration. We
 suggest inconsistency to be another reason for poor judgment
 quality-utilizing different models on different occasions resulting in
 increased wandering in judgments. We demonstrate differing consistency in
 the utilization of models depending upon which variable is used as a cue
 and which is used as the criterion to be predicted. This results in
 differing correlations underlying judgments between the same two
 variables, an internally inconsistent pattern. We trace this to the
 utilization of lay causal models to make predictions but with the strength
 of the causal story moderating the consistency in use of the model. (c) 2006 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Nation Equity: Incidental Emotions in Country-of-Origin Effects 
Abstract:
 Different from past research on country-of-origin effects that has focused
 on cognitive factors, this article examines the impact of incidental
 emotions and cognitive appraisals associated with these emotions on
 country-of-origin effects. Experiment 1 compared anger and sadness and
 demonstrated that country of origin influenced evaluations only in the
 angry (vs. sad) condition where human (vs. situation) control was high.
 Experiment 2 further identified the effects of agency control using a
 different emotion, frustration. Based on these observations, this article
 suggests that, like brands, countries also have equity associated with
 them, termed "nation equity," that has both performance and emotional
 components. (c) 2006 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: The Importance and Functional Significance of Affective Cues in Consumer Choice 
Abstract:
 Existing evidence for affect's influence on information processing and
 choice under high elaboration is mixed. In addition, affective choice is
 often viewed as erroneous in that it is assumed to lead to regret. We show
 that affect has a reliable impact on choice under high elaboration, which
 occurs through a combination of heuristic and systematic processing.
 Furthermore, consumers were able to correct for the impact irrelevant
 affect had on systematic processing but not for its impact on less
 conscious heuristic processing. Finally, affective purchases led to
 greater long-term satisfaction for important purchases, suggesting that
 affective choice can be functional. (c) 2006 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Learning through Virtual Product Experience: The Role of Imagery on True versus False Memories 
Abstract:
 Two experiments examined the effect of interacting with a virtual object
 (object interactivity) on true and false memories. Although object
 interactivity may improve memory of associations compared to static
 pictures and text, it may lead to the creation of vivid internally
 generated recollections that pose as real memories. Consequently, compared
 to information conveyed via static pictures and text, object interactivity
 may cause people to falsely recognize more nonpresented features. The
 results support these hypotheses and provide converging evidence that this
 false-recognition effect is due to using imagery during retrieval and is
 robust, emerging regardless of individuals' goals (to search or browse) or
 learning intent. (c) 2006 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: The Price of "Free"-dom: Consumer Sensitivity to Promotions with Negative Contextual Influences 
Abstract:
 Past research has shown that monetary promotions (e.g., discounts) are
 more likely to be processed relative to and integrated with the original
 product price than are free promotions. We posit that because of this
 difference, free promotions are more focal and salient than monetary
 promotions. In a set of three experiments, we demonstrate that this
 salience results in free promotions being less susceptible than equivalent
 monetary discounts to negative contextual information on quality that can
 potentially lower purchase intentions. We show that this effect can be
 reversed when respondents focus on other pieces of information that
 diminish the salience of the free promotion. (c) 2006 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Sponsorship-Linked Marketing: The Role of Articulation in Memory 
Abstract:
 Corporate sponsorship of events contributes significantly to marketing
 aims, including brand awareness as measured by recall and recognition of
 sponsor-event pairings. Unfortunately, resultant advantages accrue
 disproportionately to brands having a natural or congruent fit with the
 available sponsorship properties. In three cued-recall experiments, the
 effect of articulation of sponsorship fit on memory for sponsor-event
 pairings is examined. While congruent sponsors have a natural memory
 advantage, results demonstrate that memory improvements via articulation
 are possible for incongruent sponsor-event pairings. These improvements
 are, however, affected by the presence of competitor brands and the way in
 which memory is accessed. (c) 2006 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Spillover Effects: How Consumers Respond to Unexpected Changes in Price and Quality 
Abstract:
 This article examines how unexpected changes in the marketing mix of one
 product in a retail setting can influence demand for other, unrelated,
 items. Results from two laboratory studies show that spillover effects can
 occur in response to both positive and negative changes in either the
 price or quality of a product, such that positive changes increase total
 spending on other items and negative changes reduce it. The results also
 demonstrate that an attributional process underlies these effects,
 indicating that consumers experience specific affective responses directed
 at the retailer that lead them either to reward or punish the retailer
 accordingly. (c) 2006 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Articulation Compatibility in Eliciting Price Bids 
Abstract:
 Do consumers prefer auctions that allow them to place more precise bids to
 auctions that accept less precise bids? Can consumers accurately estimate
 their need for price-elicitation precision? This research addresses these
 questions by applying the notion of compatibility to the relationship
 between consumers' bidding price uncertainty and the precision implied by
 the price-elicitation task. Data from four experiments show that when
 consumers are uncertain about the optimal bidding price, decision tasks
 requiring elicitation of precise bids lead to lower decision confidence,
 and vice versa. It is further shown that consumers display stronger
 preference for high-precision auctions, even though such auctions are
 associated with less confident pricing decisions. (c) 2006 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Brand Extensions of Experiential Goods: Movie Sequel Evaluations 
Abstract:
 We examine movie sequels as brand extensions of experiential goods. Study
 1 reveals a reversal of the traditional categorization model such that
 dissimilar extensions are rated higher than similar extensions. This
 reversal is moderated by the name of the sequel; numbered sequels
 (Daredevil 2) are influenced by similarity more than named sequels
 (Daredevil: Taking It to the Streets). Study 2 reveals that the reversal
 arises because numbered sequels invoke a greater degree of assimilation
 with the parent movie, thereby increasing consumers' level of satiation of
 experiential attributes. The Internet Movie Database (IMDb) provides
 external validity for our results (study 3). (c) 2006 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Why It Is So Hard to Predict Our Partner's Product Preferences: The Effect of Target Familiarity on Prediction Accuracy 
Abstract:
 Many buying decisions require predictions of another person's product
 attitudes. Yet, consumers are often inaccurate predictors, even for
 familiar others. We provide strong evidence that target familiarity can
 even hurt accuracy in the presence of attitude feedback. Although
 overprojection and lack of product-specific attitude information have been
 identified as possible reasons for prediction inaccuracy, our results
 suggest a retrieval explanation. When presented with product-specific
 attitude feedback, predictors adapted their level of projection and
 encoded the attitude information, but they did not use this information.
 Instead, they retrieved less diagnostic, pre-stored information about the
 familiar targets to predict their product attitudes. (c) 2006 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Dynamic Pricing and Consumer Fairness Perceptions 
Abstract:
 Dynamic pricing practices by sellers in response to segment and
 individual-level differences have been made more feasible as internet
 buyer behavior increases. While benefits from these pricing practices can
 accrue to sellers and buyers, the potential for (un)fairness perceptions
 to mitigate these advantages is important. In an effort to investigate
 these issues, this article reports the results of three studies that
 examine the effects of seller-, consumer-, time-, and auction-based price
 differences on perceived price fairness and purchase satisfaction. The
 findings underscore the potential negative effects associated with price
 differences from dynamic pricing practices. (c) 2006 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: The Moderating Effect of Relationship Norm Salience on Consumers' Loss Aversion 
Abstract:
 People are said to be loss averse when their pain of losing something
 exceeds their joy of gaining it. This research proposes and tests a new
 moderator of loss aversion: the type of relationship norms salient at the
 time the loss or the gain is experienced. We suggest that mere salience of
 the norms of a communal relationship (based on concern for the partner)
 relative to those of an exchange relationship (based on quid pro quo)
 leads to a greater degree of loss aversion. A typical endowment effect
 study supports our overall thesis and shows that differences across
 relationship norms are stronger in selling prices (willingness to accept)
 than in buying prices (willingness to pay). (c) 2006 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: A Cue Alone or a Probe to Think? The Dual Role of Affect in Product Evaluations 
Abstract:
 Two studies investigate the conditions under which mood acts as a
 heuristic cue that influences the judgments of a message and when mood
 acts as a resource (facilitates relational elaboration). The findings
 indicate that mood serves as a cue when the message information is not
 easily accessible. This outcome is qualified by the individuals'
 willingness to hold accurate beliefs. When respondents are alerted to the
 potential effect of their mood on their judgment, they correct for it.
 Positive mood acts as a resource when information about the target is
 accessible and there are contextual cues that are perceived as relevant to
 the judgment of a target. (c) 2006 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Now or Never: Effects of Limited Purchase Opportunities on Patterns of Regret over Time 
Abstract:
 Prior research has demonstrated that actions are regretted more than
 inactions in the short term. We show that, in limited purchase
 opportunities-situations where the purchase decision cannot be
 reversed-not purchasing (inaction) is seen as a loss and is associated
 with greater short-term regret than purchasing, reversing the omission
 bias. With respect to long-term regret, we use coping and availability
 mechanisms to suggest that, contrary to prior findings, inaction
 (nonpurchase) regrets decrease over time. We also argue that action
 (purchase) regrets should increase over time, but only when long-term
 utility is low. We support our predictions with a field study and two
 laboratory experiments. (c) 2006 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..
