Title: Superfluous Choices and the Persistence of Preference 
Abstract:
 Superfluous choices are unnecessary choice steps that could be removed
 without affecting the final choice context and outcome. They are
 introduced in this article in order to study the mere effects of consumer
 participation. Superfluous choices have no immediate impact on the chosen
 option but strongly increase consumers' propensity to persist with the
 same option on future choice occasions. Four experiments that isolate and
 investigate this indirect effect and its moderators highlight the impact
 of consumer participation that derives from a perception of greater
 deliberation and fluency in decision making. (c) 2007 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Attitudinal Ambivalence and Openness to Persuasion: A Framework for Interpersonal Influence 
Abstract:
 Our two-stage framework predicts that, during impression formation,
 individuals who hold ambivalent attitudes toward an issue are influenced
 by other sources regardless of their perceived reliability on the target
 issue. Less ambivalent individuals are presumed likely to check the
 reliability of the message's source before accepting it. Experiment 1
 finds that highly ambivalent participants do not differentiate between a
 more versus less reliable source when forming impressions of a political
 candidate, whereas less ambivalent participants do. Experiments 2 and 3
 show that less ambivalent individuals' attitudes can be influenced by less
 reliable sources if participants are unaware of this influence or if
 participants' cognitive resources are curtailed. (c) 2007 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Few Ways to Love, but Many Ways to Hate: Attribute Ambiguity and the Positivity Effect in Agent Evaluation 
Abstract:
 Recent research has identified a positivity effect in consumers'
 evaluations of agents, such as friends and professional critics, who
 provide word-of-mouth evaluations and recommendations. Specifically,
 agreement with an agent on previously loved alternatives is perceived as
 more diagnostic of the agent's suitability than agreement on previously
 hated alternatives. This article argues that the positivity effect arises
 from greater ambiguity about attribute ratings of hated versus loved
 alternatives. Three studies support this by showing that the effect is
 moderated by the number of attributes, the number of alternatives, and the
 revelation of an agent's attribute ratings, and is mediated by attribute
 ambiguity. (c) 2007 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Consumer Response to Polysemous Brand Slogans 
Abstract:
 Polysemous brand slogans have multiple meanings that may convey several
 product attributes. We build on extant research by suggesting that some
 consumers automatically access multiple meanings of a polysemous brand
 slogan, whereas others access only a single, immediately available
 meaning. A novel measure of automatic access to secondary meaning (the
 Secondary Meaning Access via the Automatic Route Test, or SMAART) is
 developed to capture this individual difference and show its consequences
 for consumer responses to polysemous slogans with unfavorable secondary
 meanings. The automatic-access account is further validated by employing
 the Implicit Association Test (Greenwald, McGhee, and Schwartz),
 suggesting that the unconscious impact of polysemous brand slogans can be
 more influential than intuitively expected. (c) 2007 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: The Influence of Experience and Sequence of Conflicting Emotions on Ad Attitudes 
Abstract:
 Two experiments suggest that when participants evaluate an ad, they prefer
 improving ad emotions, because attitudes are based on an assessment of
 whether the emotions deviate positively or negatively from previous levels
 of emotions. In contrast, when emotions are experienced, positive emotions
 facilitate coping with later negativity, and an ad with declining (vs.
 improving) emotions results in more favorable attitudes. This beneficial
 effect of experienced positive emotions in reducing the impact of
 subsequent negative emotions is reversed when the positive emotions are
 allowed to dissipate over a time delay between the experiences of the two
 emotions. (c) 2007 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Retrieval Disruption in Collaborative Groups due to Brand Cues 
Abstract:
 This research examines the effect of brand cues on retrieval of target
 brands by individuals in collaborative (vs. noncollaborative) settings. We
 examine two theories, salience of the brand cue and retrieval-strategy
 disruption, as potential explanations. Two experiments show that brand
 cues lead to greater inhibition of target brands in a collaborative versus
 a noncollaborative setting. The theoretical contribution is the exposition
 of a double-cueing effect of brand cues such that both (a) cue salience
 and (b) cue-induced retrieval-strategy disruption are greater for
 individuals in a collaborative setting. The discussion highlights
 additional theoretical implications of this research. (c) 2007 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Self-Referencing and Persuasion: Narrative Transportation versus Analytical Elaboration 
Abstract:
 This article contrasts narrative self-referencing with analytical
 self-referencing. I propose that narrative self-referencing persuades
 through transportation, where people become absorbed in a story-in this
 case, in their storylike thoughts (Green and Brock <xref ref-type="bibr"
 rid="rf12">2000</xref>). When ad viewers are transported by these
 narrative thoughts, persuasion is not negatively affected by weak ad
 arguments. Conversely, analytical self-referencing persuades via more
 traditional processing models, wherein cognitive elaboration is enhanced
 by relating incoming information to one's self or personal experiences,
 which results in a differential persuasive effect of strong versus weak
 arguments. I also propose that ad skepticism moderates the effect of
 narrative transportation. My assertions are tested in two experiments in
 the context of mental simulation as a form of narrative self-referencing. (c) 2007 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Cultural Differences in Brand Extension Evaluation: The Influence of Analytic versus Holistic Thinking 
Abstract:
 Consumers evaluate brand extensions by judging how well they fit with the
 parent brand. We examine this process across cultures. We predict that
 consumers from Eastern cultures, characterized by holistic thinking,
 perceive higher brand extension fit and evaluate brand extensions more
 favorably than do Western consumers, characterized by analytic thinking.
 Study 1 supports the existence of these cultural differences, with study 2
 providing support for styles of thinking (analytic vs. holistic) as the
 drivers of cultural differences in brand extension evaluations. (c) 2007 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Jack of All Trades or Master of One? Product Differentiation and Compensatory Reasoning in Consumer Choice 
Abstract:
 This research examines consumer reactions to two common positioning
 strategies: a specialized-positioning strategy in which an option is
 described by a single feature, and an all-in-one strategy in which an
 option is described by a combination of features. The empirical data
 reported in this article demonstrate that a product specializing on a
 single attribute is perceived to be superior on that attribute relative to
 an all-in-one option, even when this attribute is exactly the same for
 both options. It is further shown that the observed devaluation of the
 all-in-one option can be mitigated by introducing another attribute on
 which the all-in-one option is inferior to the specialized option. (c) 2007 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Not as Happy as I Thought I'd Be? Affective Misforecasting and Product Evaluations 
Abstract:
 We introduce the concept of affective misforecasting (AMF) and study its
 impact on product evaluations. Study 1 examines whether and when AMF
 affects evaluations, finding that AMF has an impact on evaluations when
 the affective experience is worse (but not when better) than forecasted.
 Study 2 tests a process model designed to understand how and why AMF
 influences evaluations. The extent of elaboration is shown to underlie the
 observed effects. The studies demonstrate the robustness of the findings
 by controlling for alternative factors, specifically experienced affect,
 expectancy disconfirmation, and actual performance, which might have an
 impact on these judgments. (c) 2007 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Tempted or Not? The Effect of Recent Purchase History on Responses to Affective Advertising 
Abstract:
 Three experiments investigate the emotions that arise from buying or not
 buying at an unintended purchase opportunity and how they color
 evaluations of affective advertising appeals that are viewed subsequently.
 We demonstrate that buying can cause happiness tempered with guilt, while
 not buying causes pride. Consistent with the felt affect, respondents who
 had bought at time 1 subsequently prefer happiness appeals to pride
 appeals, while those who had refrained prefer pride appeals. Drawing
 attention to the initial purchase decision and varying the affect by
 manipulating the discount both moderate this effect. These results
 contribute to the literatures on self-regulation, emotions, and
 persuasion. (c) 2007 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Spent Resources: Self-Regulatory Resource Availability Affects Impulse Buying 
Abstract:
 This research investigated impulse buying as resulting from the depletion
 of a common-but limited-resource that governs self-control. In three
 investigations, participants' self-regulatory resources were depleted or
 not; later, impulsive spending responses were measured. Participants whose
 resources were depleted, relative to participants whose resources were not
 depleted, felt stronger urges to buy, were willing to spend more, and
 actually did spend more money in unanticipated buying situations.
 Participants having depleted resources reported being influenced equally
 by affective and cognitive factors and purchased products that were high
 on each factor at equal rates. Hence, self-regulatory resource
 availability predicts whether people can resist impulse buying
 temptations. (c) 2007 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Feeling and Thinking in Memory-Based versus Stimulus-Based Choices 
Abstract:
 We contrast memory-based and stimulus-based choices, using dual-process
 theories such as Kahneman and Frederick's system 1/system 2 dichotomy.
 Systems 1 and 2 are conceptualized as distinct modes of thought, the
 former automatic and affective, the latter controlled and deliberate.
 Cognitive load impedes system 2, yielding greater reliance on system 1. In
 memory-based choice, consumers must maintain relevant options in working
 memory. Thus, memory-based choices are associated with greater cognitive
 load than stimulus-based choices. Indeed, we find that memory-based
 choices favor immediately compelling, affect-rich system 1 options,
 whereas stimulus-based choices favor affect-poor options whose
 attractiveness emerges from deliberative system 2 thought. (c) 2007 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Taste Perception: More than Meets the Tongue 
Abstract:
 Perceptual discrimination is fundamental to rational choice in many
 product categories yet rarely examined in consumer research. The present
 research investigates discrimination as it pertains to consumers' ability
 to identify differences-or the lack thereof-among gustatory stimuli. Three
 experiments reveal systematic bias resulting from the presence of common
 visual and verbal product cues. Particularly noteworthy is the finding
 that the amount of bias induced by a subtle, nonevaluative cue can far
 exceed the bias induced by overt and well-established evaluative cues. In
 addition, the effects these cues have on perceptual discrimination diverge
 from the effects they have on preference. (c) 2007 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..
