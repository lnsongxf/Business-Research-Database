Title: License to Sin: The Liberating Role of Reporting Expectations 
Abstract:
 This research examines the impact of asking intention questions about
 "vice behaviors," or behaviors about which respondents simultaneously hold
 both negative explicit and positive implicit attitudes. Asking questions
 about the likelihood of engaging in behaviors for which respondents
 maintain conflicting attitude structures appears to give respondents a
 "license to sin," resulting in increased rates of behavior versus those of
 a control group not asked intention questions. However, when provided with
 defensive tools that highlight the negative explicit component of their
 attitudes toward the behaviors, respondents are able to dampen the
 increase in behavior caused by the act of prediction. (c) 2007 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: For Better or For Worse? Valenced Comparative Frames and Regulatory Focus 
Abstract:
 Three experiments examine how prevention-focused and promotion-focused
 consumers evaluate the comparison brand and what information they anchor
 on in direct comparative ads framed positively or negatively. Negative
 (vs. positive) frames lead prevention-focused respondents to exhibit
 higher evaluations for the advertised brand and lower evaluations for the
 comparison brand. Under promotion focus, positive (vs. negative) frames
 lead to more favorable attitudes toward the advertised brand with no
 difference in attitudes for the comparison brand. Preference for
 consistency is posited as a possible process explanation. We also find an
 evaluation order effect: prevention-focused (promotion-focused)
 individuals evaluate the comparison (advertised) brand first. (c) 2007 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Explaining Cognitive Lock-In: The Role of Skill-Based Habits of Use in Consumer Choice 
Abstract:
 We introduce and test a theory of how the choices consumers make are
 influenced by skill-based habits of use-goal-activated automated behaviors
 that develop through the repeated consumption or use of a particular
 product. Such habits can explain how consumers become locked in to an
 incumbent product. The proposed theory characterizes how the amount of
 experience with the incumbent product, the occurrence of usage errors
 while learning to use that product, and the goal that is activated at the
 time a choice is made interrelate to influence consumer preference. The
 results of three experiments support the theory's predictions. (c) 2007 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: The Influence of Chronic and Situational Self-Construal on Categorization 
Abstract:
 Four studies, using chronic and situational self-construal, supported the
 proposition that individualists (collectivists) focus on within-category
 richness (between-category differentiation). Collectivists judged paired
 products as less similar than individualists did, but only at the higher
 level of a category hierarchy (studies 1 and 2). Further, collectivists
 were more context driven in product ratings in a categorization task
 (study 3). Study 4 focused on high-level pairs and found that under high
 involvement, chronic self-construal dominated judgments. Under low
 involvement, chronic and situational construals interacted: individualists
 (collectivists) were less (more) amenable to the situational construal.
 Implications for self-construal and categorization research are discussed. (c) 2007 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: The Moderating Influence of Advertising Context on Ad Repetition Effects: The Role of Amount and Type of Elaboration 
Abstract:
 Although several advertising studies report that message repetition leads
 to favorable evaluation of the advertised brand, a surprisingly large
 number of studies fail to find this repetition effect. This article
 investigates the influence of the advertising context in which the ad is
 presented on the repetition effect. The ad context, along with the ad
 content and individual differences in expertise, are found to influence
 the type of elaboration (item-specific and relational elaboration) a
 message receives. Message repetition affects evaluation when the
 additional exposures facilitate the complementary generation of these two
 types of elaboration of the ad message. When either type of elaboration
 dominates or when the message recipient spontaneously generates the
 impoverished type of elaboration, the effect of ad repetition is not
 observed. These findings provide evidence for the distinct influence on
 evaluation of the amount and type of elaboration that an advertising
 message receives. (c) 2007 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: The Impact of the Internet on Consumers' Use of Information Sources for Automobiles: A Re-Inquiry 
Abstract:
 Using three cohorts of data from field surveys of new car buyers in 1990,
 2000, and 2002, this study seeks to determine how the Internet fits into
 patterns of information search for recent car buyers. We believe that our
 study provides the most complete analysis to date of how the Internet is
 being integrated with other product information sources. Specifically, we
 find that the Internet substitutes for time spent at the dealer and time
 spent in negotiating prices. We also find that it substitutes for print
 third-party sources. Manufacturer/dealer Internet sources are the most
 widely used and appear to substitute the most for traditional sources. (c) 2007 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: On the Perceived Value of Money: The Reference Dependence of Currency Numerosity Effects 
Abstract:
 Money illusion research shows that the nominal (face) value of money
 affects consumer perceptions of its real value. Recent mixed findings on
 consumer valuations in different currencies suggest that the underlying
 anchoring and adjustment processes are complex. We develop a framework to
 identify boundary conditions that specify the direction of anchoring
 effects on valuations in different currencies. Consumers anchor on the
 numerosity of the nominal difference between prices and salient referents
 (e.g., budgets) when evaluating transactions. Support for our framework
 comes from a series of experiments that evoke different reference
 standards. We discuss implications and opportunities for future research. (c) 2007 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Dominated Consumer Acculturation: The Social Construction of Poor Migrant Women's Consumer Identity Projects in a Turkish Squatter 
Abstract:
 We conduct an ethnographic case study of poor migrant women living in a
 Turkish squatter to explore how consumer acculturation operates in this
 important context. Poor migrants have no choice but to engage Turkish
 consumer culture because it is hegemonic and it conflicts ideologically
 with their village culture, and they do so with few resources. Our
 dominated consumer acculturation model specifies three modes of
 acculturation structured by this context: migrants reconstitute their
 village culture in the city, shutting out the dominant ideology; or they
 collectively pursue the dominant ideology as a myth through ritualized
 consumption; or they give up on both pursuits, resulting in a shattered
 identity project. (c) 2007 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Consumer-Product Skill Matching: The Effects of Difficulty on Relative Self-Assessment and Choice 
Abstract:
 Consumers infer their best product choice from comparative information
 about themselves and products (Prelec, Wernerfelt, and Zettelmeyer).
 Though common, this "matching" process leads to unstable preferences when
 perceived product ranks change due to product array manipulations. This
 article proposes that another variable, task difficulty, also leads to
 inconsistent choices through the matching process. Accuracy resulting from
 matching is also assessed by exploring domains where comparative standing
 is based on measurable, objective skill. The present studies show that
 people rely heavily on their relative self-assessments in product choice,
 but these estimates are often inaccurate and thus lead to unintended and
 inconsistent choices. (c) 2007 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Whence Univalent Ambivalence? From the Anticipation of Conflicting Reactions 
Abstract:
 The subjective experience of ambivalence results from possessing both
 positive and negative reactions. Why do individuals sometimes experience
 ambivalence when they possess only positive or only negative reactions
 (i.e., univalent attitudes)? This research advances and provides support
 for the notion that anticipated conflicting reactions underlie such
 ambivalence. Anticipated conflicting reactions occur when an individual
 possesses no, or only a few, manifest conflicting reactions and yet
 anticipates that there may exist conflicting information of which they are
 unaware. Support is provided by three experiments in which anticipated
 conflicting reactions mediated the influence of amount of univalent
 information on feelings of ambivalence. (c) 2007 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: An Examination of Different Explanations for the Mere Exposure Effect 
Abstract:
 This article investigates two competing explanations of the mere exposure
 effect-the cognition-based perceptual fluency/misattribution theory (PF/M)
 and the affect-based hedonic fluency model (HFM)-under incidental exposure
 conditions. In two studies, the classical mere exposure effect is
 replicated in the context of banner advertising. The findings rule out the
 cognition-based PF/M and suggest that the spontaneous affective reaction
 resulting from perceptual fluency is a crucial link between fluency and
 evaluation. The studies provide strong evidence that the spontaneous
 affect influences evaluative judgments through a more complex process,
 likely by coloring the interpretation of the fluency experience and the
 nature of resulting metacognitions relating fluency to liking. Theoretical
 and managerial implications of the findings are mentioned. (c) 2007 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Exploring the Cognitive Mechanism that Underlies Regulatory Focus Effects 
Abstract:
 Much research has explained regulatory focus effects via the alternative
 psychological states (eagerness vs. vigilance) people experience when they
 adopt different regulatory foci. This article identifies for the first
 time the cognitive mechanism that underlies regulatory focus effects. We
 propose that promotion-focus individuals engage in relational elaboration,
 which entails identifying commonalities or abstract relationships among
 disparate items. In contrast, prevention-focus individuals engage in
 item-specific elaboration, which involves focusing on specific attributes
 of each item independent of others. Results support our theorizing by
 demonstrating that promotion-focus (prevention-focus) individuals exhibit
 enhanced performance on tasks that require relational (item-specific)
 elaboration. (c) 2007 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..
