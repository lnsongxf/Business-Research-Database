Title: Threats to Hope: Effects on Reasoning about Product Information 
Abstract:
 Three studies find that when individuals become less confident that what
 they yearn for is possible (i.e., when hope is threatened) they engage in
 motivated reasoning related to products that purport to enable goal
 attainment. Specifically, they (a) selectively search for information from
 a product-favorable information source, (b) regard this information as
 more credible, and (c) are less discriminating of low-credibility message
 arguments. They also (d) require more negative information before they
 feel that they are able to evaluate a product's effectiveness and (e) are
 more likely to judge the product as effective at helping them attain their
 goal. (c) 2007 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: "My" Brand or "Our" Brand: The Effects of Brand Relationship Dimensions and Self-Construal on Brand Evaluations 
Abstract:
 Consumer-brand relationships can be formed based on individual- or
 group-level connections. For example, a consumer's relationship with a
 Mercedes may be based on the desire to express individual-level unique
 identity (e.g., self-concept connection), whereas a relationship with a
 local brand (e.g., Ford) may be based on a group-level patriotic national
 identity (e.g., country-of-origin connection). We suggest that the effects
 of self-concept connection and brand country-of-origin connection vary
 based on self-construal. Results across two studies reveal that, under
 independent self-construal, self-concept connection is more important.
 Under interdependent self-construal, brand country-of-origin connection is
 more important. (c) 2007 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Goal Control of Attention to Advertising: The Yarbus Implication 
Abstract:
 An eye-tracking experiment with four processing goals and a free-viewing
 condition reveals goal control of attention even during a few seconds of
 self-paced ad exposure. An ad-memorization goal enhanced attention to the
 body text, pictorial, and brand design objects. A brand-learning goal
 enhanced attention to the body text but simultaneously inhibited attention
 to the pictorial design. This supports the thesis that ad informativeness
 is goal contingent. Differences in pupillary diameter between ad objects
 but not between processing goals reflect the pupil's role in maintaining
 optimal vision. Implications of the findings for advertising theory and
 avenues for future research are indicated. (c) 2007 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Distortion of Price Discount Perceptions: The Right Digit Effect 
Abstract:
 We use four experiments to examine consumers' processing of comparative
 regular and sale price information in advertisements. Consistent with our
 hypothesized right digit effect, we find that, when consumers view regular
 and sale prices with identical left digits, they perceive larger price
 discounts when the right digits are "small" (i.e., less than 5) than when
 they are "large" (i.e., greater than 5). As a result, they may attribute
 greater value and increased purchase likelihood to higher-priced,
 lower-discounted items. We examine alternate processing explanations for
 this right digit effect, as well as the moderating impact of price
 presentation format. (c) 2007 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Learning from Mixed Feedback: Anticipation of the Future Reduces Appreciation of the Present 
Abstract:
 Consumers can evaluate their past choices by comparing their obtained
 outcome to other possible outcomes. We demonstrate that how people process
 this comparative feedback depends on whether they use it to prepare for
 future decisions. In particular, the anticipation of similar future
 choices increases consumers' sensitivity to comparisons with better
 alternatives and reduces their liking of the chosen option. Our findings
 indicate that forward-looking consumers selectively test the hypothesis
 that their current choice can be improved on and, as a result,
 disproportionately attend to the unfavorable comparisons and fail to
 appreciate the value of their current choice. (c) 2007 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Perceptual Focus Effects in Choice 
Abstract:
 This article examines consumer choice as a function of the perceptual
 similarity of the options in the decision set. In particular, we examine a
 scenario in which a set of options is extended by adding alternatives that
 change its perceptual characteristics, increasing the salience of one of
 the options in the core set. In this context, we document that, contrary
 to normative predictions, perceptual focus can increase the choice share
 of one of the core options, even when the added alternatives are dominated
 by both options in the core set. We further show that the observed effect
 is a function of consumers' mode of information processing and is more
 pronounced in the context of intuitive (System 1) processing than analytic
 (System 2) processing. (c) 2007 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Where Consumers Diverge from Others: Identity Signaling and Product Domains 
Abstract:
 We propose that consumers often make choices that diverge from those of
 others to ensure that they effectively communicate desired identities.
 Consistent with this identity-signaling perspective, four studies
 illustrate that consumers are more likely to diverge from majorities, or
 members of other social groups, in product domains that are seen as
 symbolic of identity (e.g., music or hairstyles, rather than backpacks or
 stereos). In identity domains, participants avoided options preferred by
 majorities and abandoned preferences shared with majorities. The social
 group associated with a product influenced choice more in identity domains
 and when a given product was framed as identity relevant. People diverge,
 in part, to avoid communicating undesired identities. (c) 2007 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Immediate and Delayed Emotional Consequences of Indulgence: The Moderating Influence of Personality Type on Mixed Emotions 
Abstract:
 The majority of literature looking at self-control dilemmas has focused on
 short-term positive and long-term negative affective outcomes arising from
 indulgence. In two studies, we find evidence for more complex emotional
 responses after indulgent consumption. We show that consumers feel
 simultaneous mixtures of both positive and negative emotions in response
 to indulgences and that the specific components of those emotional
 mixtures vary, depending on differences in individual impulsivity.
 Further, these mixtures are resolved differently over time, leading to
 differences in subsequent choices. In addition we show that more prudent
 consumers are likely to seize an opportunity to get rid of, or "launder,"
 their negative emotions after an indulgence by subsequently making
 utilitarian versus hedonic choices. (c) 2007 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: The Influence of Ceiling Height: The Effect of Priming on the Type of Processing That People Use 
Abstract:
 This article demonstrates that variations in ceiling height can prime
 concepts that, in turn, affect how consumers process information. We
 theorized that when reasonably salient, a high versus low ceiling can
 prime the concepts of freedom versus confinement, respectively. These
 concepts, in turn, can prompt consumers' use of predominately relational
 versus item-specific processing. Three studies found support for this
 theorizing. On a variety of measures, ceiling height-induced relational or
 item-specific processing was indicated by people's reliance on integrated
 and abstract versus discrete and concrete ideation. Hence, this research
 sheds light on when and how ceiling height can affect consumers'
 responses. (c) 2007 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Compromise and Attraction Effects under Prevention and Promotion Motivations 
Abstract:
 This article examines the influence of consumers' motivational
 orientations on their susceptibilities to context effects.
 Prevention-focused consumers were found to be more sensitive to the
 compromise effect and less sensitive to the attraction effect than
 promotion-focused consumers. In addition, the effects of promotion and
 prevention motivations were amplified when consumers were asked to justify
 their choices. Finally, we found that products associated with a
 prevention concern are more attractive when presented as compromise than
 asymmetrically dominant options, whereas products associated with a
 promotion concern are more attractive when presented as asymmetrically
 dominant options than compromise options. (c) 2007 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Relaxing Measurement Invariance in Cross-National Consumer Research Using a Hierarchical IRT Model 
Abstract:
 With the growing interest of consumer researchers to test measures and
 theories in an international context, the cross-national invariance of
 measurement instruments has become an important issue. At least two issues
 still need to be addressed. First, the ordinal nature of the rating scale
 is ignored. Second, when few or no items in the confirmatory factor
 analysis (CFA) exhibit metric and scalar invariance across all countries,
 comparison of results across countries is difficult. We solve these
 problems using a hierarchical IRT model. An empirical application is
 provided for susceptibility to normative influence, using a sample of
 5,484 respondents from 11 countries on four continents. (c) 2007 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Countervailing Market Responses to Corporate Co-optation and the Ideological Recruitment of Consumption Communities 
Abstract:
 From a conventional theoretical standpoint, the corporatization of the
 organic food movement is an example of co-optation. Co-optation theory
 conceptualizes the commercial marketplace as an ideological force that
 assimilates the symbols and practices of a counterculture into dominant
 norms. Our alternative argument is that co-optation can generate a
 countervailing market response that actively promotes the oppositional
 aspects of a counterculture attenuated by the process of commercial
 mainstreaming. To develop this theoretical argument, we analyze
 community-supported agriculture, which has emerged in response to the
 corporate co-optation of the organic food movement. We conclude by
 discussing how tacit political ideologies structure consumption
 communities. (c) 2007 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..
