Title: When Two Plus Two Is Not Equal to Four: Errors in Processing Multiple Percentage Changes 
Abstract:
 When evaluating the net impact of a series of percentage changes, we
 predict that consumers may employ a "whole number" computational strategy
 that yields a systematic error in their calculation. We report on three
 studies conducted to examine this issue. In the first study we identify
 the computational error and demonstrate its consequences. In a second
 study, we identify several theoretically driven boundary conditions for
 the observed phenomenon. Finally we demonstrate in a real-world retail
 setting that, consistent with our premise, sequential percentage discounts
 generate more purchasers, sales, revenue, and profit than the economically
 equivalent single percentage discount. (c) 2007 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: The Role of the Need for Cognitive Closure in the Effectiveness of the Disrupt-Then-Reframe Influence Technique 
Abstract:
 The disrupt-then-reframe (DTR) influence technique involves confusing
 consumers with a disruptive message and then reducing ambiguity by
 reframing the message. Experiment 1 shows that the DTR technique increases
 retail sales in a supermarket setting. Experiment 2 shows that the DTR
 technique increases the willingness to pay to join a student interest
 group. Experiment 3 shows that the DTR technique increases student support
 for a tuition increase. The results also show that the DTR effect
 increases as the need for closure increases and that disruption motivates
 consumers to embrace a reframed message that facilitates closure by
 reducing ambiguity. (c) 2007 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Writing with Pictures: Toward a Unifying Theory of Consumer Response to Images 
Abstract:
 Studies of response to advertising images follow parallel streams: one
 treats visuals as sensory data; the other, operating under rhetorical
 theory, presumes that images are communicative artifacts. By revisiting a
 seminal article by Mitchell and Olson, we empirically demonstrate an
 alternative explanation for results under the sensory approach, while also
 establishing the basis for complex statements like tropes. We argue that
 consumers read product attributes from pictures based on an emergent
 writing system made possible by recent communication technologies. Our
 theory is consistent with the historical record of communication
 technology and with the trajectory of research in fields that study
 writing systems. (c) 2007 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Phonetic Symbolism and Brand Name Preference 
Abstract:
 Two experiments investigated the effects of phonetic symbolism on brand
 name preference. Participants indicated preference for fictitious brand
 names for particular products (or for products with particular attributes)
 from word pairs that differed only on vowel sound (e.g., front vs. back
 vowels, or vowel sounds associated with positive vs. negative concepts).
 Participants preferred brand names more when the attributes connoted by
 the vowel sounds (e.g., small, sharp) were positive for a product category
 (e.g., convertible, knife), but they preferred the same names less when
 the attributes connoted were negative for a product category (e.g., sport
 utility vehicle, hammer). However, words with negative vowel sounds were
 least preferred regardless of product category or attribute. (c) 2007 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: On the Consumption of Negative Feelings 
Abstract:
 How can the hedonistic assumption (i.e., people's willingness to pursue
 pleasure and avoid pain) be reconciled with people choosing to expose
 themselves to experiences known to elicit negative feelings? We assess how
 (1) the intensity of the negative feelings, (2) positive feelings in the
 aftermath, and (3) the coactivation of positive and negative feelings
 contribute to our understanding of such behavior. In a series of four
 studies, consumers with either approach or avoidance tendencies (toward
 horror movies) were asked to report their positive and/or negative
 feelings either after (experiment 1) or while (experiments 2, 3A, and 3B)
 they were exposed to a horror movie. We demonstrate how a model
 incorporating coactivation principles and enriched with a protective frame
 moderator (via detachment) can provide a more parsimonious and viable
 description of the affective reactions that result from counterhedonic
 behavior. (c) 2007 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: The Biasing Health Halos of Fast-Food Restaurant Health Claims: Lower Calorie Estimates and Higher Side-Dish Consumption Intentions 
Abstract:
 Why is America a land of low-calorie food claims yet high-calorie food
 intake? Four studies show that people are more likely to underestimate the
 caloric content of main dishes and to choose higher-calorie side dishes,
 drinks, or desserts when fast-food restaurants claim to be healthy (e.g.,
 Subway) compared to when they do not (e.g., McDonald's). We also find that
 the effect of these health halos can be eliminated by simply asking people
 to consider whether the opposite of such health claims may be true. These
 studies help explain why the success of fast-food restaurants serving
 lower-calorie foods has not led to the expected reduction in total calorie
 intake and in obesity rates. They also suggest innovative strategies for
 consumers, marketers, and policy makers searching for ways to fight
 obesity. (c) 2007 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Anticipated Group Interaction: Coping with Valence Asymmetries in Attitude Shift 
Abstract:
 Many consumer decisions are influenced by social interactions with other
 consumers. This research proposes that negative group information induces
 asymmetric effects on individual attitudes toward a product, depending on
 anticipated group interaction as a moderating variable. More specifically,
 negative group information is expected to induce more attitude change on
 consumers who hold positive attitudes. However, an opposite pattern of
 results is predicted when consumers anticipate discussing their product
 attitude with a group. Namely, negative group information should stimulate
 more attitude change on consumers who hold negative attitudes. In two
 experiments, we show reliable support for this interaction between
 individual attitude valence, group attitude valence, and anticipated group
 interaction. We also provide evidence in support of the theoretically
 predicted mechanism responsible for these effects. Implications for the
 emerging consumer literatures on valence asymmetry and anticipated group
 interaction are discussed. (c) 2007 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Wanting a Bit(e) of Everything: Extending the Valuation Effect to Variety Seeking 
Abstract:
 Markman and Brendl have demonstrated that individuals tend to regard as
 more valuable those objects that are able to satisfy an active desire.
 Building on their framework, we predicted that desire would enlarge the
 consideration set and, hence, affect variety-seeking tendencies in a
 product category. Our first study shows that hunger and visual food cues
 enhance variety seeking in food items. Further, by means of mediation
 analyses and a suppression manipulation (exposing participants to stale
 foods), we are able to show that this increase in variety-seeking results
 from an increased attractiveness in the food items. Our second study,
 where we generalize these findings by applying them to nonphysiological
 goals, produces evidence that the effect-the increase in variety
 seeking-is domain specific. (c) 2007 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: On the Psychology of Loss Aversion: Possession, Valence, and Reversals of the Endowment Effect 
Abstract:
 Loss aversion states that "losses loom larger than gains." We consider two
 types of loss aversion defined by two interpretations of loss. A loss can
 be defined (1) in terms of valence or (2) in terms of possession.
 Correspondingly, valence loss aversion (VLA) entails greater sensitivity
 to negative (vs. positive) changes, and possession loss aversion (PLA)
 entails greater sensitivity to items leaving (vs. entering) one's
 possession. Both types of loss aversion imply an endowment effect for
 attractive items, but PLA implies a reversal of the endowment effect for
 unattractive items. Experimental results show endowment effect reversals
 consistent with PLA. (c) 2007 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: The Duration Heuristic 
Abstract:
 The duration heuristic refers to the tendency to evaluate services based
 on their duration rather than on their content. We propose that consumers
 rely on the duration heuristic because it simplifies the evaluation
 process. In particular, the duration heuristic is most likely to be seen
 when the duration of the service experience is evaluable relative to other
 features and when duration is considered in relation to price. Across four
 experiments and a field study, we (a) provide demonstrations of the
 duration heuristic, (b) illustrate the biases that result as a consequence
 of its use, and (c) identify conditions under which consumers are more
 likely to use the heuristic. (c) 2007 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Taste versus the Market: An Extension of Research on the Consumption of Popular Culture 
Abstract:
 Previous studies of cultural consumption have found a significant but weak
 relationship between expert judgment (EJ) and popular appeal (PA) and have
 suggested that this "little taste" phenomenon reflects a mediating role
 played by ordinary evaluation (OE) in diluting the association between EJ
 and PA. However, various weaknesses in this work have involved problems
 with sequential timing, nonindependence of measurements, and contamination
 by market(ing)-related influences. The present investigation of new data
 on motion pictures addresses these concerns to show that, when controlling
 for market success, consumers display aspects of "good taste" via indirect
 links from EJ to OE to PA. (c) 2007 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: When the Same Prime Leads to Different Effects 
Abstract:
 Research on priming effects has shown that primes with widely shared
 associations (i.e., stereotypes) affect the subsequent behavior of people
 in consistent ways (i.e., acting stereotypically). In this article, we
 present two experiments that show that the same primed construct can have
 different effects on the subsequent choices of different groups of people.
 These differences in effects are attributable to the groups having
 different prime associations. These results highlight the importance of
 understanding unique, personal associations to primes and suggest that
 segmentation is also important for predicting nonconsciously influenced
 choices. (c) 2007 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..
