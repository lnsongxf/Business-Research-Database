Title: The Effect of Mind-Sets on Consumer Decision Strategies 
Abstract:
 When consumers consider their preference for one of a set of products
 without having decided whether or not they want to buy something, they
 develop a "which-to-buy" mind-set that increases their likelihood of
 making a purchase both in the situation at hand and in subsequent
 unrelated situations. The effect of this mind-set is evident regardless of
 the commonality of the alternatives' features and regardless of whether or
 not the purchase decision is revocable. The mind-set that is induced by
 stating preferences in one situation influences the thoughts that people
 generate in response to other unrelated situations they encounter
 subsequently and consequently affects their actual purchase behavior in
 these situations. (c) 2007 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Growing up in a Material World: Age Differences in Materialism in Children and Adolescents 
Abstract:
 We examine age differences in materialism with children and adolescents
 8-18 years old. In study 1, we find materialism increases from middle
 childhood to early adolescence and declines from early to late
 adolescence. Further, we find that age differences are mediated by changes
 in self-esteem occurring from middle childhood through adolescence. In
 study 2, we prime self-esteem to obtain further evidence of a causal link
 between self-esteem and materialism. As expected, we find that inducing
 high self-esteem decreases expressions of materialism. Inducing high
 self-esteem reduces materialism among adolescents so dramatically that age
 differences in materialism disappear. (c) 2007 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Influentials, Networks, and Public Opinion Formation 
Abstract:
 A central idea in marketing and diffusion research is that influentials-a
 minority of individuals who influence an exceptional number of their
 peers-are important to the formation of public opinion. Here we examine
 this idea, which we call the "influentials hypothesis," using a series of
 computer simulations of interpersonal influence processes. Under most
 conditions that we consider, we find that large cascades of influence are
 driven not by influentials but by a critical mass of easily influenced
 individuals. Although our results do not exclude the possibility that
 influentials can be important, they suggest that the influentials
 hypothesis requires more careful specification and testing than it has
 received. (c) 2007 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Consumer Responses to Performance Failures by High-Equity Brands 
Abstract:
 Two experiments explore conditions that mitigate negative customer
 reactions to high-equity brand failures. Results indicate that such brands
 fare best when responses are timed immediately after the failure and when
 the failure is severe or there is substantial distraction present in the
 environment. When any of these conditions are absent, high-equity brand
 evaluations appear to be adversely affected by a performance lapse.
 Implications, particularly for service brands, are discussed. (c) 2007 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Pursuing Parenthood: Integrating Cultural and Cognitive Perspectives on Persistent Goal Striving 
Abstract:
 This article argues that a fuller understanding of consumer persistence,
 or repeated attempts to achieve goals, is necessary and can be achieved by
 adopting an interdisciplinary perspective and integrating cultural and
 cognitive perspectives on consumer phenomena. Developing insights by
 examining experiences of informants pursuing parenthood using assisted
 reproductive technologies, we build on Bagozzi and Dholakia's (<xref
 ref-type="bibr" rid="rf3">1999</xref>) model of goal striving to explore
 how cultural discourses inform consumers' cognitions. We analyze how both
 life-project framing discourses and culturally pervasive discourses affect
 consumers and demonstrate that a cultural perspective is a vital
 complement to cognitive models of persistence. (c) 2007 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: How Enjoyable Was It? Remembering an Affective Reaction to a Previous Consumption Experience 
Abstract:
 Consumers use affective reactions from previous exposure to experiences in
 decision making. However, other affective reactions derived from
 postexperience information (i.e., advertising) may interfere with the
 retrieval of experience-based reactions. The results of three experiments
 show that when postexperience affective reactions interfere with the
 retrieval of an experience-based reaction, consumers use postexperience
 behavior as a proxy for their liking of the experience. The use of
 postexperience behavior occurs even when the behavior is nondiagnostic.
 The results also indicate that participants are not consciously aware of
 the interfering effect of postexperience affective reactions or of their
 reliance on postexperience behavior when constructing memory. (c) 2007 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Unfixed Resources: Perceived Costs, Consumption, and the Accessible Account Effect 
Abstract:
 Consumption depletes one's available resources, but consumers may be
 unaware of the total resources available for consumption and, therefore,
 be influenced by the temporary accessibility of resource accounts.
 Consistent with this possibility, consumers in four experiments perceived
 a unit of consumption to be smaller and consequently consumed more, when
 large resource accounts of money, calories, or time (e.g., the money in
 their savings account) were made temporarily accessible compared with when
 small resource accounts were made temporarily accessible (e.g., the money
 in their wallet). Manipulating the cognitive accessibility of resources
 available for consumption influences both subjective judgment and
 behavior. (c) 2007 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: When Thinking Beats Doing: The Role of Optimistic Expectations in Goal-Based Choice 
Abstract:
 We propose that, in the pursuit of ongoing goals, optimistic expectations
 of future goal pursuit have greater impact on immediate actions than do
 less optimistic considerations, such as retrospections on past goal
 pursuit or less optimistic expectations. Further, we propose that the
 direction of the impact is determined by the framing of goal pursuit: it
 motivates goal-congruent actions when goal pursuit is framed as commitment
 to the goal but motivates goal-incongruent actions when the pursuit is
 framed as progress toward the goal. Four studies provided consistent
 support for the proposed hypothesis. (c) 2007 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Are All Out-Groups Created Equal? Consumer Identity and Dissociative Influence 
Abstract:
 Past research finds that consumers exhibit weak self-brand connections to
 brands associated with out-groups. We extend this work by demonstrating
 that products associated with dissociative reference groups have a greater
 impact on consumers' negative self-brand connections, product evaluations,
 and choices than do products associated with out-groups more generally. In
 addition, both situational priming and chronic identification with one's
 in-group moderate the avoidance of products associated with dissociative
 reference groups. Further, we demonstrate the conditions under which
 dissociative influence does not occur and discuss the implications of the
 research. (c) 2007 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Consuming with Others: Social Influences on Moment-to-Moment and Retrospective Evaluations of an Experience 
Abstract:
 Two studies examine differences in participants' moment-to-moment and
 retrospective evaluations of an experience depending on whether they are
 alone or in the presence of another person. Findings support our
 hypotheses that joint consumption leads to similar patterns or "coherence"
 in moment-to-moment evaluations and that greater coherence leads to more
 positive retrospective evaluations. We trace the emergence of coherence to
 processes of mimicry and emotional contagion in experiment 1 by comparing
 evaluations for pairs of participants who could see each other's
 expression with pairs who could not do so and in experiment 2 by coding
 participants' facial expressions and head movements for direct evidence of
 contagion. (c) 2007 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Is That Car Smiling at Me? Schema Congruity as a Basis for Evaluating Anthropomorphized Products 
Abstract:
 The present research proposes schema congruity as a theoretical basis for
 examining the effectiveness and consequences of product anthropomorphism.
 Results of two studies suggest that the ability of consumers to
 anthropomorphize a product and their consequent evaluation of that product
 depend on the extent to which that product is endowed with characteristics
 congruent with the proposed human schema. Furthermore, consumers'
 perception of the product as human mediates the influence of feature type
 on product evaluation. Results of a third study, however, show that the
 affective tag attached to the specific human schema moderates the
 evaluation but not the successful anthropomorphizing of the product. (c) 2007 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Is There a Substitute for Direct Experience? Comparing Consumers' Preferences after Direct and Indirect Product Experiences 
Abstract:
 We show that direct product experiences (e.g., product trials) and
 indirect product experiences (e.g., reading a product description) result
 in different levels of mental construal and product preferences. Study 1
 demonstrates that increasing experiential contact with a product triggers
 more concrete mental construal and increases preferences for products that
 are easy to use relative to those that are more desirable but difficult to
 use. Studies 2 and 3 show that the effect of product experience can be
 attenuated by encouraging consumers to think concretely prior to product
 exposure and by asking consumers to choose products for others instead of
 themselves. (c) 2007 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..
