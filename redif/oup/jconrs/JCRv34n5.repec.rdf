Title: How Does Drug and Supplement Marketing Affect a Healthy Lifestyle? 
Abstract:
 This research investigates consumer reactions to the marketing of drugs
 and supplements and the consequences for a healthy lifestyle. A series of
 experiments provides evidence that drug marketing undermines intentions to
 engage in health-protective behaviors (i.e., a boomerang effect). The
 boomerang arises from two psychological mechanisms: (1) drugs reduce risk
 perceptions and perceived importance of, and motivation to engage in,
 complementary health-protective behaviors, and (2) drugs are associated
 with poor health that reduces self-efficacy and perceived ability to
 engage in complementary health-protective behaviors. A combined
 intervention accompanying a drug remedy that targets both motivation and
 ability mitigates the drug boomerang on a healthy lifestyle. (c) 2008 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Order of Entry and the Moderating Role of Comparison Brands in Brand Extension Evaluation 
Abstract:
 The current research proposes that order of entry moderates the impact of
 fit on brand extension evaluation. We conceptualize a model in which new
 brands enter the market dynamically, driving consumers to engage in
 differential processing as a function of pioneer and follower evaluation
 scenarios. We posit that consumers rely on singular evaluative processing
 in pioneer contexts and comparative evaluation in follower contexts,
 producing unique moderating effects based on the existence of comparison
 brands. Experimental results indicate that follower brands can actually
 benefit from comparison with pioneering brands that have a relatively
 lower fit with the extension category. (c) 2008 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Procedural Priming and Consumer Judgments: Effects on the Impact of Positively and Negatively Valenced Information 
Abstract:
 The cognitive procedure that people use to search for information about a
 product is influenced by the ease with which it comes to mind. Unrelated
 experiences can activate a search process that governs the order in which
 favorable and unfavorable product descriptions are identified and the
 evaluations that are made on the basis of them. Five experiments examined
 the conditions in which these effects occur. The effects of priming a
 search strategy on the attention to positively or negatively valenced
 information are diametrically opposite to the effects of the semantic
 (e.g., attribute) concepts that are called to mind in the course of
 activating this strategy. (c) 2008 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Be Fit and Be Strong: Mastering Self-Regulation through Regulatory Fit 
Abstract:
 This research examines the effect of regulatory fit on self-regulation.
 People experience regulatory fit when their strategy of goal pursuit fits
 (vs. conflicts) with their regulatory focus. Four experiments provide
 support for the hypothesis that regulatory fit improves whereas regulatory
 nonfit impairs self-regulatory performance. These results were obtained
 across multiple self-regulatory tasks that included a handgrip exercise to
 test physical endurance (experiment 1), a choice between a healthy and a
 decadent snack to test willpower in the face of temptation (experiments 2
 and 3), and a health-related compliance decision to demonstrate
 self-regulation (experiment 4). Intensified motivation seems to be the
 mechanism underlying the regulatory fit effect. (c) 2008 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Mood and Comparative Judgment: Does Mood Influence Everything and Finally Nothing? 
Abstract:
 Research indicates that mood can influence evaluation of a product when
 considered in isolation. However, little is known about its influence on
 comparisons among several alternatives. Four experiments assessed the
 nature of this influence. When evaluating each option individually upon
 encountering it, happy participants reported greater preferences for the
 first encountered option than unhappy participants. When withholding
 evaluations until having seen all options, however, happy participants
 reported greater preferences for the last encountered option than unhappy
 participants. Which comparison strategy was employed, and consequently the
 impact of mood on preferences, depended on the similarity of choice
 alternatives in terms of appearance versus descriptive features. (c) 2008 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Reducing Satiation: The Role of Categorization Level 
Abstract:
 People usually like experiences less as they repeat them: they satiate.
 This research finds that people satiate less if they categorize the
 consumption episodes at lower levels. For instance, as people ate more
 jelly beans, their enjoyment declined less quickly when the candy was
 categorized specifically (e.g., cherry, orange) rather than generally
 (e.g., jelly bean). Three studies demonstrate this "specificity effect"
 for people's ratings of enjoyment both during and immediately after
 consumption. Process evidence shows that subcategorization focuses
 people's attention on differentiating aspects, making the episodes seem
 less repetitive and consequently less satiating. (c) 2008 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Consumer Wait Management Strategies for Negative Service Events: A Coping Approach 
Abstract:
 In negative service environments, waiting time can serve to facilitate
 consumer coping. Consequently, the very wait management strategies (such
 as providing duration information or shortening the wait) that mitigate
 wait-based stress for nonnegative services may interfere with consumers'
 efforts to cope with an upcoming negative event. We show that the
 effectiveness of wait management strategies is moderated by event valence
 and, further, by the individual's coping orientation. Shortened wait times
 lead to increased stress for those using approach-oriented strategies
 (compared to avoidance), and duration information leads to increased
 stress for those using avoidance-oriented strategies. (c) 2008 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: The Cultural Construction of Risk Understandings through Illness Narratives 
Abstract:
 A study of breast cancer screening and treatment decisions suggests that
 risk understandings are influenced by the dominant illness narrative of
 restitution within Anglo-Western cultures. Restitution stories reflect the
 cultural values of personal responsibility and control in combating
 disease and returning to a life of normalcy. In the context of breast
 cancer, individuals seek restitution by following the dictums of
 biomedicine, which promotes early detection as prevention, aggressive
 treatment as cure, and reconstructive surgery as concealment. Our findings
 suggest that these risk understandings contribute to the consumption of
 health-care interventions that exceeds medical guidelines in this country. (c) 2008 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Fact or Fiction: An Investigation of Empathy Differences in Response to Emotional Melodramatic Entertainment 
Abstract:
 Three studies investigate the influence of empathy and the level of
 fictionality of short stories on consumers' evaluations of emotional
 melodramatic entertainment. We find that high empathizers' evaluations are
 more favorable when the story is low in fictionality (i.e., real) versus
 high. In contrast, low empathizers' evaluations do not differ, regardless
 of the level of fictionality, except when these individuals (i.e., males)
 are provided with an excuse to become involved in the story; in this case
 a story that is high (i.e., make-believe) as opposed to low in
 fictionality is evaluated more favorably. Finally, transportation (i.e.,
 absorption into a narrative) with the story is found to both moderate and
 mediate the effects. (c) 2008 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Reconstructing the South: How Commercial Myths Compete for Identity Value through the Ideological Shaping of Popular Memories and Countermemories 
Abstract:
 This study explicates the coconstitutive relationships between commercial
 mythmaking and popular memory that arise through myth market competitions
 for identity value. We develop a genealogical analysis of the
 representational strategies and ideological rationales that two prominent
 New South mythmakers use to shape popular memories in relation to their
 competitive goals and to efface countermemories that contradict their
 mythologized representations. We then derive a conceptual model that
 highlights competitive, historical, and ideological influences on
 commercial mythmaking and their transformative effects on popular memory,
 which have not been addressed by prior theorizations of the meaning
 transfer process. (c) 2008 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: The Effects of Appetitive Stimuli on Out-of-Domain Consumption Impatience 
Abstract:
 Earlier work in consumer research has documented the effect of appetitive
 stimuli (e.g., chocolate cookies) on a related consumption domain (e.g.,
 eating). We argue that appetitive stimuli can lead to a change in temporal
 orientation and affect subsequent consumption impatience across domains.
 In a series of experiments, we find that consumers exposed to appetitive
 stimuli are more present oriented, more likely to choose smaller-sooner
 rewards or vice options, and more likely to make unplanned purchase
 decisions. (c) 2008 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Time Will Tell: The Distant Appeal of Promotion and Imminent Appeal of Prevention 
Abstract:
 What types of products are preferred when the purchase is immediate versus
 off in the distant future? Three experiments address this question by
 examining the influence of temporal perspective on evaluations of
 regulatory-framed products. The results reveal that when a purchase is
 about to be made, consumers prefer prevention- (vs. promotion-) framed
 products-an effect that is driven by the pain anticipated from potentially
 failing one's looming purchasing goal. When a purchase is temporally
 distant, however, promotion- (vs. prevention-) framed products become more
 appealing-an effect that is driven by the anticipated pleasure from
 achieving one's distant purchasing goal. Implications for the psychology
 of self-regulation, anticipated affect, and willpower are discussed. (c) 2008 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Attribute Conflict in Consumer Decision Making: The Role of Task Compatibility 
Abstract:
 Past research holds that a decision between two unattractive alternatives
 is more difficult than one between two attractive alternatives. We argue
 that this conclusion may rest on the the task of "choosing" adopted in the
 past research. A task of choosing requires an attractiveness judgment that
 is compatible with attractive alternatives but incompatible with
 unattractive alternatives. We test this thesis by reversing the
 compatibility using a reject task that requires judgment of
 unattractiveness. Two studies find that compatibility between alternative
 valence and task influences decision time, decision difficulty, attribute
 recall, and effort, underscoring the role of the task in the study of
 attribute conflict. (c) 2008 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..
