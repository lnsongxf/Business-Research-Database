Title: How I Decide Depends on What I Spend: Use of Heuristics Is Greater for Time than for Money 
Abstract:
 We demonstrate that decision making is more heuristic in situations that
 involve spending time rather than money. Relative to participants in the
 money condition, those in the time condition show a higher propensity to
 choose a compromise option (experiment 1) and to rely on an arbitrary
 anchor (experiment 2). We propose that such heuristics are used more for
 time because, compared to monetary expenditures, temporal expenditures are
 harder to account for. Consistent with this proposition, when participants
 in both time and money conditions are primed to account for their
 expenditures, they no longer differ in their use of heuristics. The
 associated response times offer additional process evidence (experiment
 3). (c) 2008 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Tightwads and Spendthrifts 
Abstract:
 Consumers often behave differently than they would ideally like to behave.
 We propose that an anticipatory pain of paying drives "tightwads" to spend
 less than they would ideally like to spend. "Spendthrifts," by contrast,
 experience too little pain of paying and typically spend more than they
 would ideally like to spend. This article introduces and validates the
 "spendthrift-tightwad" scale, a measure of individual differences in the
 pain of paying. Spending differences between tightwads and spendthrifts
 are greatest in situations that amplify the pain of paying and smallest in
 situations that diminish the pain of paying. (c) 2007 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Of Frog Wines and Frowning Watches: Semantic Priming, Perceptual Fluency, and Brand Evaluation 
Abstract:
 Three experiments show that semantic primes can enhance perceptual
 fluency, resulting in higher liking of the perceived product.
 Specifically, semantic primes that cue the visual identifier of one of two
 products (e.g., a bottle of wine with a frog shown on the label) increase
 preference of the prime-compatible target over another target (e.g., a
 wine without a frog on the label). This is observed even when exposure to
 the target is limited to levels associated with perceptual encoding of the
 target (experiment 1). Semantic priming of constructs compatible with
 perceptual features of the target increases liking of the target
 (experiments 2 and 3), and increased liking of the target is mediated by
 the target's increased visual appeal (experiment 3). (c) 2007 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Confirmation and the Effects of Valenced Political Advertising: A Field Experiment 
Abstract:
 There are ongoing questions in the literature and in the field about why,
 in spite of voter dislike, negative advertising continues to get
 widespread usage in politics. In a field experiment that assessed
 responses to actual ads shortly before the 2004 U.S. presidential
 election, we found that negative advertising produced more critical
 responses than positive advertising even for the voters' favored
 candidate. Yet, our findings suggest that the effects of negative
 advertising are multidimensional; four different effects-reinforcement,
 backlash, defensive reactance, and position change-were identified. We
 discuss the costs and potential returns from these effects and the
 limitations of this study, and we propose directions for future research. (c) 2007 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Context Effects in Diverse-Category Brand Environments: The Influence of Target Product Positioning and Consumers' Processing Mind-Set 
Abstract:
 We investigate the apparent rarity of contrast effects in diverse-category
 contextual and target product settings. Three studies show that the
 direction of context effects depends on (a) whether target product
 positioning is abstract or concrete, (b) consumers' adoption of an
 item-specific, similarity-focused relational or dissimilarity-focused
 relational processing mind-set, and (c) the magnitude of resources
 allocated to processing. We find that contrast effects emerge when an
 ambiguous target product is positioned concretely, not abstractly, and
 consumers employ relational, not item-specific, processing. A framework
 clarifies how and when each of the aforementioned factors shapes context
 effects, often in ways never before seen. (c) 2007 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Technology/Ideology: How Ideological Fields Influence Consumers' Technology Narratives 
Abstract:
 Through a systematic study of consumer narratives, this article models how
 technology ideologies influence consumer-level thought, speech, and
 action. Applying critical discourse analysis and articulation theory
 approaches, a semiotic square model represents the relations between
 Techtopian, Green Luddite, Work Machine, and Techspressive ideological
 elements in an ideological field. The narratives of individual consumers
 move between ideological elements in ways suggested by the model's
 semantic relations. The results reveal novel aspects of consumers' dynamic
 relations to technology ideology and invite further investigations of
 technology and consumption ideology. (c) 2007 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Does Touch Affect Taste? The Perceptual Transfer of Product Container Haptic Cues 
Abstract:
 We develop a conceptual framework regarding the perceptual transfer of
 haptic or touch-related characteristics from product containers to
 judgments of the products themselves. Thus, the firmness of a cup in which
 water is served may affect consumers' judgments of the water itself. This
 framework predicts that not all consumers are equally affected by such
 nondiagnostic haptic cues. Results from four studies show that consumers
 high in the autotelic need for touch (general liking for haptic input) are
 less affected by such nondiagnostic haptic cues compared to consumers low
 in the autotelic need for touch. The research has many implications for
 product and package design. (c) 2007 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Protection of Prior Learning in Complex Consumer Learning Environments 
Abstract:
 As a product category evolves, consumers have the opportunity to learn a
 series of feature-benefit associations. Initially, consumers learn that
 some features predict a critical benefit, whereas other features do not.
 Subsequently, consumers have the opportunity to assess if previously
 predictive features, or novel features, predict new product benefits.
 Surprisingly, later learning is characterized by attenuated learning about
 previously predictive features relative to novel features. This tendency
 to ignore previously predictive features is consistent with a desire to
 protect prior learning. (c) 2007 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: The Effect of Temporal Frame on Information Considered in New Product Evaluation: The Role of Uncertainty 
Abstract:
 Three experiments explore how presenting a new product launch as occurring
 in the future versus the past affects the information used to evaluate the
 product. When a launch is described as a future event, marketplace
 conditions and characteristics of the sponsoring company receive
 consideration, and both types of information influence evaluations.
 However, with a past launch, only sponsor information receives
 consideration and guides evaluations (experiments 1 and 2). This temporal
 frame effect is attenuated when certainty is primed, implying that the
 uncertainty associated with the future versus the past motivates more
 comprehensive use of available information in the future (experiment 3). (c) 2008 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Conflict and Compromise: Drama in Marketplace Evolution 
Abstract:
 How do markets change? Findings from a 7-year longitudinal processual
 investigation of consumer performances in the war on music downloading
 suggest that markets in the cultural creative sphere (those organizing the
 exchange of intellectual goods such as music, movies, software, and the
 written word) evolve through stages of perpetual structural instability.
 Each stage addresses an enduring cultural tension between countervailing
 utilitarian and possessive ideals. Grounded in anthropology and consumer
 behavior, I illustrate this historical dynamic through the process of
 marketplace drama, a fourfold sequence of performed conflict among
 opposing groups of consumers and producers. Implications for theorizing on
 market system dynamics and the consumption of performance are offered. (c) 2007 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Conscious and Nonconscious Components of Superstitious Beliefs in Judgment and Decision Making 
Abstract:
 Despite the large impact that superstitious beliefs have on the
 marketplace, we currently know very little about their implications for
 consumer judgment and decision making. We document the existence of the
 influence of superstitious beliefs on consumer behavior and specify their
 conscious and nonconscious underlying properties. In particular, we show
 that superstitious beliefs have a robust influence on product satisfaction
 and decision making under risk. However, these effects are only observed
 when superstitious beliefs are allowed to work nonconsciously. Using a
 process-dissociation task, we further demonstrate the distinct conscious
 versus nonconscious components of the effect of superstition on decision
 making under risk. (c) 2007 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Social Capital Production in a Virtual P3 Community 
Abstract:
 The purpose of this study is to examine the relational norms that
 determine social capital-an intangible resource embedded in and
 accumulated through a specific social structure. The social structure
 examined in this study is a virtual community created through text-based
 conversations oriented toward peer-to-peer problem solving (P3). Empirical
 results support the conceptualization of social capital as an index
 composed of the normative influences of voluntarism, reciprocity, and
 social trust. Membership length was found to moderate the virtual P3
 community experience. Qualitative analysis of the community dialogue
 provides additional support for the characterization of virtual P3
 activity as community based. (c) 2007 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Of Chameleons and Consumption: The Impact of Mimicry on Choice and Preferences 
Abstract:
 This article investigates the effect of mimicry on consumer product
 consumption and appraisal. We propose and test two paths via which mimicry
 may influence product preferences. In the mimicking consumer path, we
 suggest that individuals automatically mimic the consumption behaviors of
 other people and that such mimicry then affects preferences toward the
 product(s) consumed. In the mimicked consumer path, we argue that being
 mimicked leads to increased prosociality, which affects preferences for
 products presented in dyadic interactions. Three studies confirm the two
 paths and suggest that mimicry can indeed influence product preferences. (c) 2007 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..
