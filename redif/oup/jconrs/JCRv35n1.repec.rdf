Title: Surcharges and Seller Reputation 
Abstract:
 We propose that consumers buying from low- (vs. high-) reputation sellers
 pay greater attention to surcharges. Thus, reputation moderates the effect
 of surcharges on purchase. Data from eBay show that consumers adjust bids
 to account for surcharges when buying from low-reputation sellers but not
 when buying from high-reputation sellers (study 1). Study 2 replicates
 this effect with partitioned versus consolidated prices. Study 3 reveals
 that consumers take longer to make purchasing decisions when buying from
 low-reputation sellers and that response times mediate the moderating role
 of reputation. Furthermore, the effect of surcharges levied by
 low-reputation sellers is attenuated for consumers with low (vs. high)
 need for cognition (study 4). (c) 2008 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Estimating Multiple Consumer Segment Ideal Points from Context-Dependent Survey Data 
Abstract:
 Previous research in marketing and consumer research has shown that
 consumers/households often possess multiple ideal points in a given
 product/service category. In such cases, traditional segmentation and
 positioning models that estimate a single ideal point per
 individual/segment may render an inaccurate portrayal of the true
 underlying utility functions of such consumers/segments and the resulting
 market structure. We propose a new clusterwise multiple-ideal-point
 spatial methodology that estimates multiple ideal points at the market
 segment level while simultaneously determining the market segments'
 composition of consumers, as well as the corresponding joint space. (c) 2008 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Considering the Future: The Conceptualization and Measurement of Elaboration on Potential Outcomes 
Abstract:
 We examine a new construct dealing with individuals' tendency to elaborate
 on potential outcomes, that is, to generate and evaluate potential
 positive and negative consequences of their behaviors. We develop the
 elaboration on potential outcomes (EPO) scale and then investigate its
 relationships with conceptually related traits and its association with
 consumer behaviors such as exercise of self-control, procrastination,
 compulsive buying, credit card debt, retirement investing, and healthy
 lifestyle. Finally, we show that consumers with high EPO levels exhibit
 more effective self-regulation when faced with a choice and that EPO can
 be primed, temporarily improving self-regulation for consumers with low
 EPO levels. (c) 2007 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: What's Not to Like? Preference Asymmetry in the False Consensus Effect 
Abstract:
 Prior research has shown that individuals are often susceptible to a false
 consensus effect, whereby they overestimate the extent to which others
 share their opinions. In three studies, we show that the strength of the
 false consensus effect is moderated by the valence of one's own opinion,
 such that overestimation of population consensus is greater when an
 individual likes an alternative as compared to when she or he dislikes it.
 Further, we show that this moderation of false consensus is driven by the
 availability of countervalence attributes, that is, disliked attributes in
 liked alternatives and liked attributes in disliked alternatives. We
 discuss theoretical and practical implications of these results. (c) 2007 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: The Effect of Making a Prediction about the Outcome of a Consumption Experience on the Enjoyment of That Experience 
Abstract:
 Does predicting the outcome of an uncertain event enhance the enjoyment of
 observing that event? The current popularity of office pools, spoiler
 message boards, and online betting Web sites seems to suggest that the act
 of prediction increases enjoyment. However, in a series of four
 experiments, we find that consumers who make predictions about uncertain
 events enjoy observing those events significantly less than those who do
 not make predictions, despite consumers' expectations to the contrary. We
 explain our results in terms of anticipated regret. In fact, removing the
 source of anticipated regret eliminates the negative effect of prediction
 on enjoyment. (c) 2008 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

 conditioning on mature brands. Explicit attitudes for mature brands were
 unaffected by evaluative conditioning. Experiment 1 showed, however, that
 evaluative conditioning changed implicit attitudes toward Coke and Pepsi.
 This occurred only for participants who initially had no strong preference
 for either brand. Contingency awareness was not necessary to change
 implicit brand attitudes. Experiment 2 showed that brand choice was
 related to the altered implicit attitudes, but only when choice was made
 under cognitive load. Implications of these data for evaluative
 conditioning specifically, and for consumer research in general, are
 considered. (c) 2008 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Consumer Emotional Intelligence: Conceptualization, Measurement, and the Prediction of Consumer Decision Making 
Abstract:
 This research details the development of the Consumer Emotional
 Intelligence Scale (CEIS), which was designed to measure individual
 differences in consumers' ability to use emotional information. Scale
 development procedures confirmed the theoretical structure of the 18-item
 scale. Results supported the scale's reliability and its discriminant and
 nomological validity. Our consumer domain-specific measure predicted food
 choices better than a more domain-general alternative. Furthermore,
 consumer emotional intelligence (EI) predicted food choices beyond
 cognitive knowledge. Finally, consumer EI was found to generalize to
 product-based decision making. Theoretical implications of consumer EI are
 discussed along with areas of future research. (c) 2007 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Counting Every Thought: Implicit Measures of Cognitive Responses to Advertising 
Abstract:
 Our research explores new implicit measures of cognitive responses to
 advertisements that focus on detecting the effects of specific thoughts.
 We first demonstrate that consumers' thoughts about persuasive messages
 can be assessed by both a thought recognition task and a belief
 verification task. We also show that performance on these tasks (i.e.,
 jointly observed responses, reaction times, and confidence ratings) can be
 modeled as Poisson counting processes. Finally, we illustrate the
 effectiveness of these new measures in predicting consumers' product
 attitudes and that these measures can outperform traditional thought
 listing when people are unwilling or unable to report certain thoughts. (c) 2008 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Bikinis Instigate Generalized Impatience in Intertemporal Choice 
Abstract:
 Neuroscientific studies demonstrate that erotic stimuli activate the
 reward circuitry processing monetary and drug rewards. Theoretically, a
 general reward system may give rise to nonspecific effects: exposure to
 "hot stimuli" from one domain may thus affect decisions in a different
 domain. We show that exposure to sexy cues leads to more impatience in
 intertemporal choice between monetary rewards. Highlighting the role of a
 general reward circuitry, we demonstrate that individuals with a sensitive
 reward system are more susceptible to the effect of sex cues, that the
 effect generalizes to nonmonetary rewards, and that satiation attenuates
 the effect. (c) 2008 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: The Perils of Hedonic Editing 
Abstract:
 Retrospective hedonic editing occurs when people combine events to frame a
 previous experience in its most positive light. Although reflecting
 positively on the past has psychological and physiological benefits, it
 may also be used to justify potentially irresponsible behavior. In a
 gambling context the consequences may be perilous. The results of study 1
 show that when they have the opportunity, potentially irresponsible
 gamblers use hedonic editing strategies to reconstruct the past as more
 positive. The more positive memory provides them with evidence to support
 their desired outcome-playing again. The results of studies 2 and 3 reveal
 that the processes underlying hedonic editing include both the temporal
 categorization of positive and negative events and the strategic
 allocation of attention. Study 3 also investigates the independence of
 motivation and opportunity. (c) 2008 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Automatic Effects of Brand Exposure on Motivated Behavior: How Apple Makes You "Think Different" 
Abstract:
 This article first examines whether brand exposure elicits automatic
 behavioral effects as does exposure to social primes. Results support the
 translation of these effects: participants primed with Apple logos behave
 more creatively than IBM primed and controls; Disney-primed participants
 behave more honestly than E!-primed participants and controls. Second,
 this article investigates the hypothesis that exposure to goal-relevant
 brands (i.e., those that represent a positively valenced characteristic)
 elicits behavior that is goal directed in nature. Three experiments
 demonstrate that the primed behavior showed typical goal-directed
 qualities, including increased performance postdelay, decreased
 performance postprogress, and moderation by motivation. (c) 2008 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Family Identity: A Framework of Identity Interplay in Consumption Practices 
Abstract:
 "Being a family" is a vitally important collective enterprise central to
 many consumption experiences and replete with new challenges in
 contemporary society. We advance a framework to learn how families draw on
 communication forms and use marketplace resources to manage interplays
 among individual, relational (e.g., couple, sibling, parent-child), and
 collective identities. Our framework also outlines potential moderators of
 this identity-management process. To demonstrate the value of our
 framework for consumer researchers, we propose numerous research questions
 and offer applications in the areas of family decision making, consumer
 socialization, and person-object relations. (c) 2008 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Babyfaces, Trait Inferences, and Company Evaluations in a Public Relations Crisis 
Abstract:
 We investigate the effects of babyfaceness on the trustworthiness and
 judgments of a company's chief executive officer in a public relations
 crisis. Experiment 1 demonstrates boundary conditions for the
 babyfaceness-honesty trait inference and its influence on company
 evaluations. Experiment 2 shows that trait inferences of honesty are drawn
 spontaneously but are corrected in the presence of situational evidence (a
 severe crisis) if cognitive resources are available. We demonstrate that
 these babyface-trait associations underlie evaluations by reversing the
 babyface effect on judgments in (a) experiment 3, where a priming task
 creates associations counter to the typical babyface-unintentional harm
 stereotype, and (b) experiment 4, which creates a situation where
 innocence is a liability. (c) 2008 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..
