Title: Recalling Mixed Emotions 
Abstract:
 In two longitudinal experiments, conducted both in the field and lab, we
 investigated the recollection of mixed emotions. Results demonstrated that
 the intensity of mixed emotions is generally underestimated at the time of
 recall-an effect that increases over time and does not occur to the same
 degree with unipolar emotions. Of note, the decline in memory of mixed
 emotions is distinct from the pattern found for memory of negative
 emotions, implying that the recall bias is diagnostic of the complexity of
 mixed emotions rather than of any association with negative affect.
 Finally, the memory decay effect was driven by the felt conflict aroused
 by the experience of mixed emotions. (c) 2008 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Politicizing Consumer Culture: Advertising's Appropriation of Political Ideology in China's Social Transition 
Abstract:
 China's ideological transition from a communist country toward a consumer
 society provides an unprecedented context in which to explore the rise of
 consumerism in a contemporary society. We examine how advertising
 appropriates a dominant anticonsumerist political ideology to promote
 consumption within China's social and political transition. We show how
 advertising reconfigures both key political symbolism and communist
 propaganda strategies through a semiotic analysis of advertisements in the
 People's Daily. Our structural framework of ideological transition extends
 Barthes's myth model and examines ideological transition in advertising
 from the macroperspective of political ideology. This framework goes
 beyond the transfer of cultural meanings and can help to explain
 ideological shifts in other societies. (c) 2008 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Designing Discrete Choice Experiments: Do Optimal Designs Come at a Price? 
Abstract:
 In discrete choice experiments, design decisions are crucial for
 determining data quality and costs. While high statistical efficiency
 designs are desirable, they may come at a price if they increase the
 cognitive burden for respondents. We address this problem by designing 44
 experiments that systematically vary numbers of attributes and attribute
 level differences. Our results for two product categories suggest that
 respondents systematically are less consistent in answering choice
 questions as statistical efficiency increases. This relationship holds
 regardless of the number of attributes and is statistically significant
 even if one accommodates preference heterogeneity. Implications for
 practice and future research are discussed. (c) 2008 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Future Preference Uncertainty and Diversification: The Role of Temporal Stochastic Inflation 
Abstract:
 Consumers' choices tend to display greater variety when made for future
 versus immediate consumption. Previous accounts of such diversification
 differences suggested that they are driven primarily by (deterministic)
 shifts in underlying preference. Through a series of simulation studies,
 we propose and assess an alternative contributory mechanism: temporal
 stochastic inflation, the greater uncertainty typifying choices made for
 the future. We find effect sizes to be strongly influenced by relative
 brand attractiveness, brand attractiveness uncertainty, and degree of
 stochastic inflation, although not preference heterogeneity. Moreover,
 effect sizes are consistent with prior studies that attributed
 diversification differences to underlying preference shifts alone. (c) 2008 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Asian Brands and the Shaping of a Transnational Imagined Community 
Abstract:
 We investigate how brand managers create regional Asian brands and show
 how some of them are attempting to forge new webs of interconnectedness
 through the construction of a transnational, imagined Asian world. Some
 branding managers are creating regional brands that emphasize the common
 experience of globalization, evoke a generic, hyper-urban, and
 multicultural experience, and are infused with diverse cultural referents.
 These types of regional Asian brands contribute to the creation of an
 imagined Asia as urban, modern, and multicultural. Understanding this
 process helps one to appreciate the role of branding managers in
 constructing markets and places. (c) 2008 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: The Interactive Effect of Cultural Symbols and Human Values on Taste Evaluation 
Abstract:
 We suggest that consumers assess the taste of a food or beverage by
 comparing the human values symbolized by the product to their human value
 priorities. When there is value-symbol congruency, they experience a
 better taste and aroma and develop a more favorable attitude and behavior
 intention; incongruence has the opposite effect. Participants in two taste
 tests were told the correct identity of a product or misinformed.
 Participants who endorsed the values symbolized by the product (that they
 thought they were tasting) evaluated the product more favorably. The
 implications for marketing strategy, self-congruity theory, and the
 assimilation effect are discussed. (c) 2008 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Choice Set Configuration as a Determinant of Preference Attribution and Strength 
Abstract:
 Despite the growing consensus that consumer preferences are often
 constructed when decisions are made, we still know very little about the
 factors that determine the strength and stability of constructed
 preferences. We propose that the manner in which preferences are formed
 has a significant effect on their strength and stability. In particular,
 we propose that option set configuration, asymmetric dominance versus
 compromise, drives the decision process and whether consumers
 (consciously) focus on the chosen option or the context. This, in turn,
 affects the resulting decision process trace, as reflected in choice
 stability, confidence, and attribution. The results of five studies
 support this proposition. Thus, the strength of constructed preferences is
 a function of choice problem characteristics and the construction process. (c) 2008 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Desire to Acquire: Powerlessness and Compensatory Consumption 
Abstract:
 Three experiments examine how power affects consumers' spending
 propensities. By integrating literatures suggesting that (a) powerlessness
 is aversive, (b) status is one basis of power, and (c) products can signal
 status, the authors argue that low power fosters a desire to acquire
 products associated with status to compensate for lacking power.
 Supporting this compensatory hypothesis, results show that low power
 increased consumers' willingness to pay for auction items and consumers'
 reservation prices in negotiations but only when products were status
 related. The link between powerlessness and compensatory consumption has
 broad implications both for consumers' health and well-being and for
 understanding the psychological state of power. (c) 2008 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: The Sweet Escape: Effects of Mortality Salience on Consumption Quantities for High- and Low-Self-Esteem Consumers 
Abstract:
 This research demonstrates that exposure to death-related stimuli can
 increase consumers' amounts of purchasing and consumption. We demonstrate
 that consumers who have been recently reminded of their own impending
 mortality wish to purchase higher quantities of food products (and
 actually eat higher quantities) than do their control counterparts. This
 effect occurs primarily among low-self-esteem consumers. We explain our
 findings in terms of escape from self-awareness. Low (but not high)
 self-esteem participants overconsume in response to a mortality salience
 activation as a means to escape from self-awareness. We also address
 alternative explanations for these effects. (c) 2008 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: One Individual, Two Identities: Frame Switching among Biculturals 
Abstract:
 Bicultural bilingual individuals have incorporated two cultures within
 themselves and speak the languages of those cultures. When cued by a
 particular language, these individuals activate distinct sets of
 culture-specific concepts, or mental frames, which include aspects of
 their identities. Three studies show that language-triggered frame
 switching (i.e., switching from one set of mental frames to another)
 occurs only with biculturals, not with bilinguals who are not bicultural.
 The studies uncover frame switching at the within-individual level, and
 they include both qualitative and experimental evidence. They also provide
 a methodology to identify the relative activation strength of specific
 mental frames in different languages. (c) 2008 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Will I Spend More in 12 Months or a Year? The Effect of Ease of Estimation and Confidence on Budget Estimates 
Abstract:
 Consumers' budgets are influenced by the temporal frame used for the
 budget period. Budgets planned for the next month are much lower than
 recorded expenses, while those for the next year are closer to recorded
 expenses (study 1). The difficulty of estimating budgets for the next year
 imparts low confidence and leads to upward adjustment. When consumers'
 confidence in their estimates is increased (study 2), when their natural
 beliefs about the relationship between cognitive ease and accuracy are
 reversed (study 3), or when cognitive resources are constrained (study 4),
 consumers no longer adjust their budgets upward for the next year. (c) 2008 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: The Effect of Self-Construal on Spatial Judgments 
Abstract:
 Much prior literature has focused on the effect of self-construal on
 social judgment. We highlight the role of self-construal in spatial
 judgments. We show that individuals with independent (vs. interdependent)
 self-construals are more prone to spatial judgment biases in tasks in
 which the context needs to be included in processing; they are less prone
 to spatial judgment biases in tasks in which the context needs to be
 excluded in processing. We show such spatial judgment effects when
 self-construal is operationalized by different cultures (study 1) and as a
 construct that shifts with situational primes (studies 2 and 3). (c) 2008 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Nonconscious Goals and Consumer Choice 
Abstract:
 This work examines the process through which thrift versus prestige goals
 can nonconsciously affect decisions in a choice task. Drawing upon
 research on nonconscious goal pursuit, we present a theoretical framework
 detailing how consumer choices are affected by incidentally activated
 goals. We show that such primed goals have motivational properties
 consistent with goal pursuit but inconsistent with mere cognitive
 activation; the effects are greater with a longer time interval between
 the priming task and the choice and are less pronounced when the primed
 goal is satiated in a real, as opposed to a hypothetical, intervening
 choice task. Additionally, we show that subliminally evoked retail brand
 names can serve as the cues that activate purchasing goals. (c) 2008 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: The Mere Categorization Effect: How the Presence of Categories Increases Choosers' Perceptions of Assortment Variety and Outcome Satisfaction 
Abstract:
 What is the effect of option categorization on choosers' satisfaction? A
 combination of field and laboratory experiments reveals that the mere
 presence of categories, irrespective of their content, positively
 influences the satisfaction of choosers who are unfamiliar with the choice
 domain. This "mere categorization effect" is driven by a greater number of
 categories signaling greater variety among the available options, which
 allows for a sense of self-determination from choosing. This effect,
 however, is attenuated for choosers who are familiar with the choice
 domain, who do not rely on the presence of categories to perceive the
 variety available. (c) 2008 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..
