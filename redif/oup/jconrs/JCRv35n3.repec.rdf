Title: A Room with a Viewpoint: Using Social Norms to Motivate Environmental Conservation in Hotels 
Abstract:
 Two field experiments examined the effectiveness of signs requesting hotel
 guests' participation in an environmental conservation program. Appeals
 employing descriptive norms (e.g., "the majority of guests reuse their
 towels") proved superior to a traditional appeal widely used by hotels
 that focused solely on environmental protection. Moreover, normative
 appeals were most effective when describing group behavior that occurred
 in the setting that most closely matched individuals' immediate
 situational circumstances (e.g., "the majority of guests in this room
 reuse their towels"), which we refer to as provincial norms. Theoretical
 and practical implications for managing proenvironmental efforts are
 discussed. (c) 2008 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Exploring the Social and Business Returns of a Corporate Oral Health Initiative Aimed at Disadvantaged Hispanic Families 
Abstract:
 This research investigates the impact of a corporate oral health
 initiative aimed at disadvantaged Hispanic families, especially the
 children. We find that the initiative promotes oral health behaviors only
 among less acculturated families. Moreover, it does so by both enhancing
 participant children's beliefs about the physical and psychosocial
 benefits of oral health behaviors and strengthening the link between the
 psychosocial beliefs and behaviors. We also find that when parents of the
 participant children believe that the program has been beneficial to them,
 they are willing to engage in reciprocal behaviors, such as purchasing and
 supporting the corporate sponsor's products. (c) 2008 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: An Empathy-Helping Perspective on Consumers' Responses to Fund-Raising Appeals 
Abstract:
 The research examines viewers' actual responses to four televised
 fund-raising drives by a public television station over a 2-year period.
 The 584 pledge breaks we studied contain 4,868 individual appeals that
 were decomposed into two underlying dimensions based on the
 empathy-helping hypothesis: the appeal beneficiary (self versus other) and
 emotional valence (positive versus negative). We find that the most
 effective fund-raising appeals communicate the benefits to others rather
 than to the self and evoke negative rather than positive emotions. Appeals
 that emphasize benefits to the self significantly reduce the number of
 calls to the station, particularly when they have a positive emotional
 valence. (c) 2008 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Cost of Being Poor: Retail Price and Consumer Price Search Differences across Inner-City and Suburban Neighborhoods 
Abstract:
 This research undertakes a carefully designed and detailed empirical study
 to gain insights into (1) the extent of price differentials between
 wealthy and poor neighborhoods; (2) what induces such differentials,
 especially the nature and intensity of competitive environments, including
 mass merchandisers like Wal-Mart; and (3) their relative impacts. It finds
 a price differential of about 10%-15% for everyday items. Even after
 controlling for store size and competition, prices are found to be 2%-5%
 higher in poor areas. It also finds that it is not the poverty level per
 se but access to cars that acts as a key determinant of consumers' price
 search patterns. (c) 2008 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Choosing Outcomes versus Choosing Products: Consumer-Focused Retirement Investment Advice 
Abstract:
 Investing for retirement is one of the most consequential yet daunting
 decisions consumers face. We present a way to both aid and understand
 consumers as they construct preferences for retirement income. The method
 enables consumers to build desired probability distributions of wealth
 constrained by market forces and the amount invested. We collect desired
 wealth distributions from a sample of working adults, provide evidence of
 the technique's reliability and predictive validity, characterize
 individual- and cluster-level differences, and estimate parameters of risk
 aversion and loss aversion. We discuss how such an interactive method
 might help people construct more informed preferences. (c) 2008 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: The Effects of Reduced Food Size and Package Size on the Consumption Behavior of Restrained and Unrestrained Eaters 
Abstract:
 This research examines the moderating role of attempted dietary restraint
 on the amount of food consumed from small food in small packages versus
 large food in large packages. Four experiments demonstrate that restrained
 eaters consume more calories from small food in small packages, while
 unrestrained eaters consume more calories from large food in a large
 package. For restrained eaters, overconsumption of the small food in small
 packages results from a lapse in self-control caused by the stress of
 perceiving conflicting food information: the small food in small packages
 is perceived as both diet food and high in calories. (c) 2008 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Shifting Signals to Help Health: Using Identity Signaling to Reduce Risky Health Behaviors 
Abstract:
 This research examines how identity-based interventions can improve
 consumer health. Results of laboratory and field experiments reveal that
 associating risky health behaviors with a social identity people do not
 want to signal can contaminate the behaviors and lead consumers to make
 healthier choices. College freshman reported consuming less alcohol
 (experiment 2), and restaurant patrons selected less fattening food
 (experiment 3), when drinking alcohol and eating junk food were presented
 as markers of avoidance groups. These findings demonstrate that
 identity-based interventions can shift the identities associated with
 real-world behaviors, thereby improving the health of populations. (c) 2008 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Participatory Action Research 
Abstract:
 The goal of improving consumer welfare can subtly or dramatically shape
 the research process, the methods used, and the theories developed. This
 article introduces the participatory action research paradigm, which is
 based upon the goal of helping people and employs methodologies that are
 different from traditional consumer research. Exemplars of action research
 are analyzed to reveal applications for researchers who want to engage in
 transformative consumer research. The obstacles and opportunities for
 doing action research are examined. (c) 2008 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: The Happiness of Giving: The Time-Ask Effect 
Abstract:
 This research examines how a focus on time versus money can lead to two
 distinct mind-sets that affect consumers' willingness to donate to
 charitable causes. The results of three experiments, conducted both in the
 lab and in the field, reveal that asking individuals to think about "how
 much time they would like to donate" (vs. "how much money they would like
 to donate") to a charity increases the amount that they ultimately donate
 to the charity. Fueling this effect are differential mind-sets activated
 by time versus money. Implications for the research on time, money, and
 emotional well-being are discussed. (c) 2008 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Flying under the Radar: Perverse Package Size Effects on Consumption Self-Regulation 
Abstract:
 Consumers believe that small package formats of hedonic, but not of
 utilitarian, products help to regulate consumption-especially when their
 self-regulatory concerns are activated. These beliefs may backfire and
 increase consumption of hedonic products. Specifically, activating
 self-regulatory concerns had no consumption effects when tempting products
 came in small package formats. Yet, when tempting products came in large
 package formats, consumers deliberated most before consumption, were least
 likely to consume, and consumed the least. This illustrates how small
 temptations can remain undetected ("flying under the radar") and large
 package formats may reduce consumption as a result of the experienced
 self-control conflict. (c) 2008 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Using Extremeness Aversion to Fight Obesity: Policy Implications of Context Dependent Demand 
Abstract:
 This article illustrates how the compromise effect alters consumers'
 selection of soft drinks. Using three within-subject studies, we show that
 extremeness aversion and price insensitivity cause consumers to increase
 their consumption when the smallest drink size is dropped or when a larger
 drink size is added to a set. As a result rational firms find it best to
 drop the smaller sizes and add a larger size, thus increasing overall
 consumption. After estimating each individual's demand as a function of
 price and drink size availability, policy experiments demonstrate how it
 is possible to reduce soft drink consumption without additional taxation. (c) 2008 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Preferences for Enhancement Pharmaceuticals: The Reluctance to Enhance Fundamental Traits 
Abstract:
 Four studies examined the willingness of young, healthy individuals to
 take drugs intended to enhance their own social, emotional, and cognitive
 traits. We found that people were much more reluctant to enhance traits
 believed to be more fundamental to self-identity (e.g., social comfort)
 than traits considered less fundamental to self-identity (e.g.,
 concentration ability). Moral acceptability of a trait enhancement
 strongly predicted people's desire to legalize the enhancement but not
 their willingness to take the enhancement. Ad taglines that framed
 enhancements as enabling rather than enhancing the fundamental self
 increased people's interest in a fundamental trait enhancement and
 eliminated the preference for less fundamental over more fundamental trait
 enhancements. (c) 2008 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Friends of Victims: Personal Experience and Prosocial Behavior 
Abstract:
 Why do different people give to different causes? We show that the
 sympathy inherent to a close relationship with a victim extends to other
 victims suffering from the same misfortunes that have afflicted their
 friends and loved ones. Both sympathy and donations are greater among
 those related to a victim, and they are greater among those in a communal
 relationship as compared to those in an exchange relationship. Experiments
 that control for information support causality and rule out the
 alternative explanation that any effect is driven by the information
 advantage possessed by friends of victims. (c) 2007 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..
