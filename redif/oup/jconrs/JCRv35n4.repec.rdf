Title: Focusing on Desirability: The Effect of Decision Interruption and Suspension on Preferences 
Abstract:
 This research examines the phenomenon of interruptions and suspensions in
 decision making. It is proposed that information processing may change
 from a bottom-up, data-driven to a top-down, goal-directed mode after an
 interruption, thereby affecting preferences. In particular, in decisions
 involving desirability and feasibility conflicts, because desirability is
 a superordinate goal to feasibility, four studies found that when a
 decision is interrupted and later resumed, people become more likely to
 favor highly desirable but less feasible consumption, such as a high-risk,
 high-reward option or a high-quality, high-price option. A reduced focus
 on feasibility is found to underlie this effect. (c) 2008 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Language Choice in Advertising to Bilinguals: Asymmetric Effects for Multinationals versus Local Firms 
Abstract:
 We examine the role of language choice in advertising to bilinguals in
 global markets. Our results reveal the existence of asymmetric language
 effects for multinational corporations (MNCs) versus local firms when
 operating in a foreign domain, such that the choice of advertising
 language affects advertising effectiveness for MNCs but not local
 companies. Also, different language formats (e.g., the local language vs.
 English or a mix of the two languages) are shown to vary in their
 advertising effectiveness for different types of products (luxuries vs.
 necessities). Our results indicate that language choice for advertisements
 is an important decision for MNCs. Also, MNCs cannot mimic local companies
 in their choice of advertising language. (c) 2008 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Tempt Me Just a Little Bit More: The Effect of Prior Food Temptation Actionability on Goal Activation and Consumption 
Abstract:
 People are often exposed to actionable food temptations (i.e., an
 immediate opportunity to consume, like when friends offer cookies) and
 nonactionable food temptations (i.e., no immediate consumption
 opportunity, like ads for chocolate). The results of three experiments
 suggest that prior exposure to nonactionable food temptations does not
 prevent the activation of an eating goal, given a subsequent consumption
 opportunity, while prior exposure to actionable food temptations prevents
 such activation. As a consequence, prior exposure to actionable food
 temptations enhances self-control on a current consumption occasion, while
 prior exposure to nonactionable food temptations reduces it. (c) 2008 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: An Expanded Conceptualization and a New Measure of Compulsive Buying 
Abstract:
 Drawing on the theoretical foundation of obsessive-compulsive spectrum
 disorder, this article develops an expanded conceptualization and new
 measure of consumers' proclivity to buy compulsively. Compulsive buying is
 defined as a consumer's tendency to be preoccupied with buying that is
 revealed through repetitive buying and a lack of impulse control over
 buying. This measure includes dimensions of both obsessive-compulsive and
 impulse-control disorders. By measuring income-dependent items or
 consequences of compulsive buying separately from the compulsive-buying
 scale, we develop a measure that has a strong theoretical foundation,
 well-documented psychometric properties, and an ability to be applied to
 general consumer populations. (c) 2008 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Emotional Calibration Effects on Consumer Choice 
Abstract:
 This research extends the knowledge calibration paradigm to include
 emotional calibration. Two studies were conducted to investigate the
 effects of emotional calibration on consumer decision making. Emotionally
 calibrated consumers made higher-quality food choices, and these effects
 were predictive beyond cognitive ability and cognitive calibration. In a
 field experiment, emotional calibration enhanced obese consumers' decision
 quality by attenuating the impact of impulsive eating on caloric intake
 and reducing the effect of a vivid presentation of food choices.
 Theoretical implications are discussed for consumer emotional ability,
 confidence, and calibration, along with a motivation explanation for our
 findings. The significance of emotional calibration to future research is
 addressed along with a discussion of consumer well-being. (c) 2008 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Stigma by Association in Coupon Redemption: Looking Cheap because of Others 
Abstract:
 The present research establishes that the innocuous behavior of coupon
 redemption is capable of eliciting stigma by association. The general
 finding across four studies shows that the coupon redemption behavior of
 one consumer results in a second non-coupon-redeeming shopper being
 stigmatized by association as cheap when a low as compared to a high value
 coupon is redeemed. More important, the research identifies a number of
 factors that protect a non-coupon-redeeming shopper from the undesirable
 experience of stigma by association, even during another shopper's
 redemption of a low value coupon. (c) 2008 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Seize the Day! Encouraging Indulgence for the Hyperopic Consumer 
Abstract:
 This article explores the phenomenon of "hyperopia," or an aversion to
 indulgence, as introduced by Kivetz and Keinan (<xref ref-type="bibr"
 rid="rf16">2006</xref>) and Kivetz and Simonson (<xref ref-type="bibr"
 rid="rf17">2002</xref>). We first develop a measure to capture hyperopia
 as an individual difference. Three empirical studies use this measure to
 demonstrate that hyperopia and high self-control are both conceptually and
 empirically distinct. Further, we show that altering the level at which an
 action or item is construed can make an indulgent goal or luxury product
 more appealing to the high hyperopia consumer by influencing its value in
 terms of an attractive long-term outcome. (c) 2008 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: The Blissful Ignorance Effect: Pre- versus Post-action Effects on Outcome Expectancies Arising from Precise and Vague Information 
Abstract:
 This article examines the effects on outcome expectancies of precise
 versus vague information across two contexts: prior to an action taken by
 the consumer (pre-action) and after the action is taken (post-action).
 Across three experiments, we show that with vague information individuals
 are more optimistic of outcomes post-action compared to pre-action; this
 difference is attenuated with precise information. We term this
 inconsistency the blissful ignorance effect and show that it arises due to
 the interplay of two goals in decision making, the goal to arrive at a
 desired conclusion (directional goal) and the goal to be accurate
 (accuracy goal) about one's outcome expectancies. (c) 2008 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Effects of Temporal and Social Distance on Consumer Evaluations 
Abstract:
 This article investigates how two dimensions of psychological distance
 (i.e., temporal distance and social distance) jointly affect consumers'
 evaluations of products. Drawing on the properties of psychological
 distance and diminishing sensitivity to the increase in distance, we show
 an interaction effect of the two distance dimensions on product
 evaluations in two experiments. Specifically, when both dimensions are
 proximal, consumer evaluations are more influenced by the value associated
 with low-level construals than when either or both dimensions are distal,
 where consumer evaluations are more influenced by the value associated
 with high-level construals. (c) 2008 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Context-Dependent Effects of Goal Primes 
Abstract:
 We provide evidence that goal priming effects are context dependent. We
 show that goal primes encourage prime-consistent behavior when the
 behavioral context is common and prime-inconsistent behavior when the
 behavioral context is uncommon. While the prime-consistent behavior is
 compatible with existing theory, the prime-inconsistent behavior poses a
 theoretical challenge. We argue that uncommon behavioral contexts
 encourage the release of a primed goal and, as a consequence, an increase
 in the relative activation of information inconsistent with the primed
 goal and prime-inconsistent behavior. (c) 2008 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: The Effects of a Different Category Context on Target Brand Evaluations 
Abstract:
 Four studies support the conclusion that the evaluation of a target brand
 is influenced by its presentation in the context of advertising for brands
 from a different category. The specific effect of context depends on the
 decision maker's expertise in the target category and the accessibility of
 contextual information. In a base condition, experts exhibited an
 assimilation effect and novices a comparison contrast. Increasing the
 accessibility of the contextual information prompted a correction contrast
 effect among experts and an assimilation effect among novices. A reduction
 in the resources available for processing the highly accessible contextual
 information resulted in experts engaging in assimilation and in novices
 exhibiting a comparison contrast. These findings are explained in terms of
 an interpretation and a comparison judgment process. (c) 2008 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Recalling Past Temptations: An Information-Processing Perspective on the Dynamics of Self-Control 
Abstract:
 This research investigates how consumers respond to food-related
 temptations as a function of recalling their own behavior when faced with
 a similar temptation in the recent past. Bringing together different
 streams of relevant research, we propose and find that chronically
 nonimpulsive individuals display behavioral consistency over
 time-resisting (succumbing) when they recall having resisted (succumbed)
 earlier. In contrast, impulsive individuals show a switching pattern,
 resisting current temptations if they recall having succumbed, and vice
 versa. These propositions are supported by convergent results across four
 experiments involving real eating behaviors, response latencies, and
 hypothetical choices. Implications for consumer welfare are discussed and
 possible interventions are suggested. (c) 2008 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..
