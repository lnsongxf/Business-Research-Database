Title: Psychological Distancing: Why Happiness Helps You See the Big Picture 
Abstract:
 We propose that a positive mood, by signaling that a situation is benign,
 might allow people to step back and take in the big picture. As a
 consequence, a positive mood might increase abstract construal and the
 adoption of abstract, future goals. In contrast, a negative mood, by
 signaling not only danger but also its imminence, might focus attention on
 immediate and proximal concerns and reduce the adoption of abstract,
 future goals. (c) 2008 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: The Marketplace Management of Illicit Pleasure 
Abstract:
 Through pleasure, a foundational concept in consumer behavior, we offer an
 analysis of the history, development, and experience of clubbing, the
 postcursor of rave and the contextual focus of this article. On the basis
 of a 5-year study primarily involving participant observation and
 interviewing, we present an analysis of how the clubbing experience is
 cocreated by promoters, DJs, and clubbers themselves. We develop and
 demonstrate a biosocial conceptualization of pleasure and show how the
 shared experience of music and dance, the organization of space, and the
 effects of the drug ecstasy combine to produce a highly sought-after,
 calculated suspension of the rules and norms of everyday life. Further, we
 suggest that the club, as well as the pleasurable practices and
 experiences that it supports, has become a site of contained illegality.
 Here, the illicit, subversive practices of rave have now become shepherded
 and channeled into more predictable, manageable, and regulated
 environments facilitated by the "knowing wink" of club promoters, police,
 and state authorities. Implications for consumer research are discussed. (c) 2008 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: The Power of Strangers: The Effect of Incidental Consumer Brand Encounters on Brand Choice 
Abstract:
 In the course of daily encounters with other consumers, an individual may
 be incidentally exposed to various brands. We refer to these situations as
 incidental consumer brand encounters (ICBEs). This research examines how
 ICBEs influence brand choice. Four studies provide evidence that repeated
 exposure to simulated ICBEs increases choice of the focal brand for people
 not aware of the brand exposure, that perceptual fluency underlies these
 effects, and that these effects are moderated by perceivers' automatic
 responses to the type of user observed with the brand. (c) 2008 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Memories as Assets: Strategic Memory Protection in Choice over Time 
Abstract:
 We present five studies supporting our strategic memory protection theory.
 When people make decisions about experiences to consume over time, they
 treat their memories of previous experiences as assets to be protected.
 The first two studies demonstrate that people tend to avoid situations
 that they believe will threaten their ability to retrieve special (rather
 than merely pleasant) memories. The next three studies demonstrate that
 people seek to obtain memory pointers to help them cue special memories at
 a later time when they anticipate interference from subsequent events.
 These preferences are driven by people's lay theories about the importance
 and difficulty of obtaining and retrieving special memories. (c) 2008 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: The Effect of Brand Commitment on the Evaluation of Nonpreferred Brands: A Disconfirmation Process 
Abstract:
 This research finds that high- and low-commitment consumers use different
 information-processing strategies when exposed to competitive brand
 information. High-commitment consumers use a disconfirmatory processing
 strategy, focusing on the dissimilarities between their preferred brand
 and the competitor brand. Low-commitment consumers focus on the
 similarities between the advertised brand and their preferred brand. These
 processing differences lead to differences in the evaluation of a
 competitive brand between high- and low-commitment consumers. However,
 priming high-commitment consumers to focus on the similarities and
 low-commitment consumers on the dissimilarities between their preferred
 brand and a competitor brand mitigates the effects of the different
 processing strategies. (c) 2008 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Unrealistically Optimistic Consumers: A Selective Hypothesis Testing Account for Optimism in Predictions of Future Behavior 
Abstract:
 We propose that when predicting future behavior, consumers selectively
 (but unwittingly) test the hypothesis that they will behave ideally. This
 selective hypothesis testing perspective on unrealistic optimism suggests
 that estimates of future behavior should be similar to those made by
 individuals who assume that conditions will be ideal. Moreover, consumers
 who initially provide estimates assuming that conditions will be ideal
 should recognize that the world is not ideal and so should test a more
 realistic hypothesis. In line with these predictions, we find that
 ideal-world estimates (e.g., In an ideal world, how often will you
 exercise next week?) do not differ from standard estimates (e.g., How
 often will you exercise next week?). We also find that individuals who
 initially estimate their behavior in an ideal world subsequently make more
 realistic predictions. (c) 2008 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: How Inferences about Missing Attributes Decrease the Tendency to Defer Choice and Increase Purchase Probability 
Abstract:
 Most purchases involve choices among options with incomplete attribute
 information. In such situations, consumers often have the option not to
 choose any of the alternatives to avoid uncertainty. Alternatively,
 consumers can make inferences about the missing attributes. These
 inferences may occur spontaneously, or they may be strategically prompted.
 In five studies, it is shown that both explicitly and implicitly prompting
 consumers to make inferences about the missing attributes reduces the
 tendency to select the no-choice option and increases the likelihood of
 making a purchase decision. In parallel, consumers who generate
 spontaneous inferences are also less likely to defer their choices. (c) 2008 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Lines in the Sand: The Role of Motivated Categorization in the Pursuit of Self-Control Goals 
Abstract:
 This research explores goal-related categorization processes as part of a
 three-phase model encompassing both antecedents (goal selection) and
 consequences (purchase likelihood). In each phase, we identify conditions
 under which self-control goals (indulgence or restriction goals) and trait
 self-control may either correspond or conflict. Three experiments
 demonstrate that when no trait-goal conflict occurs, categorization
 patterns and purchase intentions are consistent with self-control
 tendencies. However, when conflicts exist between trait self-control and
 goals, individuals engage in motivated categorization or revert to
 behaviors consistent with trait self-control. Interestingly, results
 suggest that either conflict resolution mechanism may undermine the
 likelihood of goal attainment. (c) 2008 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Objective and Subjective Knowledge Relationships: A Quantitative Analysis of Consumer Research Findings 
Abstract:
 This article presents the results of a meta-analysis of empirical findings
 associated with the relationship between objective knowledge (OK; i.e.,
 accurate stored information that consumers possess) and subjective
 knowledge (SK; i.e., consumers' perceptions of their own knowledge).
 Results of the meta-analysis reveal that OK-SK relationships from prior
 research were stronger for products versus nonproducts, for public versus
 private goods, and for SK measures containing an expert versus an
 "average" standard of comparison. These results and other findings offer a
 series of implications for future research regarding investigations of
 consumer knowledge. (c) 2008 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Blackjack in the Kitchen: Understanding Online versus Casino Gambling 
Abstract:
 About $10 billion a year is spent by consumers worldwide on online
 gambling, and that number continues to grow. We present a qualitative,
 image-based study of 30 Las Vegas online and casino gamblers. By examining
 online gambling as a consumption experience, we examine what happens to
 consumption meaning as gambling moves away from a regulated physical space
 to an unregulated online space, one accessed from home. We explore the
 meaning of online gambling consumption to consumers and flesh out the
 social welfare implications of our findings. (c) 2008 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Asymmetries in the Sequential Learning of Brand Associations: Implications for the Early Entrant Advantage 
Abstract:
 The highlighting effect occurs when the order in which consumers learn
 about brands determines the strength of association between these brands
 and their attributes. In four experiments, we find that consumers more
 strongly associate common attributes with early learned brands and unique
 attributes with late-learned brands. These findings imply an advantage for
 late entrants when unique attributes offer a higher value than attributes
 that are common to late and early entrants. We extend an attention-based
 model of associative learning to accommodate sequential learning of brand
 associations and predict when late versus early entrants will be able to
 sustain an advantage. (c) 2008 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: The Influence of Self-Construal on Impulsive Consumption 
Abstract:
 Three studies investigated the impact of self-construal on impulsive
 consumption. Independents exhibited more impulsive consumption tendencies
 than did interdependents. A chronically accessible independent
 self-construal was positively associated with country-level beer
 consumption (study 1a) and state-level problem alcohol consumption (study
 1b). Experimentally primed independents reported more positive attitudes
 toward immediate beer consumption than did interdependents, and this
 effect was mediated by state impulsivity. Peer presence increased
 impulsive consumption tendencies for independents but decreased them for
 interdependents (studies 2 and 3). The moderating effect of self-construal
 was linked to greater motivation to suppress impulsive tendencies for
 interdependents than for independents (study 3). (c) 2008 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..
