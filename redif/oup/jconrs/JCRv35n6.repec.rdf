Title: Acts of Benevolence: A Limited-Resource Account of Compliance with Charitable Requests 
Abstract:
 Across six field and lab experiments, we found that impaired self-control
 fosters compliance with charitable requests. Experiments 1 and 2 showed
 that self-regulatory resource depletion was induced when participants
 yielded to the initial requests of a foot-in-the-door script aimed at
 procuring volunteer behavior. Experiment 3 demonstrated that
 self-regulatory resource depletion mediated the effects of yielding to the
 initial requests of a foot-in-the-door technique on compliance with a
 charitable target request. Experiments 4-6 demonstrated that weak
 temporary and chronic self-control ability fostered compliance through
 reliance on compliance-promoting heuristics (i.e., reciprocity, liking,
 and consistency). (c) 2008 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: The Influence of Causal Conditional Reasoning on the Acceptance of Product Claims 
Abstract:
 The believability of product claims depends on the consumer's ability to
 generate disabling conditions (i.e., other events blocking a cause from
 having its effect) and alternative causes (i.e., other events causing the
 outcome).

Title: Behavioral Consistency and Inconsistency in the Resolution of Goal Conflict 
Abstract:
 During the course of a day, consumers experience choices that involve goal
 conflict (e.g., eat tasty vs. healthy food, recreate vs. work, relax vs.
 act). In some cases, an initial behavior is followed by a similar
 behavior. In other cases, an initial behavior is followed by an opposing
 behavior. We posit that a passive guidance system can nonconsciously guide
 behavior when there is goal conflict and, hence, determine whether a
 sequence of behaviors will be consistent or inconsistent. The passive
 guidance system is sensitive to whether a current behavior sustains goal
 activation and encourages similar future behaviors or results in goal
 achievement and encourages dissimilar future behaviors. Eight experiments
 provide evidence for this passive guidance system. (c) 2008 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Variety, Vice, and Virtue: How Assortment Size Influences Option Choice 
Abstract:
 Assortment size has been shown to influence whether consumers make a
 choice, but could it also influence what they choose? Five studies
 demonstrate that because choosing from larger assortments is often more
 difficult, it leads people to select options that are easier to justify.
 Virtues and utilitarian necessities are generally easier to justify than
 indulgences; consequently, choosing from larger assortments often shifts
 choice from vices to virtues and from hedonic to utilitarian options.
 These effects reverse, however, when situational factors provide
 accessible reasons to indulge, underscoring the role of justification.
 Implications for choice difficulty and justification processes are
 discussed. (c) 2008 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Releasing the Regret Lock: Consumer Response to New Alternatives after a Sale 
Abstract:
 This research examines how consumers behave after they miss a sale and
 subsequently face a smaller sale for the same or different product.
 According to the proposed theory, a two-way interaction is predicted in
 which adding another similar alternative to the choice set leads to higher
 choice deferral without prior sale information but lower choice deferral
 with information about missing a larger sale on one of the alternatives.
 In addition, the new alternative in the choice set becomes more attractive
 and captures most of the market share. The results from three lab
 experiments and one field experiment confirm the hypotheses and the
 proposed mechanism. The article concludes with a discussion of the
 theoretical and managerial implications of the findings. (c) 2008 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Possession and Access: Consumer Desires and Value Perceptions Regarding Contemporary Art Collection and Exhibit Visits 
Abstract:
 This research develops a multilevel and multifaceted perspective on art
 consumption behavior by separating consumption modes from the consumption
 products (artworks), by comparing possession (collection) with access
 (exhibit visits), and by distinguishing desire from value. The findings
 challenge the presupposition that possession is the ultimate expression of
 consumer desire and illustrate that contemporary art collectors and
 visitors choose collection or visits based on different desires. While
 artwork is perceived similarly, collection and visits have different
 impact on consumers' perception of value. The findings confirm, extend,
 and challenge previous research on desire, value, possession, and
 experiential approach. (c) 2008 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: It's Time to Vote: The Effect of Matching Message Orientation and Temporal Frame on Political Persuasion 
Abstract:
 What political candidates say during their campaign and when they say it
 are critical to their success. In three experiments, we show that
 abstract, "why"-laden appeals are more persuasive than concrete,
 "how"-laden appeals when voters' decision is temporally distant; the
 reverse is true when the decision is imminent, and these results are
 strongest among those who are politically uninformed. These effects seem
 to be driven by a match between temporal distance and the abstractness of
 the message that leads to perceptions of fluency, and the ensuing "feels
 right" experience yields enhanced evaluations of the focal stimulus. (c) 2008 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Feeling Superior: The Impact of Loyalty Program Structure on Consumers' Perceptions of Status 
Abstract:
 We study status as it pertains to loyalty programs, investigating the
 impact of the number and size of tiers on consumers' perceptions of
 status. We find that increasing the number of elites in the top tier
 dilutes perceptions of status, while adding a subordinate tier enhances
 status. Tiers below the second tier do not affect those at the top but can
 make those in the tier immediately above feel more elite. Given the choice
 between alternative programs, those who do not qualify for status prefer
 hierarchies with multiple tiers. Finally, we show that status-laden labels
 (gold and silver) on their own signal an increasingly selective hierarchy. (c) 2008 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Specification Seeking: How Product Specifications Influence Consumer Preference 
Abstract:
 We offer a framework about when and how specifications (e.g., megapixels
 of a camera and number of air bags in a massage chair) influence consumer
 preferences and report five studies that test the framework. Studies 1-3
 show that even when consumers can directly experience the relevant
 products and the specifications carry little or no new information, their
 preference is still influenced by specifications, including specifications
 that are self-generated and by definition spurious and specifications that
 the respondents themselves deem uninformative. Studies 4 and 5 show that
 relative to choice, hedonic preference (liking) is more stable and less
 influenced by specifications. (c) 2008 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: When Brand Personality Matters: The Moderating Role of Attachment Styles 
Abstract:
 This research examines the moderating role of consumer's attachment style
 in the impact of brand personality. Findings support our hypotheses
 regarding the manner in which brand personality and attachment style
 differences systematically influence brand outcomes, including brand
 attachment, purchase likelihood, and brand choice. Results show that
 anxiously attached individuals are more likely to be differentially
 influenced by brand personalities. Further, the results indicate that the
 level of avoidance predicts the types of brand personality that are most
 relevant to anxious individuals. Specifically, under conditions of high
 avoidance and high anxiety, individuals exhibit a preference for exciting
 brands; however, under conditions of low avoidance and high anxiety,
 individuals tend to prefer sincere brands. The differential preference for
 sincere (vs. exciting) brand personality emerges in public (vs. private)
 consumption settings and in settings where interpersonal relationship
 expectations are high, supporting a signaling role of brand personality in
 these contexts. (c) 2008 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: The Effect of Regulatory Orientation and Decision Strategy on Brand Judgments 
Abstract:
 Four studies investigate how consumers' regulatory orientation and the
 decision strategies used to process message information affect their
 judgments. Evaluations of the chosen brand were more favorable when
 individuals with a prevention focus used decision strategies that enhanced
 the accuracy of a decision outcome than when they used strategies that
 facilitated progress toward a decision, whereas the opposite outcome
 occurred for those with a promotion focus. These findings emerged whether
 the decision strategies were prompted by instructions about how to make a
 decision or by the message presentation format, and they were mediated by
 a subjective experience of confidence. These observations suggest that
 judgments are influenced by the decision makers' feelings about how
 information is processed that are independent of the message content. (c) 2008 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Bilingualism and the Emotional Intensity of Advertising Language 
Abstract:
 This research contributes to the current understanding of language effects
 in advertising by uncovering a previously ignored mechanism shaping
 consumer response to an increasingly globalized marketplace. We propose a
 language-specific episodic trace theory of language emotionality to
 explain how language influences the perceived emotionality of marketing
 communications. Five experiments with bilingual consumers show (1) that
 textual information (e.g., marketing slogans) expressed in consumers'
 native language tends to be perceived as more emotional than messages
 expressed in their second language, (2) that this effect is not uniquely
 due to the activation of stereotypes associated to specific languages or
 to a lack of comprehension, and (3) that the effect depends on the
 frequency with which words have been experienced in native- versus
 second-language contexts. (c) 2008 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..
