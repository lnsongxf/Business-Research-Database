Title: Category Activation Model: A Spreading Activation Network Model of Subcategory Positioning When Categorization Uncertainty Is High 
Abstract:
 We develop a spreading activation model, which we call the category
 activation model, to predict where within a category structure consumers
 are likely to position a subcategory that they have created to accommodate
 a new hybrid product. Based on this model, we hypothesize that the
 probability that an individual will position a new category subordinate to
 a particular category i is proportional to the relative number of
 categories that are already subordinate to i. We report the results of two
 studies that support this hypothesis and provide evidence that
 accessibility is an underlying mechanism. (c) 2008 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Temporal Sequence Effects: A Memory Framework 
Abstract:
 While much attention has been given recently to studying temporal
 sequences of events, relatively less attention has been directed to
 understanding the mechanisms behind the formation of global retrospective
 evaluations of temporal sequences. The findings from this research suggest
 that a memory-based framework can provide a parsimonious, comprehensive
 explanation for retrospective evaluations. In addition to accounting for
 past findings such as a preference for improving over declining temporal
 sequences and the important role of peak (both high intensity and unique)
 experiences, we demonstrate that imposing a delay prior to retrospective
 evaluations can create a preference reversal due to the reduced
 accessibility of final or common instances. (c) 2008 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Influence of Contagious versus Noncontagious Product Groupings on Consumer Preferences 
Abstract:
 This article studies the influence of product groupings on consumer
 preferences. Specifically, it is proposed that when each product in two
 groups has an equal chance of a gain, consumers prefer to choose from a
 group that appears more contagious (e.g., products arranged close
 together, similarly, or symmetrically). However, when each product in two
 groups has an equal chance of a loss, consumers prefer to choose from a
 group that appears less contagious (e.g., products arranged apart,
 dissimilarly, or asymmetrically). Across three experiments, the effect is
 demonstrated, and contagion theory is used to explicate the underlying
 process. (c) 2008 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Parity Product Features Can Enhance or Dilute Brand Evaluation: The Influence of Goal Orientation and Presentation Format 
Abstract:
 Two studies examine the impact of adding parity features to an advertising
 message that compares a dominant target brand to a competitor. We document
 that in some instances the presence of parity features prompts more
 favorable target evaluations (enhancement), whereas in others it results
 in more negative evaluations of the target (dilution). We predict when
 each of these outcomes will occur on the basis of a fit between an
 individual's regulatory goal focus and the means of goal pursuit depicted
 in the message presentation. Enhancement occurs when there is a fit
 between an individual's regulatory goal and how message information is
 presented, and dilution occurs when there is nonfit. (c) 2008 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: The Safety of Objects: Materialism, Existential Insecurity, and Brand Connection 
Abstract:
 Over the past 2 decades, a large body of research has examined how
 materialism is formed and how this value influences well-being. Although
 these studies have substantially contributed to our understanding of
 materialism, they shed little light on this value's relationship to
 consumer behavior. Our research seeks to address this gap by examining the
 influence of materialism on self- and communal-brand connections. We
 ground our conceptualization in terror management theory and suggest that
 materialistic individuals form strong connections to their brands as a
 response to existential insecurity. We test this premise by conducting a
 national survey among 314 adults as well as an experiment among 125
 college students. Our results provide broad support for our thesis and
 suggest that the fear of death encourages materialistic individuals to
 form strong connections with their brands. (c) 2008 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: The Fit of Thinking Style and Situation: New Measures of Situation-Specific Experiential and Rational Cognition 
Abstract:
 Decades of research provide strong evidence that consumers process
 information in two distinct and qualitatively different ways, rational and
 experiential. However, little research has addressed situational
 influences on thinking style, and there have been no attempts to
 simultaneously measure and validate two-dimensional situation-specific
 thinking. We develop and validate a new instrument for measuring
 situation-specific thinking style using performance tasks, consumer Web
 activities, and differing motivations. We establish differences in
 thinking style across types of tasks and motivations, and congruence
 effects related to the fit of situation-specific thinking style and the
 nature of the task on performance and attitudinal outcomes. (c) 2008 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: "Why My Mother Never Threw Anything Out": The Effect of Product Freshness on Consumption 
Abstract:
 This research focuses on a pervasive but largely unexamined product
 attribute-freshness date-to shed light on how and why its influence on the
 consumption of perishable products changes with product ownership. Drawing
 on recent research on the endowment effect, we demonstrate that even when
 the differential costs implicit in ownership are controlled for, consumers
 are more likely to actually consume a product past its freshness date when
 they own it than when they do not. Moreover, this ownership-based increase
 in consumption is accompanied by lower estimates by consumers of their
 likelihood of getting sick from consuming the product past its freshness
 date. These outcomes are driven, in turn, by consumers' ownership-based
 susceptibility to engage in selective and confirmatory testing of the
 hypothesis that the product past its freshness date is consumption worthy
 (i.e., approach goal) rather than the alternate, default hypothesis that
 it is not consumption worthy (i.e., avoidance goal). (c) 2008 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: The "Shaken Self": Product Choices as a Means of Restoring Self-View Confidence 
Abstract:
 The present research shows that when a confidently held self-view (e.g.,
 "I am an exciting person") is temporarily cast in doubt, individuals are
 motivated to choose products that bolster their original self-view (e.g.,
 choosing brands with exciting brand personalities). The findings across
 three studies suggest that subtle manipulations can temporarily "shake"
 one's self-view confidence, resulting in an increased propensity of
 choosing self-view-bolstering products in a subsequent choice task. The
 consequences of the "shaken self" for product choices are examined in
 different self-domains. The findings also suggest that the effects of the
 shaken self are attenuated when individuals have the opportunity to
 restore their self-view confidence prior to the final choice task. (c) 2008 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Intergenerationally Gifted Asset Dispositions 
Abstract:
 This study examines the mechanisms by which intergenerationally gifted
 assets are transformed into inalienable wealth and describes how such
 gifts convey and transfer meaning within families. The study's findings
 reveal that individuals employ indexical accounts to allocate assets in
 support of relational goals and employ prosaic accounts to achieve
 utilitarian goals. These findings contribute to intergenerational gifting
 theories by demonstrating how an asset transitions between inalienable and
 alienable states, identifying antecedents and consequences of prosaic and
 indexical accounts, explaining the interactions between inalienable and
 alienable states and between indexical and prosaic account allocations,
 and discussing the implications of labeled assets on consumer behavior. (c) 2008 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: When Does Choice Reveal Preference? Moderators of Heuristic versus Goal-Based Choice 
Abstract:
 Heuristic use is a central topic in consumer research, but the factors
 that determine when consumers will settle for shortcut solutions to choice
 problems (e.g., compromise) versus rely on "true" preferences (e.g.,
 self-goals) remain unclear. We propose that both motivation to use
 self-goals, as indexed by need for cognition (NFC), and cognitive ability,
 manipulated through cognitive load, influence the use of the compromise
 heuristic. Three studies showed that NFC is associated with less
 compromise at baseline but not under load. Process measures and moderation
 tests suggest that load disrupts access to self-goals and that NFC relates
 to self-goal use. Thus, load differentially influences compromise choice
 across levels of NFC. (c) 2008 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: The Devil Is in the Deliberation: Thinking Too Much Reduces Preference Consistency 
Abstract:
 In five experiments we found that deliberation reduces preference
 consistency. In experiments 1 and 2, participants who deliberated on their
 preferences were less consistent in their evaluations compared to those
 who did not deliberate. Experiment 3 demonstrated that this effect is due
 to the impediment of deliberation and not to the benefit of
 nondeliberation. We hypothesized that deliberation leads to the
 inconsistent weighting of information, especially when the information is
 complex. As such, we predicted and found in experiments 4 and 5 that the
 extent to which deliberation decreases preference consistency depends upon
 the complexity of the information. (c) 2008 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: The Impact of Add-On Features on Consumer Product Evaluations 
Abstract:
 The research presented in this article provides evidence that add-on
 features sold to enhance a product can be more than just discretionary
 benefits. We argue that consumers draw inferences from the mere
 availability of add-ons, which in turn lead to significant changes in the
 perceived utility of the base good itself. Specifically, we propose that
 the improvements supplied by add-ons can be classified as either alignable
 or nonalignable and that they have opposing effects on evaluation. A set
 of four experiments with different product categories confirms this
 prediction. In addition, we show that the amount of product information
 available to consumers and expectations about product composition play
 important moderating roles. From a practical standpoint, these results
 highlight the need for firms to be mindful of the behavioral implications
 of making add-ons readily available in the marketplace. (c) 2008 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..
