Title: Gaming Emotions in Social Interactions 
Abstract:
 One's own emotions may influence someone else's behavior in a social
 interaction. If one believes this, she or he has an incentive to game
 emotions-to strategically modify the expression of a current emotional
 state-in an attempt to influence her or his counterpart. In a series of
 three experiments, this article investigates the extent to which people
 (1) misrepresent a current emotional state, (2) willfully acknowledge
 their strategic actions, (3) choose to game emotions over nonemotional
 information, and (4) improve their financial well-being from emotion
 gaming. (c) 2009 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: The Denomination Effect 
Abstract:
 Labeled the "denomination effect," study 1 shows in three field studies
 that the likelihood of spending is lower when an equivalent sum of money
 is represented by a single large denomination (e.g., one $20 bill)
 relative to many smaller denominations (e.g., 20 $1 bills). In two of the
 three field studies, individuals spent more once the decision to spend had
 been made. Study 2 then shows that consumers deliberately choose to
 receive money in a large denomination relative to small denominations when
 there is a need to exert self-control in spending. Study 3 further shows
 that the denomination effect is contingent on individual differences in
 people's desire to reduce the pain of paying associated with spending. The
 results suggest that the denomination effect occurs because large
 denominations are psychologically less fungible than smaller ones,
 allowing them to be used as a strategic device to control and regulate
 spending. (c) 2009 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Distinctive Roles of Lead Users and Opinion Leaders in the Social Networks of Schoolchildren 
Abstract:
 Prior research has shown that both lead users and opinion leaders may
 propel the diffusion of innovation. This raises the question of whether
 lead users and opinion leaders are positioned similarly in social
 networks, which we address using a sample of 23 school classes consisting
 of 537 children. Research among children is very scarce in this particular
 domain. Our statistical analyses based on hierarchical linear modeling
 reveal two general results: first, lead users among children appear to
 possess a variety of links between clusters; second, opinion leaders are
 locally positioned within clusters of children and have many direct links. (c) 2009 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: When Mental Simulation Hinders Behavior: The Effects of Process-Oriented Thinking on Decision Difficulty and Performance 
Abstract:
 We investigate the effect of process- versus outcome-oriented thinking on
 consumers' subjective experiences when choosing among alternatives. In
 four studies, we show that because process-oriented thinking leads to a
 dual focus on both means and end benefits, it increases decision
 difficulty when consumers face substantive trade-offs between desirability
 and feasibility. This experienced difficulty results in negative
 consequences for consumers' subsequent behavior, including greater
 willingness to postpone choice, lower commitment to the chosen option, and
 degraded task performance. (c) 2009 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Seeking Freedom through Variety 
Abstract:
 This article examines the effect of spatial confinement on consumer
 choices. Building on reactance theory and the environmental psychology
 literature, we propose that spatially confined consumers react against an
 incursion to their personal space by making more varied and unique
 choices. We present four laboratory experiments and one field study to
 support our theorizing. Study 1 demonstrates that people in narrower
 aisles seek more variety than people in wider aisles. Study 2 indicates
 that this effect of confinement in narrow aisles also extends to more
 unique choices. Study 3 shows that perceptions of confinement exert their
 strongest influence on people who are chronically high in reactance. Study
 4 suggests that influencing perceptions of confinement is sufficient to
 evoke variety seeking. Finally, the field study uses crowding as a proxy
 for confinement and finds a positive relationship between crowding and
 variety seeking in real grocery purchases. (c) 2009 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Opportunity Cost Neglect 
Abstract:
 To properly consider the opportunity costs of a purchase, consumers must
 actively generate the alternatives that it would displace. The current
 research suggests that consumers often fail to do so. Even under
 conditions promoting cognitive effort, various cues to consider
 opportunity costs reduce purchase rates and increase the choice share of
 more affordable options. Sensitivity to such cues varies with chronic
 dispositional differences in spending attitudes. We discuss the
 implications of these results for the marketing strategies of economy and
 premium brands. (c) 2009 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Effects of Temporal Distance and Memory on Consumer Judgments 
Abstract:
 Once a product has been evaluated for use, the circumstances can change
 and it must be reevaluated for use at a different time. Four experiments
 investigated processes underlying these reevaluations. Participants
 received information about a product that had implications for both
 desirability and the feasibility of using it, while anticipating either
 its immediate or future use. They were later asked to reevaluate the
 product for use at either the same or a different point in time.
 Participants who reevaluated the product for future use based their
 judgments on desirability considerations regardless of when they had
 considered using it initially. However, participants who reevaluated the
 product for immediate use also based their judgments on desirability
 considerations unless they had initially considered immediate use as well.
 These results were consistent with a conceptualization of consumer
 judgment processes that incorporated implications of research on construal
 level theory and on person memory and judgments. (c) 2009 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: When Uncertainty Brings Pleasure: The Role of Prospect Imageability and Mental Imagery 
Abstract:
 Consumers generally prefer certainty to uncertainty, which leads them to
 shun uncertain situations. This research demonstrates, however, that
 consumers facing uncertainty (rather than certainty) associated with a
 positive event (e.g., winning a lucky draw but not knowing the exact prize
 won) can experience greater, longer-lasting positive feelings. The
 sustainability of this pleasurable uncertainty effect hinges on the
 (right) level of imagery elaboration that consumers generate about the
 various possible favorable prospects of the event (e.g., imagining the
 possible prizes from winning a lucky draw). Findings from two experiments
 support the proposed imageability-based framework. (c) 2009 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Promotional Bundles and Consumers' Price Judgments: When the Best Things in Life Are Not Free 
Abstract:
 A series of experiments examined the amount that consumers were willing to
 pay for products bundled together in a promotion. Describing one of the
 disparate products in the bundle as "free" decreased the price consumers
 were willing to pay for each product when sold individually. However, a
 "freebie" offer did not influence the overall price for the bundle of
 disparate products, a finding robust across two different settings and
 populations. The differential effect of freebies is explained by varying
 judgment difficulty, with the price being easier to arrive at for just a
 single product than for the combination. Consistent with this explanation,
 factors that influence judgment difficulty (the salience of the company's
 motive for offering the freebie and time pressure to make a judgment)
 moderated the effects of a free offer on the amount consumers were willing
 to pay. (c) 2009 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Variety Amnesia: Recalling Past Variety Can Accelerate Recovery from Satiation 
Abstract:
 Consumers frequently consume items to the point where they no longer enjoy
 them. In a pilot study and two experiments spanning three distinct classes
 of stimuli, we find that people can recover from this satiation by simply
 recalling the variety of alternative items they have consumed in the past.
 And yet, people seem to exhibit "variety amnesia" in that they do not
 spontaneously recall this past variety despite the fact that it would
 result in a desirable decrease in satiation. Thus, rather than satiation
 being a fixed physiological process, it appears that it is at least
 partially constructed in the moment. We discuss some of the theoretical
 implications of these findings and provide some prescriptive measures for
 both marketers and consumers. (c) 2009 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Escaping the Gift Economy 
Abstract:
 Researchers have analyzed the dark side of the gift, but they have
 remained blind to what it implies about the market. Drawing on the
 experiences of a group of informants who participated in an ethnographical
 study of house moving in Montreal, Canada, this article provides
 significant evidence that the unattractiveness of the gift economy can
 incite people to turn to the market as an escape. It examines how people
 use the market to free themselves from the straitjacket of social
 expectations-from the sense of indebtedness and emotional oppression-which
 constrains them in their reciprocity relations inside the gift economy.
 The standard views of CCT researchers concerning the valorization of the
 gift economy are challenged, as well as the axiology that implicitly
 informs their research. As a result, it is necessary to discuss the
 inversion of this axiology. (c) 2009 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Nationalism and Ideology in an Anticonsumption Movement 
Abstract:
 In this research we examine the role of the nationalist ideology of
 swadeshi in a contemporary anticonsumption movement and show that its
 deployment is linked to the experiences of colonialism, modernity, and
 globalization in India. Specifically, we offer a postcolonial
 understanding of reflexivity and nationalism in an anticonsumption
 movement opposing Coca-Cola in India. This helps us offer an
 interpretation of this consumer movement involving spatial politics,
 temporal heterogeneity, appropriation of existing ideology, the use of
 consumption in ideology, and attempts to bring together a disparate set of
 actors in the movement. (c) 2009 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Emotional Persuasion: When the Valence versus the Resource Demands of Emotions Influence Consumers' Attitudes 
Abstract:
 Can properties of emotions other than valence influence consumers'
 responses to emotional ads? We show that consumers' processing motivation
 moderates whether their attitudes are based on the valence of or the
 resource demands imposed by the emotion featured in an ad. When motivation
 is low, consumers respond more favorably to positively versus negatively
 valenced emotional ads. However, when motivation is high, attitudes are
 more favorable when the magnitude of allocated resources matches that
 required to process the ad. Three studies identify three distinct
 properties of emotions (univalence, purity, and self-consciousness) that
 can influence the resource demands of an ad. (c) 2009 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Why Do Consumers Buy Extended Service Contracts? 
Abstract:
 We examine purchases of extended service contracts, which are essentially
 insurance products, for electronic products in a retail setting. The
 primary insurance purchase determinants are perceived probability of loss,
 extent of loss, risk aversion, and amount of insurance premium. We examine
 how product characteristics (hedonic/utilitarian, manufacturer's warranty)
 and retailer actions (promotions, feature advertising) influence the
 purchase of extended service contracts. We also investigate the impact of
 consumer characteristics (income, gender, and prior usage) on these
 insurance purchase determinants. To test the predictions, we use revealed
 preferences from panel data of electronic purchases across several product
 categories. (c) 2009 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..
