Title: The Storied Life of Singularized Objects: Forces of Agency and Network Transformation 
Abstract:
 Our study contributes to understanding the role of material culture in
 families. Findings from a longitudinal case study extend Kopytoff's theory
 of singularization by explaining what occurs between the singularization
 of a focal object and its recommodification. We uncover processes that
 move an already singularized object in and out of a network of practices,
 objects, and spaces; identify forces that constrain and empower a
 singularized object's agency within that network; and demonstrate network
 transformations that result from the focal object's movement. This
 extension explains some paradoxical findings in consumer research: how
 objects are granted agency even while displaced, when irreplaceable
 objects can be replaced, and why families sometimes displace central
 identity practices. (c) 2009 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Disambiguating the Role of Ambiguity in Perceptual Assimilation and Contrast Effects 
Abstract:
 We examine how perceptions of a product are affected by the presence of
 extreme exemplars and find that ambiguity of the product is an important
 moderator. When the target is a novel one, perceptions assimilate to the
 context, whereas when it is highly familiar, perceptions are immune to the
 influence of context. This is as predicted by the
 interpretation-comparison model. Contrary to this model, however, we find
 that effects on perceptions are not always assimilative in nature. When
 product ambiguity falls between the extremes of novel and highly familiar,
 a contrast effect in perception can occur. This is consistent with the
 selective accessibility model, which says that a perceptual contrast
 effect occurs when conditions orient respondents to dissimilarities rather
 than to similarities among context and target items. In the experiments
 conducted, context-induced response language effects were circumvented by
 employing forced-anchor scales. (c) 2009 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: The Effects of Advertising Copy on Sensory Thoughts and Perceived Taste 
Abstract:
 We propose that advertisement (ad) content for food products can affect
 taste perception by affecting sensory cognitions. Specifically, we show
 that multisensory ads result in higher taste perceptions than ads focusing
 on taste alone, with this result being mediated by the excess of positive
 over negative sensory thoughts. Since the ad effect is thoughts-driven or
 cognitive, restricting cognitive resources (imposing cognitive load)
 attenuates the enhancing effect of the multiple-sense ad. Our results are
 exhibited across three experiments and have many implications for
 cognition and sensory perception research within consumer behavior, as
 well as several practical implications. (c) 2009 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: The Persuasive Role of Incidental Similarity on Attitudes and Purchase Intentions in a Sales Context 
Abstract:
 This study examines the effects of incidental similarity shared between a
 salesperson and a potential customer. We show that an incidental
 similarity, such as a shared birthday or birthplace, can result in a more
 favorable attitude and a higher intention to purchase. We argue and find
 that the need for connectedness underlies its persuasive effects in an
 interpersonal context. In addition, we show that the valence of the
 salesperson's behavior and the possibility of an extended service
 relationship moderate the process. When the need for connectedness is
 mitigated, the positive effects of incidental similarity can be lost or
 even reversed. (c) 2009 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: The Development of Consumer-Based Consumption Constellations in Children 
Abstract:
 Three studies using multiple methodologies investigated the development of
 consumer-based consumption constellations in children, finding an
 increasing linear age trend in the number of products and brands children
 use to form constellations, the degree to which these elements display
 symbolic complementarity, and the accessibility of constellations in
 memory. However, by early adolescence, as stereotypes become stronger,
 constellations become smaller and less flexible. Although seventh graders
 use more products and brands to form constellations than younger children,
 they do so in place of other ways to define roles, such as personality
 traits, therefore forming constellations with fewer elements overall. By
 late adolescence, individuals develop more flexible constellations with a
 greater number of elements. (c) 2009 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Questing for Well-Being at Weight Watchers: The Role of the Spiritual-Therapeutic Model in a Support Group 
Abstract:
 Why do millions of consumers in the United States struggling with the
 consequences of overconsumption believe that membership in a support group
 is crucial to their well-being? We examine how Weight Watchers, the
 world's largest support group, aids its members' attempts at managing
 their overweight condition. This article advances the view that in the
 United States, support groups that are organized around issues of
 overconsumption, such as Weight Watchers, resonate with members' quest for
 well-being in light of the spiritual-therapeutic model. The
 spiritual-therapeutic model denotes the understanding of well-being
 inscribed within the contemporary American cultural milieu. We find that
 among Weight Watchers members in the United States, the support group acts
 as a venue for angst-alleviating therapeutic confession, fosters the
 enactment of the support group as a benevolent system of therapeutic
 oversight, and facilitates a revitalizing practice of autotherapeutic
 testimonial. (c) 2009 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Value from Regulatory Construal Fit: The Persuasive Impact of Fit between Consumer Goals and Message Concreteness 
Abstract:
 This research investigates the relationship between regulatory focus and
 construal level. The findings indicate that promotion-focused individuals
 are more likely to construe information at abstract, high levels, whereas
 those with a prevention focus are more likely to construe information at
 concrete, low levels (experiments 1 and 2). Further, such fit (vs. nonfit)
 between an individual's regulatory focus and the construal level at which
 information is represented leads to more favorable attitudes (experiments
 3 and 4) and enhances performance on a subsequent task (experiment 3).
 These outcomes occur because fit enhances engagement that in turn induces
 processing fluency and intensifies reactions. (c) 2009 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Pleasurable Surprises: A Cross-Cultural Study of Consumer Responses to Unexpected Incentives 
Abstract:
 Consumer reactions to a surprising event are generally stronger than those
 to an identical but unexpected event. But the experience of surprise
 differs across cultures. In this article, we examine differences between
 East Asian and Western emotional reactions to unexpected incentives. When
 given an unexpected gift, East Asians report less surprise and less
 pleasure than Westerners. East Asians' dampened pleasure is explained by
 their motivation to maintain balance and emotional control, which leads to
 a reappraisal of perceived likelihood. However, if the unexpected gift is
 attributed to good luck, which is a desirable form of the unexpected, East
 Asians experience even greater pleasure than Westerners. (c) 2009 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Contrast and Assimilation Effects of Processing Fluency 
Abstract:
 As processing difficulty associated with a product increases, information
 about a subsequently encountered product becomes easier to process,
 leading to more favorable evaluations of it (a contrast effect). If,
 however, the two products are categorized as part of the same overall
 experience, then the negative feelings elicited by increased processing
 difficulty of the first product transfer to the second product, leading to
 more unfavorable evaluations of it (an assimilation effect). Five studies
 identify the conditions in which the two processes occur and outline the
 various mechanisms that might underlie these effects. (c) 2009 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Sharing 
Abstract:
 Sharing is a fundamental consumer behavior that we have either tended to
 overlook or to confuse with commodity exchange and gift giving. Sharing is
 a distinct, ancient, and increasingly vital consumer research topic that
 bears on a broad array of consumption issues ranging from sharing
 household resources versus atomized family possessions to file sharing
 versus intellectual property rights. This theoretical review distinguishes
 between sharing in and sharing out, and suggests that sharing in dissolves
 interpersonal boundaries posed by materialism and possession attachment
 through expanding the aggregate extended self. However, such sharing is
 challenged by growing market commoditization. Implications for consumer
 theory and research are considered. (c) 2009 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: The Quest for Authenticity in Consumption: Consumers' Purposive Choice of Authentic Cues to Shape Experienced Outcomes 
Abstract:
 Drawing from image-elicited depth interviews, we investigate whether
 consumers pursue the consumption of authentic objects with specific
 personal goals in mind. We find that consumers are motivated to focus on
 those particular cues in objects that for them convey authenticity (what
 is genuine, real, and/or true) and that this decision-making process is
 driven by a desire to draw different identity benefits (control,
 connection, virtue) from authentic objects. Our interpretive analysis
 elaborates contributions to theorizing related to consumer agency in
 seeking authentic consumption experience. We provide cultural explanations
 for the desire to assert the authentic self in these particular ways. (c) 2009 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: To Each His Own? How Comparisons with Others Influence Consumers' Evaluations of Their Self-Designed Products 
Abstract:
 The vast majority of consumer behavior research has examined how consumers
 respond to products that are offered on a "take it or leave it" basis by
 the manufacturer. Self-design changes the rules substantially, allowing
 consumers to have much more control over the product's characteristics.
 This research examines the factors influencing consumers' evaluations of
 self-designed products. Three studies demonstrate that a superior fit
 between consumers' underlying preferences and their customized products
 cannot fully explain self-design evaluations. Comparisons with designers
 of comparable products can significantly influence evaluations as well.
 The first two experiments examine how social comparisons with the
 designers of similar "off-the-rack" products influence evaluations,
 identifying two key moderators useful in overcoming the negative effects
 of an upward comparison. A third study uses a real online design task to
 gain understanding of how the timing of the social comparison moderates
 the direction of the comparison (upward vs. equivalent) to influence
 evaluations. (c) 2009 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..
