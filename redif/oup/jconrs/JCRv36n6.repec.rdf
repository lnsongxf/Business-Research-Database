Title: The Disciplinary Status of Consumer Behavior: A Sociology of Science Perspective on Key Controversies 
Abstract:
 Critics within the consumer behavior field have consistently debated three
 fundamental issues about the field's defining properties and goals: (1)
 whether consumer behavior should be an independent discipline, (2) what is
 (and is not) consumer behavior, and (3) whether our field should be
 interdisciplinary. Taking the perspective of the sociology of science
 leads us to conclude that (1) consumer behavior is not an independent
 discipline; (2) consumer behavior is distinguished from other fields by
 its focus on a consumer role, emphasizing the acquisition, consumption,
 and disposal of marketplace products, services, and experiences; and (3)
 consumer behavior is not an interdisciplinary field. (c) 2009 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: I'll Have What She's Having: Effects of Social Influence and Body Type on the Food Choices of Others 
Abstract:
 This research examines how the body type of consumers affects the food
 consumption of other consumers around them. We find that consumers anchor
 on the quantities others around them select but that these portions are
 adjusted according to the body type of the other consumer. We find that
 people choose a larger portion following another consumer who first
 selects a large quantity but that this portion is significantly smaller if
 the other is obese than if she is thin. We also find that the adjustment
 is more pronounced for consumers who are low in appearance self-esteem and
 that it is attenuated under cognitive load. (c) 2009 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: The Comfort Food Fallacy: Avoiding Old Favorites in Times of Change 
Abstract:
 Consumers hold a common intuition about their preferences for familiar
 things (e.g., "comfort food") in times of upheaval. This lay theory holds
 that familiar goods are attractive as a respite from dynamic environments
 and reflects a naive prediction that familiar favorites ameliorate the
 cognitive or emotional load associated with change. Conversely, the
 research in this article finds that consumers are more rather than less
 likely to choose novel options during times of upheaval and suggests that
 this paradox may occur because of the discrepancy between consumers'
 strategic lay theories and more automatic mind-set influences. Five
 studies demonstrate (1) that the comfort food fallacy effect occurs for
 both food and nonfood choices (despite consumer predictions to the
 contrary), (2) that increasing consumers' perception of life change
 decreases choice of familiar favorites, and (3) that the effect disappears
 with high involvement. Understanding this paradox of comfort consumption
 may help both consumers and marketers promote positive change and
 innovation adoption. (c) 2009 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Revisiting Individual Choices in Group Settings: The Long and Winding (Less Traveled) Road? 
Abstract:
 This study revisits Ariely and Levav's previous findings in relation to
 consumers' need for variety when ordering (food or beverages) in a group
 setting. We examine how group opinion and unanimity can explain consumers'
 individual choice in a group setting. We hypothesize that the relationship
 between individual choice and group opinion is nonmonotonic as it is
 moderated by the degree of unanimity around an alternative. We demonstrate
 this effect in two empirical studies. We show that choice patterns are
 curvilinear, with previous findings accurately reflecting only specific
 sections of the overall pattern of individual choices in a group setting. (c) 2009 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: When Do Incidental Mood Effects Last? Lay Beliefs versus Actual Effects 
Abstract:
 In a series of studies we examine how incidental mood present at the time
 of an experience affects judgments made long after the mood has dissipated
 and compare this to lay beliefs about how mood affects memory-based
 judgments. We find that memory-based judgments are affected by incidental
 mood only when there is an external prompt to evaluate the stimulus in
 real time. This is contrasted with lay beliefs about the effects of mood,
 which are not sensitive to delay or to the presence of real-time
 evaluations. The mismatch between lay beliefs and actual effects leads
 consumers to distort previously unbiased memory-based judgments when they
 are reminded of the source of the incidental mood. (c) 2009 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Consumer Identity Work as Moral Protagonism: How Myth and Ideology Animate a Brand-Mediated Moral Conflict 
Abstract:
 Consumer researchers have tended to equate consumer moralism with
 normative condemnations of mainstream consumer culture. Consequently,
 little research has investigated the multifaceted forms of identity work
 that consumers can undertake through more diverse ideological forms of
 consumer moralism. To redress this theoretical gap, we analyze the
 adversarial consumer narratives through which a brand-mediated moral
 conflict is enacted. We show that consumers' moralistic identity work is
 culturally framed by the myth of the moral protagonist and further
 illuminate how consumers use this mythic structure to transform their
 ideological beliefs into dramatic narratives of identity. Our resulting
 theoretical framework explicates identity-value-enhancing relationships
 among mythic structure, ideological meanings, and marketplace resources
 that have not been recognized by prior studies of consumer identity work. (c) 2009 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: The Long and Short of It: Why Are Stocks with Shorter Runs Preferred? 
Abstract:
 This article examines how consumers process graphical financial
 information to estimate risk. We propose that consumers sample the local
 maxima and minima of a graph to infer the variation around a trend line,
 which is used to estimate risk. The local maxima and minima are more
 extreme the higher the run length of the stocks (the consecutive number of
 upward or downward movements of a price series with identical mean,
 variance, skewness, and kurtosis). Three experiments show that this leads
 to stocks with higher run lengths being perceived as riskier: the
 run-length effect. Importantly, the run-length effect is greater for
 investors who are more educated, are employed full time, trade more
 frequently, have had longer experience trading, and trade a wider range of
 financial instruments. Implications for the communication of financial
 products, public policy, and consumer welfare are discussed, as are
 theoretical implications for the processing of visual and financial
 information and behavioral finance. (c) 2009 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Will This Trip Really Be Exciting? The Role of Incidental Emotions in Product Evaluation 
Abstract:
 Two studies examine how different emotions of the same valence influence
 product evaluation when products make specific emotional claims. Vacation
 products with adventurous (serene) appeals were evaluated more favorably
 when participants felt excited (peaceful) rather than peaceful (excited).
 This emotion-congruency effect was not observed when participants were
 aware of the incidental nature of their feelings (study 1) and was
 mediated by the influence of feelings on participants' expectations that
 the product will deliver what it promises (study 2). The findings show
 that consumers differentiate between distinct positive emotions and use
 them as information in assessing a product's emotional claims. (c) 2009 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Choosing Your Future: Temporal Distance and the Balance between Self-Control and Indulgence 
Abstract:
 This article investigates how temporal distance influences consumers'
 self-control. We demonstrate that self-control is dependent on the content
 of currently active information in decisions for the future. When
 indulgence information is currently active, decisions for the future tend
 to be oriented toward self-control. When self-control information is
 currently active, decisions for the future tend to be oriented toward
 indulgence. In four experiments investigating two self-control domains
 (healthy eating and saving money), we find evidence for an information
 activation/inhibition account of the influence of temporal distance on
 self-control decisions. (c) 2009 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Believe Me, I Have No Idea What I'm Talking About: The Effects of Source Certainty on Consumer Involvement and Persuasion 
Abstract:
 This research explores the effect of source certainty-that is, the level
 of certainty expressed by a message source-on persuasion. The authors
 propose an incongruity hypothesis, suggesting that source certainty
 effects depend on perceived source expertise. In three experiments,
 consumers receive persuasive messages from sources of varying expertise
 and certainty. Across studies, low expertise sources violate expectancies,
 stimulate involvement, and promote persuasion when they express certainty,
 whereas high expertise sources violate expectancies, stimulate
 involvement, and promote persuasion when they express uncertainty. Thus,
 nonexpert (expert) sources can gain interest and influence by expressing
 certainty (uncertainty). (c) 2009 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: The Effects of Thin and Heavy Media Images on Overweight and Underweight Consumers: Social Comparison Processes and Behavioral Implications 
Abstract:
 This study examines how advertisements containing thin or heavy models
 influence the self-esteem of overweight, normal, and underweight
 consumers. Previous research has mainly examined the influences of
 variations of the comparison standard on self-evaluative outcomes, whereas
 we examine how the relative position of the self on the comparison
 dimension may moderate these effects. Three studies manipulated the size
 (thin vs. heavy) and extremity of the size (moderate vs. extreme) of
 advertising models and exposed these images to individuals differing in
 Body Mass Index (BMI) levels. Our findings indicate that social comparison
 processes and subsequent self-evaluative and behavioral outcomes are
 different for individuals differing in their BMI. (c) 2009 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Pragmatic Learning Theory: An Inquiry-Action Framework for Distributed Consumer Learning in Online Communities 
Abstract:
 We examine consumer social learning from distributed inquiry capabilities
 in online communities. Using an inquiry-action framework rooted in
 pragmatic learning theory, we longitudinally trace community inquiry
 processes and their link to individual action in six health-related online
 communities. Our interpretive analyses reveal leaps and lapses in social
 learning. Generative learning is evident when collective productive
 inquiry is linked to expanding individual action repertoires. Individual
 disengagement diverts inquiry and disrupts inquiry-action linkages,
 creating lapses that degenerate learning. Within these extremes, instances
 of individual faltering are evident when inquiry is productive but
 individuals fail to leverage inquiry for empowered action. (c) 2009 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..
