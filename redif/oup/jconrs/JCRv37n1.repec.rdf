Title: The Get Ready Mind-Set: How Gearing Up for Later Impacts Effort Allocation Now 
Abstract:
 People need to allocate their limited cognitive resources to current and
 future tasks. We provide evidence that anticipating the resource demands
 of a future task creates a "get ready mind-set" that mobilizes these
 resources. However, the mobilized resources for the future task can carry
 over to unrelated current tasks. This implies the counterintuitive notion
 that anticipating difficult tasks in the future leads to greater effort
 expenditure on unrelated tasks in the present. We also demonstrate that
 resource carryover is particularly likely when consumers' ability to
 separate tasks is low, whereas resource conservation is more likely when
 ability to separate is high. (c) 2009 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Context Effects from Bodily Sensations: Examining Bodily Sensations Induced by Flooring and the Moderating Role of Product Viewing Distance 
Abstract:
 When consumers shop, the flooring underfoot can prompt bodily sensations-a
 sense of comfort from soft carpeting or fatigue from hard tile flooring.
 Like moods, such bodily sensations may foster context effects on the
 products shoppers observe. However, whereas moods prompt only assimilation
 effects, we demonstrate that consumers' bodily sensations can produce
 either assimilation, contrast, or no context effects. Further, consumers'
 viewing distance from a product can determine the direction of such
 effects. Evidence attests that these effects are (a) prompted by bodily
 sensations, not conceptual knowledge, (b) rather limited in scope, and (c)
 reversible in direction under certain circumstances. (c) 2009 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Resisting That Triple-Chocolate Cake: Mental Budgets and Self-Control 
Abstract:
 This research examines whether mental budgets, defined as self-specified
 allowances for behaviors, can help with self-control. We theorize that
 mental budgets will lead to greater self-control when the avoidance
 aspects of the behavior are made salient and when the decision context
 allows easy monitoring of one's own behavior. Study 1 finds that mental
 budgets help reduce consumption of indulgent products when avoidance
 aspects of the behavior are made salient. Study 2 finds that even when
 avoidance aspects are made salient, mental budgets are effective only when
 option information enables monitoring of one's choices relative to the
 budget. Study 3 finds that external reference points (a feature of both
 studies 1 and 2) play a critical role in reducing consumption. Study 4
 extends the findings from studies 1 and 3 and finds that mental budgets
 are effective in enhancing self-control if the person also has a high
 chronic prevention focus. (c) 2009 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Toward a Theory of Status Consumption in Less Industrialized Countries 
Abstract:
 How does status consumption operate among the middle classes in less
 industrialized countries (LICs)-those classes that have the spending power
 to participate effectively in consumer culture? Globalization research
 suggests that Bourdieu's status consumption model, based upon Western
 research, does not provide an adequate explanation. And what we call the
 global trickle-down model, often invoked to explain LIC status
 consumption, is even more imprecise. We study the status consumption
 strategies of upper-middle-class Turkish women in order to revise three of
 Bourdieu's most important concepts-cultural capital, habitus, and
 consumption field-to propose a theory specific to the LIC context. We
 demonstrate that cultural capital is organized around orthodox practice of
 the Western Lifestyle myth, that cultural capital is deterritorialized and
 so accrues through distant textbook-like learning rather than via the
 habitus, and that the class faction with lower cultural capital
 indigenizes the consumption field to sustain a national social hierarchy. (c) 2009 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Lay Theories of Medicine and a Healthy Lifestyle 
Abstract:
 This research proposes that consumers hold "lay theories of medicine" that
 guide their preferences and behaviors in the health domain. Lay theories
 of medicine incorporate lay beliefs about illnesses and symptoms (i.e., a
 form of lay diagnosis that may feature causal [un]certainty) and lay
 beliefs about health remedies (i.e., a treatment function that takes into
 account how consumers think remedies work, including the focus and action
 rapidity of treatment as additional dimensions of response efficacy).
 According to the conceptual framework, lay diagnosis and treatment beliefs
 together drive consumer preference among alternative health remedies,
 which, in turn, has downstream consequences for a healthy lifestyle. A
 series of studies finds support for this framework in an investigation of
 Western medicine and its Eastern counterparts (traditional Chinese and
 Ayurvedic medicines) among Chinese, Indian, and Asian American consumers. (c) 2009 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Smart Subcategories: How Assortment Formats Influence Consumer Learning and Satisfaction 
Abstract:
 We show that formats used by retailers to organize assortments into
 subcategories can enhance or encumber consumers' learning and
 satisfaction. For more knowledgeable consumers, unexpected subcategory
 formats provide a newness cue, thereby increasing effort, learning, and
 satisfaction. That is, unexpected subcategory formats help more
 knowledgeable consumers overcome complacency and benefit more from their
 shopping experience. Conversely, unexpected subcategory formats lead to
 decreases in learning and satisfaction among lower prior knowledge
 consumers. Interestingly, we also find that consumers are relatively well
 calibrated with regard to the effects of more and less expected
 subcategory formats, anticipating that less expected formats may help more
 knowledgeable consumers. Taken together, these findings suggest that
 subcategory formats can be tailored to consumers' prior knowledge levels
 in ways that yield both expected and actual benefits. (c) 2009 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: A Generalizable Scale of Propensity to Plan: The Long and the Short of Planning for Time and for Money 
Abstract:
 Planning has pronounced effects on consumer behavior and intertemporal
 choice. We develop a six-item scale measuring individual differences in
 propensity to plan that can be adapted to different domains and used to
 compare planning across domains and time horizons. Adaptations tailored to
 planning time and money in the short run and long run each show strong
 evidence of reliability and validity. We find that propensity to plan is
 moderately domain-specific. Scale measures and actual planning measures
 show that for time, people plan much more for the short run than the long
 run; for money, short- and long-run planning differ less. Time and money
 adaptations of our scale exhibit sharp differences in nomological
 correlates; short-run and long-run adaptations differ less.
 Domain-specific adaptations predict frequency of actual planning in their
 respective domains. A "very long-run" money adaptation predicts FICO
 credit scores; low planners thus face materially higher cost of credit. (c) 2009 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Half the Thrill Is in the Chase: Twisted Inferences from Embodied Cognitions and Brand Evaluation 
Abstract:
 Do our bodies control our minds? That people approach positive outcomes is
 not surprising, but do people also infer an outcome is rewarding from
 their bodily sensation of approaching it, and does this positivity
 transfer indirectly to other outcomes linked in memory to the original
 negative outcome? We posit that, because people usually approach reward,
 they mistakenly infer that approach must equal reward. Thus, a sensation
 of approach, even toward a negative outcome, makes them feel more
 positively toward the negative outcome and associated outcomes. Experiment
 1 demonstrates a positive effect of embodied movement in space toward an
 otherwise aversive product. Experiments 2 and 3 additionally show positive
 effects of psychological movement in time, using evaluative conditioning
 procedures, to associated stimuli in memory. Implications for downward
 spirals in habit formation-the idea that approaching one bad habit might
 increase liking of other bad habits-and affect regulation are discussed. (c) 2009 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Product Scent and Memory 
Abstract:
 Scent research has focused primarily on the effects of ambient scent on
 consumer evaluations. We focus instead on the effects of product scent on
 consumer memories. For instance, if a pencil or a facial tissue is imbued
 with scent (vs. not), recall for the brand's other attributes increases
 significantly-with the effects lasting as much as 2 weeks after exposure.
 We also find that product scent is more effective than ambient scent at
 enhancing memory for product information. We suggest that this may be
 because, with product (ambient) scent, scent-related associations are
 focused on a single object (are diffused across multiple objects) in the
 environment. In support, we find that the memory effects are driven by the
 number of product/scent-related associations stored in long-term memory.
 The results suggest that, although ambient scent has received the bulk of
 attention from researchers and managers in recent years, greater focus on
 product scent is warranted. (c) 2009 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Veiling in Style: How Does a Stigmatized Practice Become Fashionable? 
Abstract:
 Although stigma is prevalent in everyday life, consumer researchers'
 interest on the topic remains scant and focuses mostly on stigma
 management. We move beyond individual coping strategies and examine the
 processes of stigmatization and destigmatization. Through an ethnographic
 study of fashion consumption practices of urban Turkish covered women, we
 explore how veiling, a deviant practice stigmatized in the secular and
 urban mind-set, first became an attractive choice for some middle-class
 women and then transformed into a fashionable and ordinary clothing
 practice for many. We map out the global multi-actored work that underlies
 the emergence of veiling as an attractive choice and explicate its gradual
 routinization and destigmatization. We discuss the findings in terms of
 their implications for understandings of choice and free will, the
 formative role of fashion in the evolution of a new habitus and social
 class, and the relationship between the market and religion. (c) 2010 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Counteractive Construal in Consumer Goal Pursuit 
Abstract:
 The present research explores a self-control operation, namely,
 counteractive construal, that helps consumers resolve the conflicts
 between an important goal and a short-term temptation by altering the
 construal of the temptation. We propose that when experiencing a
 self-control conflict, consumers intentionally construe temptation as more
 damaging to the attainment of a long-term goal and use these distorted
 construals to help resolve the conflict in favor of the goals. Four
 studies in two self-regulatory domains (a dieting goal and an academic
 goal) provided converging evidence for the counteractive construal
 hypothesis. We found that people who were experiencing self-control
 conflict expected tempting food items to contain more calories or expected
 parties to take more time away from studying and were consequently less
 interested in consuming these temptations. (c) 2009 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Talking to Ourselves: A Dialogical Exploration of Consumption Experiences 
Abstract:
 This article introduces the dialogical nature of self to study consumers'
 inner dialogs in order to understand consumers' marketplace decisions and
 conflicts. The authors explore the meaning of consumption at multiple self
 levels and dialogical relationships to manage differences. The study uses
 mixed methods including in-depth interviews, multidimensional scaling,
 cluster analysis, and metaphors to distill important voices in their
 informants. They find that the consumption stories vary across self
 levels. The meta-self level reflects a dispassionate representation of the
 primary I-positions in consumers and does not explain what the consumers
 experience at the time of actual consumption. An examination of
 inconsistent consumption preferences at the level of I-positions reveals
 that dialogical relationships labeled compartmentalization, compassion,
 negotiation, and coalition can avoid and manage conflicts, while
 relationships involving opposition and domination reflect unresolved
 conflicts. Suggestions to use the dialogical self model for addressing
 issues of negative selves, addictions, and domination in future research
 are provided. (c) 2009 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..
