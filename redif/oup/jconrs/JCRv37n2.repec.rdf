Title: Puffery in Advertisements: The Effects of Media Context, Communication Norms, and Consumer Knowledge 
Abstract:
 Ads often contain puffery-product descriptions that purport to be
 important but actually provide little if any meaningful information.
 Consumers' reactions to these descriptions depend on whether they perceive
 themselves to be more or less knowledgeable about the product than others
 whom the ad is specifically intended to influence. When an ad appears in a
 professional magazine that is read primarily by experts in the product
 domain, puffery generally increases the ad's effectiveness. This is also
 true when the ad appears in a popular magazine but readers perceive
 themselves to know less about the product than consumers at large. If
 readers believe they know as much as or more than general consumers,
 however, puffery decreases the ad's effectiveness. In addition, the media
 context in which an ad is encountered has a direct effect on judgments by
 consumers who perceive themselves to have little knowledge about the type
 of product being advertised. (c) 2010 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Changing the Future by Reshaping the Past: The Influence of Causal Beliefs on Estimates of Time to Onset 
Abstract:
 People sometimes feel the effect of product consumption almost
 instantaneously-within an unrealistically short time after consumption.
 Such placebo-like effects are typically attributed to conditioning,
 motivation, or expectations about product efficacy. The present research
 shows such effects can also occur because, under some conditions, people
 are more prone to underestimate the time to onset of products they have
 used in the past. These recollections of too short a time to onset alter
 people's experience of products and cause them to report more rapid
 effects. Participants who were led to believe there was a strong causal
 link between having consumed a product and improved performance on a task
 recalled that less time elapsed before they experienced an effect. In
 subsequent consumption, they felt comfortable using the product later in
 time, started working on a similar task earlier upon use, experienced the
 product's effect sooner, and were less inclined to switch to competing
 products. (c) 2010 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Language Abstraction in Word of Mouth 
Abstract:
 This research examines the language that consumers use in word of mouth.
 For both positive and negative product experiences, we demonstrate that
 consumers use more abstract terms when they describe experiences that are
 in line with the valence of their product attitude. This effect cannot be
 explained by differences in valence between abstract and concrete
 language. On the receiver side, abstract language in positive word of
 mouth leads to (1) the inference that the sender has a more favorable
 product attitude and (2) a higher buying intention for the product under
 consideration. The reverse is found for negative word of mouth. (c) 2010 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Small Sounds, Big Deals: Phonetic Symbolism Effects in Pricing 
Abstract:
 Studies suggest that certain vowel and consonant sounds (or phonemes) can
 be associated with perceptions of large and small size. Mental rehearsal
 of prices containing numbers with small phonemes results in overestimation
 of price discounts, whereas mental rehearsal of prices containing numbers
 with large phonemes results in underestimation. Mental rehearsal of the
 same sale prices characterized by small phonemes in one language and large
 phonemes in another language can yield differential effects. For example,
 when sale prices are rehearsed in English, an <inline-formula><tex-math

Title: Does Choice Mean Freedom and Well-Being? 
Abstract:
 Americans live in a political, social, and historical context that values
 personal freedom and choice above all else, an emphasis that has been
 amplified by contemporary psychology. However, this article reviews
 research that shows that in non-Western cultures and among working-class
 Westerners, freedom and choice do not have the meaning or importance they
 do for the university-educated people who have been the subjects of almost
 all research on this topic. We cannot assume that choice, as understood by
 educated, affluent Westerners, is a universal aspiration. The meaning and
 significance of choice are cultural constructions. Moreover, even when
 choice can foster freedom, empowerment, and independence, it is not an
 unalloyed good. Too much choice can produce a paralyzing uncertainty,
 depression, and selfishness. In the United States, the path to well-being
 may require that we strike a balance between the positive and negative
 consequences of proliferating choice in every domain of life. (c) 2010 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Reconsidering Baron and Kenny: Myths and Truths about Mediation Analysis 
Abstract:
 Baron and Kenny's procedure for determining if an independent variable
 affects a dependent variable through some mediator is so well known that
 it is used by authors and requested by reviewers almost reflexively. Many
 research projects have been terminated early in a research program or
 later in the review process because the data did not conform to Baron and
 Kenny's criteria, impeding theoretical development. While the technical
 literature has disputed some of Baron and Kenny's tests, this literature
 has not diffused to practicing researchers. We present a nontechnical
 summary of the flaws in the Baron and Kenny logic, some of which have not
 been previously noted. We provide a decision tree and a step-by-step
 procedure for testing mediation, classifying its type, and interpreting
 the implications of findings for theory building and future research. (c) 2010 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: The Many Shades of Rose-Colored Glasses: An Evolutionary Approach to the Influence of Different Positive Emotions 
Abstract:
 We present an evolutionary framework for examining the influence of
 different positive emotions on cognition and behavior. Testing this
 framework, we investigate how two positive emotions-pride and
 contentment-influence product desirability. Three experiments show that
 different positive emotions (compared with a neutral control condition)
 have specific effects on judgment that are consistent with the proposed
 underlying evolved function of each positive emotion. As predicted by the
 framework, the specific influences of pride and contentment on product
 desirability are mediated by the triggering of emotion-specific functional
 motives. Overall, an evolutionary approach presents important research
 implications and practical applications for how and why discernible
 positive and negative emotions influence thinking and behavior. We discuss
 the implications of an evolutionary approach for the study of emotions,
 highlighting key similarities and differences between this and other
 approaches, as well as noting the advantages of incorporating an
 evolutionary approach. (c) 2010 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Witnessing Incivility among Employees: Effects on Consumer Anger and Negative Inferences about Companies 
Abstract:
 We introduce the incivility construct and demonstrate that witnessing an
 incident of employee-employee incivility causes consumers to make negative
 generalizations about (a) others who work for the firm, (b) the firm as a
 whole, and (c) future encounters with the firm, inferences that go well
 beyond the incivility incident. We demonstrate the process by which these
 effects occur, showing that anger at the uncivil employee induces these
 effects. We find that anger leads to rumination about the uncivil
 encounter and causes customers to make quicker and more negative
 generalizations about related entities. We also identify boundary
 conditions for the relationship between incivility and negative
 generalizations. These process and boundary condition results add
 theoretically to the literature on incivility as well as that on anger's
 effect on information processing. (c) 2010 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Nonprofits Are Seen as Warm and For-Profits as Competent: Firm Stereotypes Matter 
Abstract:
 Consumers use warmth and competence, two fundamental dimensions that
 govern social judgments of people, to form perceptions of firms. Three
 experiments showed that consumers perceive nonprofits as being warmer than
 for-profits but as less competent. Further, consumers are less willing to
 buy a product made by a nonprofit than a for-profit because of their
 perception that the firm lacks competence. Consequently, when perceived
 competence of a nonprofit is boosted through subtle cues that connote
 credibility, discrepancies in willingness to buy disappear. In fact, when
 consumers perceive high levels of competence and warmth, they feel
 admiration for the firm-which translates to consumers' increased desire to
 buy. This work highlights the importance of consumer stereotypes about
 nonprofit and for-profit companies that, at baseline, come with opposing
 advantages and disadvantages but that can be altered. (c) 2010 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Planning to Make Unplanned Purchases? The Role of In-Store Slack in Budget Deviation 
Abstract:
 We propose that consumers have mental budgets for grocery trips that are
 typically composed of both an itemized portion and in-store slack. We
 conceptualize the itemized portion as the amount that the consumer has
 allocated to spend on items planned to the brand or product level and the
 in-store slack as the portion of the mental budget that is not assigned to
 be spent on any particular product but remains available for in-store
 decisions. Using a secondary data set and a field study, we find incidence
 of in-store slack. Moreover, we find support for our framework predicting
 that the relationship between in-store slack and budget deviation (the
 amount by which actual spending deviates from the mental trip budget)
 depends on factors related to desire and willpower. (c) 2010 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Consumer Expectations and Culture: The Effect of Belief in Karma in India 
Abstract:
 In the customer expectations arena, relatively little attention has been
 paid to the impact on expectations of variation in cultural variables
 unique to a country. Here we focus on one country, India, and a major
 cultural influence there-the extent of belief in karma. Prior research in
 the United States suggests that disconfirmation sensitivity lowers
 expectations. Here we examine whether belief in karma and, consequently,
 having a long-term orientation, counteracts the tendency to lower
 expectations in two studies that measure and prime respondents' belief in
 karma. Results show that the extent of belief in karma, operating largely
 through its impact on long-run orientation, does moderate (decrease) the
 effect of disconfirmation sensitivity on expectations. These findings
 suggest that it is important to tailor advertising messages by matching
 them with customer expectations and their cultural determinants. (c) 2010 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Goal Management in Sequential Choices: Consumer Choices for Others Are More Indulgent than Personal Choices 
Abstract:
 What are the differences in exerting self-control in sequential choices
 when consumers choose for others (family or friends) rather than for
 themselves? Sequential choices represent an opportunity to manage the
 pursuit of one's multiple personal goals. Consumers typically manage these
 personal goals by combining indulgent and virtuous choices. When choosing
 for others, however, this is not the case. Consumers then focus on a
 pleasure-seeking goal, which leads to indulgent choices for others. Six
 experiments demonstrate this phenomenon and uncover conditions that
 encourage more virtuous choices for others. (c) 2010 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..
