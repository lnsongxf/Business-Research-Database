Title: Can There Ever Be Too Many Options? A Meta-Analytic Review of Choice Overload 
Abstract:
 The choice overload hypothesis states that an increase in the number of
 options to choose from may lead to adverse consequences such as a decrease
 in the motivation to choose or the satisfaction with the finally chosen
 option. A number of studies found strong instances of choice overload in
 the lab and in the field, but others found no such effects or found that
 more choices may instead facilitate choice and increase satisfaction. In a
 meta-analysis of 63 conditions from 50 published and unpublished
 experiments (N = 5,036), we found a mean effect size of virtually zero but
 considerable variance between studies. While further analyses indicated
 several potentially important preconditions for choice overload, no
 sufficient conditions could be identified. However, some idiosyncratic
 moderators proposed in single studies may still explain when and why
 choice overload reliably occurs; we review these studies and identify
 possible directions for future research. (c) 2010 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: When Healthy Food Makes You Hungry 
Abstract:
 Do subtle cues for imposed healthy eating make consumers hungry? Imposed
 healthy eating signals that the health goal was sufficiently met, and thus
 it increases the strength of the conflicting motive to fulfill one's
 appetite. Accordingly, consumers asked to sample an item framed as healthy
 later reported being hungrier and consumed more food than those who
 sampled the same item framed as tasty or those who did not eat at all.
 These effects of healthy eating depend on the consumer's perception that
 healthy eating is mandatory; therefore, only imposed healthy eating made
 consumers hungrier, whereas freely choosing to eat healthy did not
 increase hunger. (c) 2010 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Dimensional Range Overlap and Context Effects in Consumer Judgments 
Abstract:
 What is it about context that determines whether a target will be
 assimilated to the context or contrasted away from it? We suggest that it
 is the dimensional overlap in the range of values that contextual and
 target stimuli might take. Four experiments demonstrate that overlap or
 lack thereof between context and target ranges determines context effects.
 Assimilation occurs when the context and target ranges overlap, but
 contrast occurs when the ranges do not overlap. Furthermore, perceptions
 of amount of overlap or lack thereof determine the amount of assimilation
 or contrast. These results occur regardless of whether research
 participants are asked to explicitly consider ranges or not prior to
 judgment, whether the context consists of attributes or exemplars, and
 whether the target is novel or familiar. (c) 2010 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Semiotic Structure and the Legitimation of Consumption Practices: The Case of Casino Gambling 
Abstract:
 How do changes in public discourse and regulatory structure affect the
 acceptance of a consumption practice? Previous research on legitimacy in
 consumer behavior has focused on the consumer reception of legitimizing
 discourse rather than on the historical process of legitimation itself.
 This study examines the influence of changes in the institutional
 environment over time on the meaning structures that influence consumer
 perception and practice. To study legitimation as a historical process, a
 discourse analysis of newspaper articles about casino gambling from
 1980-2007 was conducted. Results show that the regulatory approval of
 gambling is accompanied by a shift in the semantic categories used to
 discuss casinos and that journalists play a role in shaping these
 categories. Further, journalists shape the meaning of a consumption
 practice in three ways: through selection, validation, and realization.
 Interpreted through the lens of institutional theory, these findings
 suggest that studies of legitimation should consider changes in public
 discourse and legal regulation in addition to consumer perceptions of
 legitimacy. (c) 2010 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Street Art, Sweet Art? Reclaiming the "Public" in Public Place 
Abstract:
 Consumer research has paid scant attention to public goods, especially at
 a time when the contestation between categorizing public and private goods
 and controlling public goods is pronounced. In this multisited
 ethnography, we explore the ways in which active consumers negotiate
 meanings about the consumption of a particular public good, public space.
 Using the context of street art, we document four main ideologies of
 public space consumption that result from the interaction, both conflict
 and common intent, of urban dwellers and street artists. We show how
 public space can be contested as private and commercialized, or offered
 back as a collective good, where sense of belonging and dialogue restore
 it to a meaningful place. We demonstrate how the common nature of space
 both stimulates dialectical and dialogical exchanges across stakeholders
 and fuels forms of layered agency. (c) 2010 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Still Preoccupied with 1995: The Need to Belong and Preference for Nostalgic Products 
Abstract:
 This research examines the conditions under which consumers experience an
 increased preference for nostalgic products, such as previously popular
 movies, television programs, foods, or automobiles. Specifically,
 participants for whom the need to belong is an active goal experience a
 significantly stronger preference for nostalgic products than do
 participants for whom this is not an active goal. This preference holds
 both when the need to belong is activated in an ego-threatening manner,
 such as after being socially ostracized, and when it is activated in a
 non-ego-threatening manner, such as when the interdependent self is
 primed. Furthermore, the consumption of nostalgic products, rather than
 the exposure to or the mere selection of nostalgic products, successfully
 satiates the need to belong. (c) 2010 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Motivational Compatibility and Choice Conflict 
Abstract:
 For most forms of conscious consumer choice, product attributes serve as
 the means that consumers use to accomplish their goals. Because there is
 competition between products in the marketplace, consumption decisions
 typically present conflict between means to achieve a goal. In this
 article, we examine the consequences of conflict between regulatory means
 on consumers' decisions and show that its resolution depends on whether
 the means-that is, the attributes-are compatible with the consumer's
 regulatory orientation. We show that compatibility with more than one
 attribute arouses acute decision conflict and evokes decision processes
 that result in a pronounced tendency to make counternormative choices. We
 also show that incompatibility with a product's attributes leads to
 choosing extreme alternatives, which suggests the presence of a
 "pick-your-poison" effect. We test our hypotheses using the attraction,
 compromise, and deferral paradigms. We close by discussing our results in
 the context of the Lewinian view of decision conflict. (c) 2010 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Narrative and Persuasion in Fashion Advertising 
Abstract:
 Narrative transportation-to be carried away by a story-has been proposed
 as a distinct route to persuasion. But as originally conceived, narrative
 transportation is unlikely to occur in response to advertisements, where
 persuasive intent is obvious and consumer resistance is expected. We
 analyze fashion ads to show how narrative transportation can nonetheless
 be a possible response to ads, if specific aesthetic properties are
 present, most notably when grotesque imagery is used. We then situate
 narrative transportation as one of five modes of engaging fashion
 advertising, each of which serves as a distinct route to persuasion.
 Interviews showed that consumers variously engage ads to act, identify,
 feel, transport, or immerse. We explain how aesthetic properties of ads
 call forth different modes of engagement and explore how grotesque imagery
 can lead to either narrative transportation or immersion. As routes to
 persuasion, transportation and immersion work by intensifying brand
 experience rather than boosting brand evaluation. (c) 2010 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Consumer Reactions to Brand Extensions in a Competitive Context: Does Fit Still Matter? 
Abstract:
 Research indicates that reactions to brand extensions are influenced by
 the fit between the parent brand and the extension product category. The
 normative nature of this effect is limited because assessments of brand
 extensions are typically obtained in the absence of competition. The
 boundaries of prior research are investigated by testing whether the
 fit-extension relationship generalizes to scenarios that include
 relatively more or less familiar competitor brands. Support is found for
 this relationship in noncompetitive scenarios but is diminished by
 competitors' relative brand familiarity. Perceived risk mediates the
 effects of fit in noncompetitive settings and competitor brand familiarity
 in competitive settings. (c) 2010 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: You Like What I Like, but I Don't Like What You Like: Uniqueness Motivations in Product Preferences 
Abstract:
 Consumers often gauge their own and others' preferences for products
 through social comparisons. This research examines the role of consumers'
 need for uniqueness (CNFU) in two common social comparisons: projection
 and introjection. Consumers project (i.e., rely on their own preferences
 to estimate those of others), regardless of their CNFU. However, high-CNFU
 consumers are less likely than low-CNFU ones to introject (i.e., rely on
 estimates of others' preferences to gauge their own). Moreover,
 alleviating the introjection-induced threat to the high-CNFU consumers'
 self-concept by having them deliberate on their differentness from others
 increases their likelihood of introjection. Together, these findings
 confirm our basic contention that the process underlying introjection is
 more motivational in nature than that underlying projection. (c) 2010 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Feeling Mixed but Not Torn: The Moderating Role of Construal Level in Mixed Emotions Appeals 
Abstract:
 This research examines how construal level (i.e., how abstractly or
 concretely people represent information in memory) affects consumers'
 responses to mixed emotions appeals. The results of five studies show
 that, consistent with prior research, participants experienced discomfort
 when they encountered mixed emotions appeals and developed less favorable
 attitudes toward the ad relative to pure positive emotional appeals, but
 this was the case only for those who construed information at a concrete,
 low level. Participants who construed information at an abstract, high
 level did not experience much discomfort; hence, they found mixed emotions
 and pure positive emotional appeals equally persuasive. We further
 demonstrate that the chronic construal level associated with people's age
 and cultural background underlies the moderating effects of age and
 culture on consumers' attitudes toward mixed emotions appeals documented
 in prior research. (c) 2010 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Evaluative Conditioning Procedures and the Resilience of Conditioned Brand Attitudes 
Abstract:
 Changing brand attitudes by pairing a brand with affectively laden stimuli
 such as celebrity endorsers or pleasant pictures is called evaluative
 conditioning. We show that this attitude change can occur in two ways,
 depending on how brands and affective stimuli are presented. Attitude
 change can result from establishing a memory link between brand and
 affective stimulus (indirect attitude change) or from direct "affect
 transfer" from affective stimulus to brand (direct attitude change).
 Direct attitude change is significantly more robust than indirect attitude
 change, for example, to changes in the valence of affective stimuli
 (unconditioned stimulus revaluation: e.g., endorsers falling from grace),
 to interference by subsequent information (e.g., advertising clutter), and
 to persuasion knowledge activation (e.g., consumer suspicion about being
 influenced). Indirect evaluative conditioning requires repeated
 presentations of a brand with the same affective stimulus. Direct
 evaluative conditioning requires simultaneous presentation of a brand with
 different affective stimuli. (c) 2010 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Commentary on Scheibehenne, Greifeneder, and Todd<break></break>Choice Overload: Is There Anything to It? 
Abstract:
 Can there ever be too many options? We argue that because choice overload
 has multiple antecedents, simply searching for a main effect across all
 conditions and a single "sufficient" condition that is likely to solely
 predict this effect is not informative. Moreover, because prior research
 has documented multiple instances in which an abundance of options leads
 to choice overload, the interesting question is not whether choice
 overload occurs but when it occurs. The answer to this question is
 unlikely to stem from testing for the presence of a single main effect
 using the traditional meta-analytic approach. Instead, research would
 benefit from a theory-based meta-analysis that tests the validity of a
 conceptual model of choice overload capturing the underlying psychological
 processes. (c) 2010 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..
