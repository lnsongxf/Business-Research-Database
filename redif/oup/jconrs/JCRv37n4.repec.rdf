Title: Fragile Enhancement of Attitudes and Intentions Following Difficult Decisions 
Abstract:
 Increased liking of one's choice following difficult decisions (e.g.,
 choosing between similarly attractive options) is well documented. Given
 the common mechanism proposed for this effect-a highly involving
 dissonance reduction process-it would be reasonable to expect such choice
 enhancement to be quite durable and resistant to later change. Instead, we
 show the contrary: that difficulty-driven choice enhancement is
 exceptionally fragile, collapsing easily against even minor attack. In
 three experiments, consumers make easy or difficult product choices,
 report attitudes toward their choice, and subsequently encounter a
 negative customer review. Compared to easy decisions, difficult decisions
 lead to more extreme initial positivity toward chosen products but also to
 more vulnerability to subsequent attack. Moreover, this fragile
 enhancement effect is exacerbated, not ameliorated, by choice involvement.
 Thus, making difficult decisions between similarly attractive options may
 motivate a bubble-like inflation of positivity that has some semblance of
 strength yet remains highly prone to collapse. (c) 2010 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: How Mainstream Consumers Think about Consumer Rights and Responsibilities 
Abstract:
 This article examines how mainstream consumer thinking is structured in
 order to form opinions about consumer rights, government regulation, and
 individual responsibility in the credit card setting. A broader political
 ideology-one that intertwines consumption practices with a causal
 narrative of business, society, and state-infuses consumer opinions. The
 article finds that four sociohistorically shaped political myths compete
 in this ideological space: individual autonomy, social equality, consumer
 sovereignty, and corporate dominance. Consumers negotiate tensions between
 each of these four myths-for example, individual autonomy versus social
 equality, and consumer sovereignty versus corporate dominance. This
 ideology triggers moral judgments among consumers about self and others
 that inform their perceptions of deservedness and apportions degrees of
 responsibility and blame across consumer, business, and government
 participants. (c) 2010 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: The Influence of Implicit Attitudes on Choice When Consumers Are Confronted with Conflicting Attribute Information 
Abstract:
 An important issue in consumer behavior is whether affect created by
 low-level processes, such as evaluative conditioning, will influence brand
 choice when consumers have also been exposed to relevant product
 information. To examine this issue, in two experiments implicit attitudes
 were created by evaluative conditioning where the participants were
 unaware of the contingencies. This creates an "I like it, but I don't know
 why" effect. The participants also had conflicting product information
 available in memory. We find that the participants rely on their implicit
 attributes when making a brand choice if they have not formed an explicit
 evaluation based on the product attribute information. This occurs even
 when the attribute information is available in memory and the participants
 are highly motivated to retrieve it. These findings provide evidence that
 implicit attitudes can have a significant influence on behavior, despite
 conflicting product information, and increased levels of motivation and
 opportunity. (c) 2010 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Letting Good Opportunities Pass Us By: Examining the Role of Mind-Set during Goal Pursuit 
Abstract:
 It is generally accepted that forming an implementation intention promotes
 goal pursuit and achievement. Forming an implementation intention
 encourages people to develop a plan, to prepare for events that allow for
 the execution of the plan, and to efficiently respond to these
 opportunities. Yet, forming an implementation intention may not be
 universally beneficial. An implementation intention may encourage the use
 of means that are part of the plan but may discourage the use of
 efficacious means that are not part of the plan. Four experiments show
 that forming an implementation intention decreases the likelihood of
 responding to goal-directed, out-of-plan behaviors when a person is in a
 concrete mind-set. Limitations, implications, and directions for future
 research are discussed. (c) 2010 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Bridging Aficionados' Perceptual and Conceptual Knowledge to Enhance How They Learn from Experience 
Abstract:
 The aficionado consumer is one who consumes and enjoys a hedonic product
 regularly but has failed to obtain product expertise from his/her many
 experiences. We conceptualize the aficionado as having asymmetric
 perceptual and conceptual knowledge and posit that when these two types of
 knowledge are bridged with a sensory consumption vocabulary, the
 aficionados are better able to learn from their experiences. In experiment
 1, we find that providing aficionados a cross-modal learning tool (wine
 aroma wheel) during their tasting helps them strengthen their experiential
 memory and withstand influence from misleading marketing communications.
 We also find that when aficionados are presented with a misleading
 consumption vocabulary during their tasting, they more readily accept the
 marketing misinformation that results in memory distortion. In experiment
 2, we find that accurate multisensory information delivered through either
 the wine aroma wheel or advertising can enhance how aficionados learn from
 their direct tasting experience. (c) 2010 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: How Endowed versus Earned Progress Affects Consumer Goal Commitment and Motivation 
Abstract:
 Because consumers ask different questions to establish commitment at
 beginning versus advanced stages of goal pursuit, we propose that progress
 that they attribute to themselves and to the situation will have a
 distinctive impact on motivation, depending on their relative position in
 goal pursuit. When progress on achieving a goal is low, people are
 concerned about its attainability. Because attributing low progress to
 self (vs. to the situation) signals a higher difficulty of goal
 attainment, it leads to lower goal commitment and, subsequently, decreased
 motivation. Conversely, when progress on achieving the goal is high and
 attainment of the goal is relatively secured, people are more concerned
 about the value of the goal. Because attributing a high progress to self
 (vs. to the situation) signals a greater value of the goal, it should lead
 to greater goal commitment and, subsequently, higher motivation. (c) 2010 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Subtle Signals of Inconspicuous Consumption 
Abstract:
 While theories of signaling and conspicuous consumption suggest that more
 explicit markers facilitate communication, this article examines the
 utility of subtle signals. Four studies demonstrate that while less
 explicit branding increases the likelihood of misidentification (e.g.,
 observers confusing a high-end purchase for a cheaper alternative), people
 with more cultural capital in a particular domain prefer subtle signals
 because they provide differentiation from the mainstream. Such insiders
 have the necessary connoisseurship to decode the meaning of subtle signals
 that facilitate communication with others "in the know." Consistent with
 the notion that these effects are driven by outward communication, they
 are stronger in identity-relevant product domains and situations where
 consumption is more public. This work highlights the communication value
 of less explicit signals and discusses the implications for branding,
 signal persistence, and the communication of identity. (c) 2010 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Positive Mood and Resistance to Temptation: The Interfering Influence of Elevated Arousal 
Abstract:
 We investigate the interfering influence of elevated arousal on the impact
 of positive mood on resistance to temptation. Three studies demonstrate
 that when a temptation activates long-term health goals, baseline positive
 mood facilitates resistance to temptation in (1) the choice between two
 snack items, one of which is more unhealthy, sinful, and hard to resist
 (M&Ms) than the other (grapes) and (2) the monitoring of consumption when
 the sinful option is chosen. However, this influence is attenuated when
 positive mood is accompanied by elevated arousal. We demonstrate that the
 cognitive depletion that accompanies elevated arousal interferes with the
 self-regulatory focus of positive mood, decreasing resistance to
 temptation. (c) 2010 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Regulatory Focus, Regulatory Fit, and the Search and Consideration of Choice Alternatives 
Abstract:
 This research investigates the effects of regulatory focus on alternative
 search and consideration set formation in consumer decision making.
 Results from three experiments yield two primary findings. First,
 promotion-focused consumers tend to search for alternatives at a more
 global level, whereas prevention-focused consumers tend to search for
 alternatives at a more local level. Second, promotion-focused consumers
 tend to have larger consideration sets than do prevention-focused
 consumers. Building on these two primary findings, it is additionally
 shown that whereas promotion-focused consumers attach relatively greater
 value to options chosen from hierarchically structured sets,
 prevention-focused consumers attach relatively greater value to options
 chosen from nonhierarchically structured item lists. Finally, whereas
 promotion-focused consumers attach significantly greater value to options
 chosen from larger sets than to options chosen from smaller sets,
 prevention-focused consumers do not attach significantly less value to
 options chosen from larger sets than to options chosen from smaller sets. (c) 2010 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Practice Makes Perfect? When Does Massed Learning Improve Product Usage Proficiency? 
Abstract:
 Previous research has shown that spacing of information (over time) leads
 to better learning of product information. We develop a theoretical
 framework to describe how massed or spaced learning schedules interact
 with different learning styles to influence product usage proficiency. The
 core finding is that with experiential learning, proficiency in a product
 usage task is better under massed conditions, whereas with verbal
 learning, spacing works better. This effect is demonstrated for usage
 proficiency assessed via speed as well as quality of use. Further, massed
 learning also results in better usage proficiency on transfer tasks, for
 both experiential and verbal learning. We also find that massed learning
 in experiential learning conditions leads not only to better usage
 proficiency but also to positive perceptions of the product. Overall, the
 pattern of results is consistent with a conceptual mapping account, with
 massed experiences leading to a superior mental model of usage and thus to
 better usage proficiency. (c) 2010 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Got to Get You into My Life: Do Brand Personalities Rub Off on Consumers? 
Abstract:
 When consumers use brands with appealing personalities, does the brand's
 personality "rub off" on them? The answer is yes, but only for consumers
 who hold certain beliefs about their personality. Entity theorists
 perceive themselves to be better looking, more feminine, and more
 glamorous after using a Victoria's Secret shopping bag (study 1) and more
 intelligent, more of a leader, and harder working after using an MIT pen
 (study 2); incremental theorists are unaffected. In two subsequent
 studies, we find that entity theorists use brands with appealing
 personalities to signal their positive qualities, thereby enhancing
 self-perceptions in line with the brand's personality. These findings
 implicate implicit self-theories as a key factor in understanding how
 brand experiences affect consumers. (c) 2010 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..

Title: Tracking Costs of Time and Money: How Accounting Periods Affect Mental Accounting 
Abstract:
 After people incur costs to get future benefits, they usually track these
 costs in their mental accounts and are keen to receive the benefits when
 they become available. We introduce the notion that costs and benefits can
 occur either in the same accounting period (day, season, etc.) or in
 different periods. Our key argument is that monetary costs are tracked
 across accounting periods but that temporal costs are written off at the
 end of the period in which they are incurred. Thus, accounting periods
 lead to a time-money asymmetry in the tracking of costs and, consequently,
 in the likelihood of seeking benefits. In a laboratory study, an
 online-panel study, and a field study with movie-theater patrons, we
 demonstrate how this relationship among accounting periods, cost tracking,
 and benefit seeking is different for time than for money. Our findings
 offer insights into the sunk-cost effect, time-money differences, and
 mental accounting. (c) 2010 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc..
