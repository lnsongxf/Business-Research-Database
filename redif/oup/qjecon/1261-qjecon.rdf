Title: Comparing open and Sealed Bid Auctions: Evidence from Timber Auctions 
Abstract:
 We study entry and bidding patterns in sealed bid and open auctions. Using
 data from the U.S. Forest Service timber auctions, we document a set of
 systematic effects: sealed bid auctions attract more small bidders, shift
 the allocation toward these bidders, and can also generate higher revenue.
 A private value auction model with endogenous participation can account
 for these qualitative effects of auction format. We estimate the model's
 parameters and show that it can explain the quantitative effects as well.
 We then use the model to assess bidder competitiveness, which has
 important consequences for auction design.  Copyright 2011, Oxford University Press.

Title: Macroeconomic Effects From Government Purchases and Taxes<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32"></xref> 
Abstract:
 For U.S. annual data that include World War II, the estimated multiplier
 for temporary defense spending is 0.4--0.5 contemporaneously and 0.6--0.7
 over 2 years. If the change in defense spending is "permanent" (gauged by
 Ramey's defense news variable), the multipliers are higher by 0.1--0.2.
 Since all estimated multipliers are significantly less than 1, greater
 spending crowds out other components of GDP, particularly investment. The
 lack of good instruments prevents estimation of reliable multipliers for
 nondefense purchases; multipliers in the literature of two or more likely
 reflect reverse causation from GDP to nondefense purchases. Increases in
 average marginal income tax rates (measured by a newly constructed time
 series) have significantly negative effects on GDP. When interpreted as a
 tax multiplier, the magnitude is around 1.1. The combination of the
 estimated spending and tax multipliers implies that the balanced-budget
 multiplier for defense spending is negative. We have some evidence that
 tax changes affect GDP mainly through substitution effects, rather than
 wealth effects.  Copyright 2011, Oxford University Press.

Title: Estimating Cross-Country Differences in Product Quality 
Abstract:
 We develop a method for decomposing countries' observed export prices into
 quality versus quality-adjusted components using information contained in
 trade balances. Holding observed export prices constant, countries with
 trade surpluses are inferred to offer higher quality than countries
 running trade deficits. We account for variation in trade balances induced
 by horizontal and vertical differentiation, and we estimate the evolution
 of manufacturing quality for top exporters from 1989 to 2003. We find that
 observed unit value ratios can be a poor approximation for relative
 quality differences, countries' quality is converging more rapidly than
 their income, and countries appear to vary in terms of displaying
 "high-quality" versus "low-price" growth strategies.  Copyright 2011, Oxford University Press.

Title: Depression Babies: Do Macroeconomic Experiences Affect Risk Taking? 
Abstract:
 We investigate whether individual experiences of macroeconomic shocks
 affect financial risk taking, as often suggested for the generation that
 experienced the Great Depression. Using data from the Survey of Consumer
 Finances from 1960 to 2007, we find that individuals who have experienced
 low stock market returns throughout their lives so far report lower
 willingness to take financial risk, are less likely to participate in the
 stock market, invest a lower fraction of their liquid assets in stocks if
 they participate, and are more pessimistic about future stock returns.
 Those who have experienced low bond returns are less likely to own bonds.
 Results are estimated controlling for age, year effects, and household
 characteristics. More recent return experiences have stronger effects,
 particularly on younger people.  Copyright 2011, Oxford University Press.

Title: The Role of Dispute Settlement Procedures in International Trade Agreements 
Abstract:
 Although disputes are typically treated as synonymous with concerns about
 enforcement in economic models of trade agreements, in reality most WTO
 disputes seem to concern the interpretation of vague provisions, or
 instances where the agreement is silent. And some have suggested that the
 WTO's Dispute Settlement Body (DSB) could usefully grant exceptions to
 rigid contractual obligations. These activist DSB roles could help
 "complete" an incomplete contract. But how activist should the DSB be?
 Should DSB rulings set precedent? We address these questions by
 characterizing the optimal choice of contract form and DSB mandate under
 various contracting conditions. JEL Codes: D02, D78, D86, F13, K12, K33.  Copyright 2011, Oxford University Press.

Title: Financial Contracting Under Imperfect Enforcement 
Abstract:
 We develop a model of financial contracting under imperfect enforcement.
 Financial contracts are designed to keep entrepreneurs from diverting
 project returns, but enforcement is probabilistic and penalties are
 limited. The model rationalizes the prevalence of straight debt and common
 stock, and its predictions are consistent with a host of empirical capital
 structure regularities.  Copyright 2011, Oxford University Press.

Title: Outside and Inside Liquidity 
Abstract:
 We propose an origination-and-contingent-distribution model of banking, in
 which liquidity demand by short-term investors (banks) can be met with
 cash reserves (inside liquidity) or sales of assets (outside liquidity) to
 long-term investors (hedge funds and pension funds). Outside liquidity is
 a more efficient source, but asymmetric information about asset quality
 can introduce a friction in the form of excessively early asset trading in
 anticipation of a liquidity shock, excessively high cash reserves, and too
 little origination of assets by banks. The model captures key elements of
 the financial crisis and yields novel policy prescriptions.  Copyright 2011, Oxford University Press.

Title: Identifying Government Spending Shocks: It's all in the Timing 
Abstract:
 Standard vector autoregression (VAR) identification methods find that
 government spending raises consumption and real wages; the Ramey--Shapiro
 narrative approach finds the opposite. I show that a key difference in the
 approaches is the timing. Both professional forecasts and the narrative
 approach shocks Granger-cause the VAR shocks, implying that these shocks
 are missing the timing of the news. Motivated by the importance of
 measuring anticipations, I use a narrative method to construct richer
 government spending news variables from 1939 to 2008. The implied
 government spending multipliers range from 0.6 to 1.2.  Copyright 2011, Oxford University Press.

Title: The Real Costs of Credit Access: Evidence from the Payday Lending Market 
Abstract:
 Using geographic differences in the availability of payday loans, I
 estimate the real effects of credit access among low-income households.
 Payday loans are small, high interest rate loans that constitute the
 marginal source of credit for many high risk borrowers. I find no evidence
 that payday loans alleviate economic hardship. To the contrary, loan
 access leads to increased difficulty paying mortgage, rent and utilities
 bills. The empirical design isolates variation in loan access that is
 uninfluenced by lenders' location decisions and state regulatory
 decisions, two factors that might otherwise correlate with economic
 hardship measures. Further analysis of differences in loan
 availability--over time and across income groups--rules out a number of
 alternative explanations for the estimated effects. Counter to the view
 that improving credit access facilitates important expenditures, the
 results suggest that for some low-income households the debt service
 burden imposed by borrowing inhibits their ability to pay important bills.  Copyright 2011, Oxford University Press.

Title: Spring Cleaning: Rural Water Impacts, Valuation, and Property Rights Institutions 
Abstract:
 Using a randomized evaluation in Kenya, we measure health impacts of
 spring protection, an investment that improves source water quality. We
 also estimate households' valuation of spring protection and simulate the
 welfare impacts of alternatives to the current system of common property
 rights in water, which limits incentives for private investment. Spring
 infrastructure investments reduce fecal contamination by 66%, but
 household water quality improves less, due to recontamination. Child
 diarrhea falls by one quarter. Travel-cost based revealed preference
 estimates of households' valuations are much smaller than both stated
 preference valuations and health planners' valuations, and are consistent
 with models in which the demand for health is highly income elastic. We
 estimate that private property norms would generate little additional
 investment while imposing large static costs due to above-marginal-cost
 pricing, private property would function better at higher income levels or
 under water scarcity, and alternative institutions could yield Pareto
 improvements.  Copyright 2011, Oxford University Press.

Title: Family Violence and Football: The Effect of Unexpected Emotional Cues on Violent Behavior 
Abstract:
 We study the link between family violence and the emotional cues
 associated with wins and losses by professional football teams. We
 hypothesize that the risk of violence is affected by the "gain-loss"
 utility of game outcomes around a rationally expected reference point. Our
 empirical analysis uses police reports of violent incidents on Sundays
 during the professional football season. Controlling for the pregame point
 spread and the size of the local viewing audience, we find that upset
 losses (defeats when the home team was predicted to win by four or more
 points) lead to a 10% increase in the rate of at-home violence by men
 against their wives and girlfriends. In contrast, losses when the game was
 expected to be close have small and insignificant effects. Upset wins
 (victories when the home team was predicted to lose) also have little
 impact on violence, consistent with asymmetry in the gain-loss utility
 function. The rise in violence after an upset loss is concentrated in a
 narrow time window near the end of the game and is larger for more
 important games. We find no evidence for reference point updating based on
 the halftime score.  Copyright 2011, Oxford University Press.
