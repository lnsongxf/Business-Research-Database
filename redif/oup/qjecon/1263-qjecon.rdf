Title: Intermediated Trade 
Abstract:
 This paper develops a simple model of international trade with
 intermediation. We consider an economy with two islands and two types of
 agents, farmers and traders. Farmers can produce two goods, but to sell
 these goods in centralized (Walrasian) markets, they need to be matched
 with a trader, and this entails costly search. In the absence of search
 frictions, our model reduces to a standard Ricardian model of trade. We
 use this simple model to contrast the implications of changes in the
 integration of Walrasian markets, which allow traders from different
 islands to exchange their goods, and changes in the access to these
 Walrasian markets, which allow farmers to trade with traders from
 different islands. We find that intermediation always magnifies the gains
 from trade under the former type of integration, but leads to more nuanced
 welfare results under the latter, including the possibility of aggregate
 losses.  Copyright 2011, Oxford University Press.

Title: On the Long-Run Evolution of Inheritance: France 1820--2050 
Abstract:
 This article attempts to document and account for the long-run evolution
 of inheritance. We find that in a country like France the annual flow of
 inheritance was about 20--25% of national income between 1820 and 1910,
 down to less than 5% in 1950, and back up to about 15% by 2010. A simple
 theoretical model of wealth accumulation, growth, and inheritance can
 fully account for the observed U-shaped pattern and levels. Using this
 model, we find that under plausible assumptions the annual bequest flow
 might reach about 20--25% of national income by 2050. This corresponds to
 a capitalized bequest share in total wealth accumulation well above 100%.
 Our findings illustrate the fact that when the growth rate g is small, and
 when the rate of return to private wealth r is permanently and
 substantially larger than the growth rate (say, r &equals; 4--5% versus g
 &equals; 1--2%), which was the case in the nineteenth century and early
 twentieth century and is likely to happen again in the twenty-first
 century, then past wealth and inheritance are bound to play a key role for
 aggregate wealth accumulation and the structure of lifetime inequality.
 Contrary to a widespread view, modern economic growth did not kill
 inheritance.  Copyright 2011, Oxford University Press.

Title: Multiproduct Firms and Trade Liberalization 
Abstract:
 This article develops a general equilibrium model of multiple-product,
 multiple-destination firms, which allows for heterogeneity in ability
 across firms and in product attributes within firms. Firms make endogenous
 entry and exit decisions and each surviving firm chooses optimally the
 range of products to supply to each market. We show that the resulting
 selection, across and within firms, provides a natural explanation for a
 number of features of trade across firms, products, and countries. Using
 both time-series changes in trade policy and cross-section variation in
 trade, we provide empirical evidence in support of the predictions of the
 model.  Copyright 2011, Oxford University Press.

Title: Judicial Ingroup Bias in the Shadow of Terrorism 
Abstract:
 We study ingroup bias--the preferential treatment of members of one's
 group--in naturally occurring data, where economically significant
 allocation decisions are made under a strong non-discriminatory norm. Data
 come from Israeli small claims courts during 2000--2004, where the
 assignment of a case to an Arab or Jewish judge is effectively random. We
 find robust evidence for judicial ingroup bias. Furthermore, this bias is
 strongly associated with terrorism intensity in the vicinity of the court
 in the year preceding the ruling. The results are consistent with theory
 and lab evidence according to which salience of group membership enhances
 social identification.  Copyright 2011, Oxford University Press.

Title: The Logic of Political Violence 
Abstract:
 This article offers a unified approach for studying political violence
 whether it emerges as repression or civil war. We formulate a model where
 an incumbent or opposition can use violence to maintain or acquire power
 to study which political and economic factors drive one-sided or two-sided
 violence (repression or civil war). The model predicts a hierarchy of
 violence states from peace via repression to civil war; and suggests a
 natural empirical approach. Exploiting only within-country variation in
 the data, we show that violence is associated with shocks that can affect
 wages and aid. As in the theory, these effects are only present where
 political institutions are noncohesive.  Copyright 2011, Oxford University Press.

Title: Procurement Contracting With Time Incentives: Theory and Evidence 
Abstract:
 In public procurement, social welfare often depends on how quickly the
 good is delivered. A leading example is highway construction, where slow
 completion inflicts a negative externality on commuters. In response,
 highway departments award some contracts using scoring auctions, which
 give contractors explicit incentives for accelerated delivery. We
 characterize efficient design of these mechanisms. We then gather an
 extensive data set of highway projects awarded by the California
 Department of Transportation between 2003 and 2008. By comparing otherwise
 similar contracts, we show that where the scoring design was used,
 contracts were completed 30--40% faster and the welfare gains to commuters
 exceeded the increase in procurement costs. Using a structural model that
 endogenizes participation and bidding, we estimate that the counterfactual
 welfare gain from switching all contracts from the standard design to the
 efficient A&plus;B design is nearly 22% of the total contract value ($1.14
 billion).  Copyright 2011, Oxford University Press.

Title: Position Auctions with Consumer Search 
Abstract:
 This article examines a model in which advertisers bid for
 "sponsored-link" positions on a search engine. The value advertisers
 derive from each position is endogenized as coming from sales to a
 population of consumers who make rational inferences about firm qualities
 and search optimally. Consumer search strategies, equilibrium bidding, and
 the welfare benefits of position auctions are analyzed. Implications for
 reserve prices and a number of other auction design questions are
 discussed.  Copyright 2011, Oxford University Press.

Title: Why Do Mothers Breastfeed Girls Less than Boys? Evidence and Implications for Child Health in India 
Abstract:
 Breastfeeding is negatively correlated with future fertility because
 nursing temporarily reduces fecundity and because mothers usually wean on
 becoming pregnant again. We model breastfeeding under son-biased fertility
 preferences and show that breastfeeding duration increases with birth
 order, especially near target family size; is lowest for daughters and
 children without older brothers because their parents try again for a son;
 and exhibits the largest gender gap near target family size, when gender
 is most predictive of subsequent fertility. Data from India confirm each
 prediction. Moreover, child survival exhibits similar patterns, especially
 in settings where the alternatives to breastmilk are unsanitary.  Copyright 2011, Oxford University Press.

Title: Coups, Corporations, and Classified Information 
Abstract:
 We estimate the impact of coups and top-secret coup authorizations on
 asset prices of partially nationalized multinational companies that stood
 to benefit from U.S.-backed coups. Stock returns of highly exposed firms
 reacted to coup authorizations classified as top-secret. The average
 cumulative abnormal return to a coup authorization was 9% over 4 days for
 a fully nationalized company, rising to more than 13% over 16 days.
 Precoup authorizations accounted for a larger share of stock price
 increases than the actual coup events themselves. There is no effect in
 the case of the widely publicized, poorly executed Cuban operations,
 consistent with abnormal returns to coup authorizations reflecting
 credible private information. We also introduce two new intuitive and easy
 to implement nonparametric tests that do not rely on asymptotic
 justifications.  Copyright 2011, Oxford University Press.

Title: Competition and Product Quality in the Supermarket Industry 
Abstract:
 This article analyzes the effect of competition on a supermarket firm's
 incentive to provide product quality. In the supermarket industry, product
 availability is an important measure of quality. Using U.S. Consumer Price
 Index microdata to track inventory shortfalls, I find that stores facing
 more intense competition have fewer shortfalls. Competition from
 Walmart--the most significant shock to industry market structure in half a
 century--decreased shortfalls among large chains by about a third. The
 risk that customers will switch stores appears to provide competitors with
 a strong incentive to invest in product quality.  Copyright 2011, Oxford University Press.

Title: Information Technology and Economic Change: The Impact of The Printing Press 
Abstract:
 The printing press was the great innovation in early modern information
 technology, but economists have found no macroeconomic evidence of its
 impact. This article exploits city-level data. Between 1500 and 1600,
 European cities where printing presses were established in the 1400s grew
 60% faster than otherwise similar cities. Cities that adopted printing in
 the 1400s had no prior advantage, and the association between adoption and
 subsequent growth was not due to printers choosing auspicious locations.
 These findings are supported by regressions that exploit distance from
 Mainz, Germany--the birthplace of printing--as an instrument for adoption.  Copyright 2011, Oxford University Press.
