Title: Cash or Condition? Evidence from a Cash Transfer Experiment 
Abstract:
 This article assesses the role of conditionality in cash transfer programs
 using a unique experiment targeted at adolescent girls in Malawi. The
 program featured two distinct interventions: unconditional transfers (UCT
 arm) and transfers conditional on school attendance (CCT arm). Although
 there was a modest decline in the dropout rate in the UCT arm in
 comparison with the control group, it was only 43% as large as the impact
 in the CCT arm at the end of the 2-year program. The CCT arm also
 outperformed the UCT arm in tests of English reading comprehension.
 However, teenage pregnancy and marriage rates were substantially lower in
 the UCT than the CCT arm, entirely due to the impact of UCTs on these
 outcomes among girls who dropped out of school.  Copyright 2011, Oxford University Press.

Title: Exports and Financial Shocks 
Abstract:
 A striking feature of many financial crises is the collapse of exports
 relative to output. This article examines whether deteriorations in bank
 health can help explain the large drops in exports relative to output. Our
 article is the first to establish a causal link between the health of
 banks providing trade finance and growth in a firm's exports relative to
 its domestic sales. We overcome measurement and endogeneity issues by
 using a unique data set, covering the Japanese financial crises from 1990
 through 2010, which enables us to match exporters with the main bank that
 provides them with trade finance. Our point estimates are economically and
 statistically significant, suggesting that the health of financial
 institutions is an important determinant of firm-level exports during
 crises.  Copyright 2011, Oxford University Press.

Title: Expectations as Endowments: Evidence on Reference-Dependent Preferences from Exchange and Valuation Experiments 
Abstract:
 While evidence suggests that people evaluate outcomes with respect to
 reference points, little is known about what determines them. We conduct
 two experiments that show that reference points are determined, at least
 in part, by expectations. In an exchange experiment, we endow subjects
 with an item and randomize the probability they will be allowed to trade.
 Subjects that are less likely to be able to trade are more likely to
 choose to keep their item. In a valuation experiment, we randomly assign
 subjects a high or low probability of obtaining an item and elicit their
 willingness-to-accept for it. The high probability treatment increases
 valuation of the item by 20--30%.  Copyright 2011, Oxford University Press.

Title: Better Schools, Less Crime? 
Abstract:
 I estimate the impact of attending a first-choice middle or high school on
 adult crime, using data from public school choice lotteries in
 Charlotte-Mecklenburg school district (CMS). Seven years after random
 assignment, lottery winners had been arrested for fewer serious crimes and
 had spent fewer days incarcerated. The gain in school quality as measured
 by peer and teacher inputs was equivalent to moving from one of the
 lowest-ranked schools to one at the district average. The reduction in
 crime comes largely from years after enrollment in the preferred school is
 complete. The impacts are concentrated among high-risk youth, who commit
 about 50% less crime across several different outcome measures and
 scalings of crime by severity. I find suggestive evidence that school
 quality explains more of the impact in high school, whereas peer effects
 are more important in middle school.  Copyright 2011, Oxford University Press.

Title: The Role of Hospital Heterogeneity in Measuring Marginal Returns to Medical Care: A Reply to Barreca, Guldi, Lindo, and Waddell 
Abstract:
 In , we describe how marginal returns to medical care can be estimated by
 comparing patients on either side of diagnostic thresholds. Our
 application examines at-risk newborns near the very low birth weight
 threshold at 1500 g. We estimate large discontinuities in medical care and
 mortality at this threshold, with effects concentrated at "low-quality"
 hospitals. Although our preferred estimates retain newborns near the
 threshold, when they are excluded the estimated marginal returns decline,
 although they remain large. In low-quality hospitals, our estimates are
 similar in magnitude regardless of whether these newborns are included or
 excluded.  Copyright 2011, Oxford University Press.

Title: Self-Enforcing Democracy 
Abstract:
 If democracy is to have the good effects said to justify it, it must be
 self-enforcing in that incumbents choose to hold regular, competitive
 elections and comply with the results. I consider models of electoral
 accountability that allow rulers a choice of whether to hold elections and
 citizens whether to rebel. When individuals observe diverse signals of
 government performance, coordination to pose a credible threat of protest
 if the ruler "shirks" is problematic. The convention of an electoral
 calendar and known rules can provide a public signal for coordinating
 rebellion if elections are suspended or blatantly rigged, while the
 elections themselves aggregate private observations of performance. Two
 threats to this solution to political moral hazard are considered. First,
 a ruling faction that controls the army may prefer to fight after losing
 an election, and ex post transfers may not be credible. A party system in
 which today's losers may win in the future can restore self-enforcing
 democracy, though at the cost of weaker electoral control. Second, subtle
 electoral fraud can undermine the threat of coordinated opposition that
 maintains elections. I show that when there are organizations in society
 that can observe and announce a signal of the extent of popular
 discontent, the incumbent may prefer to commit to fair elections over an
 "accountable autocratic" equilibrium in which public goods are provided
 but costly rebellions periodically occur.  Copyright 2011, Oxford University Press.

Title: Learning by Drilling: Interfirm Learning and Relationship Persistence in the Texas Oilpatch 
Abstract:
 This article examines learning-by-doing that is specific not just to
 individual firms but to pairs of firms working together in a contracting
 relationship. Using data from the oil and gas industry, I find that the
 productivity of an oil production company and its drilling contractor
 increases with their joint experience. This learning is
 relationship-specific: drilling rigs cannot fully appropriate the
 productivity gains acquired through experience with one production company
 to their work for another.This result is robust to ex ante match
 specificities. Moreover, producers' and rigs'contracting behavior is
 consistent with maximization of relationship-specific learning's
 productivity benefits.  Copyright 2011, Oxford University Press.

Title: How Does Your Kindergarten Classroom Affect Your Earnings? Evidence from Project Star 
Abstract:
 In Project STAR, 11,571 students in Tennessee and their teachers were
 randomly assigned to classrooms within their schools from kindergarten to
 third grade. This article evaluates the long-term impacts of STAR by
 linking the experimental data to administrative records. We first
 demonstrate that kindergarten test scores are highly correlated with
 outcomes such as earnings at age 27, college attendance, home ownership,
 and retirement savings. We then document four sets of experimental
 impacts. First, students in small classes are significantly more likely to
 attend college and exhibit improvements on other outcomes. Class size does
 not have a significant effect on earnings at age 27, but this effect is
 imprecisely estimated. Second, students who had a more experienced teacher
 in kindergarten have higher earnings. Third, an analysis of variance
 reveals significant classroom effects on earnings. Students who were
 randomly assigned to higher quality classrooms in grades K--3--as measured
 by classmates' end-of-class test scores--have higher earnings, college
 attendance rates, and other outcomes. Finally, the effects of class
 quality fade out on test scores in later grades, but gains in noncognitive
 measures persist.  Copyright 2011, Oxford University Press.

Title: Saving Babies? Revisiting the effect of very low birth weight classification 
Abstract:
 We reconsider the effect of very low birth weight classification on infant
 mortality. We demonstrate that the estimates are highly sensitive to the
 exclusion of observations in the immediate vicinity of the 1,500-g
 threshold, weakening the confidence in the results originally reported in
 Almond, Doyle, Kowalski, and Williams (2010).  Copyright 2011, Oxford University Press.

Title: Optimal Price Setting With Observation and Menu Costs 
Abstract:
 We study the price-setting problem of a firm in the presence of both
 observation and menu costs. The firm optimally decides when to "review"
 costly information on the adequacy of its price. Upon each review, the
 firm chooses whether to adjust its price, one or more times, before the
 next price review. Each price adjustment entails paying a menu cost. The
 firm's choices map into several statistics: the frequency of price
 reviews, the frequency of price adjustments, the size distribution of
 price changes, and the hazard rate of price adjustments. The simultaneous
 presence of observation and menu costs produces complementarities that
 change the predictions of simpler models featuring one cost only. For
 instance, infrequent observations may reflect a high menu cost rather than
 high observation costs: in spite of these complementarities, we show that
 the ratio of the two costs is identified by several statistics on price
 observations and adjustments.  Copyright 2011, Oxford University Press.

Title: Ideological Segregation Online and Offline 
Abstract:
 We use individual and aggregate data to ask how the Internet is changing
 the ideological segregation of the American electorate. Focusing on online
 news consumption, offline news consumption, and face-to-face social
 interactions, we define ideological segregation in each domain using
 standard indices from the literature on racial segregation. We find that
 ideological segregation of online news consumption is low in absolute
 terms, higher than the segregation of most offline news consumption, and
 significantly lower than the segregation of face-to-face interactions with
 neighbors, co-workers, or family members. We find no evidence that the
 Internet is becoming more segregated over time.  Copyright 2011, Oxford University Press.

Title: Financial Incentives and Student Achievement: Evidence from Randomized Trials 
Abstract:
 This article describes a series of school-based field experiments in over
 200 urban schools across three cities designed to better understand the
 impact of financial incentives on student achievement. In Dallas, students
 were paid to read books. In New York, students were rewarded for
 performance on interim assessments. In Chicago, students were paid for
 classroom grades. I estimate that the impact of financial incentives on
 student achievement is statistically 0, in each city. Due to a lack of
 power, however, I cannot rule out the possibility of effect sizes that
 would have positive returns on investment. The only statistically
 significant effect is on English-speaking students in Dallas. The article
 concludes with a speculative discussion of what might account for
 intercity differences in estimated treatment effects.  Copyright 2011, Oxford University Press.

Title: The Geographic Concentration of Enterprise in Developing Countries 
Abstract:
 A nation's economic geography can have an enormous impact on its
 development. In Thailand, we show that a high concentration of enterprise
 in an area predicts high subsequent growth in and around that area. We
 also find spatially contiguous convergence of enterprise with stagnant
 areas left behind. Exogenous physiographic conditions are correlated with
 enterprise location and growth. We fit a structural, micro-founded model
 of occupation transitions with fine-tuned geographic capabilities to
 village data and replicate these salient facts. Key elements of the model
 include costs, credit constraints on occupation choice, and spatially
 varying expansion of financial service providers.  Copyright 2011, Oxford University Press.
