Title: A Dynamic Theory of Resource Wars 
Abstract:
 We develop a dynamic theory of resource wars and study the conditions
 under which such wars can be prevented. Our focus is on the interaction
 between the scarcity of resources and the incentives for war in the
 presence of limited commitment. We show that a key parameter determining
 the incentives for war is the elasticity of demand. Our first result
 identifies a novel externality that can precipitate war: price-taking
 firms fail to internalize the impact of their extraction on military
 action. In the case of inelastic resource demand, war incentives increase
 over time and war may become inevitable. Our second result shows that in
 some situations, regulation of prices and quantities by the resource-rich
 country can prevent war, and when this is the case, there will also be
 slower resource extraction than the Hotelling benchmark (with inelastic
 demand). Our third result is that because of limited commitment and its
 implications for armament incentives, regulation of prices and quantities
 might actually precipitate war even in some circumstances where wars would
 not have arisen under competitive markets.  Copyright 2012, Oxford University Press.

Title: The Changing of the Boards: The Impact on Firm Valuation of Mandated Female Board Representation 
Abstract:
 In 2003, a new law required that 40% of Norwegian firms' directors be
 women--at the time only 9% of directors were women. We use the prequota
 cross-sectional variation in female board representation to instrument for
 exogenous changes to corporate boards following the quota. We find that
 the constraint imposed by the quota caused a significant drop in the stock
 price at the announcement of the law and a large decline in Tobin's Q over
 the following years, consistent with the idea that firms choose boards to
 maximize value. The quota led to younger and less experienced boards,
 increases in leverage and acquisitions, and deterioration in operating
 performance.  Copyright 2012, Oxford University Press.

Title: Testing for Altruism and Social Pressure in Charitable Giving
Abstract:
 Every year, 90% of Americans give money to charities. Is such generosity
 necessarily welfare enhancing for the giver? We present a theoretical
 framework that distinguishes two types of motivation: individuals like to
 give, for example, due to altruism or warm glow, and individuals would
 rather not give but dislike saying no, for example, due to social
 pressure. We design a door-to-door fund-raiser in which some households
 are informed about the exact time of solicitation with a flyer on their
 doorknobs. Thus, they can seek or avoid the fund-raiser. We find that the
 flyer reduces the share of households opening the door by 9% to 25% and,
 if the flyer allows checking a Do Not Disturb box, reduces giving by 28%
 to 42%. The latter decrease is concentrated among donations smaller than
 $10. These findings suggest that social pressure is an important
 determinant of door-to-door giving. Combining data from this and a
 complementary field experiment, we structurally estimate the model. The
 estimated social pressure cost of saying no to a solicitor is $3.80 for an
 in-state charity and $1.40 for an out-of-state charity. Our welfare
 calculations suggest that our door-to-door fund-raising campaigns on
 average lower the utility of the potential donors.  Copyright 2012, Oxford University Press.

Title: Export Prices Across Firms and Destinations 
Abstract:
 This article establishes six stylized facts about firms' export prices
 using detailed customs data on the universe of Chinese trade flows. First,
 across firms selling a given product, exporters that charge higher prices
 earn greater revenues in each destination, have bigger worldwide sales,
 and enter more markets. Second, firms that export more, enter more
 markets, and charge higher export prices import more expensive inputs.
 Third, across destinations within a firm-product, firms set higher prices
 in richer, larger, bilaterally more distant and overall less remote
 countries. Fourth, across destinations within a firm-product, firms earn
 bigger revenues in markets where they set higher prices. Fifth, across
 firms within a product, exporters with more destinations offer a wider
 range of export prices. Finally, firms that export more, enter more
 markets, and offer a wider range of export prices pay a wider range of
 input prices and source inputs from more origin countries. We propose that
 trade models should incorporate two features to rationalize these patterns
 in the data: more successful exporters use higher quality inputs to
 produce higher quality goods (stylized facts 1 and 2), and firms vary the
 quality of their products across destinations by using inputs of different
 quality levels (stylized facts 3, 4, 5, and 6).  Copyright 2012, Oxford University Press.

Title: Earnings Determination and Taxes: Evidence From a Cohort-Based Payroll Tax Reform in Greece 
Abstract:
 This article analyzes the response of earnings to payroll tax rates using
 a cohort-based reform in Greece. Individuals who started working on or
 after 1993 face permanently a much higher earnings cap for payroll taxes,
 creating a large and permanent discontinuity in marginal payroll tax rates
 by date of entry in the labor force for upper earnings workers. Using
 full-population administrative social security data and a regression
 discontinuity design, we estimate the long-term labor supply effects and
 incidence of payroll tax rates on earnings. Standard theory predicts that
 in the long run, new regime workers should bear the entire burden of the
 payroll tax increase (relative to old regime workers). In contrast, we
 find that employers compensate new regime workers for the extra employer
 payroll taxes but not for the extra employee payroll taxes. We do not find
 any evidence of labor supply responses along the extensive or intensive
 margins around the discontinuity, suggesting low efficiency costs of
 payroll taxes. We discuss various possible explanations for those results.  Copyright 2012, Oxford University Press.

Title: Price Competition Under Limited Comparability
Abstract:
 This article studies market competition when firms can influence
 consumers' ability to compare market alternatives through their choice of
 price "formats." In our model, the ability of a consumer to make a
 comparison depends on the firms' format choices. Our main results concern
 the interaction between firms' equilibrium price and format decisions and
 its implications for industry profits and consumer switching rates. In
 particular, market forces drive down the firms' profits to a "constrained
 competitive" benchmark if and only if the comparability structure
 satisfies a property that we interpret as a form of "frame neutrality."
 The same property is necessary for equilibrium behavior to display
 statistical independence between price and format decisions. We also show
 that narrow regulatory interventions that aim to facilitate comparisons
 may have an anticompetitive effect.  Copyright 2012, Oxford University Press.

Title: Monetary Policy as Financial Stability Regulation
Abstract:
 This article develops a model that speaks to the goals and methods of
 financial stability policies. There are three main points. First, from a
 normative perspective, the model defines the fundamental market failure to
 be addressed, namely, that unregulated private money creation can lead to
 an externality in which intermediaries issue too much short-term debt and
 leave the system excessively vulnerable to costly financial crises.
 Second, it shows how in a simple economy where commercial banks are the
 only lenders, conventional monetary policy tools such as open-market
 operations can be used to regulate this externality, whereas in more
 advanced economies it may be helpful to supplement monetary policy with
 other measures. Third, from a positive perspective, the model provides an
 account of how monetary policy can influence bank lending and real
 activity, even in a world where prices adjust frictionlessly and there are
 other transactions media besides bank-created money that are outside the
 control of the central bank.  Copyright 2012, Oxford University Press.

Title: Comparison Friction: Experimental Evidence from Medicare Drug Plans 
Abstract:
 Consumers need information to compare alternatives for markets to function
 efficiently. Recognizing this, public policies often pair competition with
 easy access to comparative information. The implicit assumption is that
 comparison friction--the wedge between the availability of comparative
 information and consumers' use of it--is inconsequential because when
 information is readily available, consumers will access this information
 and make effective choices. We examine the extent of comparison friction
 in the market for Medicare Part D prescription drug plans in the United
 States. In a randomized field experiment, an intervention group received a
 letter with personalized cost information. That information was readily
 available for free and widely advertised. However, this additional
 step--providing the information rather than having consumers actively
 access it--had an impact. Plan switching was 28% in the intervention
 group, versus 17% in the comparison group, and the intervention caused an
 average decline in predicted consumer cost of about $100 a year among
 letter recipients--roughly 5% of the cost in the comparison group. Our
 results suggest that comparison friction can be large even when the cost
 of acquiring information is small and may be relevant for a wide range of
 public policies that incorporate consumer choice.  Copyright 2012, Oxford University Press.

Title: Incentives and the De Soto Effect 
Abstract:
 This paper explores the consequences of improving property rights to
 facilitate the use of fixed assets as collateral, popularly attributed to
 the influential policy advocate Hernando de Soto. We use an equilibrium
 model of a credit market with moral hazard to characterize the theoretical
 effects and also develop a quantitative analysis using data from Sri
 Lanka. We show that the effects are likely to be nonlinear and
 heterogeneous by wealth group. They also depend on the extent of
 competition between lenders. There can be significant increases in profits
 and reductions in interest rates when credit markets are competitive.
 However, since these are due to reductions in moral hazard, that is,
 increased effort, the welfare gains tend to be modest when cost of effort
 is taken into account. Allowing for an extensive margin where borrowers
 gain access to the credit market can make these effects larger depending
 on the underlying wealth distribution.  Copyright 2012, Oxford University Press.

Title: How do Different Exporters React to Exchange Rate Changes?
Abstract:
 This article analyzes the heterogeneous reaction of exporters to real
 exchange rate changes using a very rich French firm-level data set with
 destination-specific export values and volumes on the period 1995--2005.
 We find that high--performance firms react to a depreciation by increasing
 significantly more their markup and by increasing less their export
 volume. This heterogeneity in pricing-to-market is robust to different
 measures of performance, samples, and econometric specifications. It is
 consistent with models where the demand elasticity decreases with firm
 performance. Since aggregate exports are concentrated on high-productivity
 firms, precisely those that absorb more exchange rate movements in their
 markups, heterogeneous pricing-to-market may partly explain the weak
 impact of exchange rate movements on aggregate exports.  Copyright 2012, Oxford University Press.

Title: Long-Run Impacts of Unions on Firms: New Evidence from Financial Markets, 1961--1999
Abstract:
 We estimate the effect of new private-sector unionization on publicly
 traded firms' equity value in the United States over the 1961--1999 period
 using a newly assembled sample of National Labor Relations Board (NLRB)
 representation elections matched to stock market data. Event-study
 estimates show an average union effect on the equity value of the firm
 equivalent to $40,500 per unionized worker, an effect that takes 15 to 18
 months after unionization to fully materialize, and one that could not be
 detected by a short-run event study. At the same time, point estimates
 from a regression discontinuity design--comparing the stock market impact
 of close union election wins to close losses--are considerably smaller and
 close to zero. We find a negative relationship between the cumulative
 abnormal returns and the vote share in support of the union, allowing us
 to reconcile these seemingly contradictory findings.  Copyright 2012, Oxford University Press.
