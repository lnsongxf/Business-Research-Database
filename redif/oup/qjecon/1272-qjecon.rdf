Title: Variable Rare Disasters: An Exactly Solved Framework for Ten Puzzles in Macro-Finance
Abstract:
 This article incorporates a time-varying severity of disasters into the
 hypothesis proposed by Rietz
 (1988) and Barro (2006) that risk premia result from the
 possibility of rare large disasters. During a disaster an asset's
 fundamental value falls by a time-varying amount. This in turn generates
 time-varying risk premia and, thus, volatile asset prices and return
 predictability. Using the recent technique of linearity-generating
 processes, the model is tractable and all prices are exactly solved in
 closed form. In this article's framework, the following empirical
 regularities can be understood quantitatively: (i) equity premium puzzle;
 (ii) risk-free rate puzzle; (iii) excess volatility puzzle; (iv)
 predictability of aggregate stock market returns with price-dividend
 ratios; (v) often greater explanatory power of characteristics than
 covariances for asset returns; (vi) upward-sloping nominal yield curve;
 (vii) predictability of future bond excess returns and long-term rates via
 the slope of the yield curve; (viii) corporate bond spread puzzle; (ix)
 high price of deep out-of-the-money puts; and (x) high put prices being
 followed by high stock returns. The calibration passes a variance bound
 test, as normal-times market volatility is consistent with the wide
 dispersion of disaster outcomes in the historical record. The model
 extends to a setting with many factors and to Epstein-Zin preferences.  Copyright 2012, Oxford University Press.

Title: Do Labor Market Opportunities Affect Young Women's Work and Family Decisions? Experimental Evidence from India
Abstract:
 Do labor market opportunities for women affect marriage and fertility
 decisions? We provided three years of recruiting services to help young
 women in randomly selected rural Indian villages get jobs in the business
 process outsourcing industry. Because the industry was so new at the time
 of the study, there was almost no awareness of these jobs, allowing us in
 effect to exogenously increase women's labor force opportunities from the
 perspective of rural households. We find that young women in treatment
 villages were significantly less likely to get married or have children
 during this period, choosing instead to enter the labor market or obtain
 more schooling or postschool training. Women also report wanting to have
 fewer children and to work more steadily throughout their lifetime,
 consistent with increased aspirations for a career.  Copyright 2012, Oxford University Press.

Title: Urbanization and Structural Transformation
Abstract:
 We examine urbanization using new data that allow us to track the
 evolution of population in rural and urban areas in the United States from
 1880 to 2000. We find a positive correlation between initial population
 density and subsequent population growth for intermediate densities, which
 increases the dispersion of the population density distribution over time.
 We use theory and empirical evidence to show this pattern of population
 growth is the result of differences in agriculture's initial share of
 employment across population densities, combined with structural
 transformation that shifts employment away from agriculture.  Copyright 2012, Oxford University Press.

Title: How large is the Government Spending Multiplier? Evidence from World Bank Lending
Author-Name: Aart Kraay
Author-Workplace-Name: Development Research Group, The World Bank
Abstract:
 This article proposes a novel approach to empirically identifying
 government spending multipliers that relies on two features unique to many
 low-income countries: (1) borrowing from the World Bank finances a
 substantial fraction of government spending, and (2) spending on World
 Bank--financed projects is typically spread out over several years
 following the original approval of the project. The first fact means that
 fluctuations in spending on World Bank--financed projects are a
 significant source of fluctuations in overall government spending in these
 countries. The second fact means that fluctuations in World Bank--financed
 spending in a given year are largely determined by fluctuations in project
 approval decisions made in previous years, and so are unlikely to be
 correlated with shocks to output in the current year. I use World Bank
 project-level disbursement data to isolate the component of World
 Bank--financed government spending in a given year that is associated with
 past project approval decisions. I use this as an instrument for total
 government spending to estimate multipliers in a sample of 29 primarily
 low-income countries where variation in government spending from this
 source is large relative to the size of the economy. The resulting
 spending multipliers are small and reasonably precisely estimated to be in
 the vicinity of 0.5.  Copyright 2012, Oxford University Press.

Title: A General Equilibrium Model of Sovereign Default and Business Cycles 
Abstract:
 Why are episodes of sovereign default accompanied by deep recessions? The
 existing literature cannot answer this question. On one hand, sovereign
 default models treat income fluctuations as an exogenous endowment process
 with ad hoc default costs. On the other hand, emerging markets business
 cycle models abstract from modeling default and treat default risk as part
 of an exogenous interest rate on working capital. We propose instead a
 general equilibrium model of both sovereign default and business cycles.
 In the model, some imported inputs require working capital financing, and
 default triggers an efficiency loss as these inputs are replaced by
 imperfect substitutes, because both firms and the government are excluded
 from credit markets. Default is an optimal decision of a benevolent
 planner for whom, even after internalizing the adverse effects of default
 on economic activity, financial autarky has a higher payoff than debt
 repayment. The model explains the main features of observed cyclical
 dynamics around defaults, countercyclical spreads, high debt ratios, and
 key long-run business cycle moments.  Copyright 2012, Oxford University Press.

Title: The Effects of Extended Unemployment Insurance Over the Business Cycle: Evidence from Regression Discontinuity Estimates Over 20 Years
Abstract:
 One goal of extending the duration of unemployment insurance (UI) in
 recessions is to increase UI coverage in the face of longer unemployment
 spells. Although it is a common concern that such extensions may
 themselves raise nonemployment durations, it is not known how recessions
 would affect the magnitude of this moral hazard. To obtain causal
 estimates of the differential effects of UI in booms and recessions, this
 article exploits the fact that in Germany, potential UI benefit duration
 is a function of exact age which is itself invariant over the business
 cycle. We implement a regression discontinuity design separately for 20
 years and correlate our estimates with measures of the business cycle. We
 find that the nonemployment effects of a month of additional UI benefits
 are, at best, somewhat declining in recessions. Yet the UI exhaustion
 rate, and therefore the additional coverage provided by UI extensions,
 rises substantially during a downturn. The ratio of these two effects
 represents the nonemployment response of workers weighted by the
 probability of being affected by UI extensions. Hence, our results imply
 that the effective moral hazard effect of UI extensions is significantly
 lower in recessions than in booms. Using a model of job search with
 liquidity constraints, we also find that in the absence of market-wide
 effects, the net social benefits from UI extensions can be expressed
 either directly in terms of the exhaustion rate and the nonemployment
 effect of UI durations, or as a declining function of our measure of
 effective moral hazard.  Copyright 2012, Oxford University Press.

Title: Portage and Path Dependence
Abstract:
 Many cities in North America formed at obstacles to water navigation,
 where continued transport required overland hauling or portage. Portage
 sites attracted commerce and supporting services, and places where the
 falls provided water power attracted manufacturing during early
 industrialization. We examine portage sites in the U.S. South,
 Mid-Atlantic, and Midwest, including those on the fall line, a
 geomorphological feature in the southeastern United States marking the
 final rapids on rivers before the ocean. Although their original
 advantages have long since become obsolete, we document the continuing
 importance of historical portage sites. We interpret these results as path
 dependence and contrast explanations based on sunk costs interacting with
 decreasing versus increasing returns to scale.  Copyright 2012, Oxford University Press.

Title: The Political Economy of Indirect Control
Abstract:
 This article characterizes optimal policy when a government uses indirect
 control to exert its authority. We develop a dynamic principal-agent model
 in which a principal (a government) delegates the prevention of a
 disturbance--such as riots, protests, terrorism, crime, or tax evasion--to
 an agent who has an advantage in accomplishing this task. Our setting is a
 standard repeated moral hazard model with two additional features. First,
 the principal is allowed to exert direct control by intervening with an
 endogenously determined intensity of force which is costly to both
 players. Second, the principal suffers from limited commitment. Using
 recursive methods, we derive a fully analytical characterization of the
 intensity, likelihood, and duration of intervention. The first main
 insight from our model is that repeated and costly equilibrium
 interventions are a feature of optimal policy. This is because they are
 the most efficient credible means for the principal of providing
 incentives for the agent. The second main insight is a detailed analysis
 of a fundamental trade-off between the intensity and duration of
 intervention which is driven by the principal's inability to commit.
 Finally, we derive sharp predictions regarding the impact of various
 factors on the optimal intensity, likelihood, and duration of
 intervention. We discuss these results in the context of some historical
 episodes.  Copyright 2012, Oxford University Press.

Title: The CMS Auction: Experimental Studies of a Median-Bid Procurement Auction with Nonbinding Bids
Abstract:
 We report on the experimental results of simple auctions with (i) a
 median-bid pricing rule and (ii) nonbinding bids (winning bids can be
 withdrawn)--the two central pillars of the competitive bidding program
 designed by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS).
 Comparisons between the performance of the CMS auction and the performance
 of the excluded-bid auction reveal the problematic nature of the CMS
 auction. The CMS auction fails to generate competitive prices of goods and
 fails to satisfy demand. In all proposed efficiency measures, we find the
 excluded-bid auction significantly outperforms the CMS auction.  Copyright 2012, Oxford University Press.

Title: The Impact of Jury Race in Criminal Trials
Abstract:
 This article examines the impact of jury racial composition on trial
 outcomes using a data set of felony trials in Florida between 2000 and
 2010. We use a research design that exploits day-to-day variation in the
 composition of the jury pool to isolate quasi-random variation in the
 composition of the seated jury, finding evidence that (i) juries formed
 from all-white jury pools convict black defendants significantly (16
 percentage points) more often than white defendants, and (ii) this gap in
 conviction rates is entirely eliminated when the jury pool includes at
 least one black member. The impact of jury race is much greater than what
 a simple correlation of the race of the seated jury and conviction rates
 would suggest. These findings imply that the application of justice is
 highly uneven and raise obvious concerns about the fairness of trials in
 jurisdictions with a small proportion of blacks in the jury pool.  Copyright 2012, Oxford University Press.
