Title: The Collapse of the Soviet Union and the Productivity of American Mathematicians 
Abstract:
 It has been difficult to open up the black box of knowledge production. We
 use unique international data on the publications, citations, and
 affiliations of mathematicians to examine the impact of a large, post-1992
 influx of Soviet mathematicians on the productivity of their U.S.
 counterparts. We find a negative productivity effect on those
 mathematicians whose research overlapped with that of the Soviets. We also
 document an increased mobility rate (to lower quality institutions and out
 of active publishing) and a reduced likelihood of producing "home run"
 papers. Although the total product of the preexisting American
 mathematicians shrank, the Soviet contribution to American mathematics
 filled in the gap. However, there is no evidence that the Soviets greatly
 increased the size of the "mathematics pie." Finally, we find that there
 are significant international differences in the productivity effects of
 the collapse of the Soviet Union, and these international differences can
 be explained by both differences in the size of the émigré flow into the
 various countries and in how connected each country is to the global
 market for mathematical publications. JEL Codes: O31, J61.  Copyright 2012, Oxford University Press.

Title: The Impact of Trade on Organization and Productivity 
Abstract:
 A firm's productivity depends on how production is organized. To
 understand this relationship we develop a theory of an economy where firms
 with heterogeneous demands use labor and knowledge to produce.
 Entrepreneurs decide the number of layers of management and the knowledge
 and span of control of each agent. As a result, in the theory,
 heterogeneity in demand leads to heterogeneity in productivity and other
 firms' outcomes. We use the theory to analyze the impact of international
 trade on organization and calibrate the model to the U.S. economy. Our
 results indicate that, as a result of a bilateral trade liberalization,
 firms that export will increase the number of layers of management. The
 new organization of the average exporter results in higher productivity,
 although the responses of productivity are heterogeneous across these
 firms. Liberalizing trade from autarky to the level of openness in 2002
 results in a 1% increase in productivity for the marginal exporter and a
 1.8% increase in its revenue productivity. Endogenous organization
 increases the gains from trade by 41% relative to standard models. JEL

Title: The Role of Application Assistance and Information in College Decisions: Results from the H&R Block Fafsa Experiment 
Abstract:
 Growing concerns about low awareness and take-up rates for government
 support programs like college financial aid have spurred calls to simplify
 the application process and enhance visibility. We present results from a
 randomized field experiment in which low-income individuals receiving tax
 preparation help were also offered immediate assistance and a streamlined
 process to complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA)
 for themselves or their children. Treated participants were also provided
 with aid estimates that were compared against tuition cost amounts for
 nearby colleges. The combined assistance and information treatment
 substantially increased FAFSA submissions and ultimately the likelihood of
 college attendance, persistence, and aid receipt. In particular, high
 school seniors whose parents received the treatment were
 8&thinsp;percentage points more likely to have completed two years of
 college, going from 28% to 36%, during the first three years following the
 experiment. Families who received aid information but no assistance with
 the FAFSA did not experience improved outcomes. The findings suggest many
 other opportunities for using personal assistance to increase
 participation in programs that require filling out forms to become
 eligible. JEL Codes: I2, H4, J24.  Copyright 2012, Oxford University Press.

Title: Salience Theory of Choice Under Risk 
Abstract:
 We present a theory of choice among lotteries in which the decision
 maker's attention is drawn to (precisely defined) salient payoffs. This
 leads the decision maker to a context-dependent representation of
 lotteries in which true probabilities are replaced by decision weights
 distorted in favor of salient payoffs. By specifying decision weights as a
 function of payoffs, our model provides a novel and unified account of
 many empirical phenomena, including frequent risk-seeking behavior,
 invariance failures such as the Allais paradox, and preference reversals.
 It also yields new predictions, including some that distinguish it from
 prospect theory, which we test. JEL Codes: D03, D81.  Copyright 2012, Oxford University Press.

Title: Persecution Perpetuated: The Medieval Origins of Anti-Semitic Violence in Nazi Germany 
Abstract:
 How persistent are cultural traits? Using data on anti-Semitism in
 Germany, we find local continuity over 600 years. Jews were often blamed
 when the Black Death killed at least a third of Europe's population during
 1348--50. We use plague-era pogroms as an indicator for medieval
 anti-Semitism. They reliably predict violence against Jews in the 1920s,
 votes for the Nazi Party, deportations after 1933, attacks on synagogues,
 and letters to Der Stürmer. We also identify areas where persistence was
 lower: cities with high levels of trade or immigration. Finally, we show
 that our results are not driven by political extremism or by different
 attitudes toward violence. JEL Codes: N33, N34, N93, N94, D74.  Copyright 2012, Oxford University Press.

Title: The Oregon Health Insurance Experiment: Evidence from the First Year 
Abstract:
 In 2008, a group of uninsured low-income adults in Oregon was selected by
 lottery to be given the chance to apply for Medicaid. This lottery
 provides an opportunity to gauge the effects of expanding access to public
 health insurance on the health care use, financial strain, and health of
 low-income adults using a randomized controlled design. In the year after
 random assignment, the treatment group selected by the lottery was about
 25 percentage points more likely to have insurance than the control group
 that was not selected. We find that in this first year, the treatment
 group had substantively and statistically significantly higher health care
 utilization (including primary and preventive care as well as
 hospitalizations), lower out-of-pocket medical expenditures and medical
 debt (including fewer bills sent to collection), and better self-reported
 physical and mental health than the control group. JEL Codes: H51, H75,

Title: How Homophily Affects the Speed of Learning and Best-Response Dynamics 
Abstract:
 We examine how the speed of learning and best-response processes depends
 on homophily: the tendency of agents to associate disproportionately with
 those having similar traits. When agents' beliefs or behaviors are
 developed by averaging what they see among their neighbors, then
 convergence to a consensus is slowed by the presence of homophily but is
 not influenced by network density (in contrast to other network processes
 that depend on shortest paths). In deriving these results, we propose a
 new, general measure of homophily based on the relative frequencies of
 interactions among different groups. An application to communication in a
 society before a vote shows how the time it takes for the vote to
 correctly aggregate information depends on the homophily and the initial
 information distribution. JEL Codes: D83, D85, I21, J15, Z13  Copyright 2012, Oxford University Press.

Title: Capital Taxation During the U.S. Great Depression 
Abstract:
 Previous studies of the U.S. Great Depression find that increased
 government spending and taxation contributed little to either the dramatic
 downturn or the slow recovery. These studies include only one type of
 capital taxation: a business profits tax. The contribution is much greater
 when the analysis includes other types of capital taxes. A general
 equilibrium model extended to include taxes on dividends, property,
 capital stock, excess profits, and undistributed profits predicts patterns
 of output, investment, and hours worked that are more like those in the
 1930s than found in earlier studies. The greatest effects come from the
 increased taxes on corporate dividends and undistributed profits. JEL

Title: Debt, Deleveraging, and the Liquidity Trap: A Fisher-Minsky-Koo Approach 
Abstract:
 In this article we present a simple new Keynesian--style model of
 debt-driven slumps--that is, situations in which an overhang of debt on
 the part of some agents, who are forced into rapid deleveraging, is
 depressing aggregate demand. Making some agents debt-constrained is a
 surprisingly powerful assumption. Fisherian debt deflation, the
 possibility of a liquidity trap, the paradox of thrift and toil, a
 Keynesian-type multiplier, and a rationale for expansionary fiscal policy
 all emerge naturally from the model. We argue that this approach sheds
 considerable light both on current economic difficulties and on historical
 episodes, including Japan's lost decade (now in its 18th year) and the
 Great Depression itself. (JEL Codes: E32, E52, E62)  Copyright 2012, Oxford University Press.

Title: The Effects of Fiscal Stimulus: Evidence from the 2009 Cash for Clunkers Program 
Abstract:
 We evaluate the impact of the 2009 Cash for Clunkers program on short- and
 medium-run auto purchases. Our empirical strategy exploits variation
 across U.S. cities in ex ante exposure to the program as measured by the
 number of "clunkers" in the city as of summer 2008. We find that the
 program induced the purchase of an additional 370,000 cars in July and
 August 2009. However, we find strong evidence of reversal; high clunker
 counties bought fewer autos in the 10 months after the program expired,
 which offset most of the initial purchases. We find no evidence of an
 effect on employment, house prices, or household default rates in cities
 with higher exposure to the program. JEL Codes: H20, E62.  Copyright 2012, Oxford University Press.
