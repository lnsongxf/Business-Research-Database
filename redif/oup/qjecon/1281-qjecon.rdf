Title: A Revealed Preference Ranking of U.S. Colleges and Universities
Abstract:
 We present a method of ranking U.S. undergraduate programs based on
 students' revealed preferences. When a student chooses a college among
 those that have admitted him, that college "wins" his "tournament." Our
 method efficiently integrates the information from thousands of such
 tournaments. We implement the method using data from a national sample of
 high-achieving students. We demonstrate that this ranking method has
 strong theoretical properties, eliminating incentives for colleges to
 adopt strategic, inefficient admissions policies to improve their
 rankings. We also show empirically that our ranking is (1) not vulnerable
 to strategic manipulation; (2) similar regardless of whether we control
 for variables, such as net cost, that vary among a college's admits; (3)
 similar regardless of whether we account for students selecting where to
 apply, including Early Decision. We exemplify multiple rankings for
 different types of students who have preferences that vary systematically.

Title: Does Management Matter? Evidence from India
Abstract:
 A long-standing question is whether differences in management practices
 across firms can explain differences in productivity, especially in
 developing countries where these spreads appear particularly large. To
 investigate this, we ran a management field experiment on large Indian
 textile firms. We provided free consulting on management practices to
 randomly chosen treatment plants and compared their performance to a set
 of control plants. We find that adopting these management practices raised
 productivity by 17% in the first year through improved quality and
 efficiency and reduced inventory, and within three years led to the
 opening of more production plants. Why had the firms not adopted these
 profitable practices previously? Our results suggest that informational
 barriers were the primary factor explaining this lack of adoption. Also,
 because reallocation across firms appeared to be constrained by limits on
 managerial time, competition had not forced badly managed firms to exit.

Title: Veiling 
Abstract:
 Veiling among Muslim women is modeled as a commitment mechanism that
 limits temptation to deviate from religious norms of behavior. The
 analysis suggests that veiling is a strategy for integration, enabling
 women to take up outside economic opportunities while preserving their
 reputation within the community. This accounts for puzzling features of
 the new veiling movement since the 1970s. Veiling also has surprising
 effects on the intergenerational transmission of values. Compulsory
 veiling laws can lead to a decline in religiosity. Bans on veiling can
 inhibit social integration and increase religiosity. JEL Codes: C72, C73,

Title: Gender Discrimination in Job Ads: Evidence from China
Abstract:
 We study explicit gender discrimination in a population of ads on a
 Chinese Internet job board. Gender-targeted job ads are common, favor
 women as often as men, and are much less common in jobs requiring higher
 levels of skill. Employers' relative preferences for female versus male
 workers, on the other hand, are more strongly related to the preferred
 age, height, and beauty of the worker than to job skill levels. Almost two
 thirds of the variation in advertised gender preferences occurs within
 firms, and one third occurs within firmoccupation cells. Overall, these
 patterns are not well explained by a firm-level animus model, by a
 glass-ceiling model, or by models in which broad occupational categories
 are consistently gendered across firms. Instead, the patterns suggest a
 model in which firms have idiosyncratic preferences for particular
 job-gender matches, which are overridden in skilled positions by factors
 such as thinner labor markets or a greater incentive to search broadly for
 the most qualified candidate. JEL Codes: J16, J63, J71.  Copyright 2013, Oxford University Press.

Title: Unconditional Convergence in Manufacturing 
Abstract:
 Unlike economies as a whole, manufacturing industries exhibit strong
 unconditional convergence in labor productivity. The article documents
 this at various levels of disaggregation for a large sample covering more
 than 100 countries over recent decades. The result is highly robust to
 changes in the sample and specification. The coefficient of unconditional
 convergence is estimated quite precisely and is large, at between 2--3% in
 most specifications and 2.9% a year in the baseline specification covering
 118 countries. The article also finds substantial sigma convergence at the
 two-digit level for a smaller sample of countries. Despite strong
 convergence within manufacturing, aggregate convergence fails due to the
 small share of manufacturing employment in low-income countries and the
 slow pace of industrialization. Because of data coverage, these findings
 should be as viewed as applying to the organized, formal parts of
 manufacturing. JEL Codes: O40, O14  Copyright 2013, Oxford University Press.

Title: Long-Term Effects of Class Size 
Abstract:
 This article evaluates the long-term effects of class size in primary
 school. We use rich data from Sweden and exploit variation in class size
 created by a maximum class size rule. Smaller classes in the last three
 years of primary school (age 10 to 13) are beneficial for cognitive and
 noncognitive ability at age 13, and improve achievement at age 16. Most
 important, we find that smaller classes have positive effects on completed
 education, wages, and earnings at age 27 to 42. The estimated wage effect
 is large enough to pass a cost-benefit test. JEL Codes: I21, I28, J24,

Title: A Model of Focusing in Economic Choice
Abstract:
 We present a generally applicable theory of focusing based on the
 hypothesis that a person focuses more on, and hence overweights,
 attributes in which her options differ more. Our model predicts that the
 decision maker is too prone to choose options with concentrated advantages
 relative to alternatives, but maximizes utility when the advantages and
 disadvantages of alternatives are equally concentrated. Applying our model
 to intertemporal choice, these results predict that a person exhibits
 present bias and time inconsistency when--such as in lifestyle choices and
 other widely invoked applications of hyperbolic discounting--the future
 effect of a current decision is distributed over many dates, and the
 effects of multiple decisions accumulate. But unlike in previous models,
 in our theory (1) present bias is lower when the costs of current
 misbehavior are less dispersed, helping explain why people respond more to
 monetary incentives than to health concerns in harmful consumption; and
 (2) time inconsistency is lower when a person commits to fewer decisions
 with accumulating effects in her ex ante choice. In addition, a person
 does not fully maximize welfare even when making decisions ex ante: (3)
 she commits to too much of an activity--for example, exercise or
 work--that is beneficial overall; and (4) makes "future-biased"
 commitments when--such as in preparing for a big event--the benefit of
 many periods' effort is concentrated in a single goal. JEL Codes: D03,

Title: Human Capital and Regional Development
Abstract:
 We investigate the determinants of regional development using a newly
 constructed database of 1,569 subnational regions from 110 countries
 covering 74% of the world's surface and 97% of its GDP. We combine the
 cross-regional analysis of geographic, institutional, cultural, and human
 capital determinants of regional development with an examination of
 productivity in several thousand establishments located in these regions.
 To organize the discussion, we present a new model of regional development
 that introduces into a standard migration framework elements of both the
Lucas (1978) model of the
 allocation of talent between entrepreneurship and work, and the Lucas (1988) model of human
 capital externalities. The evidence points to the paramount importance of
 human capital in accounting for regional differences in development, but
 also suggests from model estimation and calibration that entrepreneurial
 inputs and possibly human capital externalities help understand the data.

Title: Instantaneous Gratification 
Abstract:
 Extending Barro (1999) and Luttmer and Mariotti (2003), we introduce a new
 model of time preferences: the instantaneous-gratification model. This
 model applies tractably to a much wider range of settings than existing
 models. It applies to both complete- and incomplete-market settings and it
 works with generic utility functions. It works in settings with linear
 policy rules and in settings in which equilibrium cannot be supported by
 linear rules. The instantaneous-gratification model also generates a
 unique equilibrium, even in infinite-horizon applications, thereby
 resolving the multiplicity problem hitherto associated with dynamically
 inconsistent models. Finally, it simultaneously features a single welfare
 criterion and a behavioral tendency towards overconsumption. JEL Codes:

Title: How should inmates be released from prison? An assessment of parole versus fixed-sentence regimes
Abstract:
 Over the past 30 years, many states have abolished parole boards, which
 traditionally have had the discretion to release inmates before the
 expiration of their full sentence, in favor of fixed-sentence regimes in
 which the original sentence is binding. However, if prison time lowers
 recidivism risk and if parole boards can accurately estimate inmates'
 recidivism risk, then relative to a fixed-sentence regime, parole can
 provide allocative-efficiency benefits (costly prison space is allocated
 to the highest-risk offenders) and incentive benefits (prisoners know they
 must reduce their recidivism risk to gain an early release, so invest in
 their own rehabilitation). Exploiting quasi-experiments from the state of
 Georgia, I show that prison time reduces recidivism risk and that parole
 boards set prison time in an allocatively efficient manner. Prisoners
 respond to these incentives; after a reform that eliminated parole for
 certain offenders, they accumulated a greater number of disciplinary
 infractions, completed fewer prison rehabilitative programs, and
 recidivated at higher rates than inmates unaffected by the reform. I
 estimate that eliminating parole for all prisoners would increase the
 prison population by 10% while also increasing the crime rate through
 deleterious effects on recidivism. JEL Codes: H76, K14, K40.  Copyright 2013, Oxford University Press.
