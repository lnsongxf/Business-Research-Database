Title: Proximity and Investment: Evidence from Plant-Level Data
Abstract:
 Proximity to plants makes it easier for headquarters to monitor and
 acquire information about plants. In this article, I estimate the effects
 of headquarters' proximity to plants on plant-level investment and
 productivity. Using the introduction of new airline routes as a source of
 exogenous variation in proximity, I find that new airline routes that
 reduce the travel time between headquarters and plants lead to an increase
 in plant-level investment of 8% to 9% and an increase in plants' total
 factor productivity of 1.3% to 1.4%. The results are robust when I control
 for local and firm-level shocks that could potentially drive the
 introduction of new airline routes, when I consider only new airline
 routes that are the outcome of a merger between two airlines or the
 opening of a new hub, and when I consider only indirect flights where
 either the last leg of the flight (involving the plant's home airport) or
 the first leg of the flight (involving headquarters' home airport) remains
 unchanged. Moreover, the results are stronger in the earlier years of the
 sample period and for firms whose headquarters is more time-constrained.
 In addition, they also hold at the extensive margin, that is, when I
 consider plant openings and closures. JEL Codes: D24, G31.  Copyright 2013, Oxford University Press.

Title: Cooperation in Strategic Games Revisited 
Abstract:
 For two-person complete-information strategic games with transferable
 utility, all major variable-threat bargaining and arbitration solutions
 coincide. This confluence of solutions by luminaries such as Nash,
 Harsanyi, Raiffa, and Selten, is more than mere coincidence. Staying in
 the class of two-person games with transferable unility, the article
 presents a more complete theory that expands their solution. Specifically,
 it presents: (1) a decomposition of a game into cooperative and
 competitive components, (2) an intuitive and computable closed-form
 formula for the solution, (3) an axiomatic justification of the solution,
 and (4) a generalization of the solution to games with private signals,
 along with an arbitration scheme that implements it. The objective is to
 restart research on cooperative solutions to strategic games and their
 applications. JEL Codes: C71, C72, C78.  Copyright 2013, Oxford University Press.

Title: A Price Theory of Vertical and Lateral Integration 
Abstract:
 This article presents a perfectly competitive model of firm boundary
 decisions and study their interplay with product demand, technology, and
 welfare. Integration is privately costly but is effective at coordinating
 production decisions; nonintegration is less costly but coordinates
 relatively poorly. Output price influences the choice of ownership
 structure: integration increases with the price level. At the same time,
 ownership affects output, because integration is more productive than
 nonintegration. For a generic set of demand functions, equilibrium
 delivers heterogeneity of ownership and performance among ex ante
 identical enterprises. The price mechanism transmutes demand shifts into
 industry-wide reorganizations and generates external effects from
 technological shocks: productivity changes in some firms may induce
 ownership changes in others. If the enterprise managers have full title to
 its revenues, market equilibrium ownership structures are second-best
 efficient. When managers have less than full revenue claims, equilibrium
 can be inefficient, with too little integration. JEL Codes: D21, D23, D41,

Title: Redistributive Taxation in the Roy Model
Abstract:
 We consider optimal redistribution in a model where individuals can
 self-select into one of several possible sectors based on heterogeneity in
 a multidimensional skill vector. We first show that when the government
 does not observe the sectoral choice or underlying skills of its citizens,
 the constrained Pareto frontier can be implemented with a single nonlinear
 income tax. We then characterize this optimal tax schedule. If sectoral
 inputs are complements, a many-sector model with self-selection leads to
 optimal income taxes that are less progressive than the corresponding
 taxes in a standard single-sector model under natural conditions. However,
 they are more progressive than in canonical multisector economies with
 discrete types and without occupational choice or overlapping sectoral
 wage distributions. JEL Codes: H2, D5, D8, E2, E6, J3, J6.  Copyright 2013, Oxford University Press.

Title: A Political Theory of Populism
Abstract:
 When voters fear that politicians may be influenced or corrupted by the
 rich elite, signals of integrity are valuable. As a consequence, an honest
 politician seeking reelection chooses "populist" policies--that is,
 policies to the left of the median voter--as a way of signaling that he is
 not beholden to the interests of the right. Politicians that are
 influenced by right-wing special interests respond by choosing moderate or
 even left-of-center policies. This populist bias of policy is greater when
 the value of remaining in office is higher for the politician; when there
 is greater polarization between the policy preferences of the median voter
 and right-wing special interests; when politicians are perceived as more
 likely to be corrupt; when there is an intermediate amount of noise in the
 information that voters receive; when politicians are more
 forward-looking; and when there is greater uncertainty about the type of
 the incumbent. We also show that soft term limits may exacerbate, rather
 than reduce, the populist bias of policies. JEL Codes: D71, D74.  Copyright 2013, Oxford University Press.

Title: Do Labor Market Policies have Displacement Effects? Evidence from a Clustered Randomized Experiment
Abstract: This article reports the results from a randomized experiment designed to
 evaluate the direct and indirect (displacement) impacts of job placement
 assistance on the labor market outcomes of young, educated job seekers in
 France. We use a two-step design. In the first step, the proportions of
 job seekers to be assigned to treatment (0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, or 100%) were
 randomly drawn for each of the 235 labor markets (e.g., cities)
 participating in the experiment. Then, in each labor market, eligible job
 seekers were randomly assigned to the treatment, following this
 proportion. After eight months, eligible, unemployed youths who were
 assigned to the program were significantly more likely to have found a
 stable job than those who were not. But these gains are transitory, and
 they appear to have come partly at the expense of eligible workers who did
 not benefit from the program, particularly in labor markets where they
 compete mainly with other educated workers, and in weak labor markets.
 Overall, the program seems to have had very little net benefits. JEL

Title: The Establishment-Level Behavior of Vacancies and Hiring
Abstract:
 This paper is the first to study vacancies, hires, and vacancy yields at
 the establishment level in the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, a
 large sample of US employers. To interpret the data, we develop a simple
 model that identifies the flow of new vacancies and the job-filling rate
 for vacant positions. The fill rate moves counter to aggregate employment
 but rises steeply with employer growth rates in the cross section. It
 falls with employer size, rises with worker turnover rates, and varies by
 a factor of four across major industry groups. We also develop evidence
 that the employer-level hiring technology exhibits mild increasing returns
 in vacancies, and that employers rely heavily on other instruments, in
 addition to vacancies, as they vary hires. Building from our evidence and
 a generalized matching function, we construct a new index of recruiting
 intensity (per vacancy). Recruiting intensity partly explains the recent
 breakdown in the standard matching function, delivers a better-fitting
 empirical Beveridge curve, and accounts for a large share of fluctuations
 in aggregate hires. Our evidence and analysis provide useful inputs for
 assessing, developing, and calibrating theoretical models of search,
 matching, and hiring in the labor market. JEL Codes: D21, E24, J60.  Copyright 2013, Oxford University Press.

Title: Monopolizing Violence and Consolidating Power
Abstract:
 Governments in weak states often face an armed opposition and have to
 decide whether to try to accommodate and contain that adversary or to try
 to consolidate power and monopolize violence by disarming it. When and why
 do governments choose to consolidate power and monopolize violence? How
 fast do they try to consolidate power? When does this lead to costly
 fighting rather than to efforts to eliminate the opposition by buying it
 off? We study an infinite-horizon model in which the government in each
 period decides how much to offer the opposition and the rate at which it
 tries to consolidate its power. The opposition can accept the offer and
 thereby acquiesce to the government's efforts to consolidate, or it can
 fight in an attempt to disrupt those efforts. In equilibrium, the
 government always tries to monopolize violence when it has "coercive
 power" against the opposition where, roughly, coercive power is the
 ability to weaken the opposition by lowering its payoff to fighting.
 Whether the government consolidates peacefully or through costly fighting
 depends on the size of any "contingent spoils," which are benefits that
 begin to accrue from an increase in economic activity resulting from the
 monopolization of violence and the higher level of security that comes
 with it. When contingent spoils are small, the government buys the
 opposition off and eliminates it as fast as is peacefully possible. When
 contingent spoils are large, the government tries to monopolize violence
 by defeating the opposition militarily. JEL Codes: D02, D74, H1.  Copyright 2013, Oxford University Press.

Title: Using Notches to Uncover Optimization Frictions and Structural Elasticities: Theory and Evidence from Pakistan 
Abstract:
 We develop a framework for nonparametrically identifying optimization
 frictions and structural elasticities using notches--discontinuities in
 the choice sets of agents--introduced by tax and transfer policies.
 Notches create excess bunching on the low-tax side and missing mass on the
 high-tax side of a cutoff, and they are often associated with a region of
 strictly dominated choice that would have zero mass in a frictionless
 world. By combining excess bunching (observed response attenuated by
 frictions) with missing mass in the dominated region (frictions), it is
 possible to uncover the structural elasticity that would govern behavior
 in the absence of frictions and arguably capture long-run behavior. We
 apply our framework to tax notches in Pakistan using rich administrative
 data. While observed bunching is large and sharp, optimization frictions
 are also very large as the majority of taxpayers in dominated ranges are
 unresponsive to tax incentives. The combination of large observed bunching
 and large frictions implies that the frictionless behavioral response to
 notches is extremely large, but the underlying structural elasticity
 driving this response is nevertheless modest. This highlights the
 inefficiency of notches: by creating extremely strong price distortions,
 they induce large behavioral responses even when structural elasticities
 are small. JEL Codes: H31, J22, O12.  Copyright 2013, Oxford University Press.

Title: On the Origins of Gender Roles: Women and the Plough
Abstract:
 The study examines the historical origins of existing cross-cultural
 differences in beliefs and values regarding the appropriate role of women
 in society. We test the hypothesis that traditional agricultural practices
 influenced the historical gender division of labor and the evolution of
 gender norms. We find that, consistent with existing hypotheses, the
 descendants of societies that traditionally practiced plough agriculture
 today have less equal gender norms, measured using reported gender-role
 attitudes and female participation in the workplace, politics, and
 entrepreneurial activities. Our results hold looking across countries,
 across districts within countries, and across ethnicities within
 districts. To test for the importance of cultural persistence, we examine
 the children of immigrants living in Europe and the United States. We find
 that even among these individuals, all born and raised in the same
 country, those with a heritage of traditional plough use exhibit less
 equal beliefs about gender roles today. JEL Codes: D03, J16, N30.  Copyright 2013, Oxford University Press.
