Title: Workplace Heterogeneity and the Rise of West German Wage Inequality 
Abstract:
 We study the role of establishment-specific wage premiums in generating
 recent increases in West German wage inequality. Models with additive
 fixed effects for workers and establishments are fit into four
 subintervals spanning the period from 1985 to 2009. We show that these
 models provide a good approximation to the wage structure and can explain
 nearly all of the dramatic rise in West German wage inequality. Our
 estimates suggest that the increasing dispersion of West German wages has
 arisen from a combination of rising heterogeneity between workers, rising
 dispersion in the wage premiums at different establishments, and
 increasing assortativeness in the assignment of workers to plants. In
 contrast, the idiosyncratic job-match component of wage variation is small
 and stable over time. Decomposing changes in mean wages between different
 education groups, occupations, and industries, we find that increasing
 plant-level heterogeneity and rising assortativeness in the assignment of
 workers to establishments explain a large share of the rise in inequality
 along all three dimensions. JEL Codes: J00, J31, J40.  Copyright 2013, Oxford University Press.

Title: Speculation and Risk Sharing with New Financial Assets 
Abstract:
 I investigate the effect of financial innovation on portfolio risks when
 traders have belief disagreements. I decompose traders' average portfolio
 risks into two components: the uninsurable variance, defined as portfolio
 risks that would obtain without belief disagreements, and the speculative
 variance, defined as portfolio risks that result from speculation. My main
 result shows that financial innovation always increases the speculative
 variance through two distinct channels: by generating new bets and by
 amplifying traders' existing bets. When disagreements are large, these
 effects are sufficiently strong that financial innovation increases
 average portfolio risks, decreases average portfolio comovements, and
 generates greater speculative trading volume relative to risk-sharing
 volume. Moreover, a profit-seeking market maker endogenously introduces
 speculative assets that increase average portfolio risks. JEL Codes: G11,

Title: Strengthening State Capabilities: The Role of Financial Incentives in the Call to Public Service 
Abstract:
 We study a recent recruitment drive for public sector positions in Mexico.
 Different salaries were announced randomly across recruitment sites, and
 job offers were subsequently randomized. Screening relied on exams
 designed to measure applicants' intellectual ability, personality, and
 motivation. This allows the first experimental estimates of (1) the role
 of financial incentives in attracting a larger and more qualified pool of
 applicants, (2) the elasticity of the labor supply facing the employer,
 and (3) the role of job attributes (distance, attractiveness of the
 municipal environment) in helping fill vacancies, as well as the role of
 wages in helping fill positions in less attractive municipalities. A
 theoretical model of job applications and acceptance guides the empirical
 inquiry. We find that higher wages attract more able applicants as
 measured by their IQ, personality, and proclivity toward public sector
 work--that is, we find no evidence of adverse selection effects on
 motivation; higher wage offers also increased acceptance rates, implying a
 labor supply elasticity of around 2 and some degree of monopsony power.
 Distance and worse municipal characteristics strongly decrease acceptance
 rates, but higher wages help bridge the recruitment gap in worse
 municipalities. JEL Code: H1.  Copyright 2013, Oxford University Press.

Title: The Economic Impact of Social Ties: Evidence from German Reunification 
Abstract:
 We use the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 to show that personal
 relationships which individuals maintain for noneconomic reasons can be an
 important determinant of regional economic growth. We show that West
 German households who had social ties to East Germany in 1989 experienced
 a persistent rise in their personal incomes after the fall of the Berlin
 Wall. Moreover, the presence of these households significantly affects
 economic performance at the regional level: it increases the returns to
 entrepreneurial activity, the share of households who become
 entrepreneurs, and the likelihood that firms based within a given West
 German region invest in East Germany. As a result, West German regions
 that (for idiosyncratic reasons) have a high concentration of households
 with social ties to the East exhibit substantially higher growth in income
 per capita in the early 1990s. A one standard deviation rise in the share
 of households with social ties to East Germany in 1989 is associated with
 a 4.7 percentage point rise in income per capita over six years. We
 interpret our findings as evidence of a causal link between social ties
 and regional economic development. JEL Codes: O10, O43, J61, L14, F20.  Copyright 2013, Oxford University Press.

Title: How Safe Are Money Market Funds? 
Abstract:
 We examine the risk-taking behavior of money market funds during the
 financial crisis of 2007--2010. We find that (1) money market funds
 experienced an unprecedented expansion in their risk-taking opportunities;
 (2) funds had strong incentives to take on risk because fund inflows were
 highly responsive to fund yields; (3) funds sponsored by financial
 intermediaries with more money fund business took on more risk; and (4)
 funds suffered runs as a result of their risk taking. This evidence
 suggests that money market funds lack safety because they have strong
 incentives to take on risk when the opportunity arises and are vulnerable
 to runs. JEL Codes: G21, G23, E44.  Copyright 2013, Oxford University Press.

Title: Marriage Institutions and Sibling Competition: Evidence from South Asia 
Abstract:
 Using data from South Asia, this article examines how arranged marriage
 cultivates rivalry among sisters. During marriage search, parents with
 multiple daughters reduce the reservation quality for an older daughter's
 groom, rushing her marriage to allow sufficient time to marry off her
 younger sisters. Relative to younger brothers, younger sisters increase a
 girl's marriage risk; relative to younger singleton sisters, younger twin
 sisters have the same effect. These effects intensify in marriage markets
 with lower sex ratios or greater parental involvement in marriage
 arrangements. In contrast, older sisters delay a girl's marriage. Because
 girls leave school when they marry and face limited earning opportunities
 when they reach adulthood, the number of sisters has well-being
 consequences over the life cycle. Younger sisters cause earlier
 school-leaving, lower literacy, a match to a husband with less education
 and a less skilled occupation, and (marginally) lower adult economic
 status. Data from a broader set of countries indicate that these
 cross-sister pressures on marriage age are common throughout the
 developing world, although the schooling costs vary by setting. JEL Codes:

Title: The Missing Wealth of Nations: Are Europe and the U.S. net Debtors or net Creditors? 
Abstract:
 This article shows that official statistics substantially underestimate
 the net foreign asset positions of rich countries because they fail to
 capture most of the assets held by households in offshore tax havens.
 Drawing on a unique Swiss data set and exploiting systematic anomalies in
 countries' portfolio investment positions, I find that around 8% of the
 global financial wealth of households is held in tax havens,
 three-quarters of which goes unrecorded. On the basis of plausible
 assumptions, accounting for unrecorded assets turns the eurozone,
 officially the world's second largest net debtor, into a net creditor. It
 also reduces the U.S. net debt significantly. The results shed new light
 on global imbalances and challenge the widespread view that after a decade
 of poor-to-rich capital flows, external assets are now in poor countries
 and debts in rich countries. I provide concrete proposals to improve
 international statistics. JEL Codes: F32, H26, H87.  Copyright 2013, Oxford University Press.

Title: Rules with Discretion and Local Information 
Abstract:
 To ensure that individual actors take certain actions, community
 enforcement may be required. This can present a rules-versus-discretion
 dilemma: it can become impossible to employ discretion based on
 information that is not widely held, because the wider community is unable
 to verify how the information was used. Instead, actions may need to
 conform to simple and widely verifiable rules. We study when discretion in
 the form of exceptions to a simple rule can be implemented, if the
 information is shared by the action taker and a second party, who is able
 to verify for the larger group that an exception is warranted. In
 particular, we compare protocols where the second party excuses the action
 taker from taking the action ex ante with protocols where the second party
 instead forgives a rule-breaking actor ex post. JEL Codes: C73, D82.  Copyright 2013, Oxford University Press.

Title: The Emergence of Political Accountability 
Abstract:
 When and how do democratic institutions deliver accountable government? In
 addressing this broad question, we focus on the role played by political
 norms--specifically, the extent to which leaders abuse office for personal
 gain and the extent to which citizens punish such transgressions. We show
 how qualitatively distinct political norms can coexist because of a
 dynamic complementarity, in which citizens' willingness to punish
 transgressions is raised when they expect such punishments to be used in
 the future. We seek to understand the emergence of accountability by
 analysing transitions between norms. To do so, we extend the analysis to
 include the possibility that, at certain times, a segment of voters are
 (behaviorally) intolerant of transgressions. Our mechanism highlights the
 role of leaders, offering an account of how their actions can instigate
 enduring change, within a fixed set of formal institutions, by disrupting
 prevailing political norms. We show how such changes do not depend on "sun
 spots" to trigger coordination, and are asymmetric in effect--a series of
 good leaders can (and eventually will) improve norms, whereas bad leaders
 cannot damage them. JEL Codes: D72, P16, C73.  Copyright 2013, Oxford University Press.

Title: Duration Dependence and Labor Market Conditions: Evidence from a Field Experiment 
Abstract:
 This article studies the role of employer behavior in generating "negative
 duration dependence"--the adverse effect of a longer unemployment
 spell--by sending fictitious résumés to real job postings in 100 U.S.
 cities. Our results indicate that the likelihood of receiving a callback
 for an interview significantly decreases with the length of a worker's
 unemployment spell, with the majority of this decline occurring during the
 first eight months. We explore how this effect varies with local labor
 market conditions and find that duration dependence is stronger when the
 local labor market is tighter. This result is consistent with the
 prediction of a broad class of screening models in which employers use the
 unemployment spell length as a signal of unobserved productivity and
 recognize that this signal is less informative in weak labor markets. JEL
