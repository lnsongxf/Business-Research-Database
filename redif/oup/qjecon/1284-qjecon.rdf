Title: Do terms-of-trade effects matter for trade agreements? Theory and evidence from WTO Countries 
Abstract:
 International trade agreements are an important element of the world
 economic system, but questions remain as to their purpose. The
 terms-of-trade hypothesis posits that countries use tariffs in part to
 improve their terms of trade and that trade agreements cause them to
 internalize the costs that such terms-of-trade shifts impose on other
 countries. This article investigates whether the most-favored-nation (MFN)
 tariffs set by World Trade Organization (WTO) members in the Uruguay Round
 are consistent with the terms-of-trade hypothesis. We present a model of
 multilateral trade negotiations featuring endogenous participation that
 leads the resulting tariff schedules to display terms-of-trade effects.
 Specifically, the model predicts that the level of the importer's tariff
 resulting from negotiations should be negatively related to the product of
 two terms: exporter concentration, as measured by the Herfindahl-Hirschman
 index (sum of squared export shares), and the importer's market power, as
 measured by the inverse elasticity of export supply, on a
 product-by-product basis. We test this hypothesis using data on tariffs,
 trade, and production across more than 30 WTO countries and find strong
 support. We estimate that the internalization of terms of trade effects
 through WTO negotiations has lowered the average tariff of these countries
 by 22% to 27% compared to its noncooperative level. JEL Codes: F1, F5.  Copyright 2013, Oxford University Press.

Title: External Economies and International Trade Redux: Comment 
Abstract:
 Recently, Gene Grossman and Esteban Rossi-Hansberg (GRH; "External
 Economies and International Trade: Redux," Quarterly Journal of Economics
 125 [2010], 829--858) proposed a novel way to think about the implications
 of international trade in the presence of national external economies at
 the industry level. Instead of perfect competition and two industries, GRH
 assume Bertrand competition and a continuum of industries. GRH conclude
 that the equilibrium is unique if transport costs are low, that there is
 no trade for high transport costs, and that there is no equilibrium in
 pure strategies when transport costs are intermediate. In this note we
 reexamine the equilibrium analysis under different transport costs for a
 single industry (partial equilibrium) version of GRH's model. We confirm
 many of GRH's results, but also find that there are circumstances under
 which there are multiple equilibria, including equilibria in which trade
 patterns run counter to "natural" comparative advantage, and also find
 that there is a profitable deviation to the mixed-strategy equilibrium
 postulated by GRH for intermediate trading costs. We propose an
 alternative set of strategies for this case and establish that they
 constitute an equilibrium. JEL Code: F10.  Copyright 2013, Oxford University Press.

Title: Fungibility and Consumer Choice: Evidence from Commodity Price Shocks 
Abstract:
 We formulate a test of the fungibility of money based on parallel shifts
 in the prices of different quality grades of a commodity. We embed the
 test in a discrete-choice model of product quality choice and estimate the
 model using panel microdata on gasoline purchases. We find that when
 gasoline prices rise, consumers substitute to lower octane gasoline, to an
 extent that cannot be explained by income effects. Across a wide range of
 specifications, we consistently reject the null hypothesis that households
 treat "gas money" as fungible with other income. We compare the empirical
 fit of three psychological models of decision making. A simple model of
 category budgeting fits the data well, with models of loss aversion and
 salience both capturing important features of the time series. JEL Codes:

Title: Matching with Couples: Stability and Incentives in Large Markets 
Abstract:
 Accommodating couples has been a long-standing issue in the design of
 centralized labor market clearinghouses for doctors and psychologists,
 because couples view pairs of jobs as complements. A stable matching may
 not exist when couples are present. This article's main result is that a
 stable matching exists when there are relatively few couples and
 preference lists are sufficiently short relative to market size. We also
 discuss incentives in markets with couples. We relate these theoretical
 results to the job market for psychologists, in which stable matchings
 exist for all years of the data, despite the presence of couples. JEL

Title: Household Balance Sheets, Consumption, and the Economic Slump 
Abstract:
 We investigate the consumption consequences of the 2006--9 housing
 collapse using the highly unequal geographic distribution of wealth losses
 across the United States. We estimate a large elasticity of consumption
 with respect to housing net worth of 0.6 to 0.8, which soundly rejects the
 hypothesis of full consumption risk-sharing. The average marginal
 propensity to consume (MPC) out of housing wealth is 5--7 cents with
 substantial heterogeneity across ZIP codes. ZIP codes with poorer and more
 levered households have a significantly higher MPC out of housing wealth.
 In line with the MPC result, ZIP codes experiencing larger wealth losses,
 particularly those with poorer and more levered households, experience a
 larger reduction in credit limits, refinancing likelihood, and credit
 scores. Our findings highlight the role of debt and the geographic
 distribution of wealth shocks in explaining the large and unequal decline
 in consumption from 2006 to 2009. JEL Codes: E21, E32, E44, E60.  Copyright 2013, Oxford University Press.

Title: Do Political Protests Matter? Evidence from the Tea Party Movement 
Abstract:
 Can protests cause political change, or are they merely symptoms of
 underlying shifts in policy preferences? We address this question by
 studying the Tea Party movement in the United States, which rose to
 prominence through coordinated rallies across the country on Tax Day,
 April 15, 2009. We exploit variation in rainfall on the day of these
 rallies as an exogenous source of variation in attendance. We show that
 good weather at this initial, coordinating event had significant
 consequences for the subsequent local strength of the movement, increased
 public support for Tea Party positions, and led to more Republican votes
 in the 2010 midterm elections. Policy making was also affected, as
 incumbents responded to large protests in their district by voting more
 conservatively in Congress. Our estimates suggest significant multiplier
 effects: an additional protester increased the number of Republican votes
 by a factor well above 1. Together our results show that protests can
 build political movements that ultimately affect policy making and that
 they do so by influencing political views rather than solely through the
 revelation of existing political preferences. JEL Code: D72.  Copyright 2013, Oxford University Press.

Title: The Transitional Costs of Sectoral Reallocation: Evidence From the Clean Air Act and the Workforce 
Abstract:
 This article uses linked worker-firm data in the United States to estimate
 the transitional costs associated with reallocating workers from newly
 regulated industries to other sectors of the economy in the context of new
 environmental regulations. The focus on workers rather than industries as
 the unit of analysis allows me to examine previously unobserved economic
 outcomes such as nonemployment and long-run earnings losses from job
 transitions, both of which are critical to understanding the reallocative
 costs associated with these policies. Using plant-level panel variation
 induced by the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAA), I find that the
 reallocative costs of environmental policy are significant. Workers in
 newly regulated plants experienced, in aggregate, more than $5.4 billion
 in forgone earnings for the years after the change in policy. Most of
 these costs are driven by nonemployment and lower earnings in future
 employment, highlighting the importance of longitudinal data for
 characterizing the costs and consequences of labor market adjustment.
 Relative to the estimated benefits of the 1990 CAAA, these one-time
 transitional costs are small. JEL Codes: Q50, H41, R11.  Copyright 2013, Oxford University Press.

Title: Managerial Miscalibration 
Abstract:
 Using a unique 10-year panel that includes more than 13,300 expected stock
 market return probability distributions, we find that executives are
 severely miscalibrated, producing distributions that are too narrow:
 realized market returns are within the executives' 80% confidence
 intervals only 36% of the time. We show that executives reduce the lower
 bound of the forecast confidence interval during times of high market
 uncertainty; however, ex post miscalibration is worst during periods of
 high uncertainty. We also find that executives who are miscalibrated about
 the stock market show similar miscalibration regarding their own firms'
 prospects. Finally, firms with miscalibrated executives seem to follow
 more aggressive corporate policies: investing more and using more debt
 financing. JEL Codes: G31, G32, G34, D03, D22, D84.  Copyright 2013, Oxford University Press.

Title: Truth-telling by Third-party Auditors and the Response of Polluting Firms: Experimental Evidence from India 
Abstract:
 In many regulated markets, private, third-party auditors are chosen and
 paid by the firms that they audit, potentially creating a conflict of
 interest. This article reports on a two-year field experiment in the
 Indian state of Gujarat that sought to curb such a conflict by altering
 the market structure for environmental audits of industrial plants to
 incentivize accurate reporting. There are three main results. First, the
 status quo system was largely corrupted, with auditors systematically
 reporting plant emissions just below the standard, although true emissions
 were typically higher. Second, the treatment caused auditors to report
 more truthfully and very significantly lowered the fraction of plants that
 were falsely reported as compliant with pollution standards. Third,
 treatment plants, in turn, reduced their pollution emissions. The results
 suggest reformed incentives for third-party auditors can improve their
 reporting and make regulation more effective. JEL Codes: Q56, M42, D22.  Copyright 2013, Oxford University Press.

Title: Inequality, the Urban-Rural Gap, and Migration 
Abstract:
 Using population and product consumption data from the Demographic and
 Health Surveys, I construct comparable measures of inequality and
 migration for 65 countries, including some of the poorest countries in the
 world. I find that the urban-rural gap accounts for 40% of mean country
 inequality and much of its cross-country variation. One out of every four
 or five individuals raised in rural areas moves to urban areas as a young
 adult, where they earn much higher incomes than nonmigrant rural permanent
 residents. Equally, one out of every four or five individuals raised in
 urban areas moves to rural areas as a young adult, where they earn much
 lower incomes than their nonmigrant urban cousins. These flows and
 relative incomes are suggestive of a world where the population sorts
 itself geographically on the basis of its human capital and skill. I show
 that a simple model of this sort explains the urban-rural gap in living
 standards. JEL Codes: O15, O18.  Copyright 2013, Oxford University Press.
