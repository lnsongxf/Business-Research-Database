Title: School Segregation, Educational Attainment, and Crime: Evidence from the End of Busing in Charlotte-Mecklenburg
Abstract:
 We study the end of race-based busing in Charlotte-Mecklenburg schools
 (CMS). In 2001, school boundaries in CMS were redrawn dramatically, and
 half of students received a new assignment. Using addresses measured prior
 to the policy change, we compare students in the same neighborhood that
 lived on opposite sides of a newly drawn boundary. We find that both white
 and minority students score lower on high school exams when they are
 assigned to schools with more minority students. We also find decreases in
 high school graduation and four-year college attendance for whites and
 large increases in crime for minority males. We conclude that the end of
 race-based busing widened racial inequality, despite efforts by CMS to
 mitigate the effect of segregation through compensatory resource
 allocation. JEL Codes: I20, I24.  Copyright 2014, Oxford University Press.

Title: Inflation Dynamics and Time-Varying Volatility: New Evidence and an Ss Interpretation 
Author-Name: Joseph Vavra
Abstract:
 Is monetary policy less effective at increasing real output during periods
 of high volatility than during normal times? In this article, I argue that
 greater volatility leads to an increase in aggregate price flexibility so
 that nominal stimulus mostly generates inflation rather than output
 growth. To do this, I construct price-setting models with "volatility
 shocks" and show these models match new facts in CPI micro data that
 standard price-setting models miss. I then show that these models imply
 that output responds less to nominal stimulus during times of high
 volatility. Furthermore, because volatility is countercyclical, this
 implies that nominal stimulus has smaller real effects during downturns.
 For example, the estimated output response to additional nominal stimulus
 in September 1995, a time of low volatility, is 55% larger than the
 response in October 2001, a time of high volatility. JEL Codes: E10, E30,

Title: Valuing the Vote: The Redistribution of Voting Rights and State Funds following the Voting Rights Act of 1965
Abstract:
 The Voting Rights Act of 1965, called one of the most effective pieces of
 civil rights legislation in U.S. history, generated dramatic increases in
 black voter registration across the South. We ask whether the increase in
 black voting rights was accompanied by an increase in blacks' share of
 public spending. We exploit a key provision of the act--removal of
 literacy tests at registration--for identification. Employing a
 triple-difference framework over a 20-year period, we find that counties
 with higher black population shares in former literacy test states saw
 greater increases in both voter turnout and state transfers than
 comparison counties in non--literacy test states, a finding that is
 consistent with models of distributive politics. JEL Codes: D72, H7, I2,

Title: National Institutions and Subnational Development in Africa
Abstract:
 We investigate the role of national institutions on subnational African
 development in a novel framework that accounts for both local geography
 and cultural-genetic traits. We exploit the fact that the political
 boundaries on the eve of African independence partitioned more than 200
 ethnic groups across adjacent countries subjecting similar cultures,
 residing in homogeneous geographic areas, to different formal
 institutions. Using both a matching type and a spatial regression
 discontinuity approach we show that differences in countrywide
 institutional structures across the national border do not explain
 within-ethnicity differences in economic performance, as captured by
 satellite images of light density. The average noneffect of national
 institutions on ethnic development masks considerable heterogeneity
 partially driven by the diminishing role of national institutions in areas
 further from the capital cities. JEL Codes: O10, O40, O43, N17, Z10.  Copyright 2014, Oxford University Press.

Title: Optimal money creation in "pure currency" economies: a conjecture 
Author-Name: Neil Wallace
Abstract:
 In a pure-currency economy, money is the only durable object and people
 have private histories. In such economies, taxation is not feasible and in
 some of them trade is enhanced through the use of money. For economies of
 that kind in which a nondegenerate distribution of money, part of the
 state of the economy, affects trades and real outcomes, and in which
 trades affect the state at the next date, the conjecture is that there are
 transfer schemes financed by money creation that improve ex ante
 representative-agent welfare relative to what can be achieved holding the
 stock of money fixed. JEL Codes: E52, E58.  Copyright 2014, Oxford University Press.

Title: The Employment Effects of Credit Market Disruptions: Firm-level Evidence from the 2008-9 Financial Crisis 
Author-Name: Gabriel Chodorow-Reich
Abstract:
 This article investigates the effect of bank lending frictions on
 employment outcomes. I construct a new data set that combines information
 on banking relationships and employment at 2,000 nonfinancial firms during
 the 2008-9 crisis. The article first verifies empirically the importance
 of banking relationships, which imply a cost to borrowers who switch
 lenders. I then use the dispersion in lender health following the Lehman
 crisis as a source of exogenous variation in the availability of credit to
 borrowers. I find that credit matters. Firms that had precrisis
 relationships with less healthy lenders had a lower likelihood of
 obtaining a loan following the Lehman bankruptcy, paid a higher interest
 rate if they did borrow, and reduced employment by more compared to
 precrisis clients of healthier lenders. Consistent with frictions deriving
 from asymmetric information, the effects vary by firm type. Lender health
 has an economically and statistically significant effect on employment at
 small and medium firms, but the data cannot reject the hypothesis of no
 effect at the largest or most transparent firms. Abstracting from general
 equilibrium effects, I find that the withdrawal of credit accounts for
 between one-third and one-half of the employment decline at small and
 medium firms in the sample in the year following the Lehman bankruptcy.

Title: The Global Decline of the Labor Share 
Abstract:
 The stability of the labor share of income is a key foundation in
 macroeconomic models. We document, however, that the global labor share
 has significantly declined since the early 1980s, with the decline
 occurring within the large majority of countries and industries. We show
 that the decrease in the relative price of investment goods, often
 attributed to advances in information technology and the computer age,
 induced firms to shift away from labor and toward capital. The lower price
 of investment goods explains roughly half of the observed decline in the
 labor share, even when we allow for other mechanisms influencing factor
 shares, such as increasing profits, capital-augmenting technology growth,
 and the changing skill composition of the labor force. We highlight the
 implications of this explanation for welfare and macroeconomic dynamics.

Title: Migration and Wage Effects of Taxing Top Earners: Evidence from the Foreigners' Tax Scheme in Denmark 
Abstract:
 This article analyzes the effects of income taxation on the international
 migration and earnings of top earners using a Danish preferential
 foreigner tax scheme and population-wide Danish administrative data. This
 scheme, introduced in 1991, allows new immigrants with high earnings to be
 taxed at a preferential flat rate for a duration of three years. We obtain
 two main results. First, the scheme has doubled the number of highly paid
 foreigners in Denmark relative to slightly less paid--and therefore
 ineligible--foreigners. This translates into a very large elasticity of
 migration with respect to 1 minus the average tax rate on foreigners,
 between 1.5 and 2. Second, we find compelling evidence of a negative
 effect of the scheme-induced reduction in the average tax rate on pretax
 earnings of foreign migrants at the individual level. This finding can be
 rationalized by a matching frictions model with wage bargaining where
 there is a gap between pay and marginal productivity. JEL Codes: H31, J61.  Copyright 2014, Oxford University Press.

Title: Local Economic Development, Agglomeration Economies, and the Big Push: 100 Years of Evidence from the Tennessee Valley Authority
Abstract:
 We study the long-run effects of one of the most ambitious regional
 development programs in U.S. history: the Tennessee Valley Authority
 (TVA). Using as controls authorities that were proposed but never approved
 by Congress, we find that the TVA led to large gains in agricultural
 employment that were eventually reversed when the program's subsidies
 ended. Gains in manufacturing employment, by contrast, continued to
 intensify well after federal transfers had lapsed--a pattern consistent
 with the presence of agglomeration economies in manufacturing. Because
 manufacturing paid higher wages than agriculture, this shift raised
 aggregate income in the TVA region for an extended period of time.
 Economists have long cautioned that the local gains created by place-based
 policies may be offset by losses elsewhere. We develop a structured
 approach to assessing the TVA's aggregate consequences that is applicable
 to other place-based policies. In our model, the TVA affects the national
 economy both directly through infrastructure improvements and indirectly
 through agglomeration economies. The model's estimates suggest that the
 TVA's direct investments yielded a significant increase in national
 manufacturing productivity, with benefits exceeding the program's costs.
 However, the program's indirect effects appear to have been limited:
 agglomeration gains in the TVA region were offset by losses in the rest of
 the country. Spillovers in manufacturing appear to be the rare example of
 a localized market failure that cancels out in the aggregate. JEL Codes:

Title: "Last-Place Aversion": Evidence and Redistributive Implications 
Abstract:
 We present evidence from laboratory experiments showing that individuals
 are "last-place averse." Participants choose gambles with the potential to
 move them out of last place that they reject when randomly placed in other
 parts of the distribution. In modified dictator games, participants
 randomly placed in second-to-last place are the most likely to give money
 to the person one rank above them instead of the person one rank below.
 Last-place aversion suggests that low-income individuals might oppose
 redistribution because it could differentially help the group just beneath
 them. Using survey data, we show that individuals making just above the
 minimum wage are the most likely to oppose its increase. Similarly, in the
 General Social Survey, those above poverty but below median income support
 redistribution significantly less than their background characteristics
 would predict. JEL Codes: H23, D31, C91.  Copyright 2014, Oxford University Press.

Title: International Prices and Endogenous Quality
Abstract: The unit values of internationally traded goods are heavily influenced by quality. We model this in an extended monopolistic competition framework where, in addition to choosing price, firms simultaneously choose quality subject to nonhomothetic demand. We estimate quality and quality-adjusted price indexes for 185 countries over 1984–2011. Our estimates are less sensitive to assumptions about the extensive margin of firms than are purely “demand-side” estimates. We find that quality-adjusted prices vary much less across countries than do unit values and, surprisingly, the quality-adjusted terms of trade are negatively related to countries’ level of income.

Title: Currency Unions, Product Introductions, and the Real Exchange Rate 
Abstract: We use a novel data set of online prices of identical goods sold by four large global retailers in dozens of countries to study good-level real exchange rates and their aggregated behavior. First, in contrast to the prior literature, we demonstrate that the law of one price holds very well within currency unions for tens of thousands of goods sold by each of the retailers, implying good-level real exchange rates often equal to 1. Prices of these same goods exhibit large deviations from the law of one price outside of currency unions, even when the nominal exchange rate is pegged. This clarifies that the common currency per se, and not simply the lack of nominal volatility, is important in reducing cross-country price dispersion. Second, we derive a new decomposition that shows that good-level real exchange rates in our data predominantly reflect differences in prices at the time products are first introduced, as opposed to the component emerging from heterogeneous passthrough or from nominal rigidities during the life of the good. Further, these international relative prices measured at the time of introduction move together with the nominal exchange rate. This stands in sharp contrast to pricing behavior in models where all price rigidity for any given good is due simply to costly price adjustment for that good.

Title: Agricultural Decisions after Relaxing Credit and Risk Constraints 
Abstract: The investment decisions of small-scale farmers in developing countries are conditioned by their financial environment. Binding credit market constraints and incomplete insurance can limit investment in activities with high expected profits. We conducted several experiments in northern Ghana in which farmers were randomly assigned to receive cash grants, grants of or opportunities to purchase rainfall index insurance, or a combination of the two. Demand for index insurance is strong, and insurance leads to significantly larger agricultural investment and riskier production choices in agriculture. The binding constraint to farmer investment is uninsured risk: when provided with insurance against the primary catastrophic risk they face, farmers are able to find resources to increase expenditure on their farms. Demand for insurance in subsequent years is strongly increasing with the farmer’s own receipt of insurance payouts, with the receipt of payouts by others in the farmer’s social network and with recent poor rain in the village. Both investment patterns and the demand for index insurance are consistent with the presence of important basis risk associated with the index insurance, imperfect trust that promised payouts will be delivered and overweighting recent events.

Title: Public Health Insurance, Labor Supply, and Employment Lock 
Abstract: We study the effect of public health insurance on labor supply by exploiting a large public health insurance disenrollment. In 2005, approximately 170,000 Tennessee residents abruptly lost Medicaid coverage. Using both across- and within-state variation in exposure to the disenrollment, we estimate large increases in labor supply, primarily along the extensive margin. The increased employment is concentrated among individuals working at least 20 hours a week and receiving private, employer-provided health insurance. We explore the dynamic effects of the disenrollment and find an immediate increase in job search behavior and a steady rise in both employment and health insurance coverage following the disenrollment. Our results are consistent with a significant degree of “employment lock”—workers who are employed primarily to secure private health insurance coverage.

Title: Generating Skilled Self-Employment in Developing Countries: Experimental Evidence from Uganda 
Abstract: We study a government program in Uganda designed to help the poor and unemployed become self-employed artisans, increase incomes, and thus promote social stability. Young adults in Uganda’s conflict-affected north were invited to form groups and submit grant proposals for vocational training and business start-up. Funding was randomly assigned among screened and eligible groups. Treatment groups received unsupervised grants of $382 per member. Grant recipients invest some in skills training but most in tools and materials. After four years, half practice a skilled trade. Relative to the control group, the program increases business assets by 57%, work hours by 17%, and earnings by 38%. Many also formalize their enterprises and hire labor. We see no effect, however, on social cohesion, antisocial behavior, or protest. Effects are similar by gender but are qualitatively different for women because they begin poorer (meaning the impact is larger relative to their starting point) and because women’s work and earnings stagnate without the program but take off with it. The patterns we observe are consistent with credit constraints.

Title: International Trade and Institutional Change: Medieval Venice’s Response to Globalization 
Abstract: International trade can have profound effects on domestic institutions. We examine this proposition in the context of medieval Venice circa 800–1600. Early on, the growth of long-distance trade enriched a broad group of merchants who used their newfound economic muscle to push for constraints on the executive, that is, for the end of a de facto hereditary Doge in 1032 and the establishment of a parliament in 1172. The merchants also pushed for remarkably modern innovations in contracting institutions that facilitated long-distance trade, for example, the colleganza. However, starting in 1297, a small group of particularly wealthy merchants blocked political and economic      competition: they made parliamentary participation hereditary and erected barriers to participation in the most lucrative aspects of long-distance trade. Over the next two centuries this led to a fundamental societal shift away from political openness, economic competition, and social mobility and toward political closure, extreme inequality, and social stratification. We document this oligarchization using a unique database on the names of 8,178 parliamentarians and their families’ use of the colleganza in the periods immediately before and after 1297. We then link these families to 6,959 marriages during 1400–1599 to document the use of marriage alliances to monopolize the galley trade. Monopolization led to the rise of extreme inequality, with those who were powerful before 1297 emerging as the undisputed winners.

Title: Medieval Universities, Legal Institutions, and the Commercial Revolution 
Abstract: We present new data documenting medieval Europe’s Commercial Revolution using information on the establishment of markets in Germany. We use these data to test whether medieval universities played a causal role in expanding economic activity, examining the foundation of Germany’s first universities after 1386 following the papal schism. We find that the trend rate of market establishment breaks upward in 1386 and this break is greatest where the distance to a university shrank most. There is no differential pre-1386 trend associated with the reduction in distance to a university, and there is no break in trend in 1386 where university proximity did not change. These results are robust to estimating a variety of specifications that address concerns about the endogeneity of university location. Universities provided training in newly rediscovered Roman and canon law; students with legal training served in positions that reduced the uncertainty of trade in the Middle Ages. We argue that training in the law, and the consequent development of legal and administrative institutions, was an important channel linking universities and greater economic activity in medieval Germany.

Title: Inconsistent Regulators: Evidence from Banking 
Abstract: We find that regulators can implement identical rules inconsistently due to differences in their institutional design and incentives, and this behavior may adversely impact the effectiveness with which regulation is implemented. We study supervisory decisions of U.S. banking regulators and exploit a legally determined rotation policy that assigns federal and state supervisors to the same bank at exogenously set time intervals. Comparing federal and state regulator supervisory ratings within the same bank, we find that federal regulators are systematically tougher, downgrading supervisory ratings almost twice as frequently as do state supervisors. State regulators counteract these downgrades to some degree by upgrading more frequently. Under federal regulators, banks report worse asset quality, higher regulatory capital ratios, and lower return on assets. Leniency of state regulators relative to their federal counterparts is related to costly outcomes, such as higher failure rates and lower repayment rates of government assistance funds. The discrepancy in regulator behavior is related to different weights given by regulators to local economic conditions and, to some extent, differences in regulatory resources. We find no support for regulator self-interest, which includes “revolving doors” as a reason for leniency of state regulators.

Title: The Agricultural Productivity Gap
Abstract: According to national accounts data, value added per worker is much higher in the nonagricultural sector than in agriculture in the typical country, particularly in developing countries. Taken at face value, this “agricultural productivity gap” suggests that labor is greatly misallocated across sectors. In this article, we draw on new micro evidence to ask to what extent the gap is still present when better measures of sector labor inputs and value added are taken into consideration. We find that even after considering sector differences in hours worked and human capital per worker, as well as alternative measures of sector output constructed from household survey data, a puzzlingly large gap remains.

Title: Regional Favoritism
Abstract: We complement the literature on distributive politics by taking a systematic look at regional favoritism in a large and diverse sample of countries and by employing a broad measure that captures the aggregate distributive effect of many different policies. In particular, we use satellite data on nighttime light intensity and information about the birthplaces of the countries’ political leaders. In our panel of 38,427 subnational regions from 126 countries with yearly observations from 1992 to 2009, we find that subnational regions have more intense nighttime light when being the birth region of the current political leader. We argue that this finding provides evidence for regional favoritism. We explore the dynamics and the geographical extent of regional favoritism and show that regional favoritism is most prevalent in countries with weak political institutions and poorly educated citizens. Furthermore, foreign aid inflows and oil rents tend to fuel regional favoritism in weakly institutionalized countries, but not elsewhere. JEL Codes: D72, R11.

Title: The Life Cycle of Plants in India and Mexico 
Abstract: In the United States, the average 40-year-old plant employs more than seven times as many workers as the typical plant 5 years or younger. In contrast, surviving plants in India and Mexico exhibit much slower growth, roughly doubling in size over the same age range. The divergence in plant dynamics suggests lower investments by Indian and Mexican plants in process efficiency, quality, and in accessing markets at home and abroad. In simple general equilibrium models, we find that the difference in life cycle dynamics could lower aggregate manufacturing productivity on the order of 25 percent in India and Mexico relative to the United States.

Title: Trade and the Topography of the Spatial Economy 
Abstract: We develop a general equilibrium framework to determine the spatial distribution of economic activity on any surface with (nearly) any geography. Combining the gravity structure of trade with labor mobility, we provide conditions for the existence, uniqueness, and stability of a spatial economic equilibrium and derive a simple set of equations that govern the relationship between economic activity and the geography of the surface. We then use the framework to estimate the topography of trade costs, productivities and amenities in the United States. We find that geographic location accounts for at least twenty percent of the spatial variation in U.S. income. Finally, we calculate that the construction of the interstate highway system increased welfare by 1.1 to 1.4 percent, which is substantially larger than its cost. JEL Codes: R12, F10, R13, R40.

Title: Active vs. Passive Decisions and Crowd-Out in Retirement Savings Accounts: Evidence from Denmark
Abstract: Using 41 million observations on savings for the population of Denmark, we show that the effects of retirement savings policies on wealth accumulation depend on whether they change savings rates by active or passive choice. Subsidies for retirement accounts, which rely on individuals to take an action to raise savings, primarily induce individuals to shift assets from taxable accounts to retirement accounts. We estimate that each $1 of government expenditure on subsidies increases total saving by only 1 cent. In contrast, policies that raise retirement contributions if individuals take no action—such as automatic employer contributions to retirement accounts—increase wealth accumulation substantially. We estimate that approximately 15% of individuals are “active savers” who respond to tax subsidies primarily by shifting assets across accounts; 85% of individuals are “passive savers” who are unresponsive to subsidies but are instead heavily influenced by automatic contributions made on their behalf. Active savers tend to be wealthier and more financially sophisticated. We conclude that automatic contributions are more effective at increasing savings rates than subsidies for three reasons: (i) subsidies induce relatively few individuals to respond, (ii) they generate substantial crowd-out conditional on response, and (iii) they do not increase the savings of passive individuals, who are least prepared for retirement.

Title: Finance and the Preservation of Wealth 
Abstract: We introduce the model of asset management developed in Gennaioli, Shleifer, and Vishny (“Money Doctors,” Journal of Finance, forthcoming 2015) into a Solow-style neoclassical growth model with diminishing returns to capital. Savers rely on trusted intermediaries to manage their wealth (claims on capital stock), who can charge fees above costs to trusting investors. In this model, the ratio of financial income to GDP increases with the ratio of aggregate wealth to GDP. Both rise along the convergence path to steady state growth. We examine several further implications of the model for management fees, unit costs of finance, and the consequences of shocks to trust and to the capital stock. JEL Codes: D91, E21, E44, G11.

Title: Capital is Back: Wealth-Income Ratios in Rich Countries 1700–2010 
Abstract: How do aggregate wealth-to-income ratios evolve in the long run and why? We address this question using 1970–2010 national balance sheets recently compiled in the top eight developed economies. For the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, and France, we are able to extend our analysis as far back as 1700. We find in every country a gradual rise` of wealth-income ratios in recent decades, from about 200–300% in 1970 to 400–600% in 2010. In effect, today’s ratios appear to be returning to the high values observed in Europe in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries (600–700%). This can be explained by a long-run asset price recovery (itself driven by changes in capital policies since the world wars) and by the slowdown of productivity and population growth, in line with the β=s/g Harrod-Domar-Solow formula. That is, for a given net saving rate s = 10%, the long-run wealth-income ratio β is about 300% if g = 3% and 600% if g = 1.5%. Our results have implications for capital taxation and regulation and shed new light on the changing nature of wealth, the shape of the production function, and the rise of capital shares.

Title: Learning Through Noticing: Theory and Evidence from a Field Experiment 
Abstract: We consider a model of technological learning under which people “learn through noticing”: they choose which input dimensions to attend to and subsequently learn about from available data. Using this model, we show how people with a great deal of experience may persistently be off the production frontier because they fail to notice important features of the data they possess. We also develop predictions on when these learning failures are likely to occur, as well as on the types of interventions that can help people learn. We test the model’s predictions in a field experiment with seaweed farmers. The survey data reveal that these farmers do not attend to pod size, a particular input dimension. Experimental trials suggest that farmers are particularly far from optimizing this dimension. Furthermore, consistent with the model, we find that simply having access to the experimental data does not induce learning. Instead, behavioral changes occur only after the farmers are presented with summaries that highlight previously unattended-to relationships in the data. JEL    Codes: D03, D83, O13, O14, O30, Q16.

Title: Injecting Charter School Best Practices into Traditional Public Schools: Evidence from Field Experiments 
Abstract: This study examines the impact on student achievement of implementing a bundle of best practices from high-performing charter schools into low-performing, traditional public schools in Houston, Texas, using a school-level randomized field experiment and quasi-experimental comparisons. The five practices in the bundle are increased instructional time, more effective teachers and administrators, high-dosage tutoring, data-driven instruction, and a culture of high expectations. The findings show that injecting best practices from charter schools into traditional Houston public schools significantly increases student math achievement in treated elementary and secondary schools—by 0.15 to 0.18 standard deviations a year—and has little effect on reading achievement. Similar bundles of practices are found to significantly raise math achievement in analyses for public schools in a field experiment in Denver and program in Chicago. JEL Codes: I21, I24, I28, J24.

Title: Gender, Competitiveness, and Career Choices
Abstract: Gender differences in competitiveness have been hypothesized as a potential explanation for gender differences in education and labor market outcomes. We examine the predictive power of a standard laboratory experimental measure of competitiveness for the later important choice of academic track of secondary school students in the Netherlands. Although boys and girls display similar levels of academic ability, boys choose substantially more prestigious academic tracks, where more prestigious tracks are more math- and science-intensive. Our experimental measure shows that boys are also substantially more competitive than girls. We find that competitiveness is strongly positively correlated with choosing more prestigious academic tracks even conditional on academic ability. Most important, we find that the gender difference in competitiveness accounts for a substantial portion (about 20%) of the gender difference in track choice. JEL Codes: C9, I20, J24, J16.

Title: Axiomatization and Measurement of Quasi-Hyperbolic Discounting
Abstract: This article provides an axiomatic characterization of quasi-hyperbolic discounting and a more general class of semi-hyperbolic preferences. We impose consistency restrictions directly on the intertemporal trade-offs by relying on what we call “annuity compensations.” Our axiomatization leads naturally to an experimental design that disentangles discounting from the elasticity of intertemporal substitution. In a pilot experiment we use the partial identification approach to estimate bounds for the distributions of discount factors in the subject pool. Consistent with previous studies, we find evidence for both present and future bias. JEL Codes: C10, C99, D03, D90.

Title: International Trade Puzzles: A Solution Linking Production and Preferences 
Abstract: International trade literature tends to focus heavily on the production side of general equilibrium, leaving us with a number of empirical puzzles. There is, for example, considerably less world trade than predicted by Heckscher-Ohlin-Vanek (HOV) models. Trade among rich countries is higher and trade between rich and poor countries lower than suggested by HOV and other supply-driven theories, and trade-to-GDP ratios are higher in rich countries. Our approach focuses on the relationship between characteristics of goods and services in production and characteristics of preferences. In particular, we find a strong and significant positive correlation of more than 45% between a good’s skilled-labor intensity and its income elasticity, even when accounting for trade costs and cross-country price differences. Exploring the implications of this correlation for empirical trade puzzles, we find that it can reduce HOV’s overprediction of the variance of the net factor content of trade relative to that in the data by about 60%. Since rich countries are relatively skilled-labor abundant, they are relatively specialized in consuming the same goods and services that they are specialized in producing, and so trade more with one another than with poor countries. We also find a positive sector-level correlation between income elasticity and a sector’s tradability, which helps explain the higher trade-to-GDP ratios in high-income relative to low-income countries.

Title: Where is the land of Opportunity? The Geography of Intergenerational Mobility in the United States 
Abstract: We use administrative records on the incomes of more than 40 million children and their parents to describe three features of intergenerational mobility in the United States. First, we characterize the joint distribution of parent and child income at the national level. The conditional expectation of child income given parent income is linear in percentile ranks. On average, a 10 percentile increase in parent income is associated with a 3.4 percentile increase in a child’s income. Second, intergenerational mobility varies substantially across areas within the United States. For example, the probability that a child reaches the top quintile of the national income distribution starting from a family in the bottom quintile is 4.4% in Charlotte but 12.9% in San Jose. Third, we explore the factors correlated with upward mobility. High mobility areas have (i) less residential segregation, (ii) less income inequality, (iii) better primary schools, (iv) greater social capital, and (v) greater family stability. Although our descriptive analysis does not identify the causal mechanisms that determine upward mobility, the publicly available statistics on intergenerational mobility developed here can facilitate research on such mechanisms.

Title: Evidence on Self-Stereotyping and the Contribution of Ideas 
Abstract: We use a lab experiment to explore the factors that predict an individual’s decision to contribute her idea to a group. We find that contribution decisions depend on the interaction of gender and the gender stereotype associated with the decision-making domain: conditional on measured ability, individuals are less willing to contribute ideas in areas that are stereotypically outside of their gender’s domain. Importantly, these decisions are largely driven by self-assessments, rather than fear of discrimination. Individuals are less confident in gender-incongruent areas and are thus less willing to contribute their ideas. Because even very knowledgeable group members undercontribute in gender-incongruent categories, group performance suffers and, ex post, groups have difficulty recognizing who their most talented members are. Our results show that even in an environment where other group members show no bias, women in male-typed areas and men in female-typed areas may be less influential. An intervention that provides feedback about a woman’s (man’s) strength in a male-typed (female-typed) area does not significantly increase the probability that she contributes her ideas to the group. A back-of-the-envelope calculation reveals that a “lean in”–style policy that increases contribution by women would significantly improve group performance in male-typed domains.

Title: A Sparsity-Based Model of Bounded Rationality 
Abstract: This article defines and analyzes a “sparse max” operator, which is a less than fully attentive and rational version of the traditional max operator. The agent builds (as economists do) a simplified model of the world which is sparse, considering only the variables of first-order importance. His stylized model and his resulting choices both derive from constrained optimization. Still, the sparse max remains tractable to compute. Moreover, the induced outcomes reflect basic psychological forces governing limited attention. The sparse max yields a behavioral version of basic chapters of the microeconomics textbook: consumer demand and competitive equilibrium. I obtain a behavioral version of Marshallian and Hicksian demand, Arrow-Debreu competitive equilibrium, the Slutsky matrix, the Edgeworth box, Roy’s identity, and so on. The Slutsky matrix is no longer     symmetric: nonsalient prices are associated with anomalously small demand elasticities. Because the consumer exhibits nominal illusion, in the Edgeworth box, the offer curve is a two-dimensional surface rather than a one-dimensional curve. As a result, different aggregate price levels correspond to materially distinct competitive equilibria, in a similar spirit to a Phillips curve. The Arrow-Debreu welfare theorems typically do not hold. This framework provides a way to assess which parts of basic microeconomics are robust, and which are not, to the assumption of perfect maximization. JEL     Codes: D01, D03, D11, D51.

Title: Family Welfare Cultures
Abstract: We investigate the existence and importance of family welfare cultures, where the receipt of a welfare program by one generation causes increased participation in the next generation. Our context is Norway’s disability insurance (DI) system. To overcome the challenge of correlated unobservables across generations, we take advantage of random assignment of judges to DI applicants whose cases are initially denied. Some appeal judges are systematically more lenient, which leads to random variation in the probability a parent will be allowed DI. Using this exogenous variation, we find strong evidence for a causal link across generations: when a parent is allowed DI at the appeal stage, their adult child’s participation over the next five years increases by 6 percentage points. This effect grows over time, rising to 12 percentage points after 10 years. Although these findings are specific to our setting, they highlight that welfare reforms can have long-lasting effects on program participation, since any original effect on the current generation could be reinforced by changing the participation behavior of their children as well. The detailed nature of our data allows us to compare the intergenerational transmission with spillover effects in other networks and to explore mechanisms. JEL Codes: I38, J62, H53.

Title: A Welfare Criterion For Models With Distorted Beliefs 
Abstract: This article proposes a welfare criterion for economies in which agents have heterogeneously distorted beliefs. Instead of taking a stand on whose belief is correct, our criterion asserts that an allocation is belief-neutral efficient (inefficient) if it is efficient (inefficient) under any convex combination of agents’ beliefs. Although this criterion gives an incomplete ranking of social allocations, it can identify positive- and negative-sum speculation driven by conflicting beliefs in a broad range of economic environments.

Title: Trade Adjustment: Worker-Level Evidence 
Abstract: We analyze the effect of exposure to international trade on earnings and employment of U.S. workers from 1992 through 2007 by exploiting industry shocks to import competition stemming from China’s spectacular rise as a manufacturing exporter paired with longitudinal data on individual earnings by employer spanning close to two decades. Individuals who in 1991 worked in manufacturing industries that experienced high subsequent import growth garner lower cumulative earnings, face elevated risk of obtaining public disability benefits, and spend less time working for their initial employers, less time in their initial two-digit manufacturing industries, and more time working elsewhere in manufacturing and outside of manufacturing. Earnings losses are larger for individuals with low initial wages, low initial tenure, and low attachment to the labor force. Low-wage workers churn primarily among manufacturing sectors, where they are repeatedly exposed to subsequent trade shocks. High-wage workers are better able to move across employers with minimal earnings losses and are more likely to move out of manufacturing conditional on separation. These findings reveal that import shocks impose substantial labor adjustment costs that are highly unevenly distributed across workers according to their skill levels and conditions of employment in the pre-shock period.

Title: Extensive Imitation is Irrational and Harmful
Abstract: Rationality leads people to imitate those with similar tastes but different information. But people who imitate common sources develop correlated beliefs, and rationality demands that later social learners take this correlation into account. This implies severe limits to rational imitation. We show that (i) in most natural observation structures besides the canonical single-file case, full rationality dictates that people must “anti-imitate” some of those they observe; and (ii) in every observation structure full rationality dictates that people imitate, on net, at most one person and are imitated by, on net, at most one person, over any set of interconnected players. We also show that in a very broad class of settings, any learning rule in which people regularly do imitate more than one person without anti-imitating others will lead to a positive probability of people converging to confident and wrong long-run beliefs.

Title: A body of literature suggests that ethnic heterogeneity limits economic growth. 
Abstract: This article provides microeconometric evidence on the direct effect of ethnic divisions on productivity. In team production at a plant in Kenya, an upstream worker supplies and distributes flowers to two downstream workers, who assemble them into bunches. The plant uses an essentially random rotation process to assign workers to positions, leading to three types of teams: (i) ethnically homogeneous teams, and teams in which (ii) one or (iii) both downstream workers belong to a tribe in rivalry with the upstream worker’s tribe. I find strong evidence that upstream workers undersupply non-coethnic downstream workers (vertical discrimination) and shift flowers from non-coethnic to coethnic downstream workers (horizontal discrimination), at the cost of lower own pay and total output. A period of ethnic conflict following Kenya’s 2007 election led to a sharp increase in discrimination. In response, the plant began paying the two downstream workers for their combined output (team pay). This led to a modest output reduction in (i) and (iii) teams—as predicted by standard incentive models—but an increase in output in (ii) teams, and overall. Workers’ behavior before conflict, during conflict, and under team pay is predicted by a model of taste-based discrimination. My findings suggest that interethnic rivalries lower allocative efficiency in the private sector, that the economic costs of ethnic diversity vary with the political environment, and that in high-cost environments firms are forced to adopt “second best” policies to limit discrimination distortions.

Title: Propaganda and Conflict: Evidence from the Rwandan Genocide 
Abstract: This article investigates the role of mass media in times of conflict and state-sponsored mass violence against civilians. We use a unique village-level data set from the Rwandan genocide to estimate the impact of a popular radio station that encouraged violence against the Tutsi minority population. The results show that the broadcasts had a significant effect on participation in killings by both militia groups and ordinary civilians. An estimated 51,000 perpetrators, or approximately 10% of the overall violence, can be attributed to the station. The broadcasts increased militia violence not only directly by influencing behavior in villages with radio reception but also indirectly by increasing participation in neighboring villages. In fact, spillovers are estimated to have caused more militia violence than the direct effects. Thus, the article provides evidence that mass media can affect participation in violence directly due to exposure and indirectly due to social interactions. JEL Codes: D7, N4.

Title: Tax me if you can! Optimal Nonlinear Income Tax Between Competing Governments 
Abstract: We investigate how potential tax-driven migrations modify the Mirrlees income tax schedule when two countries play Nash. The social objective is the maximin and preferences are quasi-linear in consumption. Individuals differ both in skills and migration costs, which are continuously distributed. We derive the optimal marginal income tax rates at the equilibrium, extending the Diamond-Saez formula. We show that the level and the slope of the semi-elasticity of migration (on which we lack empirical evidence) are crucial to derive the shape of optimal marginal income tax.
