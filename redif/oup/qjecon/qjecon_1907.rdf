Title: Mortgage Taxation in Wisconsin
Abstract: The taxation of mortgages condemned by most economists, 1–3; but retained on the statute books of most States, 3–4; the experience of Wisconsin throws light upon this conflict of authority and practise, 4–12; and indicates that taxation of mortgages under the general property tax will prove innocuous in some places, 12–15; but harmful in others, 16; the conditions under which shifting will probably occur, 17–20; leading to the conclusion that mortgage taxation should be limited in rate, if imposed at all, 21; and is generally inexpedient not because the tax is necessarily shifted, 22, 23; but because it is part of a vicious system of personal taxation, 25–27.

Title: The Rent Concept, Narrowed and Broadened
Abstract: Manufacture and agriculture may be reduced to a common denominator; manufacture is merely a more highly intensive form of utilizing the forces and products of nature, while land plays the same role in each form of industry, 48–50.—Rent depends upon absolute and relative position as to a market, and is sharply differentiated from interest, 51–53.—"Land" rent is, however, only one kind of rent; the various forms of economic privilege also give rise to rents, 54–61.
