Title: The Street Railways of Philadelphia
Abstract: The original franchises, granted fifty years ago, and all subsequent grants, were subject to the ordinance of 1857, reserving to the city the right to purchase at original cost, and putting on the companies certain obligations, 233–236.—Rights of the public were also protected by a dividend tax (236–238) and by the ordinances of 1893–94 stipulating that the companies shall remove overhead trolley wires whenever required to do so by ordinance, 238–241.—An ordinance of 1907 frees the companies from all old restraints and obligations, (241–246).—The original franchises have acquired great value, 246–248.—Capitalization was much increased during the period of consolidation and stock-watering, 248–257.—Market values suffered during the recent depression (257–259), but capitalists have too much at stake to permit the over-capitalized system to disintegrate, 259–260.

Abstract: The panic of 1907 witnessed a premium upon money in New York lasting two months and rising as high as 4 per cent., 290–293.—The extent of hoarding on the part of the public is roughly indicated by the amount of money that disappeared from the banks, 293; and by the number of safe deposit boxes rented in New York and other cities, 294–296.—The banks of the South and West aggravated the situation by accumulating abnormal reserves, 296–299.

Abstract: Representative constructive workers in pure economics have conceived of an inductive statistical complement without whose development the a priori instrument must lack concrete effectiveness, 1.— The most important statistical processes that must be employed in the elaboration of the inductive science are described, 8.—Steps which have already been taken in the attempt to bring together pure economics and the theory of statistics in the treatment of concrete material are illustrated, 23.—From a survey of what has been accomplished it is inferred that fecund scientific ideas as well as abiding practical results are to be gained from the development of the Statistical Complement of Pure Economics, 33.
