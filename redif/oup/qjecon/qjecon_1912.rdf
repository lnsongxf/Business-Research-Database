Mill's conception of the natural kind, 675. — Fulness of meaning follows from the definition, 676. — Recognizability apart from definition, 677. — Counting is the typical method of determining the quantity of units of the first order, 679. — (2) Products are usually defined by way of purpose and function, 680. — Difficulties of definition, 681. — Careful attention to classification required, 681. — (3) A measure is arbitrary and is useful chiefly because standard, 682. — Individuality is ignored, 683. — Desirability of counting by size-classes, 684. — Measurement is a supplement to, not properly a substitute for, counting, 684. — (4) The importance of the pecuniary unit is due to its being the most universal of common denominators, 690. — This involves abstractness, 691. — Lack of uniformity of accounting practice a large factor in uncertainty of meaning, 692. — Economic and pecuniary statistics are not identical, 696. — The purpose of index numbers, 696. — An important way to better statistical material is to make use of the higher orders of statistical unit, so far as possible, supporting in this way all data of lower order, 697. — The development of physical and operating statistics in support of financial reports of corporations, 698. — Physical valuation in the interest of the investor, 698. — Cost-keeping a similar statistical development, 700. — Pecuniary statistics especially need supporting data of higher order, 702.
