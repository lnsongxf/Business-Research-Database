Title: Economic Psychology and the Value Problem
Abstract: The basic difficulty in economic theory is the philosophical problem of the meaning of explanation in connection with human behavior. I. Motive or desire in human conduct is the analogue of force in mechanics, 375. II. Is force real or merely symbolic, leaving movement (behavior in the case of human beings) the only fact open to description or study? 379. — This question is merely formal in physics, for we know forces by their effects alone, and hence unambiguously if at all; but in the realm of conduct, we know motives in ourselves directly and in others by communication, in addition to inferring them from observed behavior, and the two sources of information disagree considerably. III–IV. The intellectually embarrassing but unescapable fact of purposiveness, in thought as well as conduct, 386. — V. The place of motives and their treatment in economics, which has to be critical as well as descriptive and logical, — a branch of esthetics and ethics as well as of science, 400. — VI. The objective of economic activity and the point of view of social criticism of the economic order, 406.

Title: Non-Competing Groups
Abstract: Values reporting themselves as relative prices, costs, to bear on values, must be relative costs, and must be reduced to money terms, 52. — Efforts and waitings, therefore, articulate with prices only when translated into money costs, 54. — The employer vs. employee point of view, 55. — The assumption that, in general, wages and interest are proportional with effort and waiting sacrifices, 55. — Cairnes's interpretation, with wages and interest conceived as derivative from product prices, and with labor as the antithesis of the remuneration of it, 55. — Employer vs. employee cost, 56. — Relation of effort and waitings costs to employer money costs, 56. — Mill, 56. — Taussig and Marshall, 57. — Ricardo, 59. — Ricardo and Cairnes, 59. — The constitution of the groups — by definition, 63. — The groupings not by vocations but by remunerations, 65. — In what sense can the intra-group relationships be competitive? 66. — Cairnes's and Taussig's reports of the groupings, 67. — Dates of group fixation vs. dates of group competition, 70. — The groupings further examined, 71. — Social stratification the point of emphasis, not competition or the lack of it, 73. — Inherited opportunity never more than part explanation of income groupings, or of ratios of income to sacrifice, 74. — Complete fluidity of labor also would leave the groupings no less inadequate, 76. — The three requisites for a tenable labor theory of values still unmet, 80.
