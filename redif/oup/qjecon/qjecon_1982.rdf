Title: Risk Aversion, Supply Response, and the Optimality of Random Prices: A Diagrammatic Analysis
Abstract: This paper analyzes the effect of commodity price stabilization on producers and consumers, both in the short run, and in the long run, when producers have adjusted their production decisions to take account of the change in the price distribution. We derive conditions under which (a) both producers and consumers may be better off; and (b) both producers and consumers may be worse off. Moreover, we show that the long-run effects may differ not only quantitatively but also qualitatively from the short-run effects. The anomalous results may occur even with reasonable assumptions concerning production functions and utility functions of producers and consumers.

Title: Rate-of-Return Regulation and Two-Part Tariffs
Abstract: In choosing a two-part tariff, a monopoly subject to rate-of-return regulation will rely more on demand elasticities and less on marginal costs than would a welfare-maximizing firm. The rate-of-return regulated firm also will reduce its access fee or its marginal usage fee more, depending on whether adding consumers or increasing output requires marginally the most capital. In the typical case these effects will favor declining-block rate structures, which helps to explain their widespread use by rate-of-return regulated firms.

Title: The Transmission of Disturbances under Alternative Exchange-Rate Regimes with Optimal Indexing
Abstract: The paper develops a general stochastic macroeconomic model that can be used to study the international transmission of disturbances under four alternative exchange-rate systems: uniform flexible exchange rates, uniform fixed exchange rates, and two versions of two-tier exchange rates. The analysis makes two general points. First, one cannot assume stability of structure when assessing the consequences of alternative exchange-rate regimes. For example, the slope of the aggregate supply curve and the rationally formed expectations in the asset markets can respond dramatically to the government's choice of exchange-rate regime. Second, exchange-rate regimes that provide full insulation from foreign disturbances may nevertheless be inferior to other regimes in terms of their ability to maximize social welfare.

Title: Educational Subsidy, Agricultural Development, and Fertility Change
Abstract: In this paper, the effects of continuing agricultural technical change on the allocation of resources by households between increments to family size and to schooling are examined within the context of a model of household decision-making in which education facilitates innovation. An empirical application of the model to data from India indicates, consistent with the theory, that in farm households more intensively exposed to the new technologies associated with the â€œgreen revolution,â€ fertility was significantly reduced, while the level of schooling investment was significantly increased. In contrast, and also consistent with the model, proximity of schools, in the absence of technical change, had only marginal effects on schooling and little impact on family size.

Title: Underemployment Equilibrium with Rational Expectations
Abstract: In this paper I use some recent work in the microeconomics of imperfect information to construct a macro model. The microeconomic theory suggests that atomistically competitive firms face kinked demand curves. In this model there is a range of aggregate equilibria consistent with correct information. I then show that individual firms can face a free-rider problem in trying to move from one equilibrium to another by changing the price level. Monetary policy is not subject to this problem, even if the policy is fully anticipated.

Title: A Model of Imperfect Competition with Keynesian Features
Abstract: The recent literature on â€œthe reappraisal of Keynesâ€ has viewed Keynesian equilibria as arising when prices are fixed and effective demands and supplies are equilibrated through the adjustment of quantities. One problem with this approach is that it lacks a theory of price determinationâ€in particular, of why prices are fixed. In the present paper, we show that a number of Keynesian features arise in a model in which prices are fully flexible, but where agents have some monopoly power. One advantage of this approach is that it provides a theory of the determination of both prices and quantities.

Title: Charitable Giving and â€œExcessiveâ€ Fundraising
Abstract: Recently, some charities have been attacked for spending an â€œexcessiveâ€ portion of their resources on fundraising. This paper shows how competition for donations can push fundraising shares to high levels even when donors dislike charities that spend a large portion of receipts on fundraising. It also considers a case in which donors take account of the productivity of fundraising in generating gifts from others. In the light of the models developed in the paper, a variety of regulatory strategies are assessed from the dissemination of information to the establishment of a federated fund drive.

Title: Layoff Unemployment, Risk Shifting, and Productivity
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the theory of implicit labor contracts. The implications of introducing hours worked or effort as an argument both in workers' utility functions (in addition to the wage rate) and in firms' production functions (in addition to the number of workers) are considered. It is shown that layoffs can occur at equilibrium in the absence of unemployment compensation and value of leisure, but only because of the inclusion of this additional variable.

Title: The Interaction of Taxes and Inflation in a Macroeconomic Model
Abstract: This paper presents a closed economy macroeconomic model in which the nominal income of some assets is taxed, whereas that of others is not. The short-run and long-run implications of a change in expected inflation are examined. An increase in the expected rate of inflation shifts the composition of aggregate demand, since asset holders shift their portfolios from the taxed asset (corporate capital) to the untaxed asset (consumer durables). In the long run, this shift implies a stock adjustment decline in capital with a consequent decrease in the rate of growth of productivity over the transition period.

Title: Aggregate Spending and the Terms of Trade: Is There a Laursen-Metzler Effect?
Abstract: This paper investigates the spending and current-account effects of terms-of-trade shifts in a model where households maximize utility over an infinite planning period. In the framework developed here, an economy specialized in production must experience a fall in aggregate spending and a current surplus as a result of an unanticipated, permanent worsening in its terms of trade. The paper's model thus provides a setting in which the current-account deficit predicted by Laursen and Metzier, Harberger, and others fails to materialize.

Title: A General Equilibrium Model of Congressional Voting
Abstract: In this paper we specify a model in which Congressmen, constituents, and campaign contributors simultaneously decide on behavior. Constituents and contributors desire to influence the voting behavior of Congressmen; Congressmen, on the other hand, want to be elected and vote accordingly. We empirically test this model using roll call voting on eight bills dealing with economic regulation and find support for the model. Our results indicate that part of the voting behavior of Congressmen may be explained by noneconomic factors. We also find that unions and businesses as campaign contributors are sometimes influential; unions are more often influential than is business. Ideological factors are also important in explaining voting.

Title: Tariffs, Quotas, and Market Structure
Abstract: This paper examines the effects of tariffs and quotas on the pricing pattern of producers in the case of duopoly by a domestic monopolist and a foreign monopolist. It is pointed out that tariffs and quotas may induce completely different pricing patterns in the two producers. Under a quota, it is always profitable for the home producer to be a price leader and for the foreign producer to be a follower, whereas under a tariff either producer may become a leader. It is also proved that, whatever leader-follower relation is chosen under a tariff, a quota always bring about a higher domestic price than the tariff as long as both permit the same amount of imports.

Title: Discrimination, Nepotism, and Long-Run Wage Differentials
Abstract: The wage discrimination model developed by Becker has been criticized for predicting that competitive forces will lead to the disappearance of racial discrimination in the long run. We have reformulated the model in terms of nepotism toward white workers rather than discrimination against black workers. In this new framework, both nepotistic and taste-neutral firms are expected to survive the competitive struggle in the long run. Therefore, the new framework is consistent with long-run as well as short-run racial wage differentials.

Title: Categorizing Risks in the Insurance Industry
Abstract: This paper analyzes the welfare implications of imperfectly categorizing risks in the insurance industry under conditions of asymmetric information. Firms, initially unable to distinguish the risk type of individuals, are provided with imperfect information concerning risk membership. The paper then compares various Wilson-type equilibria to determine the welfare implications of firms imperfectly categorizing risks. It is shown that only in the case where the initial equilibrium is of the Nash no-subsidy type is there a Pareto-type improvement in welfare.

Title: Social Aggregation Rules and Continuity
Abstract: It is shown that any continuous social aggregation rule for smooth preferences cannot simultaneously satisfy the properties of anonymity and respect of unanimity. This is true even when all individual preferences are linear. The relationship between the conditions on the social rule studied here and those of Arrow's paradox is discussed. The first result requires that the normalized gradient of the social choice rule be definable in the interior of the choice space, thus indicating a direction of increase of social preference. A second impossibility result extends the first to cases where the gradient of the social preference may vanish in the interior of the choice space.

Title: What are Corporate Pension Liabilities?
Abstract: Analyses of corporate pension plans often make unstated assumptions about an implicit labor contract. An example of the effect of such an assumption is that many mistakenly believe that if a worker's benefits are tied to final salary, he is protected against inflation until retirement. Also, the value of a worker's claims is often considered to be independent of the status of the firm's pension fund. These â€œimplicit contractâ€ assumptions are examined and questioned. The implications of analyzed pension liabilities in a manner consistent with the analysis of other corporate liabilities are explored.

Title: The Role of Knowledge in R&amp;D Efficiency
Abstract: Past research has recognized that both demand and capability influence the allocation of R&amp;D resources. Scholars have had an easier time getting a grip on demand than on capability. While it has been recognized that knowledge is an important part of capability, to date, formalization of knowledge and its role in R&amp;D activity has been unsatisfactory. This paper models the role of knowledge in R&amp;D. Various sources of such knowledge are considered. The model throws a different light on analyses that employ a â€œknowledge capital stock,â€ and also illuminates the dual private and public nature of technological knowledge.

Title: The Relative Impact of Inheritance and Other Factors on Economic Inequality
Abstract: An empirically grounded micro-simulation of saving, with bequests related negatively either in total to average children's income or separately to individual children's incomes, is constructed for a single generation in a steady growth economy. Behavioral parameters are set so that predicted bequests to the next generation are consistent with both the scale and assignment of inheritances (taken from a real-world source) for the simulation generation. The relative impact of inheritance and other factors on different aspects of economic inequality is assessed. While inheritance is a major cause of wealth inequality, its influence on annual income and lifetime resources is small, and in the latter case ambiguous. â€¦ Inheritance perpetuates and may intensify inequalities arising originally from other causes. In that sense, it is a secondary cause of inequality; but that is not, of course, to say that it is of secondary importance. The extent of its influence on distribution remains an open question, which cannot be decided merely by theoretical reasoning â€¦ but requires in addition something in the nature of a quantitative analysis of the relevant facts. -Wedgwood, 1929, pp. 60â€“61.

Title: Competitive Price Adjustment to Changes in the Money Supply
Abstract: In a competitive environment in which (ex ante) identical sellers set prices, the market price cannot always be based on updated information, since otherwise there will be no incentive to gather information about changes in demand. This result is applied to the case in which changes in the money supply are the only source of uncertainty. It is shown that, if the possible changes in the money supply are not large, the economy will exhibit a positive relationship between money and output but no involuntary unemployment. If the possible changes in the money supply are large, the economy will exhibit a positive relationship between money and employment, allowing for involuntary unemployment.

Title: Work and Welfare as Determinants of Female Poverty and Household Headship
Abstract: This paper formulates and estimates a model of the determinants of female household headship. Headship responds to variations in the levels of well-being a woman can expect if she marries or if she heads her own household. We measure the opportunity cost of female headship and the effects of welfare benefits and women's work in the market on female headship and poverty. We find that if welfare benefits were reduced, there would be small reductions in the proportion of women heading households for whites and nonwhites, but a substantial increase in poverty for nonwhites. We also find that wives' work in the market reduces poverty and female headship for nonwhites, and reduces poverty, but increases headship for whites.

Title: Labor Contracts as Partial Gift Exchange
Abstract: This paper explains involuntary unemployment in terms of the response of firms to workers' group behavior. Workers' effort depends upon the norms determining a fair day's work. In order to affect those norms, firms may pay more than the market-clearing wage. Industries that pay consistently more than the market-clearing wage are primary, and those that pay only the market-clearing wage are secondary. Thus, this paper also gives a theory for division of labor markets between primary and secondary.

Title: Union Contracts and Money Wage Changes in U. S. Manufacturing Industries
Abstract: This paper analyzes the relationship between wage changes negotiated in selected large collective bargaining agreements and industry-wide changes in average hourly earnings. Multiple regressions are used to examine the relationship in two-digit manufacturing industries for the period 1958II to 1978IL Negotiated wage changes are found to have a major impact on overall movements in hourly earnings. The estimated equations have potential applications for short-run wage forecasting and for policy analyses.

Title: Job Search and the Duration of Layoff Unemployment
Abstract: This paper derives an optimal job-searching strategy for workers on layoff, and an optimal recall policy for firms, when each side anticipates the other side's actions correctly. It shows that workers search for an alternative job only if the probability of recall falls below a critical level, and that firms may recall before the recovery of demand, depending on the costs of laying off and hiring workers, and the probability of losing workers on layoff. Through the use of optimal job searching and recall policies, the paper derives expressions for the duration of layoff unemployment and discusses briefly their comparative-static properties.

Title: Permanent versus Transitory Tax Effects and the Realization of Capital Gains
Abstract: Recent empirical work on captial gains implies that realizations are highly sensitive to marginal tax rates. Because they are based on cross-section data, however, these estimates cannot distinguish between permanent responses to tax rate changes and the timing of realizations to take advantage of the normal fluctuations in any individual's tax rates over time. The purpose of this paper is to distinguish transitory from permanent tax effects by analyzing panel data for taxpayers. Controlling for permanent and transitory income and other variables, the estimates suggest both transitory and permanent effects, although the permanent tax rate effect is not significant in all cases.

Title: Spatial Pricing, Spatial Rents, and Spatial Welfare
Abstract: This paper presents a model of spatial equilibrium that integrates elements of spatial pricing and ThÃ¼nen location models. Properties of equilibrium under mill, uniform, and discriminatory pricing regimes are explored. Three comparative propositions concerning firm, consumer, and landowner welfare that obtain under the alternative pricing schemes are presented. The welfare findings contrast with those found in the extant spatial pricing literature. In particular, the superiority of mill pricing from a consumer welfare perspective is questioned.

Title: The Effect of Federal Debt-Management Policy on Corporate Bond and Equity Yields
Abstract: In theory, Federal debt-management policy potentially plays an important role in determining Treasury and private security yields. However, empirical studies have been unable to detect any significant effects from Federal debt-management. In large part the insignificance of relative asset supply effects associated with Federal debt-management policy may result from the use of unrestricted reduced-form models of interest rate determination. Using a disaggregated structural model of the markets for corporate bonds, equities, and four distinct maturity classes of Treasury securities, Federal debt-management policy is found to affect Treasury and private security yields significantly. Furthermore, the yields on corporate bonds and equities are influenced disproportionately.

Title: The Existence of Marginal Cost Pricing Equilibria with Increasing Returns
Abstract: The competitive mechanism fails in economies with nonconvex technologies. Competitive equilibria do not exist in general, and Pareto optima are no longer equilibria. The search for alternative mechanisms in economies with increasing returns was developed and resulted in the principle of marginal cost pricing. Modern economic theory has returned to the foundations of marginal cost pricing theory in a general equilibrium framework. The existence of equilibria with marginal cost pricing in economies with increasing returns and a more general type of nonconvexities is analyzed in this paper. The case of differentiable economies where all production sets are limited by smooth surfaces is developed. The principles of the proof are also extended to the nondifferentiable case.

Title: Price Regulation Under Uncertainty in an Asymmetric Decision Environment
Abstract: A regulated firm that can make decisions both before and after uncertainty is resolved with respect to input use cannot be led to competitive solutions by regulatory price ceilings. Whether those ceilings are imposed before or after the resolution of uncertainty, they present incentives for undercapitalized production, contrary to usual AJ assertions. Under these conditions the Fair Return objective is neither a sufficient nor an unambiguous regulatory target.
