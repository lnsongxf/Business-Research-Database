Title: International Liquidity: A Welfare Analysis
Abstract: The paper addresses the effects of international liquidity conventions on the conduct and success of short-run income stabilization. Two interdependent and noncooperative nations attempt to minimize output variance subject to the international convention that adequate international reserve stocks be maintained. We demonstrate that the Nash outcome of nations which are bound by international reserve constraints is Pareto superior to the Nash outcome of unconstrained nations. With a formal model, we derive the set of Pareto-optimal liquidity conventions and explore the sensitivity of this set to the macroeconomic structural and stochastic characteristics of the nations and to the stabilization instruments that are employed.

Title: The Black Market for Dollars in Brazil
Abstract: The model of the black market for dollars focuses on the interaction of portfolio decisions relevant to the holding of asset stocks and the determinants of net flows of dollars associated with tourism and smuggling. A partial-equilibrium model of the black market shows that the level of the premium is determined by the official real exchange rate and the official, depreciation-adjusted interest differential, as well as seasonal factors associated with tourism. Expectations of future exchange rate changes, under rational expectations, are shown to affect the current level of the black market premium. The empirical evidence provides ample support for the role of the key determinants of the premium as well as for an important seasonal pattern. The magnitude of the seasonal variation is evidence of the imperfect substitutability between black dollars and cruzeiro assets in portfolios.

Title: Optimal Financial and Foreign-Exchange Liberalization of Less Developed Economies
Abstract: This paper models a typical highly inflationary less developed economy, in which monetary forces are the result of three policy determinants: the rate of monetary expansion (Âµ), the interest rate on bank deposits (d), and the rate of depreciation of the real exchange rate (…). The task confronting policy-makers is to reduce the equilibrium inflation rate without undue transitional sacrifice of the growth objective. We demonstrate that this optimally requires the precise coordination of all three instruments, with high but declining values of d and Âµ being adopted initially, and with … being modulated so as to forestall excessive capital inflows and to influence favorably the evolution of relative input prices.

Title: Product Diversity, Economies of Scale, and International Trade
Abstract: The paper develops new testable implications for monopolistic competition in the open economy. Within a two-sector model we explore how international trade affects plant size, the degree of product diversity, and excess capacity. The analysis then focuses on how trade affects the degree of domestic and international concentration, intersectoral capital mobility, and output in the competitive sector. Finally, we compare the model to the traditional Hecksher-Ohlin model and find that many of the central propositions still hold.

Title: Irreversibility, Uncertainty, and Cyclical Investment
Abstract: This paper builds on the theory of irreversible choice under uncertainty to give an explanation of cyclical investment fluctuations. The key observation is that, when individual projects are irreversible, agents must make investment timing decisions that trade off the extra returns from early commitment against the benefits of increased information gained by waiting. In an environment in which the underlying stochastic structure is itself subject to random change, events whose long-run implications are uncertain can create an investment cycle by temporarily increasing the returns to waiting for information.

Title: Transition Losses of Partially Mobile Industry-Specific Capital
Abstract: In estimating the economic effects of public policy, comparative static models typically assume homogenous factors that are either mobile or immobile. For changes designed to improve factor allocations, the former assumption would overstate welfare gains, while the latter would understate them. The model in this paper restricts each industry's capital reduction to its rate of depreciation. The stock of depreciated capital represents an industry-specific type of capital that may earn a lower equilibrium return. This model suggests that previous estimates of efficiency gains from integration of U. S. personal and corporate income taxes are overstated by $5 billion.

Title: Heterogeneous Users and the Peak Load Pricing Model
Abstract: The principal finding of this paper is that the conventional pricing solution for the peak load pricing problem must be modified to be applicable to a joint facility that is utilized by heterogeneous groups of users. The paper indicates how extending the conventional model through a multidimensional approach to capacity, accounting for its physical dimensions as well as its time dimension, will require specific capacity charges to users independent of the time of consumption. Any additional congestion charges levied will not perform the conventional role of covering replacement capacity costs, but will be used to reduce current congestion costs.

Title: Annual Inequality and Lifetime Inequality
Abstract: An estimator of inequality in lifetime incomes is derived. It can be computed for a population from the distribution of incomes in one year. As a result, the estimates are as easily calculated as measurements of annual inequality, but can be used as measurements of lifetime inequality. Estimates from this measure and two others have been computed for selected years since 1947. The results are compared by their implications for the level and trend of inequality in the United States.

Title: Losses From Horizontal Merger: The Effects of an Exogenous Change in Industry Structure on Cournot-Nash Equilibrium
Abstract: The consequences of a horizontal merger are typically studied by treating the merger as an exogenous change in market structure that displaces the initial Cournot equilibrium. In the new equilibrium the merged firm is assumed to behave like a multiplant Cournot player engaged in a noncooperative game against other sellers. The purpose of this article is to evaluate an unnoticed comparative-static implication of this approach: some exogenous mergers may reduce the endogenous joint profits of the firms that are assumed to collude. Cournot's original example is used to illustrate this and other bizarre results that can occur in the Cournot framework if the market structure is treated as exogenous.

Title: The Emergence of Chaos from Classical Economic Growth
Abstract: This paper shows how fluctuations of an erratic and unstable nature can emerge from the classical, deterministic economic growth process. Implications of the analysis would appear to be at least two. First, pronounced changes in the way an economy behaves need not cause us to reject our understanding of how it works. Second, we need not seek in exogenous forces an explanation as to why behavioral patterns change and why it may be so difficult to anticipate future events from the profile of past experience.

Title: Pricing and Depletion of an Exhaustible Resource When There is Anticipation of Trade Disruption
Abstract: This paper considers pricing and depletion of an exhaustible nonrenewable resource in an economy wherein domestic consumption is provided for by supplementing extraction from the economy's own resource stock with imports, the future supply of which is not assured. The socially optimal response to threat of trade disruption is a more conservationist depletion program for the domestic resource stock than would be called for, if import supplies were assured to persist. Competitive domestic firms adopt the socially optimal conservationist program. However, firms anticipating domestic market power after the disruption of import supplies are revealed to overextract the domestic resource stock.

Title: Spot and Futures Prices of Nonstorable Commodities Under Rational Expectations
Abstract: The paper examines the effect of the presence of a commodity futures market upon the price formation process in a stochastic rational expectations framework. An optimizing model with price uncertainty and risk aversion is used in order to solve equilibrium distributions of prices for nonstorable commodities. The existence of futures trading does not affect the degree of short-term spot price fluctuations. However, if the commodity market disturbance that originates from stochastic consumption demand is serially dependent, then the long-term price variation is smaller with a futures market than without it. Futures prices fluctuate less variably over time than spot and expected prices. Finally, there exists a futures intervention rule whereby the authority can stabilize spot prices and raise the overall welfare of society.

Title: Competition and Interest Rate Ceilings in Commercial Banking
Abstract: Regulations prohibiting the payment of explicit interest on demand deposits are gradually being eased. As banks switch from payment in the form of free services to explicit interest, both the level of money demand and the response of money demand to market interest rates will change. Banks are modeled here as being Chamberlinian monopolistic competitors. Equilibrium deposit interest rate relationships are found for markets both with and without an effective interest rate ceiling and the behavior of the two markets is compared. The elimination of deposit interest rate ceilings leads to increased money demand and an increased responsiveness of deposit rates to market interest rates.

Title: Optimal Selling Strategies: When to Haggle, When to Hold Firm
Abstract: A seller encountering risk-neutral buyers one at a time should, if commitments are feasible, quote a single take-it-or-leave-it price to each. This strategy is superior to any other for finite or infinite buyer populations, whether there is learning or the distribution of buyer prices is known at the outset, with one object for sale or many. Although haggling may offer advantages in terms of price discrimination, these gains are more than offset by the losses it generates by encouraging buyers to refuse purchases at high prices.

Title: Spatial Pricing with Differentiated Products
Abstract: This paper generalizes analysis of spatial pricing policies to cases in which oligopolists produce differentiated products. It is shown that spatial price discrimination through freight absorption is affected by the number of competitive firms, the extent to which their products are substitutes, and by the locations such firms adopt in the market. It is further shown, however, that spatial price discrimination may be the consequence of collusive agreements, or of attempts to anticipate competitors' actions. The simple (spaceless) foundations of current policies on spatial pricing need to be reexamined, but this reexamination must take into account interconnections between producers, the extent to which their products are differentiated, and their locations.

Title: The Impact of Income Components on the Distribution of Family Incomes
Abstract: Attempts have recently been made to assign inequality contributions to various components of income. This paper discusses the issues involved in such assignments and highlights the problems that follow from having a number of possible decomposition rules. U. S. data on the distribution of family incomes are used to examine the relative influence of these income components and to evaluate empirically the performance of different decomposition rules. A wide range of inequality contributions can be obtained, even when restricted to only â€œnaturallyâ€ derived decomposition rules. Some of the results are plainly absurd and serve to warn against the indiscriminate use of decomposition formulae without first investigating their properties.

Title: A Theory of Competition Among Pressure Groups for Political Influence
Abstract: This paper presents a theory of competition among pressure groups for political influence. Political equilibrium depends on the efficiency of each group in producing pressure, the effect of additional pressure on their influence, the number of persons in different groups, and the deadweight cost of taxes and subsidies. An increase in deadweight costs discourages pressure by subsidized groups and encourages pressure by taxpayers. This analysis unifies the view that governments correct market failures with the view that they favor the politically powerful: both are produced by the competition for political favors.

Title: Domestic Determinants of the Current Account Balance of the United States
Abstract: The U. S. economy is found to be sufficiently open to make the balance on foreign transactions an essential part of the equilibration process between saving and investment. Specifically, over the past two decades, changes in the national saving rate have increasingly been matched by changes in net foreign rather than domestic investment. Thus, it would be counterfactual to assume in policy discussions that measures to raise the national saving rate add fully to the stock of productive capital in the United States, barring only Keynesian complications. Conversely, a stimulus to domestic investment could be validated in part by drawing on foreign saving.

Title: Rational Expectations, Endogenous Currency Substitution, and Exchange Rate Determination
Abstract: The paper employs the intergenerational model to derive the demands for domestic and foreign currencies from microeconomic optimizing behavior. In the absence of government policy, we obtain the Kareken and Wallace result that exchange rates are constant and indeterminate. We discuss the reasons why nations may find it in their interests to impose probabilistic capital controls. It is shown that the imposition of probabilistic capital controls yields a unique (generally nonstationary) exchange rate path and that this path is determined in accord with the Monetary Approach. As the probability of controls tends to zero, the exchange rate remains determinate.

Title: Efficiency Loss from Resource Misallocation in Soviet Industry
Abstract: The paper analyzes the problems that arise in estimating the efficiency loss from misallocation of resources in Soviet industry, as revealed by the inequality of marginal rates of substitution among factors in the eight branches of Soviet industry. Econometric estimates of production functions in these branches are utilized to reach estimates of the loss arising from interbranch misallocation of capital and labor deployed in Soviet industry. This loss appears to be nonnegligible, ranging from a low of about 3 to 4 percent to a high of 10 percent of efficient factor use, and to be rising over time. Thus, an added reason for the current deceleration in Soviet industrial (and overall) growth is suggested.

Abstract: This paper takes the view that a project is a disturbance to an economy in equilibrium, and examines the shadow prices for project evaluation under alternative assumptions about how equilibrium is restored. When the government reacts by altering its foreign exchange reservesâ€a nondistortionary adjustment mechanismâ€the shadow prices coincide with those advocated in the manuals on social cost-benefit analysis. However, if the government adjusts its domestic expenditures or tariff rates, the shadow prices will differ from those of the manuals, except insofar as the relative shadow prices of tradeables remain their relative border prices.

Title: Adverse Selection in the Market for Slaves: New Orleans, 1830â€“1860
Abstract: This paper seeks to cast some light on the importance of adverse selection in competitive markets by examining the market for the sale of slaves in pre-Civil War New Orleans. Estimates of the degree of adverse selection in the New Orleans market are obtained by examining the relative prices of slaves from different regions of origin. These estimates indicate that slaves brought to market may on average have been of 20 percent to 40 percent lower quality than the slave population in general, and that good slaves were perhaps three times less likely to be sold than low quality ones.

Title: Labor-tying in a Poor Agrarian Economy: A Theoretical and Empirical Analysis
Abstract: In this paper we show how tied labor, contrary to its common characterization as a feudal relic and as a symptom of economic stagnation, may actually be strengthened by capitalist agricultural development. We construct a simple two-period theoretical model of a two-tiered labor market to show how the proportional importance of voluntary labor-tying contracts may increase with yield-increasing improvements and with a tightening of the labor market. We then provide in support of these hypotheses some general historical as well as more detailed econometric evidence from a variety of cross-sectional data in rural India.

Title: The Information Content of the Interest Rate and Optimal Monetary Policy
Abstract: Optimal monetary policy rules are derived in a rational expectations cum contracting framework. Monetary policy is redundant if wage setters exploit the incomplete current information embodied in today's nominal interest rate. However, the monetary authorities can save wage setters the costs of â€œindexingâ€ to the interest rate. A contemporaneous money supply feedback rule is as effective as wage indexation. A lagged rule, relevant under a regime of money supply targeting, is also as effective if investors use the interest rate. Both rules have the same implications for the real interest rate as Poole's combination policy. However, the two rules have strikingly different implications for the nominal interest rate.

Title: An Optimal Taxation Approach to Fiscal Federalism
Abstract: In a Federal system of government, each unit of government decides independently how much of each type of public good to provide, and what types of taxes, and which tax rates, to use in funding the public goods. In this paper we explore what types of problems can arise from this decentralized form of decision-making. In particular, we describe systematically the types of externalities that one unit of government can create for nonresidents, through both its public goods decisions and its taxation decisions. The paper also explores briefly what the central government might do to lessen the costs of decentralized decision-making.

Title: Taxation, Portfolio Choice, and Debt-Equity Ratios: A General Equilibrium Model
Abstract: This paper explores the portfolio behavior of investors differing with respect to both tax rates and risk aversion, emphasizing the role of constraints on individual and firm behavior in ensuring the existence of and characterizing portfolio equilibrium. Under certain conditions on the securities available in the market, which also are necessary for shareholders to be unanimous in supporting firm value maximization, investors will be segmented by tax rate into two groups, one specialized in equity and the other in debt. Though the relative wealths of the two groups determine the aggregate debt-equity ratio, each firm will be indifferent to its financial policy.

Title: Commodity Bundling and Agenda Control in the Public Sector
Abstract: In the public sector, commodity bundling involves an agenda setter exercising control over a governmental unit's budgetary mixâ€the allocation of the unit's total budget to its various subactivitiesâ€in order to manipulate electoral outcomes on other fiscal variables such as the total budget. This paper develops an analytical model of a political market in which a multi-activity governmental unit practices commodity bundling in order to advance the interests of the setter. Two institutional structures are considered, each involving a different voting process or set of electoral constraints and, hence, a different form of commodity bundling. The paper explores the impact of this form of monopoly power on such policy outcomes as the governmental unit's total budget, its budgetary mix, and the distribution of net benefits from collective action.

Title: Random Job Prospects and the Distribution of Income
Abstract: The paper examines job contracts consisting of a promotion procedure and a wage structure, which cause individuals of different ability to self-select into different jobs. It is established that although the promotion procedure is imperfect (as firms cannot directly obtain perfect information about workers) contracts exist that induce workers to reveal their ability through job choice. Such contracts support an informationally consistent equilibrium. In the equilibrium a proportion of individuals of each ability level are promoted. The paper examines the transformation this induces from the distribution of ability in the population to a distribution of earnings.

Title: Premiums for High Quality Products as Returns to Reputations
Abstract: This paper derives an equilibrium price-quality schedule for markets in which buyers cannot observe product quality prior to purchase. In such markets there is an incentive for sellers to reduce quality and take short-run gains before buyers catch on. In order to forestall such quality cutting, the price-quality schedule involves high quality items selling at a premium above their cost. This premium also serves the function of compensating sellers for their investment in reputation. The effects of improved consumer information and of a minimum quality standard on the equilibrium price-quality schedule are studied. In general, optimal quality standards exclude from the market items some consumers would like to buy.

Title: Noncooperative Oligopoly and Preemptive Innovation without Winner-Take-All
Abstract: Earlier models of innovation under oligopolistic rivalry are modified to include a â€œshare parameterâ€ ƒ, describing the manner in which profits are divided among rivals when one firm is successful in its search for a valuable resource stock. There is a unique value of ƒ that maximizes expected industry profits, by â€œguidingâ€ noncooperative oligopolists to choose the profit-maximizing exploration rate. Moreover, setting ƒ at this maximizing valueâ€which always allocates some share of industry profits to the â€œlosersâ€ in the exploration raceâ€leads to an exploration rate identical to what would be chosen by a jointly managed cartel.
