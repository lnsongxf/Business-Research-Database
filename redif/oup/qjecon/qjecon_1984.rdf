Title: Raw Materials, Profits, and the Productivity Slowdown
Abstract: A factor-price frontier framework is used to clarify the analogy of an increase (decrease) in raw material prices with autonomous technological regress (progress). Factor-price profiles are estimated for the manufacturing sector of the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, and Japan. The production model, in conjunction with estimates obtained from the factor-price frontier, attributes much of the slowdown in manufacturing productivity to the rise in relative raw material prices. Part of the apparent productivity riddle may have to do with the use of double-deflated national accounting measures of value added, which have an inherent measurement bias.

Title: Black-White Earnings Ratios Since the Civil Rights Act of 1964: The Importance of Labor Market Dropouts
Abstract: Published median earnings of wage and salary workers by race and sex are based on distributions that exclude those without earnings and those not employed as wage and salary workers at the time of the survey. It has been argued that the changing importance of these exclusions, rather than any improvement in the distribution of offered wages for blacks, accounts for the apparent increase in black-white relative median earnings. This paper presents a new method for correcting the published medians for such censoring. The apparent improvement in relative earnings is reduced but not eliminated by the correction.

Title: The Forward Exchange Market, Speculation, and Exchange Market Intervention
Abstract: This paper examines two issues. The first is the role of speculation in stabilizing the economy against stochastic disturbances. Increased speculation (i) stabilizes domestic income against disturbances in the domestic bond market and forward exchange market; (ii) exacerbates the effect of foreign disturbances; and (iii) may dampen or augment the effect of money market and output supply disturbances. The second issue is the role of the forward market in stabilization policy. Forward market intervention does not provide monetary authorities additional leverage in stabilizing income beyond unsterilized spot market intervention. Intervention rules based on reactions to both the forward and the spot exchange rates, however, can outperform intervention policies responding to the spot rate alone, regardless of the market in which intervention occurs.

Title: The Taking of Land: When Should Compensation Be Paid?
Abstract: The analysis focuses on the question of whether the payment of compensation for land taken by eminent domain is efficient. When the taking decision is independent of land use, zero compensation is efficient, but full compensation is not. When the project decision is no longer independent of land use, and can be affected by investor decisions, neither compensation rule is generally efficient because of the moral hazard problem. With risk-averse consumers and risk-neutral firms, the previous conclusions remain essentially unchanged. However, when the project decision rule involves a budgetary "fiscal illusion," additional compensation may be necessary to correct the incentives facing the project decision-maker.

Title: The Effects of Taxation on the Selling of Corporate Stock and the Realization of Capital Gains: Comment
Abstract: In a recent article in this Journal, Martin S. Feldstein, Joel Slemrod, and Shlomo Yitzhaki [FSY] find that marginal tax rates have a powerful effect on the realization of long-term capital gains on corporate stock, and project that a tax cut similar to that enacted in 1978 should triple realizations and increase tax revenues. This comment finds that an econometric error caused FSY to overstate the elasticity of realizations to tax rates by a factor of 51. Corrected and refined estimates show that tax rate cuts will not increase realizations sufficiently to increase tax revenues.

Title: The Design of Contracts and Remedies for Breach
Abstract: In the first part of this article, (hypothetical) contracts providing for all possible uncertain contingencies are considered. In the next part, contracts providing for only some contingencies are examined and are shown to be advantageous, due both to difficulties that could arise in making and enforcing contingent terms and to the presence of implicit substitutes for them. In the following, major part of the article, two of these substitutes for contingent terms are analyzed: remedies for breach, and the opportunity for renegotiation; the existence of both is demonstrated to induce parties to behave approximately as they would under detailed contracts.

Title: The Economics of Joint Ventures in Less Developed Countries
Abstract: The paper examines the microeconomic (partial equilibrium) behavior of joint ventures established between transnational corporations and domestic partners in less developed countries. It focuses on issues relating to resource allocation and profit distribution under various institutional scenarios. The analysis places special emphasis on the role of bargaining power, transfer pricing, stock ownership, and profit shares of the parties, and the responsiveness of joint ventures to national development goals. Some of the results apply to wholly owned subsidiaries of transnational corporations, local firms, and licensing arrangements, which emerge as special cases.

Title: The Welfare Effects of the Introduction of Storage
Abstract: This paper examines the welfare effects of introducing storage into a market with stochastic supply in which all agents are competitive profit-maximizers with rational expectations. These welfare effects are the net result of the initial increase in demand for stock-building and the partial and asymmetric reduction in the dispersion of consumption brought about by storage. The distributional impacts depend crucially on the information available to producers before storage is introduced, the elasticity of supply, the specification of the consumption demand curve, and the cost of storage.

Title: The Tradeoff Between Wages and Employment in Trade Union Objectives
Abstract: This paper demonstrates that, contrary to a widely held opinion, the determination of the goals of unions is fully amenable to empirical analysis. A characterization of the wage and employment-setting process in unionized markets is adopted, and its qualitative implications examined. The first-order condition for this model is fitted to time series data on the newspaper industry from ten cities. The International Typographical Union's objective function reveals very restricted opportunities for substituting wages for employment in response to a change in the slope of the employer's labor demand function. Larger union locals place greater emphasis on wages versus employment than smaller union locals.

Title: Inflation, Employment, and the Dutch Disease in Oil-Exporting Countries: A Short-Run Disequilibrium Analysis
Abstract: We explain nontraded goods and labor shortages in the Gulf countries, the decline of the traded goods sector in oil producers ("Dutch Disease"), and the absence of employment benefits of higher oil revenues in Latin American oil producers using a disequilibrium model where real wages and the real exchange rate adjust slowly to clear the labor and nontraded goods market. Higher oil revenues can be likened to a transfer putting pressure on NT goods prices and drawing resources out of the T sector. The slope of the wage indexation line determines whether classical unemployment or repressed inflation results. Various policy measures are analyzed.

Title: Unionized Construction Workers are More Productive
Abstract: This paper presents evidence on the effect of unionism on productivity in construction. The linkages are distinct from those studied previously in industrial settings. Apprenticeship training and hiring halls probably raise union productivity, while jurisdictional disputes and restrictive work rules lower it. Using Brown and Medoff's methodology, union productivity, measured by value added per employee, is 44 to 52 percent higher than nonunion. The estimate declines to 17 to 22 percent when estimates of interarea construction price differences are used to deflate value added. Occupational mix differences and, possibly, apprenticeship training account for 15 to 27 percent of this difference.

Title: Incentives, Productivity, and Labor Contracts
Abstract: The relationship between age-earnings profiles and worker incentives is examined by contrasting wage and salary workers with the self-employed. It is argued that the steepness of wage and salary workers' age-earnings profiles reflects the desire to provide work incentives to those workers. Since self-employed workers do not face this agency problem, they are used as a benchmark to gauge productivity. Empirical support of the proposition is provided, and the effects of human capital accumulation are separated empirically from incentive effects. The most important conclusion is that under some strong assumptions, most of the slope in age-earnings profiles is accounted for by the desire to provide incentives, rather than by on-the-job training.

Title: Work Norms and Involuntary Unemployment
Abstract: Consider the organizational environment of labor management wherein the firm can measure the average performance (i.e., group work norm) of its employees but has difficulty in observing the individual worker's performance within the group. Accordingly, the worker's remuneration is based on the observed group norm. Because of the way in which workers interact among themselves in setting work norms, there results an undersupply of effort from a given workforce size. Furthermore, the group work norm is shown to be negatively correlated with the size of the workforce. Consequently, short-run unemployment can arise with involuntary features. The paper also explores the effectiveness of alternative remuneration schemes in mitigating the inefficiency associated with the group work norm setting.

Title: Inflation, Taxation, and Corporate Behavior
Abstract: Under the U. S. tax law, taxable income differs systematically from economic income when there is inflation. For example, nominal interest payments and nominal capital gains are taxable or tax deductible, and depreciation allowances are based on historic rather than replacement costs. Therefore, even fully anticipated inflation can have real effects. The purpose of this paper is to investigate to what degree an increase in the inflation rate, given these differences between taxable and economic income under existing tax law, ought to change corporate investment and financial policy, and cause capital gains or losses to existing owners of corporate equity.

Title: Delivered Pricing and Multiple Basing Point Equilibria: A Reevaluation
Abstract: This paper examines delivered pricing with systematic freight absorption in the light of the modern theory of spatial competition. Delivered pricing, multiple basing point equilibria are compared with f.o.b. mill pricing equilibria under a variety of assumptions about market structure and firms' conjectural variations. It is shown that there is no clear reason for preferring f.o.b. pricing or delivered pricing in the abstract. Delivered pricing is likely to be preferable from the consumer's standpoint either if the conjectural variations of the firms are high, or if conjectural variations are consistent, and there are few firms in the industry.

Title: The Simultaneous Determination of Spot and Futures Prices in a Simple Model with Production Risk
Abstract: This paper deals with properties of a rational expectations equilibrium when there is futures trading. A simple two-good model is analyzed, where one of the goods is produced subject to production risk. Although the futures market provides insurance against price risk to producers, it is income risk that concerns them. Whether they hedge in equilibrium is shown to depend on the price and income elasticity of demand for their output as well as on the degree to which consumers—the other party in the futures transaction-—are risk-averse.

Abstract: Suppose that the government maximizes a fixed social welfare function through the use of policy instruments.

Title: The Long-Run Creditworthiness of Developing Countries: Theory and Practice
Abstract: This paper analyzes the determinants of developing country long-run creditworthiness, focusing on the process of capital accumulation relative to external debt. Creditworthiness depends on the actual capital stock compared with a critical level, representing the gross wealth just sufficient to ensure that interest payments to foreigners never exhaust national output given expected gross inflows and existing outstanding debt. Hence, the probability of rescheduling is linked to debt service-capital, net inflows-capital, investment rates, and income levels. The empirical results, based on a probit analysis of historical rescheduling incidents, are quite robust and supportive of the theoretical framework.

Title: Imperfect Information and the Equitability of Competitive Prices
Abstract: In many markets, sellers have imperfect information about the costs of sales to different buyers, and the pattern of competitive pricing depends on the information available. In order to analyze the equity implications of public policies requiring information suppression, non-utilitarian measures of the horizontal and vertical dimensions of pricing inequity caused by cross-subsidization are proposed and examined. Better information generally reduces vertical inequity, but if information about buyers is initially poor, additional imperfect information may increase horizontal inequity. If information is initially good, more information generally lowers both dimensions of inequity.

Title: The Relative Productivity Hypothesis of Industrialization: The American Case, 1820 to 1850
Abstract: A two-sector model is used to explore the role of the agricultural sector in the process of industrialization. Our hypothesis is that areas industrialize earlier where the wages for females and children relative to those for adult males are initially low. Furthermore, the lower this relative productivity of females and children in the pre-industrial economy, the proportionately more will their relative wages increase, and the higher will be the ratio of manufactured to agricultural goods. The model is used to interpret the conditions that fostered the rapid industrialization of the American Northeast, but not the South, from 1820 to 1850.

Title: Cyclic Pricing by a Durable Goods Monopolist
Abstract: In the model of this paper a monopoly seller of a durable good holds periodic sales as a means of price discrimination. A new cohort of consumers enters the market in each period, interested in purchasing the good either immediately or after a delay. Within each cohort, consumers vary in their tastes for the good. Under broad conditions, the seller will vary the price over time. In most periods, he will charge a price just low enough to sell immediately to consumers with a high willingness to pay. Periodically, however, he will drop the price far enough to sell to an accumulated group of consumers with a low willingness to pay.

Title: Willingness to Pay and Compensation Demanded: Experimental Evidence of an Unexpected Disparity in Measures of Value
Abstract: Aside from possible income effects, measures of the maximum amounts people will pay to avoid a loss and the minimum compensation necessary for them to accept it are generally assumed to be equivalent. Unexpectedly wide variations between these sums, however, have been noted in survey responses to hypothetical options. This paper reports the results of a series of experiments that confronted people with actual money payments and cash compensations. The results indicate that the compensation measure of value seems to exceed significantly the willingness to pay measure, which would appear to call into some question various rules of entitlement, damage assessments, and interpretations of indifference curves.

Title: The Decline of Dominant Firms, 1905–1929
Abstract: The theory of dynamic limit pricing implies that a firm maximizes its wealth by gradually sacrificing its dominant market share. We extend the theory by simulation methods to show that higher structural entry barriers generally result in both higher profits and a slower sacrifice of market share. The model is applied to 42 once-dominant firms in U. S. manufacturing to explain jointly the declines of their market shares and the profit rates earned during 1905–1929. The statistical results agree substantially with the hypothesis that these firms behaved consistently with maximizing their wealth through dynamic limit pricing.

Title: Labor Union Objectives and Collective Bargaining
Abstract: We consider a model oflabor union behavior in which workers make decisions about wages and employment by simple majority rule. We show that under general conditions such a union has a well-behaved objective function, different from those previously postulated in the literature. We then show that the union's majority preferences generally lack a von Neumann-Morgenstern utility representation and thus cannot be inserted into traditional bargaining models. We then develop and characterize the solutions to a new bargaining model that is consistent with the structure of union preferences. Several comparative-statics results are presented.

Title: Commercial Policy and Aggregate Employment Under Rational Expectations
Abstract: Commercial policy is often advocated as a useful tool for combating such macroeconomic ills as unemployment and chronic balance of payments deficits. This paper examines the role of expectations in determining the output and employment effects of various commercial policies. In a rational expectations framework in which workers have incomplete information, it is shown that (i) the short-run output and employment effects of commercial policy changes depend crucially on the correlation between real and nominal wages and that (ii) the use of commercial policy as an instrument of short-run stabilization policy cannot be divorced from its long-run effects on real wages, output, and employment.

Title: Permanent Income, Liquidity, and Expenditure on Automobiles: Evidence from Panel Data
Abstract: Several recent papers have tested the permanent income-cum-rational expectations hypothesis using data on nondurable or semidurable consumption. We show how this approach can be extended to the case of durables. An application to panel data on automobile expenditures reveals no evidence against the permanent income hypothesis. This result is unchanged in subsamples segregated by family holdings of liquid assets.

Title: Oil Prices, Welfare, and the Trade Balance
Abstract: The paper examines welfare effects and the trade balance response to changes in the world oil prices and interest rates for a small oil-importing economy. The trade balance is mainly seen as the difference between saving and investment, and these are derived from intertemporal optimization. It is shown that the welfare effects consist of static terms-of-trade effects, intertemporal terms-of-trade effects, and employment effects. The trade balance deteriorates for temporary oil price increases; whereas its response is ambiguous for permanent oil price increases. For a fall in the world interest rate, the trade balance deteriorates if the economy is a net borrower.

Title: A Production Theory Perspective on Collective Choice Theory
Abstract: Basic production theory concepts of separability and externalities are used to provide an intuitive, unifying explanation of Arrow's original possibility theorem and later variants of it due to Sen, Wilson, Mas-Colell, and Sonnenschein, of the libertarian paradoxes of Sen and Gibbard, and of the single-profile possibility theorem of Parks. These important results in collective choice theory are shown to be the result of imposing on a multiple-output production process both externality-requiring and externality-denying characteristics. In each of these cases various consistency conditions on social preference and input-output links like citizens' sovereignty or the Pareto principle create external effects in production that interact with an externality-denying characteristic of separability to create a production process with zero marginal input productivity in certain regions of input space.

Title: Wage and Employment Structure in an Economy with Internal Labor Markets
Abstract: The paper discusses the economics of promotion and, in particular, studies wage and employment structure in an economy with internal labor markets. It is shown—under a wide range of assumptions—that firms will set a nondecreasing wage profile that, for reasons apparently not suggested before, both junior and senior workers may be paid more or less than their marginal product, and that firms will offer a flat wage schedule if labor hours are supplied perfectly inelastically.

Title: The Theory of Social Custom: A Modification and Some Extensions
Abstract: Can unprofitable social customs persist? Can they account for important economic phenomena? Akerlof's original model of social custom suffers from two defects: First, sanctions for violating the custom depend discontinuously on the size of the violation, and second, the model borders on the unmanageable. This paper shows that customs can persist and can lead to such phenomena as involuntary unemployment when sanctions are continuous. More important, the continuity assumption simplifies the model dramatically, making the analysis of social customs tractable. The simplified model is used to extend Akerlof's analysis of a "just wage" to cases in which workers are heterogeneous.

Title: Tax Subsidies to Owner-Occupied Housing: An Asset-Market Approach
Abstract: Inflation reduces the effective cost of homeownership and raises the tax subsidy to owner occupation. This paper presents an asset-market model of the housing market and estimates how changes in the expected inflation rate affect the real price of houses and the equilibrium size of the housing capital stock. Simulation results suggest that the accelerating inflation of the 1970s, which substantially reduced homeowners' user costs, could have accounted for as much as a 30 percent increase in real house prices. Persistent high inflation rates could lead ultimately to a sizable increase in the stock of owner-occupied housing.

Title: Market Power and Transferable Property Rights
Abstract: The appeal of using markets as a means of allocating scarce resources stems in large part from the assumption that a market will approximate the competitive ideal. When competition is not a foregone conclusion, the question naturally arises as to how a firm might manipulate the market to its own advantage. This paper analyzes the issue of market power in the context of markets for transferable property rights. First, a model is developed that explains how a single firm with market power might exercise its influence. This is followed by an examination of the model in the context of a particular policy problem—the control of particulate sulfates in the Los Angeles region.

Title: The Effect of Social Security on Retirement in the Early 1970s
Abstract: We analyze detailed longitudinal data on a cohort of males aged 58–67 in 1969–1973, a period of substantial increases in real Social Security benefits. We find the following: (1) the accelerating decline in labor force participation of elderly men in 1969–1973 can be explained by the large increase in real Social Security benefits; (2) there is evidence of a liquidity constraint effect for an important subgroup of the elderly; (3) the magnitude of this induced retirement effect is large enough that ignoring it can lead to serious underestimation of the fiscal implications of changes in benefit provisions. Our results are interpreted in the historical context of a particular cohort undergoing major, unanticipated transfers of wealth; the steady-state effects of Social Security on retirement may not be the same.

Title: Comparative Stability Analysis of Multiregional Input-Output Models: Column, Row, and Leontief-Strout Gravity Coefficient Models
Abstract: This paper provides the necessary and sufficient conditions on the regional trade matrices that ensure that a generalized multiregional input-output (MRIO) model will be convergent. The three MRIO models are examined using the above conditions, and it is demonstrated that the Chenery-Moses column coefficient model satisfies them, whereas the opposite is true of the row coefficient and Leontief-Strout point-estimate gravity coefficient models. This evaluation of the three MRIO models confirms the results of empirical testing.

Title: Time-Separable Preferences and Intertemporal-Substitution Models of Business Cycles
Abstract: Time-separability of utility means that past work and consumption do not influence current and future tastes. This form of preferences does not restrict the size of intertemporal-substitution effects, but does place constraints on the relative responses of leisure and consumption to changes in relative prices and in permanent income. These constraints are important for evaluating the impact of shifts in expectations about the future, which play a key role in equilibrium models of the business cycle. Further, if consumption and effort are to be positively correlated over the cycle, then equilibrium theories with time-separable preferences predict a procyclical behavior for the real wage rate.

Title: Imperfect Information, Uncertainty, and Credit Rationing: Comment and Extension
Abstract: The Jaffee and Russell [1976] model of credit rationing under imperfect information and uncertainty suggests that a single-contract equilibrium will tend to occur at a point of rationing and that a multiple-contract equilibrium will likely be unstable. This paper respecifies and extends the Jaffee-Russell model to incorporate default expectations on the demand side and to consider the price of credit more appropriately to be the net (after expected default) yield rather than the contract rate. Results show rationing is not necessary in the single-contract equilibrium case, nor is an unstable equilibrium possible in the multiple-contract case.
