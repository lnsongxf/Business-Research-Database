Title: Taxation of Corporate Capital Income: Tax Revenues Versus Tax Distortions
Abstract: This paper shows that when uncertainty is taken into account explicitly, taxation of corporate income can leave corporate investment incentives, and individual savings incentives, basically unaffected, in spite of the sizable tax revenues collected. In some plausible situations, such taxes can increase efficiency. The explanation for these surprising results is that the government, by taxing capital income, absorbs a certain fraction of both the expected return and the uncertainty in the return. While investors as a result receive a lower expected return, they also bear less risk when they invest, and these two effects are largely offsetting.

Title: Permanent Differences in Unemployment and Permanent Wage Differentials
Abstract: This paper tests for the existence of wage premiums based on geographic and industry unemployment differences. These differences are broken down into permanent and transitory components in equations controlling for variation in state generosity of unemployment insurance benefits. Findings indicate that wage premiums arise for long-run unemployment differences, but that negative short-run shocks to industries generate wage cuts, while positive shocks generate wage hikes. Therefore, labor contracts accommodate long-term anticipated unemployment, and entail sharing of short-term unemployment risks.

Title: Two Views of the Geographic Distribution of Unemployment
Abstract: This paper investigates the extent to which equilibrium and disequilibrium explanations can account for unemployment rate differentials between cities. It shows that shocks that disturb the steady-state relationship among the unemployment rates of metropolitan areas tend to be eliminated by mobility within a single year. It also shows that high unemployment areas tend to be those with attractive climates and amenities, high wages, and high unemployment insurance. It argues that the main effect of government programs that create jobs in high unemployment areas will be to lure additional job seekers to those areas.

Title: Innovation and Industry Evolution
Abstract: The theoretical literature on innovation has been concerned with a single innovation produced by a number of identical agents. By contrast, we consider a market in which one firm is the current incumbent, while the remaining firms are challengers. Moreover, we consider a sequence of innovations, so that success does not imply that the successful firm reaps monopoly profits forever after, but only until the next, better innovation is developed. We begin with a fully optimizing behavioral model and derive the equivalent of the Schumpeterian "process of creative destruction." That is, a firm enjoys temporary monopoly power but is soon overthrown by a more inventive challenger. The essential point to grasp is that in dealing with capitalism we are dealing with an evolutionary process…The fundamental impulse that sets and keeps the capitalist engine in motion comes from the new consumers' goods, the new methods of production or transportation, the new markets, the new forms of industrial organization that capitalist enterprise creates [Schumpeter, 1942, pp. 82–83].

Title: The Social Efficiency of Fixed Wages
Abstract: This paper analyzes a model in which fixed wages and layoffs may be the most efficient way to organize employment contracts. When wages fluctuate to reallocate labor among firms, workers must make costly decisions and may undertake excessive search. In contrast, if all firms reallocate labor with layoffs and new hires at fixed wages, only those workers laid off will have decisions to make. The lower decision costs of the fixed wage contract may more than compensate for the resource cost of the unemployment it causes. A novel feature of the model is the result that the socially optimal contract, when chosen by all firms, may not be the privately optimal contract.

Title: Multiplicity of Equilibria and Comparative Statics
Abstract: Conditions that guarantee the uniqueness of equilibrium in models of economic competition are crucial to applications of these models in exercises of comparative statics. Until now, most of the attention given to the uniqueness question has been focused on pure exchange economies. In this paper we use a topological index theorem to derive necessary and sufficient conditions for the uniqueness of equilibrium in economies with production. Unfortunately, conditions that imply uniqueness appear to be too restrictive to have much applicability. We argue, for example, that the only economically interpretable restrictions that imply uniqueness are either that the demand side of an economy behaves like a single consumer or that the supply side is an input-output system. Our results suggest a need for reformulation of the comparative statics method.

Title: The "Patman Effect" and Stabilization Policy
Abstract: This paper examines the controversial link between interest rates and prices by introducing interest costs into John Taylor's model of overlapping wage contracts. We find that the presence of interest costs does affect the stabilization process and can make the tradeoffs between output and price variability less favorable.

Title: The Taxation of Exhaustible Resources
Abstract: The efficiency and equity effects of unit, yield, property, and windfall profits taxes upon nonrenewable resources are compared. The yield tax is the most efficient, and unit and property taxes are the least efficient of current taxes. If the base price of the windfall profits tax is set close to extraction cost, the windfall profits tax can be even more efficient than the yield tax. All the tax burdens fall primarily upon owners. In fact, with the property and windfall profits taxes, consumers can even be made better off.

Title: The Effect of Liquidity Constraints on Consumption: A Cross-Sectional Analysis
Abstract: This paper examines the effect of liquidity constraints on consumption expenditures using a single-year cross-section data set. A reduced-form equation for consumption is estimated on high-saving households by the Tobit procedure to account for the selectivity bias. Since high-saving households are not likely to be liquidity constrained, the estimated equation is an appropriate description of how desired consumption that would be forthcoming without liquidity constraints is related to the variables available in the cross-section data. When the reduced-form equation is used to predict desired consumption, the gap between desired consumption and measured consumption is most evident for young households.

Title: Incidence Analysis of a Sector-Specific Minimum Wage in a Two-Sector Harris-Todaro Model
Abstract: In this paper we explore the incidence of a sector-specific minimum wage in a two-sector Harris-Todaro model with intersectorally mobile capital. In addition to the output and substitution effects in Harberger's tax incidence analysis, an additional effect reflecting the endogenously generated unemployment arises in the Harris-Todaro case. We also explore the functional incidence issue numerically for Mexico by using general equilibrium computational techniques. In a number of the calculations reported, capital more than bears the income loss from unemployment caused by the sector-specific minimum wage.

Title: Intertemporal Substitution in Macroeconomics
Abstract: Modern neoclassical business cycle theories posit that the observed fluctuations in consumption and employment correspond to decisions of an optimizing representative individual. We estimate three first-order conditions that represent three tradeoffs faced by such an optimizing individual. He can trade off present for future consumption, present for future leisure, and present consumption for present leisure. The aggregate U. S. data lend no support to this model. The overidentifying restrictions are rejected, and the estimated utility function is often convex. Even when it is concave, the estimates imply that either consumption or leisure is an inferior good.

Title: The Optimal Level of Social Security Benefits
Abstract: The optimal level of social security benefits depends on balancing the protection that these benefits offer to those who lack the foresight to provide for their own old age against the welfare costs of distorting economic behavior. The primary such cost is the distortion in private saving. The present paper derives the level of social security benefits that is optimal in three basic cases. In the first section the paper derives the optimal level of benefits for an economy in which all individuals do not anticipate retirement at all and therefore do no saving. The second and third sections then derive optimal benefits for two different definitions of incomplete myopia.

Title: Population Size: Individual Choice and Social Optima
Abstract: Optimal population size when fertility is endogenous is considered in relation to two social welfare criteria, a Benthamite and a Millian, and in relation to purely individualistic maximization of utility in the current generation. We show that a tax-subsidy scheme involving child allowances and subsidies to future generation consumption can be found to support a social optimum through individual choice. A general proof that the optimal population size according to the Benthamite criterion is always larger than that given by the Millian criterion is presented, but we show that no general conclusions about the size of the population under laissez-faire are possible.

Title: Efficient Tax Reform in a Dynamic Model of General Equilibrium
Abstract: The welfare gain of a shift from capital to a labor income tax is determined in a model of intertemporal optimization with infinite horizon and variable labor supply. The welfare impact of small tax changes is computed by an approximation method around the steady state. When the difference between the growth rate and the discount rate is small, the welfare impact of tax reform depends mainly on the parameters of the production function.

Title: State Dependence in Optimal Factor Accumulation
Abstract: A general model of optimal factor accumulation over an infinite horizon is presented in which the steady state depends on initial conditions and on the history of the system. In contrast to conventional results, any change in initial conditions or any temporary shock in the convergence process will in general change the optimal steady state. The result is shown to arise, when the discount rate is positive, from standard assumptions made about the technology of converting heterogeneous factors from one type to another.

Title: The Inefficiency of Unemployment: The Supervision Perspective
Abstract: We study an example economy with costly labor monitoring under a wage-cum-supervision arrangement, where workers' utilities are not equalized across sectors (workers are identical to each other). Our main task is to look for (and find) a set of "flat" taxes and subsidies that bring about a Pareto improvement over the laissez-faire solution. We show that any of such welfare-improving schemes involves a tax on labor income from those workers whose utility is the lowest.

Title: Expectations, Life Expectancy, and Economic Behavior
Abstract: The formation of individuals' horizons, which is central to the theory of life-cycle behavior, has been completely neglected. This is especially surprising, since the life expectancy of adults has recently increased rapidly in Western countries. This study analyzes responses to a questionnaire designed to elicit subjective expectations and probabilities of survival. People do extrapolate past improvements in longevity when they determine their subjective horizons, and they are fully aware of levels of and movements within today's life tables. The subjective distribution has greater variance than its actuarial counterpart; and the subjective variance decreases with age. The implications of these findings for optimal Social Security, for the construction of annuities, for the analysis of savings behavior, and for evaluating lifetime earnings are discussed.

Title: Occupational Choice: An Application to the Market for Public School Teachers
Abstract: Most previous work on occupational choice does not satisfactorily treat the potentially important effects of future demand conditions. In contrast, this paper develops and estimates a rational expectations model in which agents look beyond expected starting salaries and take explicit account of future demand conditions. The empirical results demonstrate that future demand conditions are important determinants of the decision to acquire secondary school certification but are not important for the decision to acquire elementary school certification. The paper concludes with a comparison of the dynamic properties of the rational expectations model and a cobweb specification.

Title: Flexibility in Intercommodity Substitution May Sharpen Price Fluctuations
Abstract: Consider a competitive industry using an aggregate of two commodities as an input to production. Suppose that the supply of one of the commodities is stochastic. It can then be shown that investment in flexibility in the ex post choice among the two commodities is likely to result in a sharpening rather than dampening of the stochastic fluctuations in the aggregate commodity price if the supply elasticity is lower for the substitute commodity than for the one with stochastic supply. The paper derives this result and applies it to the case of ex post flexibility in fuel choice with uncertain fuel supply.

Title: A Theory of Price-Fixing Rings
Abstract: Price-fixing rings with market sharing arrangements are an empirically important category of cartel phenomena. This paper develops a cartel model in which side payments are not allowed and firms engage in negotiations to fix price and market shares under conditions of demand uncertainty. The negotiated agreement reflects cost averaging and yields a solution on the contract curve. The price determined by unit cost averaging ensures acceptable profits for the firms while the risks associated with slack demand and excess capacity are spread across the firms in accordance with the division of the market. The model's predictions are consistent with available empirical evidence.

Title: Indirect Methods for Regulating Externalities Under Uncertainty
Abstract: It is sometimes necessary or appropriate to correct an externality by intervening in the market for a privately traded commodity with which the externality is linked. In these situations ad valorem taxation is a viable policy option. It is argued that some combination of specific and ad valorem taxes will always outperform regulations which fix price administratively, but that quantity standards may outperform taxes. The analysis is applied to a problem in international trade.

Title: Predetermined Prices and the Allocation of Social Risks
Abstract: We propose a Walrasian explanation for the existence of fixed prices, i.e., of trades in which either the price or the quantity exchanged does not reflect all publicly available information. Such trades result in a rigid price system that facilitates the sharing of social risks; they may also cause allocative distortions that increase the equilibrium price of insurance above its actuarially fair level. We demonstrate that the market for noncontingent claims is active only when this insurance "gain" outweighs the "cost" of allocative distortions. Fixed price equilibria are constrained optima, i.e., they cannot be dominated by an appropriately constrained central planner.

Title: International Factor Mobility, Minimum Wage Rates, and Factor-Price Equalization: A Synthesis
Abstract: This paper examines the behavior of a small open economy facing perfectly elastic supply curves for some of its productive factors. In particular, the paper derives some comparative statics properties of such economies, compares them with the properties of otherwise identical economies in which all factor prices are determined endogenously, and investigates the relationship between factor-price rigidities, factor-price equalization, and the pattern of specialization. Among the new results which are proved, it is shown that, as more and more factor-price rigidities are imposed on an economy, it comes "closer" to a state of factor-price equalization.

Title: Disequilibrium Dynamics and the Stability of Quasi Equilibria
Abstract: This paper develops a dynamic disequilibrium macro model and examines its stability properties. We specify a rationing scheme that explicitly takes into account the spillover effects and differentiates between notional, effective, and actual quantities. A complete graphical representation of an economy under nonmarket-clearing trade conditions is then given. In a Solow-Stiglitz [1968] setting we develop a dynamic model in which the dynamic forces depend on the economic environment à la Malinvaud. The stability conditions for a stable quasi equilibrium in each region are derived, and it is shown that, in general, any two stable quasi-equilibrium points are separated by an unstable stationary point.

Title: Monopolistic Recycling of Oil Revenue and Intertemporal Bias in Oil Depletion and Trade
Abstract: This paper investigates oil depletion and trade when monopolistic oil producers also exercise monopoly power in the capital market. A two-period model views collusively organized oil producers with an initial trade surplus and a subsequent deficit. When monopoly power in the capital market is applied to the disadvantage of borrowers, less oil is initially made available to oil importers than if the interest rate had been competitively determined. This depletion bias, however, is reversed if, because of incentives for capital accumulation, it is to the advantage of the oil producers to subsidize lending to the oil importers. In either case the bias in oil depletion due to monopolistic recycling of oil revenue is greater, the more vulnerable are oil importers' incomes to a curtailment of oil supplies.

Title: Wage Bargaining in a Macroeconomic Model with Rationing
Abstract: A model of a single-commodity, closed economy is constructed in which the commodity price is fixed and its market clears by quantity adjustment. The distinctive feature is that the real wage and employment are determined by bargaining between unions, representing workers and firms. There are several possible regimes, some with labor hoarding. The effects of changes in autonomous spending and the reservation wage on the endogenous variables of the model, including employment and the real wage are discussed. Some interesting possibilities emerge for the cyclical movement of productivity and the real wage.

Title: The Contribution of Changing Energy and Import Prices to Changing Average Labor Productivity: A Profit Formulation for Canada
Abstract: In the 1970s there has been a noticeable labor productivity slowdown in Canada. In addition to contributions of such traditional variables as changes in capital intensity and quality of labor, this study quantifies contributions of higher energy and changing import prices to productivity changes. A Taylor series approximation to a restricted profit function representing the Canadian economy helps reveal that rising energy prices have reduced labor productivity by 0.53 percent per year after 1970 and that the underlying modified rates of technical progress in the 1960s and 1970s, having netted out price of energy—and import—effects, are not dissimilar.

Title: Inflation, Interest Rates, and Welfare
Abstract: This paper develops a simple general equilibrium model of a monetary economy with a capital market. Money demand arises from a "cash-in-advance" constraint rather than from any direct role in the utility function, and uncertainty gives rise to a meaningful portfolio choice between money and bonds. We show that velocity is increasing in the rate of inflation, and that the optimal monetary policy is that which maximizes real balances. We also show that the real rate of interest is not invariant to monetary, policy: inflation lowers the real rate.

Title: The Generalized Theory of Transfers and Welfare: Exogenous (policy-Imposed) and Endogenous (Transfer-Induced) Distortion
Abstract: This paper reconsiders the welfare effects of a transfer payment in a two-commodity world with two agents (countries), by taking the presence of exogenous and endogenous distortions into account. When there is an exogenous tax-cumsubsidy on production, consumption, or trade, the analysis demonstrates that a transfer may paradoxically enrich the donor and immiserize the recipient under certain specific conditions. These welfare paradoxes are also shown to be possible if the transfer endogenously induces "directly unproductive profit-seeking" activity of lobbyists. Concluding remarks emphasize the paper's relevance for policymakers.

Title: Government Expenditures, Deficits, and Inflation: On the Impossibility of a Balanced Budget
Abstract: A model is presented in which governments can select real expenditure levels that are feasible, but are sufficiently high that a balanced budget is impossible. Thus, governments with large expenditures are committed to inflationary finance schemes. This is the case, even though the governments in question have access to lump-sum taxes. In addition, the model can explain why poorer countries tend to make heavier use of the inflation tax than do wealthier countries, and can account for the existence of country-specific fiat monies. The government that does not have access to the printing press can, nonetheless, use emergency taxes or compulsory loans for emergency financing. S.Fischer [1982, p. 297]

Title: Unemployment Through the Filter of Memory
Abstract: This paper uses data from the annual Work Experience Survey to construct a new unemployment series based on respondents' recollection of unemployment over the previous year. It is argued that the ratio of this new series to the official series computed from the monthly Current Population Survey provides an index of the "salience" or painfulness of unemployment. Over the past two decades this ratio has declined secularly. About 30 percent of this decrease is due to shifts in the composition of unemployment toward demographic groups with low ratios of remembered to currently reported unemployment. The remainder is due to a secular decline in salience for younger and older people.

Title: A Simple Durable Goods Model
Abstract: The durability of a good has two implications. First, it can be stored in inventories by producers. Second, if it provides a stream of services to consumers, consumers may wish to defer purchases to take advantage of price fluctuations. The most significant conclusion is that the stockpiling of demand that results when consumers defer purchases explains why the variance of output exceeds the variance of sales even if demand shocks are serially independent.

Title: The Distribution of Wealth and Welfare in the Presence of Incomplete Annuity Markets
Abstract: This paper examines the implications of the absence of complete annuity markets on the distribution of wealth and welfare of agents whose saving decisions are obtained under uncertainty regarding the length of their life. The absence of annuities is shown to yield a unique nondegenerate intragenerational distribution of wealth, which is fully characterized. This characterization is then used to evaluate the Pareto desirability of an annuity system. Alternative welfare criteria that can be used when the proposed change has differential impacts on the initial state of subsequent generations are considered.

Title: A Near-Rational Model of the Business Cycle, with Wage and Price Inertia
Abstract: This paper presents a model in which insignificantly suboptimal behavior causes aggregate demand shocks to have significant real effects. The individual loss to agents with inertial price-wage behavior is second-order in terms of the parameter describing the shock, while the effect on real economic variables is first-order. Thus, significant changes in business activity can be generated by anticipated money supply changes provided that some agents are willing to engage in nonmaximizing behavior which results in small losses.

Title: Learning Curve Spillovers and Market Performance
Abstract: This paper examines the effect of learning curve spillovers on market structure and performance. We derive a simple characterization of the "true" marginal cost for a broad class of learning curves, and use calculated examples to show that spillovers substantially undercut the barriers to entry erected by proprietary learning. Unlike the case of cost-reducing research and development, spillovers also tend to improve market performance; the increased efficiency of the industrywide reduction process typically outweighs the decrease in firms' incentives to reduce costs by expanding output.

Title: Producer Surplus and Risk
Abstract: This paper examines the welfare economics of producer behavior under risk aversion. Hicksian, Marshallian, and money equivalent measures are explored. It is found that under decreasing absolute risk aversion, compensating variation is less than the ordinary Marshallian surplus, which is less than the money equivalent measure. Under constant absolute risk aversion all measures coincide. Finally, bounds on compensating and equivalent variations using ordinary producer surplus in a manner analogous to Willige approach in consumer theory under certainty are studied. Similar results hold, mutatis mutandis, for input demands.

Title: A Minsky Crisis
Abstract: A model is developed to illustrate Hyman Minsky's financial crisis theories. A key assumption is that the level of wealth in the economy is determined mac-roeconomically, with the value of firms' assets responding to the state of confidence as reflected by discounted quasi rents on capital. The second assumption is that there is high substitutability between liabilities of firms and money in the public's portfolio. A downward shift in anticipated profits leads wealth to contract and the public to shift portfolio preferences toward money. Interest rates rise, leading to further dampening of expected profits, and a debt-deflation crisis can occur.

Title: Optimal Price and Inventory Adjustment in an Open-Economy Model of the Business Cycle
Abstract: This paper presents a macroeconomic model containing optimizing, inventory-holding firms that is consistent with a number of prominent empirical regularities concerning fluctuations in output, exchange rates, relative prices, and money. Prices are sticky, but they are not predetermined. Still, our model is consistent with exchange rate overshooting in the sense of Dornbusch. Typical sticky-price models allow a divergence between current production and current demand, but this divergence is never allowed to feed back into the model. Our optimal inventory adjustments reconcile divergences between current demand and production, and the inventory stock movements provide expected future dynamics.

Title: A Method for Identifying the Public Good Allocation Process Within a Group
Abstract: This paper develops a method for inferring from observations on a group's collective expenditure whether a cooperative or competitive resource allocation process, or some mixture of the two, has occurred. The method will be applicable to a variety of situations from small collectives such as the family or groupings of nations collaborating in security or trade alliances, to collectives with large numbers. This method will be useful for identifying (1) whether observed outcomes have been efficient, (2) whether costs have been shared equitably, (3) what is the form of collaboration or competition, and (4) what is the degree of "publicness" of the collective good.

Title: Staggered Contracts and the Frequency of Price Adjustment
Abstract: This paper describes a methodology for measuring the frequency of price change in order to test the relevance of assuming prices to be set for discrete periods of time at overlapping intervals. Taylor [1980] has related the frequency of adjustment to the rigidity of the economy in responding to unanticipated events. Estimates of the frequency of price change are computed from data on the component parts of the deflator for personal consumption expenditure. The results show a substantial decrease in the period between price changes during the middle 1960s, and marked fluctuations in the 1970s. The movements suggest changes in the rigidity associated with both changes in general price inflation and changes in the posture of the fiscal and monetary authorities.

Title: Specific Experience, Household Structure, and Intergenerational Transfers: Farm Family Land and Labor Arrangements in Developing Countries
Abstract: An overlapping generations model incorporating returns to specific experience is used to demonstrate how three salient phenomena in land-scarce developing countries—the predominance of intergenerational family extension, cost advantages of family relative to hired labor, and the scarcity of land sales—may be manifestations of an optimal implicit contract between generations that maximizes the gains from farm-specific, experientially obtained knowledge. A method for estimating the contribution to agricultural profits of the farm experience embodies in elderly kin based on a three-year panel of household data from India is proposed and implemented. Implications of the theory for market transactions in land and for family extension are also tested using individual farm data and time-series information on rainfall. Why is the aged husbandman more skillful in his calling than the younger beginner, but because there is a certain uniformity in the operation of the sun, rain, and earth, towards the production of vegetables; and experience teaches the old practitioner the rules, by which this operation is governed and directed?

Title: An Equilibrium Analysis of Optimal Unemployment Insurance and Taxation
Abstract: A two-person, two-period general equilibrium model with uncertainty about second-period labor productivity is developed. The model is used to consider potential welfare (Pareto) gains from both a stylized unemployment insurance system and from a negative income tax system. Welfare gains are possible if individuals are sufficiently homogeneous. When both programs are operated simultaneously, complete insurance is always feasible but is optimal only if the labor supply curve is negatively sloped.

Title: Monetary Policy Regimes, Expected Inflation, and the Response of Interest Rates to Money Announcements
Abstract: This paper examines the response of the term structure of interest rates to weekly money announcements. Estimated responses for both the pre- and post-October 1979 periods are first presented. Then, two competing hypotheses involving the policy anticipations and expected inflation effects are formally specified and compared with the estimated responses. Both hypotheses are found to be consistent with the responses, but they have sharply different implications about the Federal Reserve's short-run monetary policy. By exploiting these different implications, additional empirical results focusing directly on the money stock process support the policy anticipations hypothesis.

Title: Portfolio Crowding-Out, Empirically Estimated
Abstract: This paper tests hypotheses regarding the parameters in investors' asset-demand functions. The hypothesis that federal bonds are closer substitutes for equity than for money implies "portfolio crowding out" by federal borrowing. Regression studies of asset-demand functions have needed to impose prior beliefs to obtain precise and plausible estimates for the parameters. This paper uses a MLE technique that dominates regression in that it makes full use of the constraint that the parameters are not determined arbitrarily but rather are determined by mean-variance optimization on the part of the investor. The striking conclusion is that portfolio effects are close to zero.

Title: The Permanent Income Hypothesis and Consumption Durability: Analysis Based on Japanese Panel Data
Abstract: The permanent income hypothesis with durability of commodities is tested on a panel of about 2,000 Japanese households for several commodity groups. Under static expectations about real interest rates and for some class of utility functions, consumption, which is a distributed lag function of current and past expenditure, follows a martingale. Main empirical results are (i) the durability of commodities usually classified as services is substantial, (ii) the hypothesis applies to about 85 percent of the population consisting of wage earners, and (iii) income changes explain only a small fraction of the movements in expenditure.

Title: Wages and Employment in a Segmented Labor Market
Abstract: This paper analyzes the impact of business cycle fluctuations on a labor market segmented into a unionized primary sector and a "competitive" secondary sector. Either permanent or temporary changes in real aggregate demand are shown to widen the intersectoral wage differential in recession and, under reasonable specifications of key parameters, to cause greater fluctuations of primary-sector employment than secondary-sector employment. This pattern agrees with the stylized facts of the U. S. economy.

Title: Market Power in a Securities Market with Endogenous Information
Abstract: A rational expectations model of a securities market is developed in which one agent, the monopolist, behaves like a Stackelberg leader and other agents behave competitively. Two information structures, one in which each agent has identical information and the other in which each agent has independent information are examined. Equilibrium is shown to exist and is characterized in both cases, but monopoly has a significant effect on the equilibrium only in the latter. The optimal strategy of the Stackelberg leader is also studied, and it is shown that he will not randomize his strategy by adding white noise to his demand function, even though this obfuscates the information content of the market price.

Title: The Optimal Degree of Commitment to an Intermediate Monetary Target
Abstract: Society can sometimes make itself better off by appointing a central banker who does not share the social objective function, but instead places "too large" a weight on inflation-rate stabilization relative to employment stabilization. Although having such an agent head the central bank reduces the time-consistent rate of inflation, it suboptimally raises the variance of employment when supply shocks are large. Using an envelope theorem, we show that the ideal agent places a large, but finite, weight on inflation. The analysis also provides a new framework for choosing among alternative intermediate monetary targets.

Title: A History of Mechanization in the Cotton South: The Institutional Hypothesis
Abstract: The Cotton South has always lagged behind the rest of American agriculture in the use and development of large-scale machinery. This paper formalizes an idea often found in the historical literature in loosely specified form which argues that the institutional structure of the southern plantation economy caused this technological inertia. In particular, the Institutional Hypothesis argues that the annual labor contracts used to secure plantation labor discouraged partial mechanization and inventive activity by redirecting the impact of higher labor costs away from the development and adoption of labor saving machinery and toward the adoption of small unmechanizable tenancies. This hypothesis is modeled, and supporting evidence is presented. Its larger implications are also discussed.

Title: Expectational Stability and the Multiple Equilibria Problem in Linear Rational Expectations Models
Abstract: Linear models involving expectations of future endogenous variables generally have multiple rational expectations equilibria. This paper investigates the stability of solutions in the disequilibrium sense of whether, given a small deviation of expectations functions from some rational expectations equilibrium, the system returns to that solution under a natural revision rule. Weak and strong local stability are distinguished. Stability conditions are calculated for a simple general linear model and applied to two macroeconomic examples. In some cases there is a unique stable equilibrium. In other cases a continuum of equilibria forms a weakly but not strongly stable class.

Title: Comparative Dynamics in Aggregate Models of Optimal Capital Accumulation
Abstract: The hypothesis that capital increases at each time in response to an increase in the discount factor is explored for a class of aggregate models of optimal accumulation. When the optimal program is monotonic, capital is shown to increase with an increase in the discount factor. A counterexample in the case of oscillating programs is discussed. An application of the monotone case is given for an adjustment cost model of the firm.

Title: Competitive Value when Only Labor is Scarce
Abstract: Even when only labor is scarce, the validity of a labor theory of value depends on reducing all labor to a homogeneous equivalent. The various implicit or explicit efforts of Smith, Ricardo, and Marx to do so are shown to fail on more counts than previously recognized. The labor theory is also shown to fail when laborers are not indifferent among alternative occupations.

Title: Resale Price Maintenance and Forward Integration into a Monopolistically Competitive Industry
Abstract: In this paper we adopt the CES model of product differentiation for the downstream stage of the industry. With an upstream monopolist we first show that resale price maintenance is equivalent to forward integration and that both increase profits. Then we demonstrate that forward integration by an upstream monopolist will reduce welfare for the industry. Prices fall with forward integration, but the integrating firm contracts the number of downstream subsidiaries so drastically that the reduced diversity more than offsets the gains from lower prices.

Title: The Heckscher-Ohlin-Samuelson Model with Implicit Contracts
Abstract: In a world with multiplicative production uncertainty and implicit labor contracts, we show that the Rybczynski theorem retains its validity; therefore the quantity version of the Heckscher-Ohlin theorem survives as well. We also show that the Stolper-Samuelson theorem may not hold. A small increase in the price of the capital-intensive good may benefit labor. We derive a strong version of the factor price equalization theorem that shows free trade tends to equalize sector-specific unemployment rates and sector-specific factor prices across countries. Finally, we relate trade patterns to international differences in the degree of risk aversion.
