Title: Menu Auctions, Resource Allocation, and Economic Influence
Abstract: In many examples of competitive bidding (e.g., government construction contracting) the relevant object is either partially divisible or ill-defined, in contrast to much of the recent theoretical work on auctions. In this paper we consider a more general class of auctions, in which bidders name a "menu" of offers for various possible actions (allocations) available to the auctioneer. We focus upon "first-price" menu auctions under the assumption of complete information, and show that, for an attractive refinement of the set of Nash Equilibria, an efficient action always results. Our model also has application to situations of economic influence, in which interested parties independently attempt to influence a decision-maker's action.

Title: Cooperation in Ongoing Organizations
Abstract: This paper argues that overlapping games can provide a natural theory of long-lived organizations. It shows that participation in organizations of infinite duration changes the incentives of agents with finite lives, and will induce more cooperation than a static model would predict. After developing the general theory, we apply it to the description of career paths in organizations and show that it can be optimal to give the youngest workers the most arduous tasks.

Title: Nonlinear Prices and the Regulated Firm
Abstract: This paper examines the problem of a regulated utility that sells output according to a nonlinear price schedule. Three results are obtained. First, rate-of-return regulation lowers the price schedule charged by the firm along its entire length. Second, some units of output will always be sold at a marginal price below true marginal cost. Third, a move from linear to nonlinear prices at a given fair rate-of-return can lead to an unambiguous increase in welfare.

Title: Exchange Markets: A Welfare Comparison of Market Maker and Walrasian Systems
Abstract: This paper compares the social welfare of a simple economy with asymmetric information under two different exchange market structures, Walrasian and the monopolistic, price-setting schemes. It is found that the relative efficiency depends on the nature of uncertainties in the economy. For some environments, the price-setting allocation with a market maker Pareto dominates the rational expectations equilibrium allocation in a competitive market. This finding provides a justification for the existence of the market maker system, which is the predominant institutional arrangement in many exchange markets.

Title: Supply Shocks and Price Adjustment in the World Oil Market
Abstract: Understanding the impacts of transitory oil supply shocks on world oil prices is crucial to the evaluation of the economic impacts of shocks and the design of policy responses to address those impacts. This paper integrates short-run and long-run approaches to oil price determination, with particular emphasis on the "two-price" structure of the world oil market—with coexisting short-term "spot" prices and long-term "contract" prices. Even transitory shocks are shown to exhibit persistence effects on long-term prices. Some implications for econometric models of the relationship between spot and contract prices are discussed.

Title: Public and Private Returns from Joint Venture Research: An Example from Agriculture
Abstract: Public research institutions are turning increasingly to the private sector for additional financial support. Such a trend, in the short run, lessens the need for public research expenditures, but may, in the long run, prove to be very costly to the economy as a whole. This is because private funding increases the chance that the direction of research will shift so that private benefits are enhanced. Such a shift is especially costly if public research funds are then not forthcoming that would have the potential of producing the maximum level of benefits to the economy as a whole. A case study of Canadian barley research is used to illustrate this problem.

Title: Vertical Integration: Scale Distortions, Partial Integration, and the Direction of Price Change
Abstract: Two new features are introduced in a standard model of forward vertical integration by an intermediate good monopolist into a contestable downstream industry. First, U-shaped average costs replace constant returns in the downstream industry. Second, the effect of subjecting the monopolist to the pressure of upstream entry is explored. It is found that monopoly pricing of the intermediate good can distort the scale as well as the input proportions of the downstream firms. Either distortion leads to integration, but here integration may be partial rather than full. Prices rise with partial integration when there is no upstream entry, but prices fall when upstream entry is free.

Title: Sex Discrimination and Product Market Competition: The Case of the Banking Industry
Abstract: This paper examines the relationship between product market competition and employment discrimination using an especially constructed data set that links microeconomic data on female employment with measures of market concentration in the banking industry. The use of firm-specific data drawn from this one industry allows estimation of this relationship in a manner that avoids the problems of interindustry differences that have troubled previous studies. The results provide strong support for a negative relationship between market concentration and the relative employment of women. Further, we find that individual market shares are unrelated to female employment, suggesting that the relationship is due primarily to differences across markets rather than individual firms.

Title: The Changing Behavior of the Term Structure of Interest Rates
Abstract: We reexamine the expectations theory of the term structure using data at the short end of the maturity spectrum. We find that prior to the founding of the Federal Reserve System in 1915, the spread between long rates and short rates has substantial predictive power for the path of interest rates; after 1915, however, the spread contains much less predictive power. We then show that the short rate is approximately a random walk after the founding of the Fed but not before. This latter fact, coupled with even slight variation in the term premium, can explain the observed change in 1915 in the performance of the expectations theory. We suggest that the random walk character of the short rate may be attributable to the Federal Reserve's commitment to stabilizing interest rates.

Title: Externalities in Economies with Imperfect Information and Incomplete Markets
Abstract: This paper presents a simple, general framework for analyzing externalities in economies with incomplete markets and imperfect information. By identifying the pecuniary effects of these externalities that net out, the paper simplifies the problem of determining when tax interventions are Pareto improving. The approach indicates that such tax interventions almost always exist and that equilibria in situations of imperfect information are rarely constrained Pareto optima. It can also lead to simple tests, based on readily observable indicators of the efficacy of particular tax policies in situations involving adverse selection, signaling, moral hazard, incomplete contingent claims markets, and queue rationing equilibria.

Title: Monopolistic Competition with Experience Goods
Abstract: This paper constructs a model of monopolistic competition where consumers cannot directly verify product quality prior to an initial purchase. Instead, consumers base initial purchases on observed prices, which perfectly signal firms' qualities both in and out of equilibrium. Equilibrium quality is less than efficient, but generally bounded away from the minimum quality. With free entry, observable product variety exceeds what would prevail with perfect information. As repeat purchases become large relative to initial purchases, or as firms become small relative to the size of the market, equilibrium product quality rises, and the market converges to the full information equilibrium.

Title: Controlling Preferences for Lotteries on Units of Experimental Exchange
Abstract: In an experimental setting when outcomes are stochastically related to actions, predictions of equilibrium behavior depend not only on the participants' preference orderings of outcomes, but also on their orderings of lotteries on outcomes as well. We introduce and test a reward structure that can be utilized in any experimental setting to allow the experimenter to decree beforehand the subjects' preferences for lotteries on experimental outcomes. We show analytically that the proposed reward structure can induce subjects to behave as if they have the decreed preference function defined on experimental outcomes. Empirical tests using two different choice settings provide evidence to support this ability to control preferences.

Title: Divisionalization and Entry Deterrence
Abstract: This paper assumes that incumbent firms can create new independent divisions more cheaply than potential entrants, who must incur the additional overhead costs of new entry. The main theoretical result is that such divisionalization ability leads perfectly informed incumbents to preempt all rational entry into their industries. In contrast, existing models of entry deterrence imply that informed incumbents, even those with steadily decreasing average costs, will often allow rational entry. Our result may explain why successful, large-scale entry by firms with no informational advantage is extremely rare. The use of divisions to preempt entry may also explain why large firms in high-profit oligopolies often divisionalize, allowing their divisions to compete freely despite the negative pecuniary externality that each division imposes on others.

Title: Gasoline Prices and the Used Automobile Market: A Rational Expectations Asset Price Approach
Abstract: This paper examines the impact of changes in gasoline price expectations on the market values of used automobiles. An asset model of automobile valuation is used to relate year-to-year changes in market values to changes in the present discounted value of gasoline expenses. Econometric evidence from data covering the years 1972 through 1981 substantially confirms the hypothesis of the model that a gasoline price shock causes relative price changes across automobile types in proportion to the differences in their rates of fuel consumption.

Title: Earnings and Pension Compensation: The Effect of Eligibility
Abstract: Pension compensation is shown to rise with age and tenure until the worker becomes eligible to receive benefits. At this point, pension compensation drops sharply. If workers are paid their marginal product in each period, earnings grow at a lower rate prior to eligibility but must increase when the worker reaches the age of eligibility. This hypothesis is tested using data from the Retirement History Study, and earnings are found to rise significantly after eligibility. This finding supports the concept of spot market compensation and is in direct conflict with the predictions of Lazear-type lifetime contracts.

Title: A Language Theory of Discrimination
Abstract: Any advanced industrial society is composed of a number of speech communities with different verbal and nonverbal languages. In particular, in the United States blacks and whites and men and women have sharply differing methods of speaking and listening. This paper develops a model in which people can only work together if they "speak" the same language and in which it is costly to learn a second language. The competitive market will tend to minimize communication through segregation, but if interaction is required, the cost will be borne by the minority. A number of nontrivial predictions are derived from the model.

Title: Optimal Trade and Industrial Policy Under Oligopoly
Abstract: We analyze the welfare effects of trade and industrial policy under oligopoly, and characterize optimal intervention under a variety of assumptions about market structure and conduct. When all output is exported, optimal policy with a single home firm depends on the difference between foreign firms' actual responses to the home firm's actions and the responses that the home firm conjectures. A subsidy often is indicated for Cournot behavior, but a tax generally is optimal if firms engage in Bertrand competition. If conjectures are "consistent," free trade is optimal. With domestic consumption, intervention can raise national welfare by reducing the deviation of price from marginal cost.

Title: Can the Production Smoothing Model of Inventory Behavior be Saved?
Abstract: The production smoothing model of inventory behavior has a long and venerable history and theoretical foundations that seem very strong. Yet certain overwhelming facts seem not only to defy explanation within the production smoothing framework, but actually to argue that the basic idea of production smoothing is all wrong. Most prominent among these is the fact that the variance of detrended production exceeds the variance of detrended sales. This paper first documents the stylized facts. Then it derives the production smoothing model rigorously and explains how the model can be amended to make it consistent with the facts. Finally, it reviews the theoretical and empirical evidence and tries to draw some tentative conclusions.

Title: The Allocation of Credit and Financial Collapse
Abstract: This paper examines the allocation of credit in a market in which borrowers have greater information concerning their own riskiness than do lenders. It illustrates that (1) the allocation of credit is inefficient and at times can be improved by government intervention, and (2) small changes in the exogenous risk-free interest rate can cause large (discontinuous) changes in the allocation of credit and the efficiency of the market equilibrium. These conclusions suggests a role for government as the lender of last resort.

Title: Fees Versus Royalties and the Private Value of a Patent
Abstract: We compare how much profit an owner of a patented cost-reducing invention can realize by licensing it to an oligopolistic industry producing a homogeneous product, by means of a fixed fee or a per unit royalty. Our analysis is conducted in terms of a noncooperative game involving n + 1 players: the inventor and the n firms. In this game the inventor acts as a Stackelberg leader, and it has a unique subgame perfect equilibrium in pure strategies. It is shown that licensing by means of a fixed fee is superior to licensing by means of a royalty for both the inventor and consumers. Only a "drastic" innovation is licensed to a single producer.

Title: True Monopolistic Competition as a Result of Imperfect Information
Abstract: The paper restates Hart's [1985a, 1985b] definition of large group monopolistic competition, distinguishes it from oligopolistic competition, and raises the question of whether there are reasonable circumstances that give rise to true monopolistic competition as defined. The purpose is to show that consumers' imperfect information may create conditions that will turn an otherwise oligopolistic market into a truly monopolistically competitive one.

Title: The Dynamic Demand for Capital and Labor
Abstract: A model of the dynamically interrelated demand for capital and labor is specified and estimated. The estimates are of the first-order conditions of the firm's problem rather than of the closed-form decision rules. This use of the first-order conditions allows a random rate of return and a flexible specification of the technology. The estimates do not imply the very slow rates of adjustment displayed in other, related estimates of the demand for capital. Because adjustment is estimated to be rapid, there is, contrary to the standard view, scope for factor prices to affect investment at relatively high frequencies.

Title: The Wage Price Spiral
Abstract: This paper rehabilitates the old wage price spiral. It shows that, after an increase in aggregate demand, the process of adjustment of nominal prices and nominal wages results from attempts by workers to maintain or increase their real wage and by firms to maintain or increase their markups of prices over wages. Under continuous price and wage setting, the process of adjustment would be instantaneous; under staggering of price and wage decisions, the adjustment takes time. The more inflexible real wages and markups are to shifts in demand, the higher is the degree of price level inertia, and the longer lasting are the effects of aggregate demand on output.

Title: How to License Intangible Property
Abstract: We examine the optimal licensing strategy of a research lab selling to firms who are product market competitors. We consider an independent lab as well as a research joint venture. We show that (1) demands are interdependent and hence the standard price mechanism is not the profit-maximizing licensing strategy; (2) the seller's incentives to develop the innovation may be excessive; (3) the seller's incentives to disseminate the innovation typically are too low; (4) larger ventures are less likely to develop the innovation, and more likely to restrict its dissemination in those cases where development occurs; and (5) a downstream firm that is not a member of the research venture is worse off as a result of the innovation.

Title: Export Performance and Export-Import Linkage Requirements
Abstract: This paper examines the resource allocation effects of two policies widely employed by developing countries to improve their trade balances. Compared to free-trade, both export performance and export-import linkage policies may actually worsen the balance of trade unless they are coupled with an import barrier on final goods. Even with such barriers, an export-import linkage policy still may not cause the trade balance to improve. The effects of both policies on a number of domestic variables are discussed. Profit and output of domestic exporters can increase under trade performance policies.

Title: Human Capital Versus Sorting: The Effects of Compulsory Attendance Laws
Abstract: Under the educational sorting hypothesis a state compulsory school attendance law will increase the educational attainment of high-ability workers who are not directly affected by the law. Under the human capital hypothesis such laws affect only those individuals whose behavior is directly constrained. We find that compulsory attendance laws do increase enrollment rates in age groups they do not affect directly. Thus, our results contradict the human capital hypothesis and are consistent with the sorting hypothesis.

Title: General Equilibrium Wage and Price Distributions
Abstract: This paper extends models of search market equilibrium to incorporate general-equilibrium considerations. The model we treat is one with a single product market and a single labor market. An equilibrium distribution of prices and wages is the result of optimal price- and wage-setting behavior by firms in conjunction with optimal search by individuals. We prove the existence of a degenerate equilibrium and of a two-point dispersion equilibrium.

Title: The Value of Waiting to Invest
Abstract: This paper studies the optimal timing of investment in an irreversible project where the benefits from the project and the investment cost follow continuous-time stochastic processes. The optimal investment rule and an explicit formula for the value of the option to invest are derived, assuming that the option is valued by risk-averse investors who are well diversified. The same analysis is applied to the scrapping decision. Simulations show that this option value can be significant, and that for reasonable parameter values it is optimal to wait until benefits are twice the investment costs.

Title: An Economic Theory of Planned Obsolescence
Abstract: "Planned Obsolescence" is the production of goods with uneconomically short useful lives so that customers will have to make repeat purchases. However, rational customers will pay for only the present value of the future services of a product. Therefore, profit maximization seemingly implies producing any given flow of services as cheaply as possible, with production involving efficient useful lives. This paper shows why this analysis is incomplete and therefore incorrect. Monopolists are shown to desire uneconomically short useful lives for their goods. Oligopolists have the monopolist's incentive for short lives as well as a second incentive that may either increase or decrease their chosen durability. However, oligopolists can generally gain by colluding to reduce durability and increase rentals relative to sales. Some evidence is presented that appears to be generally consistent with the predictions of the theory.

Title: Equality of Resources Implies Equality of Welfare
Abstract: If one is an egalitarian, should one try to equalize resources available to agents, or to equalize their welfares? With a suitably general conception of what resources are, these two conceptions cannot be distinguished. An allocation mechanism is defined on a space of economies, and is required to satisfy various axioms that are necessary conditions for "equalizing resources" among a population. The unique mechanism satisfying these axioms on a large domain of economies is the one that allocates commodities so as to equalize utilities of the agents. Methodologically, the theorem is a generalization of bargaining theory because the mechanisms are defined on commodity space.

Title: Bond and Stock Returns in a Simple Exchange Model
Abstract: This paper studies asset pricing in a general equilibrium representative agent exchange model. The assumptions of isoelastic period utility and lognormal endowment allow the derivation of closed-form solutions for asset returns without restricting the serial correlation of the log endowment. Risk premiums on stocks and real bonds are found to be simple functions of relative risk aversion, the variance of the log endowment innovation, and the weights in the moving average representation of the log endowment. The paper analyzes the sign of term premiums, the size of the equity premium, and the effect of taste shocks on asset prices.

Title: The Multinational Firm
Abstract: Direct investment is incorporated into a simple general equilibrium model of international trade. The analysis focuses on an attempt to endogenize the internalization decision. It is argued that a reasonable approach assumes that arm's length contracts must be "simple" so that "complex" arrangements require internalization. The model relates direct investment to the degree of underlying uncertainty and to fundamental trade determinants, such as relative factor endowments. The behavior of the model contrasts sharply with that of the Markusen-Helpman model, which takes internalization for granted.

Title: Managerial Incentives and Capital Management
Abstract: The paper shows how career concerns rather than effort aversion can induce a natural incongruity in risk preferences between managers and superiors. A model, based on learning about managerial talent, is developed to study second-best contractual remedies. We show that the optimal wage contract is an option of the value of the manager's human capital for insurance reasons and that consequently rationing of capital is often required to counterbalance the manager's resulting incentive to overinvest. Rationing is strictly superior to price decentralization, offering one reason for the prevalence of centralized capital budgeting procedures.
