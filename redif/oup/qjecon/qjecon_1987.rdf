Title: Confidence and the Real Value of Money in an Overlapping Generations Economy
Abstract: We demonstrate that stochastic bubbles which have a constant, exogenous, probability of collapsing may exist, in general equilibrium, on an intrinsically useless and unbacked asset (money). This may happen provided that the probability q that the bubble will persist next period is large enough and exceeds a threshold level Q which we call the minimum rate of confidence. This condition is always violated when the economy without bubble is dynamically efficient. It is more likely to be satisfied, in dynamically inefficient economies, the larger the "size" of the inefficiency (as measured by the excess of the growth rate over the no-bubble interest rate). We study both exchange and production economies.

Title: Cooperation, Productivity, and Profit Sharing
Abstract: Firm-specific assets generate an ex post bargaining problem over surplus-division, and rational workers may collude to obtain a surplus-share in nonpecuniary form through restriction of effort. Conversely, profit sharing should motivate cooperation to increase productivity when work organization facilitates interaction and horizontal monitoring, since productive effort yields positive externalities to workers under contractual surplus sharing. In simultaneous Tobit estimates we find a strong influence of profit sharing on factor productivity in a sample of medium-sized metalworking capitalist firms in West Germany. Proxies for human capital and organizational factors were included.

Title: Incomplete Information Bargaining with Outside Opportunities
Abstract: We consider two kinds of "outside opportunity" that a seller of an indivisible good might have: selling to a different buyer and consuming the good herself. In both models the seller is uncertain about the buyer's valuation, and becomes more pessimistic over time. When the seller becomes sufficiently pessimistic, she prefers the outside opportunity, so she will not bargain indefinitely with the current buyer. Despite the resulting finite-horizon nature of negotiations, the link between the buyer's willingness to accept an offer and the seller's eagerness to go "outside" generates multiple equilibria.

Title: The Costs of Worker Displacement
Abstract: This study identifies part of the social loss attendant upon displacement as the remaining value of the assets specific to the severed employment relationship. A bargaining model is used to link wage-tenure profiles to the amount of information firms and workers possess about the duration of that relationship. If information is good, the profile will flatten as displacement approaches. Using PSID data for workers separated between 1977 and 1981, wage-tenure profiles are found not to change. This suggests that either workers, or both firms and workers, are surprised by the displacement. The present value of that part of the social loss attributable to the worker's share of firm-specific capital is around $7,000 (1980 dollars).

Title: The Relation between Return and Income
Abstract: This paper presents evidence that the corporate stock owned by high-income investors appreciates substantially faster than the stock owned by investors with lower incomes. The evidence indicates that the differences are large and that they have persisted for a long period of time. Some potential explanations of this phenomenon are discussed, and it seems that the best explanation is that the rich have a higher tendency to invest in risky stock.

Title: The Welfare Cost of Rationing-By-Queuing Across Markets: Theory and Estimates from the U. S. Gasoline Crises
Abstract: Governments sometimes impose price controls and nonprice rationing-by-queuing. Profit-seeking firms occasionally ration by putting their customers on "allocation." Following Barzel [1974] and Deacon and Sonstelie [1985], we take the decision to ration as a given and analyze it, employing standard microeconomics and applied welfare economics. This paper adds to the literature by focusing on optimally rationing a good across markets. Further, we estimate the actual welfare cost of improper allocation across markets in the U. S. gasoline crises of 1973–1974 and 1979.

Title: Price Scissors and the Structure of the Economy
Abstract: This paper undertakes three sets of tasks: (i) it analyzes positive and normative aspects of price scissors (the domestic terms of trade between agriculture and industry) within nonsocialist as well as socialist LDCs. The critical role of the economy's institutional features (e.g., external trade environment, wage and income determination, and wage-productivity effects) is emphasized. Certain aspects of the Soviet Industrialization Debate and subsequent collectivization are interpreted, (ii) It develops simple rules to delineate who gains and who loses (within agriculture) from changes in terms of trade, (iii) It presents powerful (and informationally parsimonious) rules for Pareto-improving price reforms for cash crops and agricultural inputs.

Title: Signaling Games and Stable Equilibria
Abstract: Games in which one party conveys private information to a second through messages typically admit large numbers of sequential equilibria, as the second party may entertain a wealth of beliefs in response to out-of-equilibrium messages. By restricting those out-of-equilibrium beliefs, one can sometimes eliminate many unintuitive equilibria. We present a number of formal restrictions of this sort, investigate their behavior in specific examples, and relate these restrictions to Kohlberg and Mertens' notion of stability.

Title: Information, Incentives, and Organizational Mode
Abstract: We examine the choice of organizational mode for a two-stage production process wherein cost realizations at each stage are observed only by the producing party. When these costs are positively correlated, the principal prefers to undertake second-stage production herself. When the correlation is negative and sufficiently small, she will prefer that the agent who performs the first stage also perform the second. For large negative correlation, either mode might be preferred. When costs are uncorrelated, the principal is indifferent between modes.

Title: Risk and Capital Accumulation in a Small Open Economy
Abstract: This paper examines the dynamics of capital accumulation in a small open economy where home capital is risky and consumers are risk-averse. It is assumed that the economy participates in perfect international bond markets but that risky home capital is held by domestic residents only. Under these assumptions the rate of investment is no longer independent of the saving rate, and they are positively related. As a result, a rise in savings does not increase foreign investment by the same amount but by less, and in some situations the quantity of foreign assets may even decrease.

Title: Too Much Investment: A Problem of Asymmetric Information
Abstract: This paper shows that under plausible assumptions, the inability of lenders to discover all of the relevant characteristics of borrowers results in investment in excess of the socially efficient level. Raising the rate of interest above the free market level will restore optimality. This conflicts with generally held views and is contrasted with the Stiglitz-Weiss model. It is shown that the assumptions which yield overinvestment support debt as the equilibrium method of finance. However, under the Stiglitz-Weiss assumptions, used to derive an underinvestment result, equity is shown to be the equilibrium method of finance.

Title: Testing the Response of Consumption to Income Changes with (Noisy) Panel Data
Abstract: This paper tests the rational expectations lifecycle model of consumption against (i) a Keynesian model and (ii) the rational expectations lifecycle model with imperfect capital markets. The tests are based upon the relative responsiveness of consumption to income changes that can be predicted from past information and income changes that cannot be predicted. The tests allow for measurement error in income. The results reject the Keynesian model and generally support the lifecycle model. But the results are not sufficiently precise to rule out the possibility that some households are liquidity constrained. Measurement error has a strong influence on the relationship between consumption and income.

Title: Eating, Drinking, Smoking, and Testing the Lifecycle Hypothesis
Abstract: This paper presents some evidence on expenditure patterns over the lifecycle that has a direct bearing on the question of whether households are significantly credit constrained. Our particular test looks at the consumption of food, alcoholic beverages, and tobacco to see whether the consumption of the latter two "goods" falls as couples have children. The latter usually involves a decrease in household current income and an increase in needs. If households are not credit constrained, they should maintain their consumption of alcoholic beverages and tobacco. We find no significant decrease in the consumption of these goods.

Title: Can Union Labor Ever Cost Less?
Abstract: This paper examines the effect of unions on efficiency by estimating cost function systems over three different sets of construction projects. The results show that union contractors have greater economies of scale. This gives them a cost advantage in large commercial office buildings, but in school and hospital construction, nonunion contractors have lower costs at all output levels. Despite the cost differences, profits for nonunion contractors in school and hospital construction are no higher than those for union contractors because the burden of higher union costs is shifted to buyers.

Title: Markets with Consumer Switching Costs
Abstract: Ex ante homogeneous products may, after the purchase of one of them, be ex post differentiated by switching costs including learning costs, transaction costs, or "artificial" costs imposed by firms, such as repeat-purchase discounts. The nonco-operative equilibrium in an oligopoly with switching costs may be the same as the collusive outcome in an otherwise identical market without switching costs. However, the prospect of future collusive profits leads to vigorous competition for market share in the early stages of a market's development. The model thus explains the emphasis placed on market share as a goal of corporate strategy.

Abstract: The paper presents a "micro" shock explanation of aggregate risk. Shocks are independent over agents, and equilibria are always unique. It is shown that any amount of aggregate risk can be generated by games in which shocks to players are independent. Explicit examples are given, some of which elaborate on examples in the literature. Implications are drawn for factor-analytic methods of extracting aggregate shocks.

Title: Job Discrimination, Market Forces, and the Invisibility Hypothesis
Abstract: The Invisibility Hypothesis holds that the job skills of disadvantaged workers are not easily discovered by potential new employers, but that promotion enhances visibility and alleviates this problem. Then, at a competitive labor market equilibrium, firms profit by hiding talented disadvantaged workers in low-level jobs. Consequently, those workers are paid less on average and promoted less often than others with the same education and ability. As a result of the inefficient and discriminatory wage and promotion policies, disadvantaged workers experience lower returns to investments in human capital than other workers.

Abstract: This paper considers a simple general equilibrium model that contains two types of workers with differing levels of ability and a social-welfare-maximizing government. The paper shows that social welfare can sometimes be increased by supplementing an optimal linear income tax with a minimum wage, but that social welfare can never be increased by supplementing an optimal nonlinear income tax with a minimum wage.

Abstract: A computer simulation model in the tradition of evolutionary models of technical change is developed in this paper. It focuses on R&amp;D competition in new product introductions and is based on data for the U. S. pharmaceutical industry during the 1970s. The sensitivity of innovation levels to the rate of generic competition, regulatory review time, and patent life is examined in the computer simulation experiments. These factors are found to have significant long-run effects on industry structure and innovation levels.

Title: Labor Contracts under Asymmetric Information When Workers are Free to Quit
Abstract: This paper examines the impact of workers' ability to quit on the performance of labor contracts between workers and privately informed firms. While the need to induce workers to remain with the firm necessarily lowers total welfare, the effect on employment levels is to reduce the magnitude of the inefficiency due to asymmetric information, whether this inefficiency is under- or overemployment. The model predicts that employment distortions increase with the strength of lock-in effects on workers, a prediction which contrasts with the results of efficiency wage models and which may help in empirical testing of labor contract theory.

One may test for speculative bubbles, or fads, by testing whether the two estimates are the same. When the test is applied to some annual U. S. stock market data, the data usually reject the null hypothesis of no bubbles. The test is of general interest, since it may be applied to a wide class of linear rational expectations models.

Title: Middlemen
Abstract: We study a model of a market with three types of agents: sellers, buyers, and middlemen. Buyers and sellers can trade directly or indirectly through the middlemen. The analysis focuses on steady state situations in which the numbers of agents of the different types and hence the trading opportunities are constant over time. The paper provides a framework for analyzing the activity of middlemen and the endogenous determination of the extent of that activity. It highlights the relations between the trading procedure and the distribution of the gains from trade.

Title: Optimum Product Diversity and the Incentives for Entry in Natural Oligopolies
Abstract: This paper concerns the classification of biases in the set of produced varieties in a monopolistically competitive equilibrium in the natural oligopoly setting. That is, we analyze the relationship between the set of produced goods in equilibrium when fixed costs are small and the set of produced goods by a social planner when fixed costs equal zero. It is shown that if all of the goods are substitutes, there are never too few varieties, and there may be too many. Conversely, if the goods are all complementary, there are never too many, and there may be too few.

Title: Import Quotas and the Product Cycle
Abstract: This paper uses a dynamic general equilibrium model of the product cycle in North-South trade to analyze the short-run and long-run effects of import quotas imposed in the North on manufactured goods from the South. The short-run effects are predictable: real wages in the North may rise as a result of the protection, though even this is not certain if the South captures the quota rents. The long-run effect of the protection is to unambiguously reduce real wages in the North because the quotas artificially increase production costs in the North relative to the South, accelerating the transfer of technology and capital from North to South.

Title: The Economics of Export-Performance Requirements
Abstract: This paper analyzes the resource-allocation and welfare effects of export-performance requirements imposed on foreign investors. It argues that a satisfactory analysis must consider the presence of tariff distortions and oligopolistic behavior in host-country markets. These create a second-best environment in which an evaluation of the welfare effects of such requirements is no longer straightforward. It is concluded that export requirements can improve home welfare by reducing payments to foreign capital, reducing the output of commodities which are being overproduced, and shifting profits toward domestically owned firms.

Title: Macroeconomic Policy in a Two-Party System as a Repeated Game
Abstract: This paper considers the interaction of two parties with different objectives concerning inflation and unemployment and rational and forward-looking wage-setters. If discretionary policies are followed, an economic cycle related to the political cycle results in equilibrium. This cycle is significantly different from the traditional "political business cycle." Reputational mechanisms due to the repeated interaction of the two parties and the public or commitments to a common policy rule can improve upon the discretionary outcome by reducing or eliminating the magnitude of the economic fluctuations.

Title: Menu Costs and the Neutrality of Money
Abstract: A model of endogenous price adjustment under money growth is presented. Firms follow (s,S) pricing policies, and price revisions are imperfectly synchronized. In the aggregate, price stickiness disappears, and money is neutral. The connection between firm price adjustment and relative price variability in the presence of monetary growth is also investigated. The results contrast with those obtained in models with exogenous fixed timing of price adjustment.

Title: Heterogeneous Preferences, Compensating Wage Differentials, and Comparable Worth
Abstract: This paper sets up a general equilibrium model of a world of heterogeneous jobs and heterogeneous tastes, and uses the model to (i) analyze the effects of employer discrimination and (ii) predict the likely consequences of requiring "equal pay for jobs of comparable worth." It shows that employment of both women and men is likely to fall as a result of comparable worth. It also shows that when individuals' tastes are heterogeneous, neither comparable worth nor the simple model of compensating differentials on which it is based provides useful insights into wage determination. In particular, when tastes are heterogeneous, there is no reason to expect equal pay for jobs of "comparable worth" even in the absence of employer discrimination.

Title: Monopoly and Quality Distortion: Effects and Remedies
Abstract: A monopolist that sells in a market in which consumers differ in their willingness to pay for quality will distort and enlarge the range of products offered for sale. We examine the positive and normative impacts of remedies used to counteract such distortions. For the case of a price ceiling, the monopolist improves quality at the low quality end of the market, offsetting the distortion induced by the unregulated exercise of monopoly power. Social welfare can be shown to increase for a sufficiently slight degree of price regulation. For minimum quality standards, the social welfare implications are ambiguous because the standards may exclude some consumers from the market.

Title: The Pure Compensation Problem: Egalitarianism Versus Laissez-Fairism
Abstract: A binary choice problem with side-payments and quasi-linear utilities is considered. We study two compensation rules, called social choice functions. The egalitarian rule divides equally the surplus above the average utility level. The laissez-faire rule chooses an efficient decision but performs no transfer. Egalitarianism is characterized by a monotonicity axiom called Agreement: no two agents ever disagree in comparing two distinct preferences of a third one. Laissez-fairism is characterized by the No Subsidy axiom: a coalition would not be worse off if the other agents were not present.

Title: "Making Book Against Oneself," the Independence Axiom, and Nonlinear Utility Theory
Abstract: An individual with known preferences over lotteries can be led to accept random wealth distributions different from his initial endowment by a sequential process in which some uncertainty is resolved and he is offered a new lottery in place of the remaining uncertainty. This paper examines the restrictions that can be placed on an individual's preferences by axioms that stipulate that such a process not be able to generate a new wealth distribution that is prima facie inferior to the original. The relationship of these axioms to the independence axiom of von Neumann and Morgenstern and to the quasi convexity of preferences in the wealth distribution are explored.

Title: The Cyclical Component of U. S. Economic Activity
Abstract: Quarterly data on industrial production and deflated gross national product in the United States from 1947 through 1985 are decomposed into independent nonstationary trend and stationary cycle components using Kalman filtering and smoothing techniques. Estimates of the model parameters imply that at least half of the quarterly innovation in U. S. economic activity can be attributed to a stationary cyclical component that persists over periods of time as long as five years. This finding is inconsistent with the hypothesis that most of the apparent variation in U. S. economic activity can be attributed to a nonstationary trend component.

Title: Labor Turnover, Job-Specific Skills, and Efficiency in a Search Model
Abstract: This paper analyzes the implications for turnover of costly job-specific training. The presence of such costs in a search model implies that turnover decisions reduce the value of potential trades that are available to other market participants. There is too much turnover because of this external effect, and, therefore, too much retraining. When the investment in job training is endogenous, inefficient turnover again occurs, and the investment in specific skills is inefficiently high. The interactions between skill acquisition and turnover imply that it is essentially impossible for a brokerage institution to achieve efficiency.

Title: Stabilization with Exchange Rate Management
Abstract: Stabilization programs in open economies typically consist of two stages. In the first stage the rate of currency devaluation is reduced, but the fiscal adjustment does not eliminate the fiscal deficit that causes growth of debt and loss of reserves, making a future policy change necessary. Only later, at a second stage, is this followed by either an abandonment of exchange rate management or by a sufficiently large cut in the fiscal deficit. We study how different second-stage policy changes affect economic dynamics during the first stage. These changes include tax increases, budget cuts on traded and nontraded goods, and increases in the growth rate of money.

Title: Are Output Fluctuations Transitory?
Abstract: According to the conventional view of the business cycle, fluctuations in output represent temporary deviations from trend. The purpose of this paper is to question this conventional view. If fluctuations in output are dominated by temporary deviations from the natural rate of output, then an unexpected change in output today should not substantially change one's forecast of output in, say, five or ten years. Our examination of quarterly postwar United States data leads us to be skeptical about this implication. The data suggest that an unexpected change in real GNP of 1 percent should change one's forecast by over 1 percent over a long horizon.
