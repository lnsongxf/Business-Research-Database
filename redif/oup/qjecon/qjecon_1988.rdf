Title: A Reformulation of the Economic Theory of Fertility
Abstract: Altruistic parents choose fertility and consumption by maximizing a dynastic utility function. The maximization implies an arbitrage condition for consumption across generations, and equality between the benefit from an extra child and the child-rearing cost. These conditions imply that fertility in open economies depends positively on the world's long-term real interest rate, the degree of altruism, and the growth of child-survival probabilities; and negatively on the rate of technical progress and the growth rate of social security. The growth of per capita consumption across generations depends on changes in the child-rearing cost, but not on interest rates or time preference.

Title: Real Balances, the Exchange Rate, and Indexation: Real Variables in Disinflation
Abstract: The paper shows first that real exchange rate appreciation typically reduces, but may increase, the output costs of disinflation. The direct favorable effects of cheaper imports on consumer prices, on the prices of imported inputs, on wage demands, and on the demand for money may be outweighed by the unemployment caused by the trade deficit. Second, the effects of wage indexation on the costs of disinflation are reexamined. Ex ante indexation speeds up disinflation. Ex post indexation, the type observed in practice, automatically increases the real wage at the start of a disinflation and may therefore increase the sacrifice ratio.

Title: A Time Series Analysis of Representative Agent Models of Consumption and Leisure Choice Under Uncertainty
Abstract: This paper investigates empirically a model of aggregate consumption and leisure decisions in which utility from goods and leisure is nontime-separable. The nonseparability of preferences accommodates intertemporal substitution or complementarity of leisure and thereby affects the comovements in aggregate compensation and hours worked. These cross-relations are examined empirically using postwar monthly U. S. data on quantities, real wages, and the real return on the one-month Treasury bill. The estimated values of the parameters governing preferences differ significantly from the values assumed in several studies of real business models. Several possible explanations of these discrepancies are discussed.

Title: Foreign Counterfeiting of Status Goods
Abstract: We study the positive and normative effects of counterfeiting, i.e., trademark infringement, in markets where consumers are not deceived by forgeries. Consumers are willing to pay more for counterfeits than for generic merchandise of similar quality because they value the prestige associated with brand-name trademarks. Counterfeiters of status goods impose a negative externality on consumers of genuine items, as fakes degrade the status associated with a given label. But counterfeits allow consumers to unbundle the status and quality attributes of the brand-name products, and alter the competition among oligopolistic trademark owners. We analyze two policies designed to combat counterfeiting: enforcement policy which increases the likelihood of confiscation of illegal items, and the imposition of a tariff on low-quality imports.

Title: Signaling in Credit Markets
Abstract: In this paper we show that, under a variety of alternative assumptions about the private information of loan applicants, a competitive market for loans is characterized by screening. Banks separate out loan risks by offering higher loans at higher interest rates. Depending on the nature of the informational asymmetry, it may be that applicants with less risky projects select larger rather than smaller loans. Comparative statics implications are also examined. In particular, we explore the effects of an increase in banks' cost of funds on average loan quality.

Title: Quality Change Under Trade Restraints in Japanese Autos
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the quality change in Japanese car and truck imports over 1979–1985. Car imports have been subject to a quota restraint since April 1981, while compact trucks have faced an ad valorem tariff of 25 percent since August 1980. We find evidence of substantial upgrading in Japanese car imports, with ambiguous quality change in trucks. The welfare cost of the quota restraint in cars exceeds $1,000 per import in 1983 and 1984.

Title: Business Cycles With Costly Search and Recruiting
Abstract: A business cycle model is developed in which output is traded on Lucas-Phelps islands and labor services on each island are exchanged through costly search and recruiting with transactions externalities. The model exhibits persistent involuntary unemployment and inefficient equilibria, even though there are no nominal rigidities and no unexploited privately attainable gains from trade. It also exhibits employment fluctuations without any real-wage fluctuations. It yields a Lucas aggregate-supply curve (to a linear approximation). It also implies that the natural rate of unemployment depends positively upon the variability and persistence of relative price shocks.

Title: Efficient Regulation of Environmental Health Risks
Abstract: This paper introduces a decision framework for regulating environmental health risks which incorporates the characteristic uncertainty about the dissemination and toxicological impacts of environmental contaminants and the behavioral restrictions commonly encountered. Analysis indicates that increases in uncontrollable uncertainty will increase emphasis on average performance, that more potent or less controllable risks will be regulated more stringently and that increasing aversion to uncertainty may result in poorer average performance. The paper also develops an alternative measure for valuing risk of loss of life taking into account uncertainty about health risk generation processes.

Title: Group Size Effects in Public Goods Provision: The Voluntary Contributions Mechanism
Abstract: This paper examines the relationship between variations in group size and "free-riding" behavior in the voluntary provision of public goods. We examine experimentally two pertinent concepts: the marginal return to an individual from contributions to the public good, and the actual number of members in the group. Our results strongly support a hypothesis that increasing group size leads to a reduction in allocative efficiency when accompanied by a decrease in marginal return from the public good (as from crowding or an association of large groups with imperceptibility of marginal benefits). Our results do not support a pure numbers-in-the-group effect.

Title: Can the Share Economy Conquer Stagflation?
Abstract: This paper analyzes Weitzman's contention that a share economy will significantly improve the unemployment-inflation tradeoff. It is shown that the argument rests on a critical proposition that share contracts lead to labor's being in perpetual excess demand. The basis of this proposition is challenged using a wide variety of models of the labor market. The paper concludes that the microeconomics of share economies differs little from that of wage economies, and that a widespread introduction of share contracts is unlikely to improve macroeconomic performance.

Title: Stability of Equilibria with Externalities
Abstract: It is shown that, in a class of models with multiple externalities (one positive and one negative), all stationary equilibria may be locally stable to perturbations, in the sense that there exist perfect foresight trajectories leading back to the equilibrium. Thus, scale diseconomies (arising, for example, out of a common resource pool) generally overturn the Liviatan-Samuelson result, that equilibria are either saddlepoints or sources.

Title: Partnerships
Abstract: A partnership is a coalition that divides its output equally. We show that when partnerships can form freely, a stable or "core" partition into partnerships always exists and is generically unique. When people differ in ability, the equal-sharing constraint inefficiently limits the size of partnerships. We give conditions under which partnerships containing abler people will be larger, and show that if the population is replicated, partnerships may become more or less homogeneous, depending on an elasticity condition. We also examine when the equal-sharing inefficiency vanishes in the limit.

Title: Is Equilibrium Indexation Efficient?
Abstract: This paper investigates the welfare properties of equilibrium indexation in a decentralized economy. If indexation is costless, so all firms index, then the equilibrium degree of indexation is efficient. But if indexation is costly and this leads some firms not to index, equilibrium indexation is inefficient because indexation has externalities for nonindexed firms. Firms choose too little indexation if labor demand is more responsive to movements in real money than to movements in real wages. The results do not depend on the relative importance of real and nominal shocks.

Title: Sources of Economic Fluctuations in the United States
Abstract: There has been much recent discussion about the ultimate sources of macroeconomic variability. A number of authors attribute most of this variability to only a few sources, sometimes only one. Although there may be only a few important sources, this is far from obvious, since economies seem complicated. The purpose of this paper is to provide quantitative estimates of various sources of variability using a U. S. econometric model. Stochastic simulation is used to estimate how much the overall variances of real GNP and the GNP deflator are reduced when various shocks are suppressed in the model.

Title: An Intertemporal Model of Industrial Exit
Abstract: A finite horizon model of industrial exit is developed. After an initial lag, most exits are by young firms. The duration of the lag is positively related to sunk entry costs, but not due to the fallacy of sunk costs. The conception of entry differs from previous research; as a result, not all entrants are identical; and firm size affects the rate of learning. On average, larger new firms last longer. Entrepreneurs in declining firms act more lazily as the firm declines. A number of empirical observations about declining firms are organized by the model.

Title: Vertical Mergers and Market Foreclosure
Abstract: yThe model in this paper illustrates three effects of vertical mergers when both stages are oligopolistic and vertically integrated and unintegrated producers coexist. First, the merging firm increases its final good output. Second, the resulting backward shift in the residual demand curve facing unintegrated final good producers ylowers their demand for the intermediate good. Third, the merged firm withdraws from the intermediate good market. The increased concentration pushes the intermediate good price upward. Which effect dominates depends on market structure. Under some conditions, a vertical merger causes the price of the final good to increase.

Title: On the Efficiency of Competitive Markets for Operating Licenses
Abstract: Some economists and policy makers have suggested that market allocation of scarce operating licenses, broadcasting licenses, and airport "slots," for instance, would lead to their efficient use. This paper demonstrates that a competitive market allocation of operating licenses, whether attained through auctioning, selling, or allowing resale of the rights, does not, in general, assure efficiency. The profit criterion that would guide the allocation of licenses in a competitive market would not necessarily lead to the uses that maximize social benefits. The paper shows that the difference between private and social incentives in the allocation process can be quite large. The theory is then applied to discussions of allocating airport takeoff and landing slots and broadcasting licenses.

Title: Coordinating Coordination Failures in Keynesian Models
Abstract: This paper focuses on the importance of strategic complementarities in agents' payoff functions as a basis for macroeconomic coordination failures. Strategic complementarities arise when the optimal strategy of an agent depends positively upon the strategies of the other agents. We first analyze an abstract game and find that multiple equilibria and a multiplier process may arise when strategic complementarities are present. Often these equilibria can be Pareto ranked. We then place additional economic content on the analysis of this game by considering strategic complementarities arising from production functions, matching technologies, and commodity demand functions in a multisector, imperfectly competitive economy.

Title: Market Imperfections, Labor Management, and Earnings Differentials in a Developing Country: Theory and Evidence from Yugoslavia
Abstract: In this paper we evaluate empirically the relative importance of two explanations of Yugoslav interindustry income differentials. One explanation, proposed initially by Vanek and Jovicic [1975], stresses capital market imperfections which permit capital rents to be appropriated as workers' incomes. The second explanation points to labor allocation problems under self-management. We first present a critique of the Vanek-Jovicic original formulation and then respecify the problem to permit simultaneous evaluation of the two schools of thought. Results based on two data sets suggest that labor allocation factors and monopoly power rather than capital rents are the main source of Yugoslav earnings dispersion.

Title: Option Valuation of Claims on Real Assets: The Case of Offshore Petroleum Leases
Abstract: This paper extends financial option theory by developing a methodology for the valuation of claims on a real asset: an offshore petroleum lease. Several theoretical and practical problems, not present in applying option pricing theory to financial assets, are addressed. Most importantly, we show the necessity of combining option pricing techniques with a model of equilibrium in the market for the underlying asset (petroleum reserves). The advantages of this approach over conventional discounted cash flow techniques are emphasized. The methodological development provides important insights for both company behavior and government policy. Promising empirical results are reported.

Title: A Theoretical Explanation of Some Stylized Facts of Economic Growth
Abstract: This paper presents a three-good, two-country, general equilibrium model that is consistent with several stylized facts of economic growth. The three goods are manufactures, agriculture, and services. Manufactures are subject to economies of scale. The model predicts that services, a nontraded good, must be more expensive in the country with higher per capita income. It also shows that as per capita income increases, we should expect the productivity in commodities relative to services to rise. The model is able to generate many other stylized facts of economic growth.

Title: Complementarity and the Discount Rate for Public Investment
Abstract: The marginal rate of return on public investment in a tax-distorted economy is a weighted average of the marginal social productivity of capital in the private sector and the marginal social rate of time preference, but the weights are shown to depend not only on the proportions of funding obtained from each source through incremental borrowing but also on the degree of complementarity or substitutability between public and private investment.

Title: Consumer's Surplus as an Exact Approximation When Prices Are Appropriately Deflated
Abstract: A canonical price-normalized form is proposed as a generalization of the ordinary consumer's surplus expression commonly used to evaluate changes in economic welfare. This familiar-looking formula, it is proved, can be rigorously interpreted as representing the first- and second-order terms of a Taylor-series expansion for the equivalent-variation or willingness-to-pay function of a single consumer. In principle, the lowly consumer's surplus triangle-and-rectangle methodology can be rigorously defended as an exact approximation to a theoretically meaningful measure as long as prices are appropriately deflated. The appropriate price deflator is derived, and some implications are discussed.

Title: Vertical Restraints in a Model of Vertical Differentiation
Abstract: We consider the case of a manufacturer who sells a homogeneous good to retailers who compete in prices and "cum-sales" or "post-sales" services. We show that the optimal linear-price contract is inefficient from the point of view of the vertical structure and that simple forms of vertical restraints, such as resale price maintenance and franchise fees, dominate the optimal linear-price contract, but do not restore vertical efficiency. Our analysis is concluded with the description of an efficient contract.

Title: Differences in Education and Earnings Across Racial and Ethnic Groups: Tastes, Discrimination, and Investments in Child Quality
Abstract: Viewing the United States as comprising many racial and ethnic groups, it is shown that group differences in earnings, schooling, and rates of return from schooling are striking and that the groups with higher levels of schooling also have higher rates of return. These data are shown to be consistent with a child quality investment model, but they are not consistent with the hypotheses that the primary determinants of schooling level are discrimination, minority group status, differences in time preference (discount rates), or "tastes" for schooling. Group differences in fertility and female labor supply are examined as partial determinants of investment in child quality. Policy implications are discussed.

Title: A Competitive Efficiency Wage Model with Keynesian Features
Abstract: We study a general equilibrium efficiency wage model characterized by fully optimizing agents, flexible prices, and imperfect information. The model has a unique competitive equilibrium with underemployment in a sector (called manufacturing) with efficiency wages, relative to a self-employment sector. Since prices are flexible, the multiplier of manufacturing output with respect to autonomous demand changes may or may not exceed unity: demand changes lead to price effects as well as income effects that work opposite each other. Nevertheless, there always exist government policies that achieve Pareto improvements by switching demand toward the manufacturing sector. Optimal demand-switching policies are explicitly characterized.

Title: Appropriability and Market Structure in a Stochastic Invention Model
Abstract: This research examines in the laboratory a class of game-theoretic equilibrium models of private research and development (R&amp;D). We formulate a stochastic model of R&amp;D investment whose predictions can be examined by using laboratory experiments. The noncooperative Nash equilibrium of our operational model yields testable predictions about the effects of appropriability and market structure on R&amp;D. The experimental results support the hypothesis that the degree of appropriability is inversely related to R&amp;D spending. The results strongly support the hypothesis that an increase in group size yields greater aggregate R&amp;D. The noncooperative Nash equilibrium is shown to be a good predictor of central tendencies in the experiments.

Title: Second-Sourcing as a Commitment: Monopoly Incentives to Attract Competition
Abstract: We show that a new product monopolist may benefit from (delayed) competition if consumers incur setup costs. Setup costs create a dynamic consistency problem: the monopolist cannot guarantee low future prices once customers have incurred those costs. We show that, if customers anticipate this problem, the monopolist's profits can be improved through ex ante commitment to competition in the post-adoption market, if setup costs are large. If setup costs are small, the monopolist can typically achieve the same level of profits without price commitment as with.

Title: Multiple Expectational Equilibria Under Monopolistic Competition
Abstract: This paper shows that a monopolistically competitive economy with real investment can have multiple rational expectations equilibria: one is associated with entrepreneurs' optimistic expectations about future demand; another with entrepreneurs' pessimism. It also shows that an optimistic expectational equilibrium Pareto dominates a pessimistic equilibrium. An investment subsidy can be beneficial both by reducing the original underinvestment distortion and by changing firms' expectations from pessimistic to optimistic. The most important assumption is increasing returns to scale, and monopolistic competition makes increasing returns consistent with each producer's optimization.

Title: Frictional Unemployment and the Role of Industrial Diversity
Abstract: Since many individuals are immobile between city labor markets in the short run, the industrial structure of cities plays an important role in determining the national rate of unemployment. This paper argues that a city's frictional unemployment rate will be lower, the more industrially diversified is the city; that is, the more evenly distributed is employment across industries. The empirical work on 91 large SMSAs strongly supports the hypothesis. The difference in frictional unemployment rates between the twenty most and least diverse cities is estimated at about 2.4 percentage points.

Title: Price Setting and Competition in a Simple Duopoly Model
Abstract: The paper studies a market in which there are two sellers and one buyer. Each agent wants to trade at most one unit of an indivisible commodity. The sellers are uncertain whether the buyer is receiving offers from one or both of them at any given time. This model induces competitive and monopolistic outcomes for particular parameter values. But, other things being equal, as the buyer becomes very patient, the equilibrium price converges to the competitive one.

Title: The Relationship Between Unemployment Spells and Reservation Wages as a Test of Search Theory
Abstract: The theory of stationary job search predicts that, controlling for other factors that affect the probability of leaving unemployment, duration and reservation wages are likely to be positively associated. The paper tests this prediction for British cross-sectional data from 1982 using an estimating equation implied by search theory. Simultaneity is crucial in the evaluation of this prediction, with single-equation and instrumental-variable estimates differing markedly. Perhaps surprisingly, given the extreme paucity of both job interviews and offers in the sample, the main finding is that reservation wages play a significant role in the determination of duration.

Title: Infant-Industry Protection Reconsidered: The Case of Informational Barriers to Entry
Abstract: In industries with imperfect consumer information, the lack of a reputation puts latecomers at a competitive disadvantage vis-à-vis established firms. We consider whether the existence of such informational barriers to entry provides a valid reason for temporarily protecting infant producers of experience goods and services. Our model incorporates both moral hazard in an individual firm's choice of quality and adverse selection among potential entrants into the industry. We find that infant-industry protection often exacerbates the welfare loss associated with these market imperfections.
