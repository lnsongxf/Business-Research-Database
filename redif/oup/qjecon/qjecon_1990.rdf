Title: Fads, Martingales, and Market Efficiency
Abstract: Predictable variation in equity returns might reflect either (1) predictable changes in expected returns or (2) market inefficiency and stock price "overreaction." These explanations can be distinguished by examining returns over short time intervals since systematic changes in fundamental valuation over intervals like a week should not occur in efficient markets. The evidence suggests that the "winners" and "losers" one week experience sizeable return reversals the next week in a way that reflects apparent arbitrage profits which persist after corrections for bid-ask spreads and plausible transactions costs. This probably reflects inefficiency in the market for liquidity around large price changes.

Title: Nonexpected Utility in Macroeconomics
Abstract: This paper introduces, within the context of an infinite horizon optimal consumption problem, a parametric class of Kreps-Porteus nonexpected utility preferences—generalized isoelastic utility—which distinguishes attitudes toward risk from behavior toward intertemporal substitution. Some of the theoretical and empirical implications for macroeconomics of these state- and time-nonseparable preferences are examined.

Title: RINCE Preferences
Abstract: This paper presents a class of preferences that yield closed-form solutions to dynamic stochastic choice problems. These preferences are based on a set of axioms that were proposed by Kreps and Porteus. The Kreps-Porteus axioms allow one to separate an agent's attitudes to risk from his or her intertemporal elasticity of substitution. RINCE preferences have the properties of Risk Neutrality and Constant Elasticity of substitution.

Title: The Significance of Tax Law Asymmetries: An Empirical Investigation
Abstract: This study uses tax return data for U. S. nonfinancial corporations for the period 1971–1982 to estimate the importance of restrictions on the ability of firms to use tax credits and to obtain refunds for tax losses. Our results suggest that the incidence of such unused tax benefits increased substantially during the early 1980s, though we do not find these increases attributable to increased investment incentives during that period. We present estimates of the marginal tax rate on interest payments which take into account unused tax benefits and emphasize the importance of distinguishing current tax payments from marginal tax rates in estimating the incentive to invest.

Title: Financial Fragility and Economic Performance
Abstract: Financial stability is an important goal of policy, but the relation of financial stability to economic performance and even the meaning of the term itself are poorly understood. This paper explores these issues in a theoretical model. We argue that financial instability, or fragility, occurs when entrepreneurs who want to undertake investment projects have low net worth; the heavy reliance on external finance that this implies causes the agency costs of investment to be high. High agency costs in turn lead to low and inefficient investment. Standard policies for fighting financial fragility can be interpreted as transfers that maintain or increase the net worth of potential borrowers.

Title: Media, Political Pressure, and the Firm: The Case of Petroleum Pricing in the Late 1970s
Abstract: This paper empirically examines whether major domestic oil companies held down product prices relative to their less visible counterparts during the 1979 oil crisis. We compare company prices on unregulated fuel oil with a measure of political pressure—the level of television coverage of the energy crisis. We find that media coverage influenced home heating oil price ratios, but did not influence residual fuel oil price ratios for the same companies. We argue that this differential pricing pattern is rational in a politically sensitive period.

Title: The Cost of Annuities: Implications for Saving Behavior and Bequests
Abstract: The fact that most elderly U. S. individuals maintain a flat age-wealth profile, rather than buy individual life annuities, contradicts the standard life-cycle consumption model. Average expected yields on individual life annuities in the United States during 1968–1983 were lower by 4.21–6.13 percent, or 2.43–4.35 percent after allowing for adverse selection, than yields on plausible alternative investments. Simulations of a model of saving and portfolio allocation show that during the early retirement years such yield differentials can account for the absence of annuity purchases even without a bequest motive. At older ages the combination of such yield differentials and a bequest motive can do so. It is common experience that as we grow older and nearer to eternity we become more, not less, anxious about money [Derek Brewer, Chaucer and His World, p. 213].

Title: The Rotten-Kid Theorem Meets the Samaritan's Dilemma
Abstract: A familiar result in the economic theory of the family is Becker's rotten-kid theorem. This theorem states that altruism by a family member will lead other selfish members to act efficiently from the family viewpoint. We extend Becker's one-period model to two periods and show that parental altruism can result in an inefficiency known in other contexts as the Samaritan's dilemma. Implications of this for transfer arrangements within the family and for the Ricardian equivalence theorem are drawn.

Title: The Devolution of Declining Industries
Abstract: In declining industries capacity must be reduced in order to restore profitability. Who bears this burden? Where production is all or nothing, there is a unique subgame-perfect equilibrium: the largest firms exit first [Ghemawat and Nalebuff, 1985]. In this paper firms continuously adjust capacity. Again, there is a unique subgame-perfect equilibrium. All else equal, large firms reduce capacity first, and continue to do so until they shrink to the size of their formerly smaller rivals. Intuitively, bigger firms have lower marginal revenue and correspondingly greater incentives to reduce capacity. This prediction is supported by empirical findings.

Title: Intergenerational Transfers and Liquidity Constraints
Abstract: A growing body of evidence indicates that liquidity constraints could affect a substantial proportion of U. S. consumers, but little is known about why these constraints might exist. An important, but little-explored, issue is the relationship between inter vivos intergenerational transfers and liquidity constraints. These transfers can ease borrowing constraints. Empirical transfer patterns match those predicted from a model in which transfers are allocated to liquidity-constrained consumers. In particular, the distinction between current and permanent incomes of potential recipients is a key aspect of private-transfer behavior. The findings have important implications for our understanding of consumer behavior.

Title: The Fair Wage-Effort Hypothesis and Unemployment
Abstract: This paper introduces the fair wage-effort hypothesis and explores its implications. This hypothesis is motivated by equity theory in social psychology and social exchange theory in sociology. According to the fair wage-effort hypothesis, workers proportionately withdraw effort as their actual wage falls short of their fair wage. Such behavior causes unemployment and is also consistent with observed cross-section wage differentials and unemployment patterns.

Title: Pairwise Credit in Search Equilibrium
Abstract: Pairwise extension of credit is introduced into the barter-search economy previously analyzed by the author. The penalty for failure to repay a debt is modeled as the end of trading opportunities. Since credit availability makes access to trade more valuable, there may be multiple equilibrium credit limits. Since the credit limit affects the implicit interest rate and the stock of inventories, it is necessary to check the net impact of the credit limit on the incentive to repay. In a calculated example, with lumpy credit availability, multiple equilibria are very common with a greater credit limit associated with a lower implicit interest rate. With smooth credit availability no multiple equilibria were found. Surprisingly, credit can break the no-production equilibrium.

Title: Black-White Differences in Wealth and Asset Composition
Abstract: Using data from the 1976 and 1978 National Longitudinal Surveys of young men and young women, this study examines racial differences in the magnitude and composition of wealth and the reasons for them. On average, young black families hold 18 percent of the wealth of young white families, and hold their wealth in proportionately different forms. Even after controlling for racial differences in income and other demographic factors, as much as three quarters of the wealth gap remains unexplained. We speculate on the causes for this, concluding that racial differences in intergenerational transfers and to a lesser extent barriers to the accumulation of business and home equity most likely play a role.

Title: Is There Value-Added from the Review Process in Economics?: Preliminary Evidence from Authors
Abstract: Do referees employed by journals merely screen acceptable from unacceptable manuscripts or are they charged with an additional value-adding responsibility vis-à-vis the papers they review? Drawing from editorial correspondence provided by survey respondents, I address this question by examining the relationship between citations of published papers and comments provided by reviewers and editors. Referees' comments demonstrate a positive impact on subsequent citation of papers, while comments made by editors show no such impact. Value-adding by editors appears to derive principally from efficient matching of papers with reviewers.

Title: Seigniorage, Operating Rules, and the High Inflation Trap
Abstract: There may be both a high and a low inflation equilibrium when the government finances the deficit through seigniorage. Under rational expectations the high inflation equilibrium is stable, and the low inflation equilibrium unstable; under adaptive expectations or lagged adjustment of money balances with rational expectations, the low inflation equilibrium may be stable. Adding bond financing, dual equilibria remain if the government fixes the real interest rate, but a unique equilibrium is attained when the government sets a nominal anchor for the economy. The existence of dual equilibria is thus a result of the government's operating rules.

Title: Equilibria with Communication in a Job Market Example
Abstract: We study (costless) information transmission from a job applicant to an employer who must decide whether to hire him and, if so, which position to give him. We construct equilibrium payoffs requiring at least two signaling steps, or even that no deadline be imposed on the (plain) conversation. The set of communication equilibrium payoffs (achieved with the help of a communication device) is larger than the set of equilibrium payoffs of the plain conversation game but coincides with the set of correlated equilibrium payoffs.

Title: Real Money Balances and the Timing of Consumption: An Empirical Investigation
Abstract: This paper examines the correlation between changes in consumer spending on nondurables and services, and levels or changes in a variety of other variables that might be expected to enter directly as arguments of the household utility function or to serve as measures of household liquidity. Empirical results strongly suggest that an increase in real money balances raises the marginal utility of consumption. Once the influence of real balances is accounted for, there is little evidence that other variables have a direct impact on the timing of consumption.

Title: The Optimal Amount of Discretion to Allow in Disclosure
Abstract: In this paper a party with private information can verifiably disclose some, but not all, of his information. The optimal amount of discretion to allow the informed party is studied. That is, should the informed party be allowed unlimited discretion in choosing which elements of his information set to disclose, or should restrictions be imposed that limit this discretion? The model is formulated in the spirit of a "persuasion game." It is demonstrated that under certain circumstances, rules that limit discretion increase the informativeness of disclosures and thus improve economic decisions.

Title: Monopoly Agenda Control and Asymmetric Information
Abstract: This paper extends the Romer-Rosenthal [1978, 1979] model of monopoly agenda control to an environment where only the agenda setter knows with certainty the outcome associated with a failed proposal. The presence of this asymmetric information implies that any "take-it-or-leave-it" proposal may provide information crucial to the decision calculus of the voters, a fact which an optimal proposal strategy will incorporate. The equilibrium behavior of the agenda setter and voters is characterized and contrasted with that in the complete information environment, and a number of empirical predictions concerning the nature of elections with monopoly controlled agendas are derived.

Title: The Limits of Monopolization Through Acquisition
Abstract: We address the question of whether competitive acquisition of firms by their rivals can result in complete or partial monopolization of a homogeneous product industry. This question is modeled in terms of two distinct three-stage noncoopera-tive games. Analysis of subgame perfect pure strategy Nash equilibria of these games discloses that, under simplifying assumptions, monopolization of an industry through acquisition is limited to industries with relatively few firms. Partial monopolization is either limited in scope or can be completely eliminated by prohibiting any owner from acquiring over 50 percent of the firms in the industry.

Abstract: Standard one-sector growth models often have the counterfactual implication that economies with access to similar technologies will converge to a common balanced growth path. We propose an elaboration of the Diamond model that permits multiple, locally stable stationary states. This multiplicity is due to increasing social returns to scale in the accumulation of human capital.

Title: Customer Racial Discrimination in the Market for Memorabilia: The Case of Baseball
Abstract: Because consumer discrimination can reduce productivity, it is often impossible to tell whether differential productivity is the effect of discrimination or of differential ability. Detailed data for the sports labor market make it possible to separate consumer discrimination from ability. We use a unique approach to determine whether the entertainment value of baseball players is related to their race: we examine whether race directly affects the value of a player in the market for baseball cards. In contrast to studies that use salaries, there is no room for owner or coworker discrimination. Our evidence supports the hypothesis of consumer discrimination.

Title: The Great Crash and the Onset of the Great Depression
Abstract: This paper argues that the collapse of stock prices in October 1929 generated temporary uncertainty about future income which led consumers to forgo purchases of durable goods. That the Great Crash generated uncertainty is evidenced by the decline in surety expressed by contemporary forecasters. That this uncertainty affected consumer behavior is shown by the fact that spending on consumer durables declined drastically in late 1929, while spending on perishable goods rose slightly. This effect is confirmed by the fact that there is a significant negative relationship between stock market variability and the production of consumer durables in the prewar era.

Title: Strikes and Wages: A Test of an Asymmetric Information Model
Abstract: This paper describes a simple model of labor disputes based on the hypothesis that unions use strikes to infer the profitability of the firm. The model posits the existence of a negatively sloped resistance curve between wages and strike duration. In addition, it offer a series of predictions relating wage and strike outcomes to changes in the expected profitability of the firm and changes in the alternative opportunities of striking workers. These implications are tested using data on wage outcomes, strike probabilities, and strike durations for a large sample of collective bargaining agreements.

Title: Have IRAs Increased U. S. Saving?: Evidence from Consumer Expenditure Surveys
Abstract: The vast majority of Individual Retirement Account contributions represent net new saving, based on evidence from the quarterly Consumer Expenditure Surveys (CES). The results are based on analysis of the relationship between IRA contributions and other financial asset saving. The data show almost no substitution of IRAs for other saving. Estimates are based on a flexible constrained optimization model, with the IRA limit the principal constraint. The implications of this model for saving in the absence of the IRA option match very closely the actual non-IRA financial asset saving behavior prior to 1982. IRA saving does not show up as other financial asset saving in the pre-IRA period.

Title: Job Security Provisions and Employment
Abstract: European countries have enacted various job security provisions over the last 30 years. Employers are required to pay workers on separation or to give advance notice of termination. In anything less than a perfectly functioning market, there are effects of the provisions on employment. Incumbents are more likely to retain their jobs, but new workers are less likely to be hired. An examination of the European data suggests that severance pay requirements reduce employment.

Title: Expenditure on Durable Goods: A Case for Slow Adjustment
Abstract: For more than a half a decade the fact that expenditure on durables can be well approximated by a random walk has remained a hidden puzzle, challenging almost any theory in which agents smooth the use of their wealth. This paper shows that once a nonparsimonious approach is used, or lower frequencies of the data are examined, the fact itself disappears; changes in expenditures on durables reveal a degree of reversion consistent with the permanent income hypothesis (PIH), although this reversion occurs at a rate significantly slower than what is suggested by a frictionless PIH model.

Title: The Allocation of Resources by Voting
Abstract: A general theory of voting, which explains under what conditions voting will be chosen as a means for allocating resources and how the constitution that governs the voting will be structured is presented. It is hypothesized that developers of voting organizations will structure their organizations in order to maximize the value of shares sold by minimizing the expected costs of wealth transfer and decision making in the voting organization. Implications regarding the allocation of votes and assessments within the organization, the domain of voting decisions, and the optimal voting rule are tested with data on the constitutional structure of condominium homeowner associations.

Title: Is Unemployment Lower if Unions Bargain over Employment?
Abstract: We consider an economy in which all firms are unionized and bargain with their own union. (1) If unions bargain over employment as well as wages, employment will be the same as if they bargain over wages only, provided that the production function is Cobb-Douglas. (Employment will be higher if the elasticity of substitution between labor and capital is smaller than unity.) (2) If we start from a fully competitive labor market and then move to one of efficient bargaining (over wages and employment), employment falls. This is so even if the marginal utility of income is constant, so that bargaining is "strongly efficient."

Title: The Politics of Ambiguity
Abstract: Politicians face a trade-off between the policies that maximize their chances of reelection and their most preferred policies (or the policies most preferred by the constituency which they represent). This paper analyzes this trade-off in a dynamic electoral model in which the voters are not fully informed about the preferences of the incumbent. First, we show that the incumbent follows a policy which is intermediate between the other party's ideal policy and his own ideal policy. Second, we show that, often, the incumbent has an incentive to choose procedures which make it difficult for voters to pinpoint his preferences with absolute precision. Thus, politicians may prefer to be "ambiguous."

Title: Inflexible Prices and Procyclical Productivity
Abstract: Hall has shown that, with perfect competition and price flexibility, total factor productivity measured using labor's share either in revenues or in costs will be acyclical regardless of the level of labor hoarding. We show that if firms producing a homogeneous good under constant returns must pick their prices before demand is known, both measures of productivity become procyclical. The model implies that productivity should be more procyclical the more important is labor hoarding. Empirically, productivity is more procyclical in industries and in nations where labor hoarding appears more important.

Title: Nash-Cournot or Lindahl Behavior?: An Empirical Test for the NATO Allies
Abstract: This paper derives systems of demand equations for distinguishing between Nash-Cournot and Lindahl behavior in a group that either shares a pure public good or an activity that provides a private and a pure public joint product. Systems of simultaneous equations are estimated based upon Nash-Cournot and Lindahl behavior for a sample of ten NATO allies for the 1956–1987 period. Nonnested hypothesis tests support the Nash-Cournot specification for five of the ten sample allies. No evidence of Lindahl behavior is found. The Nash-Cournot joint-product specification outperforms the pure public model for all sample allies.

Title: On Monopolistic Competition and Involuntary Unemployment
Abstract: In a simple temporary general equilibrium model, it is shown that, if the number of firms is small, imperfect price competition in the markets for goods may be responsible for the existence of unemployment at any given positive wage. In our examples involving two firms facing their "true" demand curves, total monopolistic labor demand remains bounded as the wage rate goes to zero, and unemployment prevails for a sufficiently large inelastic labor supply. In the competitive case total labor demand would go to infinity and intersect labor supply at a positive wage.

Title: Monopolistic Competition, Risk Aversion, and Equilibrium Recessions
Abstract: This paper considers a model with monopolistic competition and multiple equilibria, rankable by output, employment, and the Pareto criterion. While papers in the literature assume a linear production technology and derive a continuum of equilibria, we assume a standard diminishing returns production function and find a finite set of equilibria. Our new feature is the assumption that firms behave in a risk-averse manner. A low-level equilibrium is sustainable because firms, at the low profits level associated with the equilibrium, become extremely cautious in their employment decisions.

Title: The Sources of Fluctuations in Aggregate Inventories and GNP
Abstract: A simple real linear-quadratic inventory model is used to determine how cost and demand shocks interacted to cause fluctuations in aggregate inventories and GNP in the United States, 1947–1986. Cost shocks appear to be the predominant source of fluctuations in inventories and are largely, though not exclusively, responsible for the fact that GNP is more variable than final sales. Cost and demand shocks are of roughly equal importance for GNP. These estimates, however, are imprecise. With different, but plausible, values for a certain target inventory-sales ratio, cost shocks are less important than demand shocks for GNP fluctuations.

Title: Unemployment Insurance, Recall Expectations, and Unemployment Outcomes
Abstract: This paper empirically examines the importance of explicitly accounting for the layoff-rehire process in the analysis of unemployment outcomes in the United States. We find that the spells of individuals' who initially expect to be recalled account for much more of the unemployment of unemployment insurance (UI) recipients than do spells actually ending in recall. Our results indicate that the recall and new job escape rates from unemployment have quite different time patterns and are often affected in opposite ways by explanatory variables. We also find that the probability of leaving unemployment both through recalls and new job finding increases greatly around the time that UI benefits lapse.

Title: A Shred of Evidence on Theories of Wage Stickiness
Abstract: A small interview survey was undertaken to see how actual wage-setters would react to the central ideas of several economic theories of wage stickiness. Wage cuts were surprisingly prevalent in recent years, despite the booming economy. The strongest finding was that managers believe that perceptions of fairness play a major motivational role in labor markets and that a "fair" wage policy is a good deal more complicated than simply not cutting wages. We also found substantial evidence for money illusion and against the adverse-selection version of the efficiency wage model.

Title: The Macroeconomic Effects of False Announcements
Abstract: Suppose that the government were to announce the economy will be booming in six months, and this announcement is based on false data. What effect would such an announcement have on future aggregate activity? This paper employs revisions of the series of leading economic indicators to test the hypothesis that such an announcement would have a positive effect on future activity. We find that the evidence is generally consistent with the hypothesis and that for the time period 1976–1988 the expectational shocks measured by these revisions explain over 20 percent of the fluctuation in the quarterly growth rate of industrial production.
