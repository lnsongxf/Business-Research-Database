Title: The Cyclical Behavior of Individual Production Series, 1889–1984
Abstract: This paper uses simple summary statistics to analyze the volatility, persistence, and comovement of 38 annual individual production series for the period 1889–1984. It seeks to identify the size, source, and correlation of fluctuations in the production of specific commodities within various sample periods and to analyze possible changes in these characteristics over time. The paper also discusses the implications of the behavior of individual production series for the behavior of the aggregate economy within the prewar, interwar, and postwar eras.

Title: Corporate Structure, Liquidity, and Investment: Evidence from Japanese Industrial Groups
Abstract: This paper presents evidence suggesting that information and incentive problems in the capital market affect investment. We come to this conclusion by examining two sets of Japanese firms. The first set has close financial ties to large Japanese banks that serve as their primary source of external finance and are likely to be well informed about the firm. The second set of firms has weaker links to a main bank and presumably faces greater problems raising capital. Investment is more sensitive to liquidity for the second set of firms than for the first set. The analysis also highlights the role of financial intermediaries in the investment process.

Title: Segregated Schools and the Mobility Hypothesis: A Model of Local Government Discrimination
Abstract: Around the turn of the century, Southern blacks lost the right to vote, and discrimination against them by local government officials intensified. This paper argues that, in the case of the de jure segregated public schools attended by black children, the ability of Southern blacks to "vote with their feet" placed limits on local government discrimination.

Title: Ownership, Agency, and Wages: An Examination of Franchising in the Fast Food Industry
Abstract: This paper estimates the difference in compensation between company-owned and franchisee-owned fast food restaurants. The contrast is of interest because contractual arrangements give managers of company-owned outlets less of an incentive to monitor and supervise employees. Estimates based on two data sets suggest that employee compensation is slightly greater at company-owned outlets than at franchisee-owned outlets. The earnings gap is 9 percent for assistant and shift managers and 2 percent for full-time crew workers. Furthermore, the tenure-earnings profile is steeper at company-owned restaurants. These findings suggest that monitoring difficulties influence the timing and generosity of compensation.

Title: Externalities and Asymmetric Information
Abstract: A reconsideration of the Pigovian theory of regulating externalities via taxation is undertaken for environments with private information. The presence of private information may have no effect on the social optimum; but when it has an impact, it is to cause a group of different agents to share the same production or consumption levels. The model developed provides an appealing characterization of when such situations transpire: they occur when the individuals who desire most to engage in some activity are the ones who society least wants to participate. Since such instances could potentially be regulated by the imposition of quantity controls, this may explain authorities' apparent predilection for quantity limits rather than tax-cum-subsidy schemes to manage many externalities.

Title: A Test of the Theory of Exhaustible Resources
Abstract: An empirical test of the theory of exhaustible resources requires an estimate of the time path of the shadow price of the unextracted resource that generally is not observable because of the prevalence of vertical integration in natural resource industries. In this paper we use duality theory to derive an econometric model that provides a statistical test of the theory of exhaustible resources. A restricted cost function is used to obtain estimates of the shadow prices of unextracted resources. The procedure is illustrated with data for the Canadian metal mining industry. For this industry the empirical implications of the theory of exhaustible resources are strongly rejected.

Title: Consumer Rationality and the Status Quo
Abstract: Received microeconomic theory presumes rational consumers maximize utility over all commodity bundles. Recent analysis, however, suggests that a consumer's status quo may limit economic rationality, "bias" consumer decisions, and induce serious errors in survey-based valuations of public and private goods. Using regression and choice-theoretic frameworks, we investigate the existence of status quo effects in the consumer valuation of a particular unpriced product—the reliability of residential electrical service. Such valuations have become important in electric utility resource planning and rate making. We find substantial status quo effects, which must be addressed in welfare comparisons regarding electric service reliability.

Title: Equilibrium Wage Dispersion and Interindustry Wage Differentials
Abstract: This paper develops a search-theoretic explanation of interindustry wage differentials. Given coordination problems in the labor market, the probability of filling a vacancy is an increasing function of the wage offered; in equilibrium, firms that find vacancies more costly will offer higher wages. The model thus explains the persistence of interindustry wage differentials and their correlation with industry-average capital-labor ratio and profitability. Additionally, the model predicts that high-wage firms will receive more applications per job opening and that wages in the labor market will behave as strategic complements.

Title: Persistent Wage Dispersion and Involuntary Unemployment
Abstract: It is costly for firms' offers to workers to be turned down both because firms must make additional offers and making offers is costly and because capital is underused or unused. Provided that workers apply to at least two firms for jobs, there will be wage dispersion in equilibrium, and some workers will randomly fail to receive any wage offers. Firms in the same industry with access to the same technology may nevertheless choose different levels of capital intensity. Firms using capital-intensive technologies will pay higher wages.

Title: Permanent Income, Liquidity, and Adjustments of Automobile Stocks: Evidence from Panel Data
Abstract: A recent article by Bernanke [1984] tests the rational expectations-permanent income hypothesis using panel data on automobile expenditures. He finds no evidence refuting the hypothesis. This paper incorporates a threshold adjustment process into Bernanke's model. Estimations based on a subset of the data used by Bernanke reveal evidence that resale market imperfections and credit market constraints have important effects on automobile expenditures.

Title: The Threat of Unionization, the Use of Debt, and the Preservation of Shareholder Wealth
Abstract: This paper argues that firms use debt to protect the wealth of shareholders from the threat of unionization. Under U. S. labor law the firm cannot prohibit its workers from attempting to form a collective bargaining unit. Debt policy offers a method of reducing the impact of this monopoly right on shareholders. By issuing debt, the firm credibly reduces the funds that are available to a potential union. Empirical evidence that strongly supports this hypothesis is presented.

Title: Adverse Selection in Dynamic Moral Hazard
Abstract: This paper studies a multiperiod moral hazard problem under two assumptions: (i) contracts are subject to renegotiations; (ii) the agent's action has long-term effects. The action is also interpreted as a choice of characteristic or "type." Renegotiation-proof contracts that implement various actions, including random ones, are characterized. Under appropriate conditions, the equilibrium involves the principal implementing a random action. Therefore, the equilibrium has standard properties of "adverse selection" models.

Title: The Penn World Table (Mark 5): An Expanded Set of International Comparisons, 1950–1988
Abstract: The Penn World Table displays a set of national accounts economic time series covering many countries. Its expenditure entries are denominated in a common set of prices in a common currency so that real quantity comparisons can be made, both between countries and over time. It also provides information about relative prices within and between countries, as well as demographic data and capital stock estimates. This updated, revised, and expanded Mark 5 version of the table includes more countries, years, and variables of interest to economic researchers. The Table is available on personal computer diskettes and through BITNET.

Title: Learning by Doing and the Dynamic Effects of International Trade
Abstract: Using an endogenous growth model in which learning by doing, although bounded in each good, exhibits spillovers across goods, this paper investigates the dynamic effects of international trade. Examining the interaction of an LDC and a DC, the latter distinguished by a higher initial level of knowledge, I find that under free trade the LDC (DC) experiences rates of technical progress and GDP growth less than or equal (greater than or equal) to those enjoyed under autarky. Since both countries enjoy the usual static gains from trade, free trade may, nevertheless, improve the welfare of LDC consumers.

Title: Economic Growth in a Cross Section of Countries
Abstract: For 98 countries in the period 1960–1985, the growth rate of real per capita GDP is positively related to initial human capital (proxied by 1960 school-enrollment rates) and negatively related to the initial (1960) level of real per capita GDP. Countries with higher human capital also have lower fertility rates and higher ratios of physical investment to GDP. Growth is inversely related to the share of government consumption in GDP, but insignificantly related to the share of public investment. Growth rates are positively related to measures of political stability and inversely related to a proxy for market distortions.

Title: Equipment Investment and Economic Growth
Abstract: Using data from the United Nations Comparison Project and the Penn World Table, we find that machinery and equipment investment has a strong association with growth: over 1960–1985 each extra percent of GDP invested in equipment is associated with an increase in GDP growth of one third of a percentage point per year. This is a much stronger association than found between growth and any of the other components of investment. A variety of considerations suggest that this association is causal, that higher equipment investment drives faster growth, and that the social return to equipment investment in well-functioning market economies is on the order of 30 percent per year.

Title: The Allocation of Talent: Implications for Growth
Abstract: A country's most talented people typically organize production by others, so they can spread their ability advantage over a larger scale. When they start firms, they innovate and foster growth, but when they become rent seekers, they only redistribute wealth and reduce growth. Occupational choice depends on returns to ability and to scale in each sector, on market size, and on compensation contracts. In most countries, rent seeking rewards talent more than entrepreneurship does, leading to stagnation. Our evidence shows that countries with a higher proportion of engineering college majors grow faster; whereas countries with a higher proportion of law concentrators grow more slowly.

Title: Economic Integration and Endogenous Growth
Abstract: In a world with two similar, developed economies, economic integration can cause a permanent increase in the worldwide rate of growth. Starting from a position of isolation, closer integration can be achieved by increasing trade in goods or by increasing flows of ideas. We consider two models with different specifications of the research and development sector that is the source of growth. Either form of integration can increase the long-run rate of growth if it encourages the worldwide exploitation of increasing returns to scale in the research and development sector.

Title: Quality Ladders and Product Cycles
Abstract: We develop a two-country model of endogenous innovation and imitation in order to study the interactions between these two processes. Firms in the North race to bring out the next generation of a set of technology-intensive products. Each product potentially can be improved a countably infinite number of times, but quality improvements require the investment of resources and entail uncertain prospects of success. In the South entrepreneurs invest resources in order to learn the production processes that have been developed in the North. All R&amp;D investment decisions are made by forward-looking, profit-maximizing entrepreneurs. The steady-state equilibrium is characterized by constant aggregate rates of innovation and imitation. We study how these rates respond to changes in the sizes of the two regions and to policies in each region to promote learning.

Title: Human Capital, Product Quality, and Growth
Abstract: A model of growth is developed in which finite-lived individuals invest in human capital, investments have a positive external effect on the human capital of later cohorts, and labor with more human capital produces higher-quality goods. Stationary growth paths are analyzed, paths along which human capital and the quality of goods grow at a common, constant rate. It is also shown that if a small open economy is either very advanced or very backward relative to the rest of the world, then its rate of investment in human capital is lower under free trade than under autarky.

Title: Increasing Returns, Industrialization, and Indeterminacy of Equilibrium
Abstract: This paper asks whether adjustment processes over real time help to "select" the long-run outcome in a model of industrialization, where multiple stationary states exist because of increasing returns in the manufacturing sector. "History" alone cannot in general determine where the economy will end up. Self-fulfilling expectations often make the escape from the state of preindustrialization (the takeoff) possible. The global bifurcation technique is used to determine when an underdevelopment trap exists and when a takeoff path exists. The role of government policy and agricultural productivity in industrialization are then considered.

Title: History versus Expectations
Abstract: In models with external economies, there are often two or more long-run equilibria. Which equilibrium is chosen? Much of the literature presumes that "history" sets initial conditions that determine the outcome, but an alternative view stresses the role of "expectations," i.e., of self-fulfilling prophecy. This paper uses a simple trade model with both external economies and adjustment costs to show how the parameters of the economy determine the relative importance of history and expectations in determining equilibrium.

Title: Target Zones and Exchange Rate Dynamics
Abstract: This paper develops a simple model of exchange rate behavior under a target zone regime. It shows that the expectation that monetary policy will be adjusted to limit exchange rate variation affects exchange rate behavior even when the exchange rate lies inside the zone and is thus not being defended actively. Somewhat surprisingly, the analysis of target zones turns out to have a strong formal similarity to problems in option pricing and investment under uncertainty.

Title: State-Dependent Pricing and the Dynamics of Money and Output
Abstract: Standard macroeconomic models of price stickiness assume that each firm leaves its price unchanged for a fixed amount of time. We present an alternative model in which the pricing decision depends on the state of the economy. We find a method of aggregating individual price changes that allows a simple characterization of macroeconomic variables. The model produces a positive money-output correlation and an empirical Phillips curve. In addition, the impact of monetary shocks depends crucially on the current level of output, which points to a natural connection between state-dependent microeconomics and state-dependent macroeconomics.

Title: Debt Maturity Structure and Liquidity Risk
Abstract: This paper analyzes debt maturity structure for borrowers with private information about their future credit rating. Borrowers' projects provide them with rents that they cannot assign to lenders. The optimal maturity structure trades off a preference for short maturity due to expecting their credit rating to improve, against liquidity risk. Liquidity risk is the risk that a borrower will lose the nonassignable rents due to excessive liquidation incentives of lenders. Borrowers with high credit ratings prefer short-term debt, and those with somewhat lower ratings prefer long-term debt. Still lower rated borrowers can issue only short-term debt.

Title: Job Queues and Wages
Abstract: This paper uses job applications data to investigate the relationship between job queues and wage differentials. The main finding is that openings for jobs that pay the minimum wage attract more job applicants than jobs that pay either slightly more or slightly less than the minimum wage. This spike in the job application rate distribution suggests that ex ante rents generated for employees by an above market-level minimum wage are not completely dissipated by reductions in nonwage benefits. In addition, we find that highly unionized firms, large firms, and firms in high-wage industries tend to receive relatively many job applicants for openings.

Title: An Interplant Test of the Efficiency Wage Hypothesis
Abstract: The analysis that follows tests the shirking model of efficiency wages by examining the relationship between rates of employee discipline and relative wage premiums across plants within the same firm. The structure of this data set controls for many of the problems that confound other tests of efficiency wage arguments, and the results suggest that greater wage premiums are associated with lower levels of shirking as measured by disciplinary dismissals. Shirking and discipline are also lower where conditions in the labor market raise the costs associated with shirking by making it more difficult to find alternative employment. It is less clear, however, whether the wage in this case is necessarily efficient in the sense of generating reductions in discipline sufficient to offset the costs of the wage premium.

Title: Smuggling, Camouflaging, and Market Structure
Abstract: We examine how market structure and enforcement affect smuggling and welfare in a model where smuggling is camouflaged by legal sales. Conditions are given for when some, but not necessarily all, firms smuggle. With camouflaging, the market price is below the price when all sales are legal, so smuggling improves welfare if the price effect outweighs excess smuggling cost. This welfare effect is directly related to the degree of competition. Increased enforcement in this model potentially reduces welfare. The model is shown to be consistent with evidence on cigarette smuggling in the United States for 1975–1982.

Title: Forecasting Pre-World War I Inflation: The Fisher Effect and the Gold Standard
Abstract: We examine interest and inflation rates from 1879 to 1913. Deflation prior to 1896 was followed by inflation. Average U. S. inflation was 3.1 percentage points higher in the years after 1896, yet nominal interest rates were no higher after 1896. This nonadjustment of nominal rates would be consistent with rational expectations if inflation was not forecastable, and indeed univariate tests show little sign of serial correlation. But gold production does forecast inflation. The relationship between mining and inflation was such that expected inflation should have risen 300 basis points between 1890 and 1910. We consider explanations of this failure to foresee the shift in inflation after 1896 and conclude that it is not persuasive evidence that investors ignored relevant information, but does suggest great uncertainty about the appropriate model for analyzing the economy.

Title: Credibility and Stabilization
Abstract: The paper deals with stabilization as a one-shot problem to ask what "credibility" means in a world where programs will succeed with probability one. A model is spelled out where the equilibrium program has some ex ante probability of failure. The model draws attention to the factors that raise or lower the probability of success of a stabilization program and thus offers a positive theory of stabilization. Reputation that emerges as a central element in repeated games has no role in this model.

Title: Aggregate Stochastic Implications of the Life Cycle Hypothesis
Abstract: This paper sets forth some key aggregate stochastic implications of the Modigliani-Brumberg [1980] life cycle hypothesis and explores the extent to which a properly aggregated life cycle model can help to explain the first and second moment properties of changes in per capita consumption. The principal finding of the paper, which to my knowledge is new, is that smooth per capita consumption in the presence of permanent shocks to per capital labor income is exactly the outcome one should expect from a properly aggregated life cycle model in which saving for retirement, as well as for consumption smoothing, is a motive for asset accumulation.

Title: Sources of Intra-Industry Wage Dispersion: How Much Do Employers Matter?
Abstract: Observed human capital explains less than half of wage variation. In BLS Industry Wage Surveys, establishment-based wage differentials (controlling for occupation) account for 20–70 percent of intra-industry wage variation. This corresponds to a standard deviation in wages of 14 percent of the mean, almost as large as interindustry wage variation. Investigation suggests that establishment wage differentials are not random variations or returns to usual measures of human capital.

Title: Strategic Uncertainty, Equilibrium Selection, and Coordination Failure in Average Opinion Games
Abstract: Deductive equilibrium analysis often fails to provide a unique equilibrium solution in many situations of strategic interdependence. Consequently, a theory of equilibrium selection would be a useful complement to the theory of equilibrium points. A salient equilibrium selection principle would allow decision makers to implement a mutual best response outcome. This paper uses the experimental method to examine the salience of payoff-dominance, security, and historical precedents in related average opinion games. The systematic and, hence, predictable behavior observed in the experiments suggests that it should be possible to construct an accurate theory of equilibrium selection.

Title: Should Marginal Tax Rates be Equalized Through Time?
Abstract: I derive necessary and sufficient conditions for the intertemporal equalization of optimal tax rates. The conditions in the case of wage taxes include constant-elasticity labor supply and constant relative risk aversion. Wage taxes should be low in times of relatively elastic labor supply, or low risk aversion. The conditions in the case of capital taxes include perfect-foresight expectations and constant relative risk aversion. If foresight is imperfect, intertemporal equality will be impeded by a covariance term; if relative risk aversion is time-varying, next period's capital tax should have the same sign as this period's change in relative risk aversion.

Title: Does Compulsory School Attendance Affect Schooling and Earnings?
Abstract: We establish that season of birth is related to educational attainment because of school start age policy and compulsory school attendance laws. Individuals born in the beginning of the year start school at an older age, and can therefore drop out after completing less schooling than individuals born near the end of the year. Roughly 25 percent of potential dropouts remain in school because of compulsory schooling laws. We estimate the impact of compulsory schooling on earnings by using quarter of birth as an instrument for education. The instrumental variables estimate of the return to education is close to the ordinary least squares estimate, suggesting that there is little bias in conventional estimates.

Title: Why Are Products Sold on Sale?: Explanations of Pricing Regularities
Abstract: This paper reports on interesting changes in markdown pricing practices over time and differences in the pricing within a product line. The price discrimination and the uncertainty hypotheses appear to better explain the data than the peak load hypothesis. Fashion has become more important over time and appears to explain the greater seasonal variation in retail apparel prices in recent years. Differences in uncertainty also explains differences in the pricing of different types of men's dress shirts.

Title: Loss Aversion in Riskless Choice: A Reference-Dependent Model
Abstract: Much experimental evidence indicates that choice depends on the status quo or reference level: changes of reference point often lead to reversals of preference. We present a reference-dependent theory of consumer choice, which explains such effects by a deformation of indifference curves about the reference point. The central assumption of the theory is that losses and disadvantages have greater impact on preferences than gains and advantages. Implications of loss aversion for economic behavior are considered.

Title: A Stochastic Dynamic Analysis of Parental Sex Preferences and Fertility
Abstract: This paper formulates a stochastic dynamic model of fertility to evaluate the assumptions that underlie the widely used econometric tests for parental sex preferences. Unlike previous work on dynamic models of fertility, several tractable and testable predictions are established. It is shown rigorously that conventional econometric tests using fertility data are valid tests for sex preferences; however, they cannot separate son preference from daughter preference. The only definite conclusion that one can draw from fertility data is whether there are sex preferences. These results call into question the validity of conventional econometric tests for son preference.

Title: The Politics of Government Decision-Making: A Theory of Regulatory Capture
Abstract: The paper develops an agency-theoretic approach to interest-group politics and shows the following: (1) the organizational response to the possibility of regulatory agency politics is to reduce the stakes interest groups have in regulation. (2) The threat of producer protection leads to low-powered incentive schemes for regulated firms. (3) Consumer politics may induce uniform pricing by a multiproduct firm. (4) An interest group has more power when its interest lies in inefficient rather than efficient regulation, where inefficiency is measured by the degree of informational asymmetry between the regulated industry and the political principal (Congress).

Title: Testing for Contracting Effects on Employment
Abstract: I test for the importance of wage rigidities from long-term contracts by observing how employment responds when firms and workers recontract. If rigidities are important, then employment should adjust after recontracting to partially undo its movements during the past contract. I examine twelve manufacturing industries that display a strong bargaining pattern. I find employment does rebound after recontracting, particularly in motor vehicles. This implies that contract rigidities are important. I also find responses in wage growth at the beginning of new contracts; but these responses are not related to the pattern of employment responses across industries.

Title: Recent Trends in Insured and Uninsured Unemployment: Is There an Explanation?
Abstract: This paper explores the recent decline in the fraction of unemployed workers who receive unemployment insurance benefits. Using March Current Population Surveys, we compare the fraction who are potentially eligible for benefits with the fraction who receive them. The decline in insured unemployment is almost entirely due to a decline in the early 1980s in the takeup rate for benefits. We analyze the determinants of the takeup rate, using both aggregated state-level data and micro-data. At least half the decline is due to an increasing share of unemployment in states with lower takeup rates.

Title: Exchange Rates and Foreign Direct Investment: An Imperfect Capital Markets Approach
Abstract: We examine the connection between exchange rates and foreign direct investment that arises when globally integrated capital markets are subject to informational imperfections. These imperfections cause external financing to be more expensive than internal financing, so that changes in wealth translate into changes in the demand for direct investment. By systematically lowering the relative wealth of domestic agents, a depreciation of the domestic currency can lead to foreign acquisitions of certain domestic assets. We develop a simple model of this phenomenon and test for its relevance in determining international capital flows.

Title: Sovereign Debt Repurchases: No Cure for Overhang
Abstract: Troubled debtor countries do not gain by repurchasing external bank debt at market discount, even if a buyback would stimulate investment by relieving debt overhang. The reason is that buybacks allow creditors to reap more than 100 percent of any efficiency gains that might result from increased investment. We show that open-market buybacks provide a benchmark for evaluating more complex negotiated buyback deals. By comparing any given deal with a hypothetical market buyback of the same size, one can derive upper and lower bounds on the gain to the country. We apply our model to the 1990 Mexican debt deal.

Title: The Dominant-Firm Advantage in Multiproduct Industries: Evidence from the U. S. Airlines
Abstract: In many industries, the largest firms are most successful in entering and competing in individual markets or submarkets. While this success is often attributed to cost or quality differences, it may also reflect reputation advantages or marketing strategies that benefit firms selling a wider variety of products in the industry. I present an approach to estimating the advantages of a dominant firm in the airline industry that allows one to effectively control for cost and quality heterogeneity. Results using data from 1986 indicate that an airline with a dominant presence at an airport will have a significant advantage in attracting customers whose trips originate at that airport, regardless of the specific route on which the customer is traveling.

Title: Trade Inventories and (S,s)
Abstract: The paper presents empirical tests of the (S,s) model of inventory behavior using aggregate retail trade data. Estimation and testing are based on the probability distributions of inventories derived by Caplin [1985]. The excess volatility of retailers' demand over their consumers' demand, and the "forgetfulness" of inventories under (S,s) are emphasized. Test results indicate that the time series properties of deliveries and sales are consistent with (S,s) and not a quadratic cost model. Finally, when autoregressions of inventories are given an (S,s) rather than a stock adjustment interpretation, traditional empirical problems such as low speeds of adjustment are explained.

Title: Negotiated Trade Restrictions with Private Political Pressure
Abstract: We consider a home government with political pressure to restrict trade. The foreign country is compensated with a portion of the tariff revenues or quota rents, but cannot directly observe the political pressure abroad. In this setting, the two countries negotiate over the volume of trade and transfer of rents, depending on the level of political pressure. We determine globally optimal, incentive-compatible trade policies, in which the home government has no incentive to overstate (or understate) the pressure for protection.

Title: Market Structure, Marketing Method, and Price Instability
Abstract: Data for metals sold on commodity exchanges and at prices set by producers are used to test the relationship between the organization of markets and the behavior of prices. On the production side the question is whether prices are more stable in concentrated industries. And on the sales side the question is whether markets where buyers are consumers have more stable prices than those with consumers and speculators. The recent increase in metal-price instability is explained by changes in the market-structure and organization variables. Foremost is increased reliance on commodity exchanges. Declines in concentration are of less importance.

Title: Employment Risk, Diversification, and Unemployment
Abstract: This paper studies determinants of the geographic distribution of unemployment in the United States since 1950. We argue that "equilibrium" differences in unemployment among markets are partially supported by corresponding differences in the covariance structure of sectoral demands for labor. When workers are mobile, greater diversification of sectoral demands reduces unemployment. We confirm this point using pooled time-series-cross-section data on state unemployment and employment by industry. We also find evidence for nonneutrality of aggregate disturbances based on geographic differences in industrial composition, and that permanent changes in the sectoral composition of employment lead to transitory fluctuations in unemployment.
