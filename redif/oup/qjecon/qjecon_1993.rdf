Title: Do Supply Curves Slope Up?
Abstract: This paper examines the short-run responses of price and quantity to exogenous demand shocks for disaggregated U. S. manufacturing industries, using prior information on input-output linkages to identify industries whose fluctuations are likely to function as approximately exogenous demand shocks for other industries. I find that demand shocks induce positive covariation between price and quantity for 16 out of 26 sample industries, controlling for observable cost shift variables. When sample industries are pooled, I estimate that a demand shock which initially raises industry output by 1 percent generates a price increase of 0.182 percent within one year. I find that input-output instruments detect upward sloping supply curves more readily than least squares or other commonly used demand-shift instruments.

Title: How Computers Have Changed the Wage Structure: Evidence from Microdata, 1984–1989
Abstract: This paper uses Current Population Survey data to examine whether workers who use a computer at work earn a higher wage rate than otherwise similar workers who do not use a computer at work. A variety of models are estimated to try to correct for unobserved variables that might be correlated with job-related computer use and earnings. Estimates suggest that workers who use computers on their job earn 10 to 15 percent higher wages. Additionally, the expansion in computer use in the 1980s can account for one-third to one-half of the increase in the rate of return to education.

Title: Vertical Control and Price Versus Nonprice Competition
Abstract: This paper considers a manufacturer distributing a product through retailers who compete in price and service, which reduces the time it takes to purchase a good. The mix of these instruments that maximizes collective profit is determined by the tastes of consumers on the "product margin," whereas decentralized retailers consider as well the tastes of consumers on the interretailer margins. Given search or travel costs, consumers with low time costs are overrepresented on the interretailer margins. In considering customers on the wrong margin, retailers are therefore biased toward price competition. This distortion that can be corrected with vertical restraints.

Title: Financial Market Imperfections and Business Cycles
Abstract: Because of financial market imperfections, such as those generated by asymmetric information in financial markets, which lead to breakdowns in markets, like that for equity, in which risks are shared, firms act in a risk-averse manner. The resulting macroeconomic model accounts for many widely observed aspects of actual business cycles: (a) cyclical movements in real product wages, (b) cyclical patterns of output and investment including inventories, (c) sensitivity of the economy to small perturbations, and (d) persistence. More downward flexibility in wages and prices may exacerbate the plight of an economy that is in a deep recession.

Title: The Stock Market, Profit, and Investment
Abstract: Should managers, when taking investment decisions, follow the signals given by the stock market even when those do not coincide with their own assessment of fundamentals? Do they? In this paper we review theoretical arguments and examine the empirical evidence. First, we look at the relation between investment, market valuation, and proxies for fundamentals over the last 90 years. Second, we look at the behavior of investment during the episodes associated with the crashes of 1929 and 1987. We find a limited role of market valuation, given fundamentals.

Title: Ants, Rationality, and Recruitment
Abstract: This paper offers an explanation of behavior that puzzled entomologists and economists. Ants, faced with two identical food sources, were observed to concentrate more on one of these, but after a period they would turn their attention to the other. The same phenomenon has been observed in humans choosing between restaurants. After discussing the nature of foraging and recruitment behavior in ants, a simple model of stochastic recruitment is suggested. This explains the "herding" and "epidemics" described in the literature on financial markets as corresponding to the equilibrium distribution of a stochastic process rather than to switching between multiple equilibria.

Title: What to Preserve? An Application of Diversity Theory to Crane Conservation
Abstract: This paper attempts to demonstrate how "diversity theory" can be applied to the analysis of real-world conservation policies. The specific example chosen to serve as a paradigm concerns preservation priorities among the fifteen species of cranes living wild throughout the world. The example is sufficiently actual to show how diversity theory can be used operationally to frame certain critical conservation questions and to guide us toward answers by providing informative quantitative indicators of what to protect. At the same time the cranes example is rich enough that it illustrates nicely some broad general principles about the economics of diversity preservation.

Title: Partisan Monetary Policies: Presidential Influence Through the Power of Appointment
Abstract: We investigate the channels through which partisan influence from a Presidential administration could affect monetary policy-making. Influence could be a result of direct Presidential pressure exerted on members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), or it could be a result of partisan considerations in Presidential appointments to the Board of Governors. To investigate these two channels of influence, we devise and apply a method for estimating parameters of monetary policy reaction functions that can vary across individual members of the FOMC. Our results suggest that the appointments process is the primary mechanism by which partisan differences in monetary policies arise.

Title: Sectoral Shifts and Cyclical Unemployment Reconsidered
Abstract: This paper develops a new measure of reallocation shocks based on the variance of industry stock market excess returns to assess the contribution of sectoral reallocation to unemployment in the postwar U. S. economy. The Beveridge Curve relationship is used to establish that this series isolates reallocation shocks. Reallocation shocks are found to explain only a moderate share of the fluctuations in aggregate unemployment on average over the period. However, reallocation accounted for a substantial share of increases in unemployment in several episodes, particularly the mid-1970s. Reallocation shocks also account for a larger share of fluctuations in unemployment of longer durations than of shorter durations.

Title: Noncooperative Foundations of the Area Monotonic Solution
Abstract: Given a finite set of alternatives, players alternate making offers. Player 1 offers some alternative that 2 can accept or veto. If 2 accepts, it is enforced, and the game ends. Otherwise, 2 makes a counteroffer among the remaining alternatives, and so on. If all alternatives are vetoed, a disagreement alternative is enforced. First, we characterize the unique outcome of any subgame perfect equilibrium of this game. Then, we show that this outcome converges to the Area Monotonie Solution if the alternatives are uniformly distributed over the bargaining set, and as the number of alternatives tends to infinity.

Title: Why Does the Stock Market Fluctuate?
Abstract: Major long-run swings in the U. S. stock market over the past century are broadly consistent with a model driven by changes in current and expected future dividends in which investors must estimate the time-varying long-run dividend growth rate. Such an estimated long-run growth rate resembles a long distributed lag on past dividend growth, and is highly correlated with the level of dividends. Prices therefore respond more than proportionately to long-run movements in dividends. The time-varying component of dividend growth need not be detectable in the dividend data for it to have large effects on stock prices.

Title: The Evolution of Buyout Pricing and Financial Structure in the 1980s
Abstract: We examine changes in the pricing and financial structure of large management buyouts in the 1980s. Over time, (1) buyout price to cash flow ratios rose in absolute terms (particularly in deals financed using public junk bonds); (2) required bank principal repayments accelerated, leading to sharply lower ratios of cash flow to total debt obligations; (3) private subordinated and bank debt were replaced by public junk debt; and (4) management teams and dealmakers took more money out of transactions up front. These patterns are consistent with an "overheating" phenomenon in the buyout market. Preliminary post-buyout evidence lends some support to this interpretation.

Title: Microeconomic Adjustment Hazards and Aggregate Dynamics
Abstract: The basic premise of this paper is that understanding aggregate dynamics requires considering that agents are heterogeneous and that they do not adjust continuously to the shocks they perceive. We provide a general characterization of lumpy behavior at the microeconomic level in terms of an adjustment-hazard function, which relates the probability that a unit adjusts to the deviation of its state variable from its moving target. We characterize rich, cross-sectionally dependent aggregate dynamics generated by nonconstant hazards. We present an example based on U. S. manufacturing employment and job flows, and find that increasinghazard models outperform constant-hazard-partial-adjustment models in describing aggregate employment dynamics.

Title: Taxation and the Structure of Labor Markets: The Case of Corporatism
Abstract: We propose an explanation for the wide variation in rates of taxation across developed economies, based on differences in labor market institutions. In "corporatist" economies, which feature centralized labor markets, taxes on labor input will be less distortionary than when labor supply is determined individually. Since the level of labor supply is set by a small group of decision-makers, these individuals will recognize the linkage between the taxes that workers pay and the benefits that they receive. Labor tax burdens are indeed higher in more corporatist nations, while nonlabor taxes are actually lower. There is also some evidence that the distortionary effects of labor taxes are lower in more corporatist economies.

Title: The Carnegie Conjecture: Some Empirical Evidence
Abstract: This paper examines tax-return-generated data on the labor force behavior of people before and after they receive inheritances. The results are consistent with Andrew Carnegie's century-old assertion that large inheritances decrease a person's labor force participation. For example, a single person who receives an inheritance of about $150,000 is roughly four times more likely to leave the labor force than a person with an inheritance below $25,000. Additional, albeit weaker, evidence suggests that large inheritances depress labor supply, even when participation is unaltered. Warren Kendall … heir to an insurance company fortune … says he's worth about $5 million and has an income of "about, oh, $300 and some thousand a year." [H]e has never held a job, or wanted to. Going down to sea in cruise ships is his full-time pursuit. He estimates that he has taken about 250 cruises over the past couple of decades, spending at least 50 percent to 70 percent of the year afloat [Morgenthaler, 1991, p. Al].

Title: Does Fairness Prevent Market Clearing? An Experimental Investigation
Abstract: This paper reports the results of an experiment that was designed to test the impact of fairness on market prices. Prices were determined in a one-sided oral auction, with buyers as price-makers. Upon acceptance of an offer, sellers determined the quality of the good. Buyers offered prices that were substantially above the market-clearing level and expected sellers to respond with high quality levels. This expectation was, on average, confirmed by the behavior of sellers. These results provide, therefore, experimental support for the fair wage-effort theory of involuntary unemployment.

Title: Selection in the Market for Slaves: New Orleans, 1830–1860
Abstract: Greenwald and Glasspiegel argue that adverse selection depressed the market prices of slaves, causing current researchers to overestimate the rate of return from slavery. In this paper we test for the presence of adverse selection by comparing the prices of local slaves with the prices of slaves sold from estate sales. We find no difference in the prices of these slaves, from which we conclude that there was no significant adverse selection in the market. Instead, we propose an alternative explanation for the observed pattern of slave prices based on the costs of shipping slaves to the New Orleans market.

Title: Empirical Evidence on Nominal Wage and Price Flexibility
Abstract: This paper tests a necessary condition for the neutrality of money in a framework that imposes only weak restrictions on the money supply process. It extends Bernanke's [1986] work by weakening the set of just-identifying restrictions and by providing a statistical test of the overidentifying restrictions. Instead of specifying a structural model to identify primitive shocks, I deduce the impact effects of structural money shocks under the neutrality hypothesis and then test whether the system maintains neutrality as it propagates these impact effects. The tests reject neutrality for both the M1 and the monetary base.

Title: The O-Ring Theory of Economic Development
Abstract: This paper proposes a production function describing processes subject to mistakes in any of several tasks. It shows that high-skill workers—those who make few mistakes—will be matched together in equilibrium, and that wages and output will rise steeply in skill. The model is consistent with large income differences between countries, the predominance of small firms in poor countries, and the positive correlation between the wages of workers in different occupations within enterprises. Imperfect observability of skill leads to imperfect matching and thus to spillovers, strategic complementarity, and multiple equilibria in education.

Title: Geographic Localization of Knowledge Spillovers as Evidenced by Patent Citations
Abstract: We compare the geographic location of patent citations with that of the cited patents, as evidence of the extent to which knowledge spillovers are geographically localized. We find that citations to domestic patents are more likely to be domestic, and more likely to come from the same state and SMSA as the cited patents, compared with a "control frequency" reflecting the pre-existing concentration of related research activity. These effects are particularly significant at the local (SMSA) level. Localization fades over time, but only very slowly. There is no evidence that more "basic" inventions diffuse more rapidly than others.

Title: Corruption
Abstract: This paper presents two propositions about corruption. First, the structure of government institutions and of the political process are very important determinants of the level of corruption. In particular, weak governments that do not control their agencies experience very high corruption levels. Second, the illegality of corruption and the need for secrecy make it much more distortionary and costly than its sister activity, taxation. These results may explain why, in some less developed countries, corruption is so high and so costly to development.

Title: Workings of a City: Location, Education, and Production
Abstract: We model the links between residential choice, education, and productivity in a city composed of several communities. Local complementarities in human capital investment induce occupational segregation, although efficiency may require identical communities. Even when some asymmetry is optimal, equilibrium segregation can cause entire "ghettos" to drop out of the labor force. Underemployment is more extensive, the easier it is for high-skill workers to isolate themselves from others. When perfect segregation is feasible, individual incentives to pursue it are self-defeating and lead instead to a collapse of the productive sector.

Title: Equalizing Exchange: Trade Liberalization and Income Convergence
Abstract: How does movement toward freer trade affect income disparity among countries? This paper attempts to shed some light on the issue by examining episodes of major postwar trade hberalization within specified groups of countries. The findings suggest a strong link between the timing of trade reform and income convergence among countries.

Title: Population Growth and Technological Change: One Million B.C. to 1990
Abstract: The nonrivalry of technology, as modeled in the endogenous growth Uterature, implies that high population spurs technological change. This paper constructs and empirically tests a model of long-run world population growth combining this implication with the Malthusian assumption that technology limits population. The model predicts that over most of history, the growth rate of population will be proportional to its level. Empirical tests support this prediction and show that historically, among societies with no possibility for technological contact, those with larger initial populations have had faster technological change and population growth.

Title: Finance and Growth: Schumpeter Might Be Right
Abstract: We present cross-country evidence consistent with Schumpeter's view that the financial system can promote economic growth, using data on 80 countries over the 1960–1989 period. Various measures of the level of financial development are strongly associated with real per capita GDP growth, the rate of physical capital accumulation, and improvements in the efficiency with which economies employ physical capital. Further, the predetermined component of financial development is robustly correlated with future rates of economic growth, physical capital accumulation, and economic efficiency improvements.

Title: Transitional Dynamics in Two-Sector Models of Endogenous Growth
Abstract: We analyze the steady state and transitional dynamics of two-sector models of endogenous growth. The necessary conditions for endogenous growth imply that transitions depend only on a measure of the imbalance between the two sectors such as the ratio of the two capital stocks. We use the Time-Elimination method to analyze the transitional d)niamics. Three main economic forces drive the transition: a Solow effect, a consumption smoothing effect, and a relative wage effect. For plausible parameterizations the consumption smoothing effect tends to dominate the relative wage effect; transition from relatively low levels of physical capital is accomplished through higher work effort rather than higher savings.

Title: Substitution and Complementarity in Endogenous Innovation
Abstract: The influence of Schumpeter's notion of "creative destruction" may have led to an overemphasis on substitution between technologies in recent models of endogenous innovation. Historical examples of technological change suggest that new technologies may just as frequently complement older technologies, creating, rather than destroying, rents. Acknowledgment of the potential for both substitution and complementarity among inventions allows for a much richer characterization of the growth process, creating the possibility of threshold effects and multiple equilibria and bringing to the forefront the important role played by the expectations of inventive entrepreneurs.

Title: Capital Formation and Economic Growth in China
Abstract: First, production functions are estimated for China's aggregate economy and for the five sectors—agriculture, industry, construction, transportation, and commerce—using annual data (some constructed by the author) from 1952 to 1980. Then, this paper measures the contribution of capital formation to the growth of these sectors, the effects of the Great Leap Forward of 1958–1962 and of the Cultural Revolution of 1966–1976 on outputs, the impact of economic reforms since 1979 on growth, the rates of return to capital, and the effects of sectorial growths on relative prices.

Title: Does History Matter Only When It Matters Little? The Case of City-Industry Location
Abstract: When will an industry subject to agglomeration economies move from an old, high-cost site to a new, low-cost site? It is argued that history, in the form of sunk costs resulting from the operation of many firms at a site, creates a first-mover disadvantage that can prevent relocation. It is demonstrated that developers of industrial parks can partly overcome this inertia through discriminatory pricing of land over time, and empirical evidence is provided that they actually engage in such behavior. It is also shown that other aspects of developer land-sale strategy can be a source of information on the nature of interfirm externalities.

Title: Openness and Inflation: Theory and Evidence
Abstract: Because unanticipated monetary expansion leads to real exchange rate depreciation, and because the harms of real depreciation are greater in more open economies, the benefits of unanticipated expansion are decreasing in the degree of openness. Models in which the absence of precommitment in monetary policy leads to excessive inflation therefore predict lower average inflation in more open economies. This paper tests this prediction using cross-country data. The data show a strong and robust negative link between openness and inflation.

Title: Trading Volume and Serial Correlation in Stock Returns
Abstract: This paper investigates the relationship between aggregate stock market trading volume and the serial correlation of daily stock returns. For both stock indexes and individual large stocks, the first-order daily return autocorrelation tends to decline with volume. The paper explains this phenomenon using a model in which risk-averse "market makers" accommodate buying or selling pressure from "liquidity" or "noninformational" traders. Changing expected stock returns reward market makers for playing this role. The model implies that a stock price decline on a high-volume day is more likely than a stock price decline on a low-volume day to be associated with an increase in the expected stock return.

Title: A Simple Theory of Advertising as a Good or Bad
Abstract: Our analysis treats advertisements and the goods advertised as complements in stable metautility functions, and generates new results for advertising by building on and extending the general analysis of complements. By assimilating the theory of advertising into the theory of complements, we avoid the special approaches to advertising found in many studies that place obstacles in the way of understanding the effects of advertising. We also use this approach to evaluate advertising from a welfare perspective. Whether there is excessive or too little advertising depends on several variables: the effects on consumer utility, the degree of competition in the market for advertised goods, the induced changes in prices and outputs of advertised goods, and whether advertising is sold to consumers.

Title: Secondary Market Prices and Mexico's Brady Deal
Abstract: The use of official funds in debt reduction packages has been widely argued to amount to a creditor bailout. We analyze this question using a case study of Mexico's 1989 Brady deal. Using an option-based pricing model, we obtain pre- and postmarket values for Mexico's commercial debt and find that the market value inclusive of official funds went up only marginally. Consequently, Mexico obtained a large share of the benefits of the official funds and struck a favorable deal. The Brady debt reduction formula thus seems to offer an efficient framework for debt workouts. Recent events in Mexico confirm that view.

Title: The Effects of Product Market Competition on Collective Bargaining Agreements: The Case of Foreign Competition in Canada
Abstract: In this paper we estimate the effect of the financial conditions of firms on negotiated wage settlements and on employment using a sample of Canadian collective bargaining agreements from 1965 to 1983. We find that ordinary least squares estimates of the effect of quasi-rents per worker on wages are positive but very small. However, we find a much larger effect when we instrument quasi-rents with measures of foreign competition shocks. We conclude that standard estimates of rent-sharing based on contract data seriously understate the impact of product market competition on negotiated wage settlements.

Title: Linear Adjustment Costs and Seasonal Labor Demand: Evidence from Retail Trade Firms
Abstract: Standard models of dynamic labor demand rely on the presence of adjustment costs to explain the observed smoothness in employment patterns, although the costs are often difficult to quantify. The experience rating feature of the U. S. Unemployment Insurance (UI) system provides a measurable linear cost of adjustment. Using a unique data set with administrative data on over 8000 firms, I estimate the effect of a UI-induced linear adjustment cost on seasonal labor demand in retail trade. I find strong support for the large role of adjustment costs in reducing the employment response of firms to seasonal fluctuations in demand.

Title: Automobiles and the National Industrial Recovery Act: Evidence on Industry Complementarities
Abstract: This paper investigates the Automobile Industry code negotiated in 1933 and modified in 1935 under the National Industrial Recovery Act. The amended code contained a provision calling for automobile producers to alter the timing of new model introductions and the annual automobile show as a means of regularizing employment in the industry. Our analysis of this period provides evidence against the hypothesis that changes in fundamentals led to the dramatic changes in the seasonal pattern of production and sales starting in 1935. Instead, it appears that the National Industrial Recovery Act succeeded in coordinating activity on an alternative Nash equilibrium.

Title: The Comovement of Stock Prices
Abstract: We test whether comovements of individual stock prices can be justified by economic fundamentals. This is a test of the present value model of security valuation with the constraint that changes in discount rates depend only on changes in macroeconomic variables. Then, stock prices of companies in unrelated lines of business should move together only in response to changes in current or expected future macroeconomic conditions. Using a latent variable model to capture unobserved expectations, we find excess comovement of returns. We show that this excess comovement can be explained in part by company size and degree of institutional ownership, suggesting market segmentation.

Title: Investment in Competitive Equilibrium: The Optimality of Myopic Behavior
Abstract: There is an extensive literature on the optimal irreversible investment strategy of a solitary firm facing an exogenous price process. This paper shows that the investment strategies that this literature derives may be optimal in competitive equilibrium even though the price process is now endogenous. This provides a simple means for computing equilibrium investment strategies.

Title: How Learning in Financial Markets Generates Excess Volatility and Predictability in Stock Prices
Abstract: Two of the most discussed anomalies in the financial literature are the predictability of excess returns and the excess volatility of stock prices. Learning effects on stock price dynamics are an intuitive candidate to explain these empirical findings: estimation uncertainty may increase volatility of stock prices and an estimate of the dividend growth rate that is, say, lower than the "true" value tends to increase the dividend yield and capital gain. Simulations of learning effects in a present value model confirm that learning may help to explain excess volatility and predictability of stock returns.
