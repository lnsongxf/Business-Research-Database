Title: Information Aggregation and Policy
Abstract: The function of monetary policy to alter the informational content of money price signals is examined in a model where traders can observe an economy wide financial signal and a local commodity price. Under a passive policy, money demand disturbances, which are not directly observable, are shown to be confused with real productivity shocks and thereby preclude prices from fully reflecting all information. Even when the policy authority has no informational advantage, prospective money growth feedback rules can "improve" the structure of available information.

Title: The Determinants of Occupational Success in Britain
Abstract: This paper is concerned with measuring the true impact of certain human capital variables on an individual's occupational position. The particular variables which are analysed are training, qualifications and spells of sickness and unemployment. The longitudinal nature of the data enables us to control for all relevant individual attributes which remain fixed over the period of the sample. This is vitally important because these attributes are strongly correlated with the variables of interest and would seriously corrupt estimates derived from a single cross-section. A method of generating consistent estimates (as N → ∞, T fixed) for a dynamic model with fixed effects is also illustrated.

Title: The Efficient Estimation of Econometric Models with Rational Expectations
Abstract: The efficient estimation of econometric models with rational expectations by the substitution method usually entails the use of a non-linear simultaneous equations estimator and hence is not very attractive computationally. It is shown that for a wide class of problems efficient estimates can also be obtained with standard estimation methods if instead an errors in variables approach is used. For many other problems, although not providing fully efficient estimates because rationality is not imposed, the errors in variables method will still have a strong appeal because otherwise it uses all of the structural information in the model; unlike the substitution method, when an incomplete information set is used, it guarantees consistent estimates; and it is easy to compute.

Title: Compulsory Arbitration, Arbitral Risk and Negotiated Settlements: A Case Study in Bargaining under Imperfect Information
Abstract: The effect of conventional and final-offer compulsory arbitration on negotiated settlements is characterized, using Nash's variable-threats bargaining solution, with particular attention to the interaction between arbitral risk and bargainers' risk preferences. When there is no arbitral risk, both schemes are shown to have the same effect on negotiated settlements under very general conditions, even when bargaining is over several issues. Whether or not there is arbitral risk, negotiated settlements favour a bargainer more if his opponent is more risk-averse. On the other hand, increases in arbitral risk need not improve the position of the less risk-averse bargainer. As a by-product of the analysis, Kihlstrom, Roth and Schmeidler's risk-sensitivity results for the Nash and Raiffa-Kalai-Smorodinsky solutions are generalized from fixed-threats to variable-threats bargaining.

Title: Welfare Economics of Decision Making with Changing Preferences
Abstract: The paper considers the properties a decision tree needs to guarantee that there are no preferences such that the sophisticated equilibrium is Pareto dominated when all agents act completely myopically. It shows that the only decision trees with this property are the most trivial problems. The analysis is generalized to agents who are not completely myopic and gives an example of union and shareholder conflict to illustrate the results.

Title: "Automatic" Output Stability and the Exchange Arrangement: A Multi-Country Analysis
Abstract: The dependence of national output variances on the structural and stochastic features of world markets and on the global exchange arrangement is depicted in a multi-country model of income and exchange rate determination. The set of Pareto optimal exchange arrangements is displayed. Examples are presented to illustrate the empirical determinants of an optimal arrangement, the situations under which currency blocs are Pareto optimal, and the distributional conflicts which often arise in an asymmetric world.

Title: Models and Estimation of Disequilibrium for Centrally Planned Economies
Abstract: The planned level of output is an important variable in modelling Centrally Planned Economies and the present paper discusses several disequilibrium models in which the plan level is an endogenous variable. A key relationship in such a model is the plan-adjustment equation which is the counterpart of the usual price-adjustment equation employed in models of free economies. Seemingly minor differences in assumptions lead to markedly different econometric models. The coherency properties of these are studied and several likelihood functions are derived. The most complex of the models includes both endogenous plan levels and endogenous prices.

Title: Achieving Macroeconomic Goals
Abstract: Two basic approaches to using dynamic econometric models to formulate macroeconomic policy are generally in use. These are: invertible transfer function methodology and optimal control methodology. In this paper a technique for determining dynamic growth paths is presented. The result of the application of this technique is the synthesis of the two approaches into a single approach yielding a policy with more desirable characteristics than was previously possible. An example of the use of this synthesis technique using Pindyck's model is presented.

Title: Inventory and Price Behaviour
Abstract: The point of this paper is that inventory adjustment attenuates downward pressure on price when realized demand is low because firms accumulate inventory hold-overs, speculating that demand will be stronger in the succeeding period. When realized demand is high the firm draws down its inventories until a "stock-out" occurs and price rises to clear the market.

Title: Nonbinary Social Choice: An Impossibility Theorem
Abstract: This paper contains a generalization of the General Possibility Theorem to situations where choice over two-element (more generally, "small") sets is not possible. The analysis is developed in terms of the social choice function formulation rather than the social welfare function approach. In this formulation, assumptions concerning the size of sets of feasible alternatives are explicit, allowing the role of these assumptions in inducing impossibility results to be explored.

Title: Testing for Sample Selection Bias
Abstract: A simple regression test of the null hypothesis of no sample selection bias has been suggested by J. J. Heckman. Because of its computational simplicity, this test is widely used by applied researchers. This paper shows that Heckman's test is equivalent to the Lagrange multiplier test of the null hypothesis. This allows us to readily deduce that the simple regression test also has desirable large sample properties.

Title: Imperfect Price Discrimination and Welfare
Abstract: We develop a model in which a monopolist uses differences across consumers in their valuation of time to imperfectly price discriminate. Though it is customary to analyse price discrimination problems by the calculus of variations after postulating a continuum of types, we assume a finite number of types and exploit the geometry and duality of the contract set and the structure of the programming specification. We analyse in detail the qualitative properties of the model's solution and show by construction that our results exhaust the implications of the model for equilibrium contract pairs. We show that imperfect discrimination is not bounded in welfare terms between perfect discrimination and single-price monopoly and that the deadweight loss, consumer surplus and output comparisons between single-price monopoly and imperfect discrimination are ambiguous.

Title: The Comparison of Multi-Dimensioned Distributions of Economic Status
Abstract: The literature on inequality measurement has been largely concerned with single-dimensioned indicators. This paper explores some of the issues which arise when there are several dimensions to inequality, and these are not readily reduced to a single index, concentrating particularly on the two-dimensioned case. We make use of results on multi-variate stochastic dominance in portfolio theory, extending these and applying them to the measurement of inequality. The use of the dominance conditions is illustrated by an application to the international distribution of income and life expectancy.

Title: Search and Consumer Theory
Abstract: A consumer faces list prices for commodities, but can buy one at a discount. Discounts vary randomly between sellers. The number of quotations sought depends on list prices, search costs and wealth. This function is homogeneous of degree zero, and, provided some sufficient conditions are satisfied, is; increasing in wealth; decreasing in search cost; independent of the list price of the discounted commodity if indirect utility is multiplicatively separable; increasing in the list price if the commodity is a necessity; increasing in the list price of substitutes. Slutsky's equation is generalized to include search.

Title: Wage Determination and Efficiency in Search Equilibrium
Abstract: Using a simple search technology and the Nash bargaining solution, the paper derives the steady state equilibrium negotiated wage as a function of the equilibrium unemployment and vacancy rates. For this wage, the lifetime expected present discounted value of earnings of a new worker is compared with the social marginal product of a new worker. These are not generally equal implying inefficient incentives for labour mobility.

Title: A Generalized Model of Pricing for Homogeneous Goods under Imperfect Information
Abstract: This paper generalizes the model developed in Wilde and Schwartz (1979) to allow downward sloping demand curves and u-shaped average cost curves. It shows that the basic qualitative conclusions of Wilde and Schwartz still hold. Moreover, it shows that the critical proportion of comparison shoppers needed to generate a competitive equilibrium falls as demand becomes more elastic or average costs become more inelastic. Finally, it shows that when imperfect information generates non-competitive outcomes, they are bounded below, in welfare terms, by the monopolistically competitive equilibrium.

Title: The Inefficiency of the Stock Market Equilibrium
Abstract: This paper establishes that when there is not a complete set of markets but more than one commodity the stock market equilibrium will not in general be a constrained Pareto optimum. The economy will lack both the property of exchange and production efficiency. Necessary conditions which must be satisfied if the economy is to be a constrained Pareto optimum for all technologies are derived; if all individuals have identical, homothetic indifference maps, then either there must be unitary price elasticities (so there is no effective risk) or all individuals must have the same degree of risk aversion (so there is no trade on the stock market).

Title: "Learning by Doing" and "Investment in Training": A Synthesis of Two "Rival" Models of the Life Cycle
Abstract: This paper provides a theoretical synthesis of recent discussions of "learning by doing" and "investment in training" as alternative forms of human capital accumulation. These theoretical notions relate to essentially different phenomena; in particular, pace Becker and Mincer, "investment in training" does not completely encompass "learning by doing". The paper then develops a model in which human capital accumulation occurs via both "training" and "learning by doing". The joint training-learning model, since it is more general then "pure" models in which all accumulation occurs via either training or learning, avoids certain restrictive and seemingly implausible implications of either kind of "pure" model. However, the joint model also has implications that, while compatible with stylized facts about the life cycle, are sharper than those of either kind of pure model. (For example, the joint model implies that market time and earnings must rise early in the life cycle, while neither pure model without "corners" does so.) Finally, the notion of learning by doing provides a rationale for an empirical finding that has recently received attention, to the effect that the rate of depreciation of human capital is not constant, but rather depends on the extent to which it is used in market activities.

Abstract: Alternative methods of computing estimates of inequality measures from grouped data are critically examined in terms of their theoretical and empirical properties. The use of a simple "split-histogram" technique of interpolation is explained and supported. Theoretical and empirical support is also provided for the "⅓/⅔ rule"—a simple computational procedure for a point estimate of an inequality measure derived from its standard grouping bounds.

Title: Risk Aversion and Optimal Trade Restrictions
Abstract: If the representative consumer of a country is risk averse then the choice of trade controls must take account of their effects on the fluctuations of domestic real income. If the world price of the importable is uncertain and risk aversion is high then the optimal policy for achieving a ceiling on expected imports involves a reduction in imports and a rise in the domestic price as the world price falls. Moreover, a quota is superior to a tariff in achieving the ceiling. Under domestic uncertainty, a tariff is superior to a quota but it could be optimal to reduce the domestic price as imports increase.

Title: Determinateness of the Utility Function: Revisiting a Controversy of the Thirties
Abstract: It has been alleged that, contrary to the assumptions in Pareto's Manual, the ability to compare first-differences of utility implies cardinality. It is shown here that the validity of this theorem hinges critically on the framework of analysis. In the framework of the thirties it is valid because of the implicit use of an ‘unrestricted domain’ assumption. In the modern choice-theoretic context it is not in general true but it becomes valid if utility functions are continuous and are defined on a connected topological space.

Title: Monopolistic Competition in a Large Economy with Differentiated Commodities: A Correction
Abstract: In Hart (1979), a model of monopolistic competition in a large economy with differentiated commodities was developed. In this model, firms had a choice whether to set up or not. One feature of the model was that free entry of firms was not assumed. Barriers to entry were captured by assuming that there was a large (generally, infinite) set of potential firms F. Corresponding to each f ∊ F, there was a firm (called "firm f") with a production set Y(f). Each firm had a set-up cost associated with it. Only very weak conditions were placed on the set F and the production set mapping Y(·), so that in particular the case where different firms could produce a commodity on different terms was allowed for. The economy was made large by replicating the consumer sector, keeping the production sector, i.e. the set of potential firms F, fixed. The number of operating firms in equilibrium generally increased, however, since in view of the set-up costs there was "room" for more firms in a large economy. Unfortunately, it turns out that this procedure, while correct, does not capture quite what was intended. In particular, while in the resulting monopolistically competitive equlibrium, some firms will earn supernormal profits, it can be shown that, for any η &gt; 0, the per capita number of firms earning profits in excess of η tends to zero as the size of the consumer sector tends to infinity (see Corollary 6 in the Appendix to Hart (1979)). In other words, in per capita terms, almost all firms earn approximately zero profits in a large economy. Thus while barriers to entry may be significant in absolute terms, in per capita terms they are negligible. The way round this difficulty is to drop the assumption that the set of potential firms is fixed. Instead substitute the assumption that the set of potential firms in the economy rE, where the consumer sector is replicated r times, is given bywhere F is as before. That is, one replicates the set of potential firms at the same time as the consumer sector. Then the theorems of Hart (1979) continue to hold. Corollary 6 in the Appendix must be modified as follows. Corollary 6′. There exists h &gt; 0 such thatfor all f ∊ F. Corollary 6′ is proved below. Otherwise the proofs of Theorem 1 and Proposition 2 are unchanged (one no longer sets h = 1 after Corollary 6). As an example, F might consist of one firm with an efficient technology for producing some commodity and one firm with an inefficient technology. Then in the economy rE, there will be r potential firms with the efficient technology and r potential firms with the inefficient technology. It is easy to construct cases where both types of firms operate in the monopolistically competitive equilibrium in rE and the efficient firms earn supernormal profits which are bounded away from zero as r → ∞. Thus barriers to entry which are significant in per capita terms are now allowed for. A justification for replicating F along with the consumer sector can be given. In the above example, the efficient firms may owe their superior technology to the fact that they are situated on good land, say, of which there is a scarcity (thus the supernormal profits are just rents on the land). When one replicates the economy, it is natural to replicate the scarce land and hence the number of firms which are situated on it, so as to keep everything constant except for scale. Note finally that it may be possible to generalize the analysis to the case where the set of potential firms in the economy rE is given by rF, where 1F, 2F are exogenously specified sets and rF is not necessarily the r-fold union of some set F. We have not investigated this, however. Proof of Corollary 6′. Suppose not. Then for each h &gt; 0, we can find f ∊ F with . By Lemma 5 (2), rπf &gt; h for all r ≧ some r*. But in rE there are r firms identical to firm f and so each of these firms makes profit in excess of h in the monopolistically competitive equilibrium when r ≧ r*. Hence total per capita profits of all firms exceed h in equilibrium when r ≧ r*. It follows that, letting h → ∞, we can find a subsequence of the economies rE such that total per capita profits tend to infinity along the subsequence. However, applying Corollary 4 and an argument similar to that in (A.30)–(A.32), we see that ʃArp(a)drY1(a) is bounded. Hence so are per capita profits, ʃArp(a)drY1(a) + rY0. Contradiction. ||

Title: A Theory of Wage Dynamics
Abstract: A dynamic, equilibrium model of long term (implicit) labour contracts under incomplete but symmetric information is developed. Workers are assumed to be risk averse and of unknown ability or productivity. Risk neutral firms learn, as do workers, about each worker's productivity by observing the worker's output over time. It is shown that equilibrium contracts provide for wages which never decline with age and increase only when the worker's market value increases above his current wage. In addition to characterizing the equilibrium wage contract, we also derive some of its implications for the behaviour of aggregate wages across various groups of workers. These implications explain some findings in the recent empirical literature on age-earnings profiles. In particular our model can explain why earnings may be positively related to experience even after controlling for productivity, as some empirical studies have indicated.

Title: Estimation of a Labour Supply Model with Censoring Due to Unemployment and Underemployment
Abstract: This study proposes and implements a method of labour supply estimation which is appropriate when the sample contains unemployed and underemployed workers. The estimation method consists of excluding unemployed and underemployed workers from the sample and then using (to avoid selection bias) an extension of Heckman's approach to the case where two correlated selection rules generate the sample. Hausman's specification test is then used to determine whether ignoring constrained workers has led to biases in traditional labour supply estimates, and the empirical results suggest that previous estimates of several important parameters are biased. Since the biases go in the direction that would be predicted by the hypothesis that the unemployed and underemployed are constrained, the results support this hypothesis.

Title: Some Approaches to the Correction of Selectivity Bias
Abstract: This article addresses the issue of specification of econometric selectivity models and suggests approaches for the correction of selectivity bias. Our approaches provide ways to specify selectivity models without the assumption of multinormal distribution. Some flexible function forms for the correction of selectivity bias in the regression equation are derived. All the models considered can be estimated by simple consistent two stage methods. Our approaches provide simple procedures for the testing of selectivity bias without imposing restrictive distributional assumptions and also tests for the normality assumption.

Title: Information and Incentives: The Agency Information Problem
Abstract: This paper considers the use of imperfect information for risk sharing and incentive purposes when perfect observation of actions and outcomes is impossible, making complete contracting infeasible. The incentive-insurance problem is defined to consist of two parts: the choice of an information system and the design of a sharing rule based on the information system. A generalized agency model is formulated to analyse this problem. The agency models of Ross (1973a, b), Wilson (1968), Stiglitz (1974), Mirrlees (1976), Harris and Raviv (1979), Holmström (1979) a.o. appear as special cases of the generalized model. The analysis focuses on the value of information in the agency information problem. The set of information systems which are valuable—i.e. improve risk sharing and incentives in a Pareto sense—is characterized. A problem-independent ranking of information systems for the agency information problem is then characterized under the assumption that the agent's preferences are additive in money and actions. The ranking may be viewed as a generalization of Blackwell's ranking of information systems for decision problems, to this particular game. When the agent's risk preferences depend on his choice of action, on the other hand, it is shown that the Blackwell ranking may be invalid. Randomized incentive schemes are shown to be efficient when the incentive effect of risk is positive and sufficiently large relative to the absolute risk aversion of the partners.

Title: Price Discrimination Based On Imperfect Information: Necessary and Sufficient Conditions
Abstract: Usually, the information a buyer requires in order to obtain the lowest price must be produced at a cost depending on the efficiency with which the buyers gather information. Thus, a suitable price dispersion enables a monopolist to split up the market to permit a more profitable price discrimination. In this paper, necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a non-trivial profit maximizing price dispersion are considered. Furthermore, the relationship between statistical properties of the set of consumers' characteristics and this existence problem are studied.

Title: True and Spurious Duration Dependence: The Identifiability of the Proportional Hazard Model
Abstract: Lancaster and Nickell (1980) have argued that in the proportional hazard model the effects of time dependence (true duration dependence) and unobserved sample heterogeneity (spurious duration dependence) cannot be distinguished. We show that both effects can be distinguished if the model allows for observed explanatory variables in the hazard. We also discuss the application of our result to practical situations.

Title: Integrability of Incomplete Systems of Demand Functions
Abstract: The problem of integrating back from an incomplete set of demand functions to a utility function is considered. Conditions permitting local integrability are analogous to those which arise in local integrability theorems for complete systems. But the analysis of the global integrability of incomplete systems differs markedly from that of complete systems.

Title: Stochastic Dominance and the Investment Horizon With Riskless Assets
Abstract: This paper analyses the relationship between the efficient sets of investment portfolios and the investment holding period. Investors are allowed to hold risky assets as well as the riskless asset. The main result is that dominance in each period implies dominance in the multiperiod case. This finding holds with respect to first, second and third degree stochastic dominance. The riskless interest rate may vary from one period to another without changing the results of this paper.

Title: Implementation of Democratic Social Choice Functions
Abstract: A social choice function is said to be implementable if and only if there exists a game form such that for all preference profiles an equilibrium strategy n-tuple exists and any equilibrium strategy n-tuples of the game yield outcomes in the social choice set. A social choice function is defined to be minimally democratic if and only if whenever there exists an alternative which is ranked first by n − 1 voters and is no lower than second for the last voter, then the social choice must be uniquely that alternative. No constraints are placed on the social choice function for other preference profiles. Using the classical definitions of equilibria for n-person games—namely Nash and strong equilibria, it is shown here that over unrestricted preference domains, as long as there are at least as many alternatives as individuals, no minimally democratic social choice function is implementable. A similar result holds in certain restricted domains of the type assumed by economists over public goods spaces. We then show that a different notion of equilibrium—namely that of sophisticated equilibrium—allows for implementation of democratic social choice functions also having further appealing properties.

Title: Stability of the Neumann Ray in a Dynamic Leontief System with Finite Forecast Horizons
Abstract: This paper considers whether the dynamic stability of the steady-state growth path, deduced in various models under the assumption of perfect foresight, can be sustained if foresight is imperfect. Using a dynamic Leontief system as the framework and measuring the degrees of goodness of foresight by the length of the forecast horizon, the paper derives an affirmative answer. The result can also be interpreted as asserting that the Neumann ray serves as a turnpike for a rolling plan of a long planning horizon.

Title: An Equilibrium Analysis of Wage—Productivity Gaps
Abstract: We develop a model in which each firm chooses a hiring standard as well as a wage schedule and an application fee, we then characterize the set of Nash equilibria, and establish necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of equilibrium. If the distribution of productivities within each ability type is Gaussian, workers who pass the test will be paid more than the value of their marginal product, while workers who fail the test will receive a wage, net of the application fee, below the value of their marginal product.

Title: Prices and Qualities in Markets with Costly Information
Abstract: This paper extends the seminal work of Akerlof, and Salop and Stiglitz in two directions: (i) the sellers can select both the selling prices and quality levels of their good, and (ii) the buyers can acquire price/quality information about individual sellers at a cost. We observe multiple price/quality combinations in equilibrium, which depend upon the distribution of information costs of consumers and upon whether quality, or price, or both are costly observable. Welfare comparisons of equilibrium are considered. We show that welfare will be greater when price advertising is permitted.

Title: Monopolistic Price Adjustment and Aggregate Output
Abstract: This paper studies the consequences for the behaviour of aggregate output of the perception on the part of firms that changing prices is costly. The rational expectations equilibrium of an economy with many such firms is constructed. It is shown that in this economy nominal shocks have a persistent effect on aggregate output. Furthermore, the real wage is demonstrated to move procyclically in such an economy.

Also generalized are the tests proposed by Sargan and Bhargava for the hypothesis that the residuals form a random walk. A method for efficient estimation of the parameters is also developed. Finally, an earnings function is estimated using the Michigan Survey of Income Dynamics in order to illustrate the uses of the tests and the estimation procedures developed in this paper.

Title: Some Non-Nested Hypothesis Tests and the Relations Among Them
Abstract: In this paper we discuss several statistical techniques which may be used to test the validity of a possibly non-linear and multivariate regression model, using the information provided by estimating one or more alternative models on the same set of data. We first exposit, from a different perspective, the tests proposed by us in Davidson and MacKinnon (1981a), and discuss modified versions of these tests and extensions of them to the multivariate case. We then prove that all these tests, and also the tests previously proposed by Pesaran (1974) and Pesaran and Deaton (1978), based on the work of Cox (1961, 1962), are asymptotically equivalent under certain conditions. Finally, we present the results of a sampling experiment which shows that different tests can behave quite differently in small samples.

Title: Invention and Innovation Under Alternative Market Structures: The Case of Natural Resources
Abstract: This paper examines the interactions between market structure and resource allocation over time when there is endogenous technical progress. The structures considered are a planned economy, pure monopoly, and competition with patent rights. In an efficient allocation the date of invention coincides with the date of innovation (the date at which technology is used). This is also true with a pure monopoly, but monopoly retards technical progress relative to the efficient level. Competition for patents rights to a new technology results in excessively rapid technical progress if the resource endowment of the economy is sufficiently large. Also, competition may lead to "sleeping patents" where invention strictly precedes the date of innovation.

Title: Trade and Protection with Multistage Production
Abstract: This paper analyses trade in manuf acutured goods that are produced via a vertical production structure with many stages, where some value is added at each to an intermediate product to yield a good-in-process ready for the next stage. We consider the stage at which a good is traded to be an economically endogenous variable, with comparative advantage determining the pattern of production specialization by stages across countries. We study how endowment changes and policy shifts move the margin of comparative advantage, which thus provides a channel for resource allocation adjustment that is additional to the usual ones of factor substitution and changes in the quantity of output.

Title: Aggregate Investment and Consistent Intertemporal Technologies
Abstract: It is frequent practice to model an industry or economy as if it were a single agent solving a single optimization problem. A model of firm behavior which has had extensive use as an aggregative model is the adjustment cost model of investment. We assume there are a number of competitive firms in an industry that choose investment paths to maximize their present value; the technologies of the firms exhibit capital stock adjustment costs. For general concave technologies of the firms, there is no aggregate concave technology that can represent the technological possibilities available to the industry. We find conditions on the technologies of the firms that are necessary and sufficient for the existence of an aggregate technology that can consistently model the industry's behavior and discuss their empirical implications.

Title: Aggregate Production Functions Revisited: The Mobility of Capital and the Rigidity of Thought
Abstract: Past work on aggregation of production functions has focused on aggregation over firms where technology is embodied in fixed capital. This paper shows that much of the stringency of the necessary conditions for aggregation resides in the nature of aggregation over firms and not in the immobility of capital. Roughly, when capital is mobile, aggregation is permitted for any group of factors under the union of the conditions which otherwise applied to aggregation of fixed or aggregation of movable factors, respectively. No truly new conditions appear. The results are also interpreted in terms of output aggregation.

Title: On the Sign of the Optimum Marginal Income Tax
Abstract: This paper studies a central aspect of optimal income taxation as modelled in Mirrlees' original paper on the topic (identical leisure/consumption preferences, qualitatively homogeneous "skills" in production), namely, whether given concave utilitarianism alone the optimal marginal income tax will be non-negative. A well-known positive answer to this question (in weak inequality form) was given in the said paper which, however, we show requires additive separability of Individual utility (in the ordinal and cardinal senses). Our main result here is to derive the required (strict) positivity of the marginal tax under weak conditions, slightly wider than noninferiority of consumption and leisure, with preferences otherwise arbitrary.

Title: Ambiguities in the Sign of Excess Effective Demand by Firms
Abstract: Can we state that at a given Benassy Fixprice Allocation z* there is, say, excess effective demand for a commodity? It turns out that in productive economies there may be ambiguities in the sign of excess effective demand: different effective demand vectors with different signs, may be compatible with z*. We prove: (a) no ambiguity exists if intermediate goods are ruled out and if all firms in the long side of a market perceive binding constraints; (b) in any case one can always select a vector of effective demands yielding minimal sets of buyer's and seller's markets.

Title: Catastrophic Walrasian Equilibrium from the Non-Walrasian Viewpoint: A Three-good Macroeconomic Example
Abstract: A Walrasian equilibrium is catastrophic from the non-Walrasian viewpoint if some small deviation from the Walrasian prices produces only non-Walrasian equilibrium allocations a long way from the Walrasian allocation. A precise account of this phenomenon is given for a class of three good, single household private ownership production economies.

Title: Input Price Shocks and the Slowdown in Economic Growth: The Case of U.K. Manufacturing
Abstract: This paper provides a theoretical and empirical analysis of the effects of input price shocks on economic growth, with a focus on United Kingdom manufacturing in the 1970s. The theoretical model predicts a discrete decline in output and productivity after an input price rise, and a longer-run slowdown in productivity growth, real wage growth, and capital accumulation. These features characterize the United Kingdom and most other OECD economies after 1973. The empirical results confirm the important role of input prices in recent U.K. adjustment, but also point to an important role for other supply and demand factors.

Title: Causes of the Current Stagflation
Abstract: Since 1975 labour slack has been unusually high in the OECD countries, and yet inflation has not diminished. The less favourable mix of unemployment and rate of change of inflation (which we call stagflation) is explained by a fall in the feasible rate of growth of real wages unmatched by a reduction in the constant term in Phillips curve. To investigate this mechanism, conventional wage and price equations are estimated for 19 countries and then used for simulation. Stagflation has been caused in roughly equal amounts by rising relative import prices and by the fall in the rate of productivity growth. In the basic model the Phillips curve is assumed not to adapt to falls in feasible real wage growth, but in a final section an adaptive wage equation is estimated, which confirms that the process of adaptation is slow.

Title: Unemployment in the United Kingdom Since the War
Abstract: In this paper, we first present a competitive macroeconomic model of an open economy which is suitable for estimation and contrast this with a non-competitive model. We then derive unemployment equations from the various models and estimate them over annual data from 1948–1979. We draw the following conclusions. (i) The competitive model of the labour market does not fit the facts. (ii) The non-competitive model generates an equation for the constant inflation rate of unemployment which reveals how, at certain times such as the mid 1970s, a combination of factors conspired to raise this level forcing the government into a deflationary stance to prevent inflation rising drastically. (iii) A number of factors have raised the level of unemployment in a secular fashion since the war, in particular the increase in the variation of relative prices, the increase in the benefit to income ratio, the introduction of employment protection legislation and the rise in the intersectoral shifts of the labour force.

Title: Time Series Representations of Economic Variables and Alternative Models of the Labour Market
Abstract: Accepting the hypothesis that the time-series "facts" of the aggregate labour market may be summarized by the linear autoregressive and moving average representations of wages, prices, unemployment, and interest rates implies that a useful theory ought to lead to predictions about these representations. Following this approach, this paper first catalogues many of the time-series facts about the aggregate labour market and then compares them against alternative models of the labour market based on the intertemporal substitution and staggered contract hypotheses.

Title: The Intertemporal Substitution Model of Labour Market Fluctuations: An Empirical Analysis
Abstract: The paper uses two approaches to study whether aggregate fluctuations in employment and unemployment may be explained within a market clearing framework as intertemporal substitution in labour supply. First, log-linear equations for labour supply and unemployment are estimated using a forecasting model to measure wage and price expectations. Second, a utility function is used to derive and estimate an equation for labour supply as a function of the current real wage and consumption. The influence of expected future real wages and interest rates is captured by the consumption variable. The empirical results do not support the intertemporal substitution model.

Title: Labour Force Participation: Timing and Persistence
Abstract: This paper examines the relative importance of timing and persistence elements in explaining cyclical fluctuations in labour supply. Data from the natural experiment provided by World War II and cross-sectional data on American local labour markets, as well as aggregate time-series data are used in the empirical work. We find little evidence that timing effects play an important role in labour market dynamics. The evidence suggests that views emphasizing persistence are more accurate, and that previous employment tends to raise the probability of subsequent employment.

Title: Energy and Resource Allocation: A Dynamic Model of the "Dutch Disease"
Abstract: It is well known that a domestic resource discovery gives rise to wealth effects that cause a squeeze of the tradeable good sector of an open economy. The decline of the manufacturing sector following an energy discovery has been termed the "Dutch disease", and has been investigated in many recent studies. Our model extends the principally static analyses to date by allowing for: (1) short-run capital specificity and long-run capital mobility; (2) international capital flows; and (3) far-sighted intertemporal optimizing behaviour by households and firms. The model is solved by numerical simulation.
