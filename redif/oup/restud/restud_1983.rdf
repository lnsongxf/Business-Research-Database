Title: Optimal Labour Contracts under Asymmetric Information: An Introduction
Abstract: The Review of Economic Studies has instituted a new series of lectures to be given annually by a "younger" British economist at the Association of University Teachers of Economics Meetings. The choice of lecturer is determined by a panel whose members are currently Professors Hahn, Mirrlees and Nobay. This paper is a revised version of the first lecture in the series. It was presented at the AUTE Meeting held at the University of Surrey in April 1982, and was refereed in the usual way.—MAK.

Title: Non-uniform Pricing, Output and Welfare under Monopoly
Abstract: A monopolist may earn greater profits by setting a nonuniform price schedule (one in which the price varies with the quantity purchased) than by charging a uniform price. In general, the profit maximizing non-uniform price schedule and the welfare maximizing schedule do not coincide. Thus, there may be scope for improving market performance through regulation. The paper considers a regulator who has limited information and authority. The issues addressed centre around the question of whether the level of total market output can be taken as a measure of market performance. Conditions under which welfare is a monotonic function of the level of total output are derived.

Title: Efficiency Aspects of the Financing of Unemployment Insurance and Other Government Expenditure
Abstract: This paper argues that if the disincentive effects of unemployment insurance result from higher reservation wages, they may be eliminated by financing benefits with a progressive income tax. The result is obtained within an equilibrium model with stochastic job matchings. An optimal tax formula is derived for a linear income tax, and shown to imply that the average tax rate should increase faster with income the higher the level of UI benefits relative to other government expenditure. In some cases optimal financing may require the subsidization of low-wage jobs.

Title: Total Utility, Overlapping Generations and Optimal Population
Abstract: The necessary and sufficient conditions for the solution to an optimal population growth model with overlapping generations, using the sum of total utility per generation as the objective function are derived. The solution for a specific, steady state model and an example are presented, and compared to that for a similar model without overlapping generations. In both cases, a positive, but less than infinite, optimal growth rate is found. Next, since an additively separable individual utility function is used, the differences between a total utility per generation model and a total utility per period model, a la Lerner, are discussed. Finally, the results of the total utility model are compared to those from a model in which the discounted sum of per capita utility is the objective function. An extension to the Samuelson-Lerner Utility Paradox, concerning the optimal rate of population growth, is discussed.

Title: Price Smoothing and Inventory
Abstract: This paper explains the phenomenon of price rigidity (or price smoothing) as the outcome of the optimal inventory policy of a multi-period profit-maximizing firm under demand and output uncertainties. Price smoothing may be manifested in two forms. First, price changes may be moderated with respect to those implied by the demand function; and second, the firm may choose to restrict price fluctuations by establishing upper and/or lower bounds on prices. We show that the extent of the asymmetry in price smoothing depends on the relationship between the inventory holding cost and the backlog penalty cost. Our model accommodates a wide range of price behaviour as observed in empirical studies on the issue.

Title: Small-Sample Properties of Estimators of Regression Coefficients Given a Common Pattern of Missing Data
Abstract: For a commonly occurring pattern of missing data, estimators of regression coefficients are derived by a non-likelihood method. The small-sample properties are investigated for the case of normality assumptions. The estimators are shown to be unbiased, exact small-sample variance formulae are derived, comparisons are made with ordinary least-squares estimators and it is demonstrated that the estimators can be more efficient than maximum-likelihood estimators in small samples.

Title: Defects in Disneyland: Quality Control as a Two-Part Tariff
Abstract: This paper shows that firms endowed with monopoly power can utilize an optional service contract form of guarantee as an instrument for effecting a surplus extracting two-part tariff. The monopolist finds it optimal to produce, guarantee and replace defective units, even if a zero defect rate could be achieved at no additional production cost. It is also shown that the price per unit is greater than the "effective" marginal cost; it may even be higher than the pure monopoly price. Moreover the monopolist is unable to extract all of the consumers surplus. Thus, that optional service contract policy can provide an effective yet defensible form of price discrimination as an alternative to possible illegal tie-ins, quantity discounts and simple two-part tariffs.

Title: Reproductive Behaviour in Peasant Societies: A Theoretical and Empirical Analysis
Abstract: An optimal policy is derived for a sequential family size decision making problem. It is shown that households will follow a stopping rule, replacing dead children until an optimal number of living children is reached. The behavioural equation derived from the optimal policy is then used to explain retrospective household data collected in Bangladesh in 1977–1978. This data provides some support for the underlying hypothesis.

Title: Dynamic Optimization with a Non-Convex Technology: The Case of a Linear Objective Function
Abstract: The paper studies the problem of optimal intertemporal allocation in an aggregative model with a non-convex technology set and a discounted sum of consumptions as the objective function. The study demonstrates the existence of a threshold initial stock such that the long-run behaviour of optimal programmes depends critically on whether the initial stock is, above or below the threshold. This is in contrast with the standard turnpike theory of convex models in which the long-run behaviour of optimal programmes is independent of the initial stock.

Title: Straightforward Elections, Unanimity and Phantom Voters
Abstract: Non-manipulable direct revelation social choice functions are characterized for societies where the space of alternatives is a euclidean space and all voters have separable star-shaped preferences with a global optimum. If a non-manipulable choice function satisfies a weak unanmity-respecting condition (which is equivalent to having an unrestricted range) then it will depend only on voters' ideal points. Further, such a choice function will decompose into a product of one-dimensional mechanisms in the sense that each coordinate of the chosen point depends only on the respective coordinate of the voters' ideal points. Each coordinate function will also be non-manipulable and respect unanimity. Such one-dimensional mechanisms are uncompromising in the sense that voters cannot take an extreme position to influence the choice to their advantage. Two characterizations of uncompromising choice functions are presented. One is in terms of a continuity condition, the other in terms of "phantom voters" i.e. those points which are chosen which are not any voter's ideal point. There are many such mechanisms which are not dictatorial. However, if differentiability is required of the choice function, this forces it to be either constant or dictatorial. In the multidimensional case, non-separability of preferences leads to dictatorship, even if preferences are restricted to be quadratic.

Title: A Characterization of Strongly Locally Incentive Compatible Planning Procedures with Public Goods
Abstract: This paper provides a systematic study of planning procedures with public goods in which local truthful revelation of preferences is a dominant strategy. These procedures are said to be strongly locally individually incentive compatible (SLIIC). We first characterize the (time invariant) continuously differentiable planning procedures that are SLIIC. Then, we study properties such as balancedness, cheatproofness with respect to coalitions, neutrality, individual rationality and we point out the connection with the MDP procedures.

Title: Myopic Versus Intertemporal Manipulation in Decentralized Planning Procedures
Abstract: Manipulation is studied in abstract planning procedures in exchange economies with private goods and a generalization of the results of Champsaur-Laroque (1980) is obtained. When the Nash equilibrium corresponding to myopic manipulation is unique, the outcome of consistent intertemporal manipulation on a time interval [0, T] is characterized. It is shown that when T goes to infinity, the resulting allocation tends towards a competitive equilibrium. For T equal to infinity, there exists a Nash equilibrium only when the initial allocation is Pareto-optimal.

Title: On the Simultaneous Existence of Full and Partial Capital Aggregates
Abstract: Earlier work on aggregate production functions with capital-embodied technology showed that, when firms employ more than one capital type, conditions for partial capital ("equipment") aggregation and for total capital aggregation differ. This paper studies simultaneously existing partial and total aggregates. Existence of a total and one partial aggregate implies existence of the complementary partial aggregate. However, simultaneous existence requires each firm's production function to be strongly separable in its capital subaggregates. The use of subaggregates like "equipment" and "plant" together with an aggregate "capital" thus implies that "plant" and "equipment" are perfect substitutes and is highly questionable.

Title: Non-joint Technologies
Abstract: The hypothesis of non-jointness in input quantities (separate production functions) is well-known, and it plays an important role in many areas of economics. In this paper we define three additional forms of non-jointness which have received little or no attention in the literature, and which might be relevant for the firm as well as for the representation of the aggregate technology. We characterize all forms of non-jointness in terms of variable profit and joint cost functions. This yields a number of restrictions which are all testable empirically.

Title: Sequential Bargaining with Incomplete Information
Abstract: This paper describes a simple two-person, two-period bargaining game, and solves it using the concept of perfect Bayesian equilibrium, in which the actions of each player convey information which is used by his opponent. The paper examines the effects of changes in bargaining costs, the size of the "contract zone" and the length of the bargaining process on such aspects of the solution as the probability of impasse and the likelihood of concessions. The combination of information transfer and the lack of pre-commitment embodied in perfectness yields many surprising results. Common perceptions about the effects of parameter changes on bargaining processes are suspect, and should be checked in the particular game being discussed.

Title: The Time Pattern of Hedging and the Volatility of Futures Prices
Abstract: The paper proposes a multi-period model of hedging which allows for a futures position to be revised within the cash market holding period. Within this framework, we assess the robustness of the two-period theory of hedging when generalized to many periods. We characterize the normal time path of a hedge and the way it is affected by the requirement that futures accounts "mark to market" daily. Finally we show how the resolution of production uncertainty over time affects hedging behavior and determines the volatility of futures prices.

Title: Expectations Equilibria with Dispersed Information: Existence with Approximate Rationality in a Model with a Continuum of Agents and Finitely Many States of the World
Abstract: A model of a large economy in which prices transmit information (about the "state of the world" which is an argument in consumers' utility functions) from more informed to less informed agents is analysed. The basic hypothesis is that the forecast functions of imperfectly informed agents are suitably dispersed. For any such distribution of forecasts, market clearing prices exist. Moreover, there is always an equilibrium in which each agent's expectations are approximately rational.

Title: Asymptotic Properties of Instrumental Variables Statistics for Testing Non-Nested Hypotheses
Abstract: This paper develops Instrumental Variables statistics for testing non-nested hypotheses when the hypotheses considered are single equations from a system of linear dynamic simultaneous equations. Asymptotic distributions of those statistics and of comparable Maximum Likelihood statistics are derived under the null hypothesis, a local non-nested alternative hypothesis, and a local "comprehensive" alternative hypothesis. The asymptotic powers of the non-nested hypothesis tests are compared with those of tests of nested hypotheses, and a numerical application is given.

Title: Innovation and Communication: Signalling with Partial Disclosure
Abstract: This paper introduces a model of "feedback effect equilibrium" i.e. equilibria in which an asymmetrically informed agent is motivated to communicate its privately known attribute but can do so only through channels or signals which convey directly useful information to competing agents. This revelation to the competition serves to reduce the value of the private information held by the first agent. Models of this kind are of obvious relevance to realistic theories of product or financial market disclosure policies of firms, patenting, and a host of related behavioural and regulatory issues. This model is developed in the context of a set of firms engaged in research and development rivalry, in which the value of privately held and disclosed information arises from its implications for the likelihood and timing of productive innovation.

The indirect expected utility and expenditure functions are used to provide an extremely simple derivation of Slutsky equations by obtaining results similar to Roy's Identity and Shephard's Lemma. The substitutability/complementarity relations among assets are investigated, and a number of empirically testable implications are deduced from the properties of the expenditure function.

Title: Acceptable Versus Straightforward Game Forms: An Example
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the design of non-cooperative game forms for economic decision problems. A decision problem is presented which admits non-dictatorial game forms with the following properties: Nash equilibria exist and all Nash equilibrium outcomes are Pareto optimal; or dominant strategies exist and all dominant strategy equilibria are Pareto optimal; but not both. This is, any (non-dictatorial) game form whose Nash equilibria are well behaved does not have dominant strategies, and any game form with well behaved dominant strategy equilibria must have at least one non-optimal non-dominant strategy Nash equilibrium.

Abstract: There are many situations where agents supply input factors and produce a transferable good (money). This paper examines the conditions on technology under which agents can specify reward schedules which lead to an efficient outcome even if inputs are chosen non-cooperatively and preferences are private information. The characterisation of the class of technologies that allows this involves a generalization of additivity known as (n − 1)-additivity.

Title: Testing Restrictions in a Flexible Dynamic Demand System: An Application to Consumers' Expenditure in Canada
Abstract: Traditionally, restrictions on systems of demand equations have been tested using static models, whilst being estimated with time series data. This paper develops a vector time series model of expenditure shares in the context of a singular dynamic demand system. The model allows for non-symmetric and non-homogeneous short run behaviour. The homogeneity and symmetry restrictions are only examined in the long run structure. Results based on Canadian time series data are presented and reject the current practise of static modelling while restrictions suggested by economic theory are not rejected when imposed on the long run structure.

Abstract: This paper presents a simple, multistage model of bargaining wherein a seller makes an offer that can be either accepted or refused. If rejected, the process continues. How the seller's ability to make commitments affects bargaining outcomes is analysed by comparing the commitment equilibria to those arising when commitment is impossible. The effects of increasing uncertainty about preferences and varying the length of the bargaining horizon are analysed. The ways in which the bargaining environment can be changed to improve outcomes are discussed.

Title: A Simple Competitive Model with Production and Storage
Abstract: We study a rational expectations partial equilibrium model of a market for a single storable commodity whose output each period is a function of previous period effort on production and a realization of a shock that affects equally all producers. The final demand is non-random and depends only on each period's price. Risk-neutral producers make production and storage decisions based on forecasts of future price distributions. Existence of equilibrium is proved, and for the case of i.i.d. shocks several comparative statics results are established as well as the existence and stability of a unique stationary distribution.

Title: Price Dispersion and Stockpiling by Consumers
Abstract: This paper presents a model of equilibrium price dispersion in which buyers do not search. However they are able to store the non-durable commodity for future use. Such behaviour implies sellers' demand curves are endogenously generated by the observed price distribution. Equilibrium is shown to exist. Although more than one price may be charged in equilibrium, the monopoly price will occur with positive probability. Comparative static results are derived with a linear version of the model, some of which are "perverse".

Title: Housing Quality, Maintenance and Rehabilitation
Abstract: This paper investigates a representative landlord's profit-maximization problem in a stationary economy. The landlord must decide on the quality of his housing units at the time of construction, maintenance expenditure over the life of the building, and the time of demolition or rehabilitation. The analysis can be applied to other problems with similar economic structure, notably equipment and durable good maintenance, overhaul and replacement.

Title: Capacity and Entry Under Demand Uncertainty
Abstract: This paper examines the decision to enter into a sector dominated by a monopoly if demand is random at entry time. Given a two-period world, the monopolist enters initially and enjoys an uncontested monopoly for one period, while the entrant may enter and compete during the second period. Demand is random one period earlier and independently distributed in both periods and entry corresponds to an irreversible capacity choice, made under certain demand. All other production decisions take place after demand has been revealed. Risk-neutrality is assumed on both sides. If entry occurs then there is a Cournot duopoly in the second period. It is shown that concurrently with this Cournot production game, there is a separate Stackelberg-type game with capacities as decision variables. Entry-deterrence conditions are derived under general demand and cost assumptions. It is shown that demand uncertainty changes several of the results of similar certain demand models.

Title: Optimum Pricing Policy under Stochastic Inflation
Abstract: We describe aggregate inflation as a stochastic process in which the rate of change of the price level can be positive or zero, where the times spent in each state are of random duration. This class of processes includes Two-State Markov Chains and Renewal Processes as special cases. It is shown that the optimal pricing policy of a monopolistic firm with non-convex costs of price adjustment is (S, s) in its real-price, i.e. its nominal price relative to the price level. A basic certainty-equivalence result is proved: i.e. the firm behaves as if it faces a certain and fixed rate of inflation, higher than the actual expected rate, the difference between the two rates being a risk premium which depends on the real interest rate and the parameters of the stochastic process. One can thus apply previous results from the case of certainty (Sheshinski and Weiss, The Review of Economic Studies, 1977) to obtain comparative static results. In particular, one finds that an increase in the variance of expected inflation leads firms to choose a pricing policy with larger amplitude in real price. The paper also addresses the question of consistency in firms' expectations when the price level is determined by the firms' actions.

Title: A Theoretical Derivation of the Functional Form of Short Run Money Holdings
Abstract: This paper considers the short run adjustment of money holdings towards their desired levels. A rationale for short run money holdings is given, which allows for uncertainty in cash flows, and it is shown how the adjustment to desired money balances will occur following a change in some of the economic variables. The model generates a particular form for the short run demand for money function, which is shown to be econometrically superior to the standard ad hoc formulation. The chief theoretical novelty is the derivation of the appropriate transient probability density of money holdings.

Title: Optimal Consumption of a Nonrenewable Resource with Stochastic Discoveries and a Random Environment
Abstract: We present a general model for the optimal consumption of a nonrenewable resource under two kinds of uncertainties. One source of uncertainty is in the resource discovery process and the other is in the economic environment that affects resource supply and demand conditions, such as exhaustion and development of a substitute. The problem is formulated as one of optimally controlling a storage process with Markov additive discoveries. The optimal value of the resource stock is characterized as the solution of a functional equation and the existence of an optimal consumption policy is established. It is shown that, in a given environment, the optimal consumption rate is increasing and the resource price is decreasing in the level of proven reserves. A counterexample is provided to show that better environments may in fact mean higher prices and lower consumption rates. Finally, a variety of examples is given to illustrate the scope and applicability of the general model.

Title: The Usefulness of Demand Forecasts for Team Resource Allocation in a Dynamic Environment
Abstract: The efficiency of market information for planning resource allocation in "real time" is explored. In each period resources are allocated as planning for the next period proceeds. Full optimality is not possible, even when maximum information is exchanged between firms and resource allocators, as the technologies of the firms are changing. The major result shows that market-type information such as demands and especially demand forecasts is as good as full technological information to exchange.

Title: Assessing the Variability of Inflation
Abstract: Although there has been much argument over the impact of variable inflation rates upon economic performance, there has been surprisingly little attempt to define the term "variability of inflation" carefully or to test proposed hypotheses connecting variability and the level of inflation. Precise definitions are given in the paper and a model is constructed showing that the level/variability hypothesis may be formulated in terms of the presence of heteroscedasticity in a regression model. This theoretical model is used to criticize existing studies, while an empirical study with Australian data illustrates the application of the approach.

Title: Competitive Approximation of a Cournot Market
Abstract: Stimulated by the work of Novshek (1980), this paper concerns the accuracy of the competitive approximation to a Cournot market with free entry. Novshek took a static equilibrium approach to the problem. This paper takes a dynamic stochastic approach, one which allows persistent disequilibrium. It is argued that the alternative approach yields similar results with less effort and, in some senses, with greater generality.

Title: The Estimation of Models of Labour Market Behaviour
Abstract: In this paper we view the labour market experience of individuals as a process of movement between the states of employment and unemployment. We note that there are three main ways of sampling members of the labour force namely sampling the members of a specific state, sampling the people entering or leaving a state and sampling the population regardless of state. The joint distribution of observable and unobservable characteristics of individuals depends on the mode of sampling adopted. We examine this dependence and its implications for the interpretation of estimates of models of labour market behaviour.

Title: Market Structure and the Durability of Goods
Abstract: This paper compares the durability of goods produced in competitive and monopolistic markets. Durability is chosen to minimize the cost of providing a given present value of flow of services over the life of the durable. As pointed out by Swan, under constant returns to scale, the cost-minimizing durability is independent of the level of output; thus competitive firms will choose the same durability as a monopolist, even though they would produce different levels of output. In this paper, we relax the assumption of constant returns to scale and derive more general conditions under which optimal durability is independent of the level of output. We also demonstrate that with a particular specification of external diseconomies of scale, the monopolist will produce goods with greater durability than would be produced by competitive firms.

Title: Credit Rationing and Payment Incentives
Abstract: A model of borrowing for production is presented where default leads to exclusion from the capital market. This means contracts are enforceable, provided the current payment is less than or equal to the value of future access to the capital market. The main result of the paper is to show that if this constraint binds then credit is rationed.

Title: Prices as Signals of Product Quality
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the provision of quality in markets in which consumers have only imperfect information. The analysis focuses on a market for a product that can be produced at different quality levels. All consumers prefer higher to lower quality, but they may differ in their willingness to pay for quality. Producers can produce any quality they like, but higher qualities are more costly to produce. The information in this market is imperfect in the sense that the exact quality chosen by a firm is known only to the firm itself; some information about the quality of a firm's product will, however, reach its potential customers, even if they do not make any special effort to acquire it. Within the framework suggested here, two conclusions are drawn. First, prices may serve as signals which exactly differentiate the available quality levels. That is, there exists a fulfilledexpectations equilibrium at which each price signals a unique quality level. Second, the pricesignals are not arbitrary. Each price-signal exceeds the marginal cost of producing the quality it signals. Such a mark-up depends on the nature of the product-specific information received by consumers—the poorer the information, the higher the mark-up.

Title: Search and Optimal Sample Sizes
Abstract: This paper considers the wide class of problems in which a searcher can choose his sample size and whether or not to stop search at each of a sequence of decision points. Sequential search problems are the special cases in which the sample size chosen at each decision point is unity. Several properties of the optimal sample size sequence are established, with particular attention being paid to the effects of recall, decision horizons and fallback utilities. These properties yield necessary and sufficient conditions for the optimality of sequential search strategies within the class of problems considered.

Title: Voting for Public Goods
Abstract: It is shown that when resources are privately owned, the institution of voting is irrelevant to the choice of non-exclusive public goods: the total bundle of such goods produced by Society is the same whether or not minority coalitions are permitted to produce them. This is in sharp contrast to the cases of redistribution and of exclusive public goods, where public decisions depend strongly on the vote. The analytic tool used is the Harsanyi-Shapley non-transferable utility value.

Title: Generic Instability of Majority Rule
Abstract: Majority rule voting with smooth preferences on a smooth policy space W is examined. It is shown that there is an integer w(n), which is 2 when the size of the society n is odd and 3 when n is even such that when the dimension of W is at least w(n) then, for almost preference profiles on W, the core of the voting game is empty when the dimension of W exceeds w(n) then for almost all preference profiles on W, there exist dense preference cycles in W. Moreover in dimension w(n) + 1 the policy space can be partitioned into a finite number of path connected components, such that any two points in one of the components can be connected by a majority voting trajectory. In dimension greater than w(n) + 1 there exists only one such component.

Title: International R &amp; D Rivalry and Industrial Strategy
Abstract: This paper presents a theory of government intervention which provides an explanation for "industrial strategy" policies such as R &amp; D or export subsidies in imperfectly competitive international markets. Domestic net welfare is improved by the capture of a greater share of the output of rent earning industries, although the subsidy-ridden noncooperative international equilibrium is jointly suboptimal. Behaviour of governments and firms is modelled as a three stage subgame perfect Nash equilibrium. The assumption that the government is the first player in this game allows it to influence equilibrium outcomes by altering the set of credible actions open to firms.

Title: Distribution-Free Statistical Inference with Lorenz Curves and Income Shares
Abstract: The paper considers the problem of statistical inference with estimated Lorenz curves and income shares. The full variance-covariance structure of the (asymptotic) normal distribution of a vector of Lorenz curve ordinates is derived and shown to depend only on conditional first and second moments that can be estimated consistently without prior specification of the population density underlying the sample data. Lorenz curves and income shares can thus be used as tools for statistical inference instead of simply as descriptive statistics.

Title: On Least Squares Estimation when the Dependent Variable is Grouped
Abstract: This paper examines the problem of estimating the parameters of an underlying linear model using data in which the dependent variable is only observed to fall in a certain interval on a continuous scale, its actual value remaining unobserved. A Least Squares algorithm for attaining the Maximum Likelihood estimator is described, the asymptotic bias of the OLS estimator derived for the normal regressors case and a "moment" estimator presented. A "two-step estimator" based on combining the two approaches is proposed and found to perform well in both an economic illustration and simulation experiments.
