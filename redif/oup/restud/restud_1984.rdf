Title: Pareto Inferior Trade
Abstract: The paper shows that between two competitive but risky economies with no insurance markets, free trade may be Pareto inferior to no trade. The model is simple enough to show clearly the role prices play in transferring and sharing risk when there is an incomplete set of markets, but rich enough to exhibit the resulting inefficiencies dramatically.

Title: Flexibility and Uncertainty
Abstract: The preserving of flexibility when faced with uncertainty is a neglected aspect of behaviour under risk. Yet it is an important factor in decisions to hold liquid assets or delay irreversible investment. This paper formalizes the notion of flexibility in a sequential decision context, and relates its value to the amount of information an agent expects to receive. A rudimentary money demand model is developed embodying these ideas, and the history of flexibility as an economic concept is traced.

Title: Considering an Informational Role for a Futures Market
Abstract: This study compares how well current spot prices predict future spot prices for a variety of commodities in a non-futures market environment and examines how the predictive power of the price system is altered after the initiation of futures trading. The results indicate a positive association between the inability of a non-futures market price system to predict the future spot price and the subsequent development of a futures market. The claim that traders can earn a return on information collection after the introduction of a futures price into the pricing system is supported for some, but not all, commodities.

Title: Product Differentiation with Imperfect Information
Abstract: The paper employs a model of monopolistic competition and product differentiation with consumers who are not well informed about the specification of the offered brands. Welfare analysis of the degree of product differentiation in such a market concludes that the socially desirable product variety is limited due to consumers' imperfect information. Consequently, when the number of consumers is sufficiently large or economies to scale in production are sufficiently weak, the market would offer excessive variety.

Title: Informative Advertising with Differentiated Products
Abstract: In this paper we study the role of promotional expenditures by sellers in a model of product differentiation. Advertising conveys full and accurate information about the characteristics of products. Heterogeneous consumers, who have no source of information other than advertisements, seek to purchase the products that best fit their needs. Despite the roles played by advertising in improving the matching of products and consumers, and in increasing the elasticity of demand faced by each firm, we find that the market-determined Jevels of advertising are excessive, given the extent of diversity in the market. We derive a promotional equilibrium based on a specific information transmission technology, paying explicit attention to the structure of consumer information and its impact on firms' demand curves. This allows us to study the effects of changes in the advertising technology, including an increased ability to target messages to specific groups of consumers, on the equilibrium in the product market. We find that decreased advertising costs may reduce profits by increasing the severity of price competition.

Title: Uncertainty, Asymmetric Information and Bilateral Contracts
Abstract: The paper considers a bilateral monopoly with uncertainty and asymmetric information, and characterizes necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of contracts that are efficient and incentive compatible. These contracts can be implemented by a truthful sequential revelation mechanism. Alternatively, they can be interpreted as specifying a class of payment schedules, designating the seller to choose a schedule from this class, and the buyer to pick a point on the chosen schedule. Requirements contracting is similar.

Title: Worker Allocation, Hierarchies and the Wage Distribution
Abstract: Economists have traditionally viewed the allocation of workers among jobs through the concept of comparative advantage. This paper investigates hierarchical production models which display an absence of comparative advantage, in order to demonstrate that for hierarchical production there is a second allocating factor which plays an important role. Two results are found. First, the allocation of workers among jobs tends to match high ability workers with positions which value ability highly. Second, despite the fact that the models display an absence of comparative advantage, i.e. the standard theoretical explanation for why wage distributions might be skewed, the models' wage distributions are skewed to the right relative to the underlying ability distributions.

Title: Capitalist-Worker Conflict and Involuntary Unemployment
Abstract: We study a simple model of the determination of the level of employment in which a capitalist decides how many workers to hire, and then bargains over the wage with those whom he hires. If the capitalist hires all the available workers, his position is weak since, in the event of a strike, he is unable to hire strike-breakers; for this reason he chooses to leave some workers ("involuntarily") unemployed. An increase in unemployment benefits which raises the cost of hiring strike-breakers affects the bargaining power of both capitalist and workers; under some conditions it leads to a reduction in unemployment.

Title: Assets, General Equilibrium and the Neutrality of Money
Abstract: When government liabilities (including money) are held in private portfolios only as stores of value and do not provide additional services (such as liquidity), real variables are not affected by changes in the money supply due to the government's trading in real assets (open market operations). This neutrality of monetary policy fails if the government either trades in nominal assets, or it distributes subsidies and levies taxes.

Title: Spatial Equilibrium with Entry
Abstract: This paper examines spatial equilibrium in political competition when established parties choose their platforms competitively while rationally anticipating entry of a vote-maximizing third party. The resulting equilibrium is substantially different from the Hotelling "median" equilibrium. Established parties are spatially separated and third parties will generally lose the election. This provides one theoretical explanation for the stability of two-party systems, namely that non-cooperative behaviour between established parties can effectively prevent third parties from winning.

Title: The Conditional Auction Mechanism for Sharing a Surplus
Abstract: A first-bid auction to allocate the leadership role is used to choose a public decision and a balanced set of transfers. The mechanism is shown to implement an equal-sharing of the surplus above the "average" utility level. At the equilibrium an agent's message reveals the other agent's utility (when only two players are involved) and the exact value of the joint surplus. A variety of other contexts allow for the construction of similar auction-like mechanisms displaying the same mirror-image effect.

Title: Prices, Product Qualities and Asymmetric Information: The Competitive Case
Abstract: Recent developments in the economics of information emphasize the informational content of prices. We examine the degree to which prices convey information on product quality to uninformed agents. Under perfect competition, we show that a rational expectations equilibrium may not exist. When an equilibrium does exist, the information on quality conveyed by prices depends on the shape of the average cost curves and the relative numbers of informed and uniformed agents.

Title: Bertrand, the Cournot Paradigm and the Theory of Perfect Competition
Abstract: In this paper, we extend to a general equilibrium context Bertrand's classic critique of Cournot. We present a game-theoretic model of a pure exchange, monetary economy, in which buyers as well as sellers announce both quantities and prices. When buyers act strategically, the "Edgeworth nonexistence problem" is circumvented: under weak conditions, a pure strategy Nash equilibrium exists for this game. We make precise the Bertrand idea that when agents in a finite economy are permitted to compete-by-price the resulting allocations will be competitive. Specifically, the Nash equilibria for our game yield allocations that are "competitive" allocations for the underlying exchange economy, provided that there are at least two buyers and two sellers actively trading in every market. Under this characterization of strategic behaviour, then, "two is enough for competition."

Title: Estimating Distributed Lags in Short Panels with an Application to the Specification of Depreciation Patterns and Capital Stock Constructs
Abstract: This paper considers the problem of estimating distributed lags in short panels. Though the N time series contained in a panel may allow for relatively precise estimates of identified lag coefficients, identification requires restrictions on the contribution of the unobserved pre-sample x's to the current values of y, and the shortness of panels focuses attention on this matter. We investigate two such restrictions. The first constrains the relationship between the presample and insample x's, while the second constrains the lag distribution itself. An example, which investigates empirically how to construct "capital stocks" for the analysis of rates of return, closes the paper.

Title: A Price Discrimination Analysis of Monetary Policy
Abstract: Monetary policy is analysed within a model that appeals to legal restrictions on private intermediation to explain the coexistence of currency and interest-bearing default-free bonds. The interaction between such legal restrictions and monetary policy is illustrated in a version of the overlapping generations model. The model shows that legal restrictions and the use of both currency and bonds permit the government to levy a nonlinear inflation tax and that such a tax may be better in terms of the Pareto criterion than a linear inflation tax.

Title: Uncertainty in the Theory of Renewable Resource Markets
Abstract: The natural growth rate of most renewable resource stocks is in part stochastic. This paper examines the implications of such ecological uncertainty for competitive equilibrium in a market with property rights. We show that stochastic fluctuations add a risk premium to the rate of return required to keep a unit of stock in situ, and we examine the effects of fluctuations on resource rent. Examples are used to show that extraction can increase, decrease, or be left unchanged as the variance of the fluctuations increases, depending on the extent of market "self-correction". Regulatory implications are also discussed.

Title: Optimal Nonuniform Prices
Abstract: We consider optimal nonuniform pricing schedules, where the price depends upon the amount purchased. Such schedules are regularly used by public utilities and other services. Welfare-optimal nonuniform prices are related to the theory of optimal uniform prices developed by Ramsey. We characterize situations in which upward or downward discontinuities in pricing schedules are optimal. Our results are applicable to a number of related problems, including optimal taxation, insurance, and incentives.

Title: Value of an Additional Firm in Monopolistic Competition
Abstract: The paper develops a model of monopolistic competition in which the satisfaction levels consumers get from products are independently and identically distributed. Potential substitution among products then generates demand curves through the mechanism of order statistics. The value of extra variety can be calculated directly. Pareto, lognormal and beta distributions are investigated using numerical integration. Some but not all cases support the argument that the optimal number of firms exceeds the equilibrium number.

Title: Mixed-Strategy Equilibrium in a Market with Asymmetric Information
Abstract: In the mid-1970s several authors studied models of markets with asymmetric information in which equilibria do not exist. Although those authors focused on models of insurance and education, it was recognized that similar nonexistence problems arise in a wide class of models with asymmetric information. Recently, Dasgupta and Maskin have demonstrated that for a game-theoretic version of at least one of those models, although no equilibria may exist in pure strategies, equilibria exist in mixed strategies. In the present paper we construct a mixed-strategy equilibrium for one member of the class—Spence's signalling model of education. Qualitative features of the equilibrium are explored.

Title: A Note on Aoki's Conditions for Path Controllability of Continuous-Time Dynamic Economic Systems
Abstract: In this note we discuss necessary and sufficient conditions for dynamic path controllability, and show that the rank condition in Aoki (1975) is necessary but not sufficient unless impulse controls are admissible. It is demonstrated that in the special case of state space targets Tinbergen's concept of static controllability is equivalent to the dynamic concept of path controllability. For general linear systems conditions for path controllability depend on the choice of the admissible target and instrument space. In contrast to discrete-time models Tinbergen's original counting rule is necessary for path controllability for any target and instrument space in the continuous-time framework.

Title: The Timing of Sales
Abstract: This paper presents a model of intertemporal price discrimination. A fixed number of sellers produce a homogeneous good. Consumers with different preferences enter the market in each period and leave when they make a purchase. The sellers typically vary their prices over time, charging a high price in most periods, but occasionally cutting the price to sell to a large group of customers with a low reservation price. In some equilibria, all stores lower their price at the same time and to the same level.

Title: Aggregate Consumer Behaviour and the Measurement of Inequality
Abstract: This paper presents an approach to inequality measurement based on an econometric model of aggregate consumer behaviour. The novel feature of this model is that systems of individual demand functions can be recovered uniquely from the system of aggregate demand functions. We present methods for evaluating social welfare based on an explicit social welfare function. This social welfare function incorporates measures of individual welfare based on indirect utility functions for all consumer units. We develop indexes of inequality based on actual and potential levels of social welfare.

Title: Financial Intermediation and Delegated Monitoring
Abstract: This paper develops a theory of financial intermediation based on minimizing the cost of monitoring information which is useful for resolving incentive problems between borrowers and lenders. It presents a characterization of the costs of providing incentives for delegated monitoring by a financial intermediary. Diversification within an intermediary serves to reduce these costs, even in a risk neutral economy. The paper presents some more general analysis of the effect of diversification on resolving incentive problems. In the environment assumed in the model, debt contracts with costly bankruptcy are shown to be optimal. The analysis has implications for the portfolio structure and capital structure of intermediaries.

Title: Information Reliability and a Theory of Financial Intermediation
Abstract: This paper is an analysis of when it will be beneficial for agents engaged in the production of information to form coalitions. The model is cast in a financial market framework, thus leading to an identification of conditions sufficient for the existence of financial intermediaries. Intermediation is shown to improve welfare if informational asymmetries are present, and the information generated to rectify these asymmetries is potentially unreliable. The usual appeal to transactions costs to explain intermediation is not needed.

Abstract: The Grossman-Hart principal-agent model of moral hazard is extended to the multiple agent case to explore the use of relative performance in optimal incentive contracting. Under the assumption that the principal chooses incentive schemes to implement agent actions as Nash equilibria, necessary and sufficient conditions are derived for the optimality of independent contracts, of rank-order tournaments, and for attainability of the first-best. In this context the relation of the principal's welfare to the correlation between the underlying randomness in outputs of different agents is also investigated. Finally, some problems with the Nash equilibrium implementation assumption are discussed.

Title: The Manipulability of Resource Allocation Mechanisms
Abstract: The vulnerability to manipulate behaviour of resource allocation mechanisms is evaluated by determining the Nash equilibria of associated manipulation games. Under manipulation, all monotonic correspondences are essentially equivalent to the Walrasian correspondence. For most non-monotonic correspondences of interest, the initial position appears at equilibrium to be efficient.

Title: Nonuniform Pricing with Unobservable Numbers of Purchases
Abstract: Properties are derived for the profit-maximizing price schedule in a market where the firm can observe the size of any given purchase, but cannot directly observe the number of purchases made by any given consumer. In such a market, A consumer may make multiple purchases to minimize the amount paid for a given quantity of the good. It is shown that when purchase numbers are unobservable the schedule may entail quantity premia and may be strikingly different from the schedule that obtains when the numbers of purchases are observable. In particular, some individuals may consume more under the profit-maximizing outcome than under the first-best outcome.

Title: A Welfare Analysis of Employment Contracts with and without Asymmetric Information
Abstract: This paper provides a complete characterization of the welfare economics of employment contracts when workers are immobile in the ex post period. Necessary and sufficient conditions for constrained Pareto optimality are derived for economies with incomplete risk markets, two consumption goods and random production technologies in which: (a) workers can/cannot observe realizations of their employers' revenue function (symmetric vs. asymmetric information), and in which; (b) employment contracts allow/preclude contingent wages and/or employment levels (flexible vs. rigid contracts). This taxonomic approach serves to identify the welfare implications of exogenous and endogenous contractual rigidities, and to isolate a class of externalities that is unique to economies with asymmetric information. The latter market failure is also present with "indexed" contracts when workers alone can observe realizations of their consumption goods prices (another form of asymmetric information).

Title: Comparative Dynamics of an Equilibrium Intertemporal Asset Pricing Model
Abstract: This paper uses recursive competitive theory to develop a general equilibrium asset pricing model. In this framework all prices and rates of return are endogenously determined, thus enabling us to analyze the effects of changes in preferences, technological uncertainty, and expectations on the structure of security prices. In particular we focus on how the market risk premium varies with changes in the underlying economic environment, an issue which other asset pricing models have chosen not to address.

Title: Dynamic Exchange Rate Equilibria with Uncertain Government Policy
Abstract: In this paper we link two exchange rate literatures by showing how threats of asset controls yields determinate exchange rates in general equilibrium models with otherwise perfect capital markets and by showing how, for certain sequences of threats, exchange rate determination may be well explained by monetary variables. We find that in general there exists no natural exchange rate, and market rates may be sensitive to changed perceptions about future exchange rate intervention.

Title: A Bayesian Approach to the Production of Information with a Linear Utility Function
Abstract: The paper considers the problem facing a consumer deciding whether to purchase a good whose effect on utility is unknown. The consumer is allowed to learn about the effect over time according to a Bayesian updating procedure. Of interest is the quantity of the good the consumer will purchase in the first period. The paper allows the consumer's budget constraint to be spread over more than one period and consequently generates results which contradicts earlier work.

Title: An Investigation of the Determinants of Manufacturing Employment in the United Kingdom
Abstract: In this paper we present and estimate an adjustment cost model of industry employment which takes explicit account of both expectations and aggregation over different labour types. The resulting model is subject to a large number of tests and is a highly robust representation of the data. Finally forecasts are produced for manufacturing employment up to 1990.

Title: Earnings, Unemployment, and the Allocation of Time Over Time
Abstract: A stochastic dynamic model of labour supply is specified and analysed empirically. The theoretical model provides a sound structural economic basis for a class of empirical models which have been shown useful. The implications of the estimated model are explored and diagnostic checks are suggested and implemented.

Title: Bargaining with Incomplete Information: An Infinite-Horizon Model with Two-Sided Uncertainty
Abstract: The resolution of any bargaining conflict depends crucially on the relative urgency of the agents to reach agreement and the information each agent has about the others' preferences. This paper explores, within the context of an infinite-horizon bargaining model with two-sided uncertainty, how timing and information affect the rational behaviour of agents when commitment is not possible. Since the bargainers are uncertain about whether trade is desirable, they must communicate some of their private information before an agreement can be reached. This need for learning, due to incomplete information about preferences, results in bargaining inefficiencies: trade often occurs after costly delay. Thus, the model provides an explanation for the inefficient bargaining behaviour that appears to occur often in practice.

Title: A Comparison of Posted-Offer and Double-Auction Pricing Institutions
Abstract: This paper presents an experimental study of a computerized "posted-offer" pricing mechanism that captures many of the basic institutional features of retail exchange in the U.S. Posted-offer market performance is evaluated relative to "double-auction" market performance using two supply and demand designs. Subject experience with the trading mechanism is explicitly considered as an experimental treatment variable. The market data suggest that prices tend to be higher and efficiency lower under posted-offer pricing relative to double auction. However, the institutional effect appears to interact with other design conditions. When feasible, the predictive power of competitive, Nash, and limit-price theoretic equilibria are empirically evaluated.

Title: Informational and Performance Properties of a Class of Iterative Planning Procedures
Abstract: This paper analyses a class of iterative planning procedures that can be applied in environments describable by the Leontief-Samuelson technology. Members of the class are distinguished by the extent of the communication of technical information from firms to the Centre. All members of the class are monotonic and convergent, but the speed and finiteness of convergence is shown to depend critically on the extent of the transfer of technical information throughout each procedure. The paper thus establishes a trade-off between the informational and performance properties of a class of resource allocation mechanisms, taking environmental coverage as given.

Title: The Structure of Economies with Aggregate Measures of Capital: A Complete Characterization
Abstract: In this paper, we present the primal characterizations of the technologies that are consistent with capital aggregation. These characterizations are dual to the profit function restrictions obtained by Gorman and complete the closed-form production function restrictions obtained by Fisher. We use the result to solve a problem recently posed by Fisher. In addition, we pose and solve a natural extension of the usual capital aggregation problem.

Title: A Neoclassical Model of the Balance of Payments
Abstract: This paper analyses the transitory and long run effects of devaluation and tariffs, as well as the effects of alterations in the domestic money supply and the terms of trade, for a small country on fixed exchange rates. These issues are investigated in a self-contained dynamic optimization model of the sort popularized by Brock (1974, 1975). Familiar results in the trade literature are thereby explicated for the nonspecialist who is nonetheless familiar with Brock's work. There are some new results regarding the role played by income and substitution effects in determining the consequences of terms-of-trade shifts.

Title: Pricing and Investment Policies in a System of Competitive Commuter Railways
Abstract: This paper develops a simple spatial equilibrium model of a city served by competing commuter railways and analyses the effects of different transportation policies on their pricing and investment decisions. It is shown that a system of competitive railway companies does not achieve the optimal allocation. We then examine whether or not three types of government intervention, i.e. subsidies to railway companies, a rate-of-return regulation, and the ownership of residential land by railway companies, can achieve the optimal allocation.

Title: Probabilistic Social Choice Based on Simple Voting Comparisons
Abstract: A social choice procedure is developed for selecting an alternative from a finite set on the basis of paired-comparison voting. Ballot data are used to construct a lottery on the alternatives that is socially as preferred as every other lottery. The constructed lottery is then used to select a winner. An axiomatization of social preferences among lotteries that justifies the procedure is included. The procedure will always select a consensus majority alternative when one exists, and it will never select an alternative that is Pareto dominated by another alternative.

Title: Acyclic Choice without the Pareto Principle
Abstract: In this paper we prove some versions of the Arrow Impossibility Theorem, with the collective rationality condition weakened from transitivity to acyclicity, and the Pareto condition replaced by weaker conditions. Thus this result has weaker assumptions than versions of the Arrow Theorem which have previously appeared in the literature. Consequently it is one of the strongest impossibility theorems. Our result is an extension of a recent theorem of Blair and Pollak.
