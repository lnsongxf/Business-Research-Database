Title: A Unified Approach to Incorporating Demographic or Other Effects into Demand Systems
Abstract: A general method of introducing demographic effects into any demand system, using modifying functions, is described which permits complicated interactions of demographic variables with prices and expenditures. Theorems give properties the modifying functions must have to ensure integrability of the resulting system. Demand equations of the new system are given explicitly as functions of the original demand equations and the modifying functions. The procedure is interpreted as altering a household's technology, and is shown to encompass adult equivalent scales and related methods. Examples of modifying functions are derived and applications of the technique to uses other than demographic variation are considered.

Title: Distributed Lags, Aggregation and Compounding: Some Econometric Implications
Abstract: This paper considers the aggregation of discrete distributed lags in the spirit of Houthakker and Johansen. Well-known distributed lag models in econometrics are shown to arise from aggregation across heterogeneous microeconomic units. The technique of analysis is based on the statistical theory of compound distributions. The paper goes on to consider how consistently estimated macro distributed lags may be decomposed into two components which represent, respectively, the microeconomic response and the heterogeneity in that response. Related problems of identification and estimation and the interpretive value of the approach are also discussed and illustrations provided.

Title: Optimal Labour Contracts when Workers have a Variety of Privately Observed Reservation Wages
Abstract: If a firm does not know the individual ex post outside opportunities of its contracted workforce, then it can use hours, wages, and redundancy payments to screen them. Will a second-best contract have underemployment inefficiency, or overemployment? And, with a stochastic contract, are those workers randomly selected for layoff worse off than their retained colleagues (involuntary layoff), or vice versa (involuntary retention)? The answers depend on the nature of the workers' preferences. Two polar cases are looked at, corresponding to permanent and temporary layoff. The former is characterized by overemployment and involuntary retention; the latter by underemployment and involuntary layoff. Also examined are "simple contracts" where all retained workers are paid a common wage and all laid-off workers receive a common redundancy payment. Handling asymmetric information in stochastic contracts has led to two technical innovations. First, a number of results are proved even though all the truth-telling constraints are explicitly included. Second, a new regularity condition is found under which the local constraints are sufficient to ensure global incentive compatibility at an optimum.

Title: Uncertainty Resolution, Private Information Aggregation and the Cournot Competitive Limit
Abstract: A Cournot model of oligopoly in which otherwise identical firms have private differential information about the common cost of production and a shared (but unknown) demand curve is examined. A Bayesian equilibrium of the corresponding game of incomplete information is solved for explicitly and analysed. In the symmetric equilibrium, different firms produce at different output levels because they have different information. Because the information individual firms have is random, total output and hence market price is also random for any finite number of firms. The main result of the paper relates to the asymptotic properties of the equilibrium, when the number of firms becomes large. Under fairly general conditions on the joint distribution of demand and individual firms' information about demand, the random equilibrium price converges almost surely to a constant in the limit. More importantly, this price equals the perfectly competitive price. In other words, in large markets, even if no firm knows the true market demand curve and firms are not price-takers and do not use price as a signal to improve their information, the competitive price will prevail with certainty. In the limit, aggregate outcomes are as if all firms shared their private information with each other.

Title: On the Existence of Cournot Equilibrium
Abstract: This paper examines the existence of n-firm Cournot equilibrium in a market for a single homogeneous commodity. It proves that if each firm's marginal revenue declines as the aggregate output of other firms increases (which is implied by concave inverse demand) then a Cournot equilibrium exists, without assuming that firms have nondecreasing marginal cost or identical technologies. Also, if the marginal revenue condition fails at a "potential optimal output", there is a set of firms such that no Cournot equilibrium exists. The paper also contains an example of nonexistence with two nonidentical firms, each with constant returns to scale production.

Title: Innovation and Imitation in a Duopoly
Abstract: In a duopoly where one firm has the idea for a non-patentable innovation, the expected profits from the innovation will not be a monotonic function of the cost of innovating. Furthermore, a costly innovation may be undertaken, where an inexpensive one would not have been, all other things being equal.

Title: Equilibrium with Product Differentiation
Abstract: A model of product differentiation which combines elements of both spatial and representative consumer formulations is used to examine the properties of single- and multiple-price equilibria. Conditions under which decreases in the intensity of consumer preferences reduce price are given. It is shown that, with certain types of demand curves, entry can eliminate price-cost markups even given product differentiation. If competition is localized, it is demonstrated that entry does not affect the markup. Finally, the effect of spurious product differentiation on price is examined.

Title: Taxes, Subsidies and Equilibrium Unemployment
Abstract: This paper considers the effects of wage taxes, employment subsidies and unemployment benefits in a simple model of equilibrium search. Unemployment is determined by the equality of job matchings and job separations, job vacancies are determined by a zero-profit condition and wages by a Nash bargain between the meeting firm and worker. I show that marginal wage taxes influence the firm's and worker's equilibrium sharing rule, whereas employment subsidies and unemployment benefits influence only the surplus shared. Hence, tax-financed subsidies reduce wages and raise employment and vacancies, whereas tax-financed unemployment benefits raise wages and reduce employment and vacancies.

Title: Measures of Distributional Change: An Axiomatic Approach
Abstract: Income mobility and horizontal inequity are two common examples of the phenomenon of "distributional change": the transformation of an "old" distribution vector into a "new" distribution vector. An attempt is made to supplement the sundry ad hoc methods of measuring this change with a system of axioms that might command support as general principles of measurement. Variants on the axiom system are examined and the associated class of measures is derived.

Title: Optimal Growth, Resource Amenities and the Preservation of Natural Environments
Abstract: This paper examines the conditions for which it is optimal to permanently preserve natural environments in which a productive natural resource is found. The conditions are more restrictive than those previously indicated in the literature on the economics of natural environments. Increasing consumption and declining commodity prices are not sufficient to warrant permanent preservation. The initial capital stock can be an important determinant of the optimal level of preservation. In addition, resource amenity values will increase the initial resource price and decrease the rate of growth of the resource price.

Title: Planning under Incomplete Information and the Ratchet Effect
Abstract: Central planning of production is usually performed under asymmetric information which leads to use of an incentive scheme. As the planner revises the scheme over time to take into account information provided by the firm's performance, this induces firms to underproduce to avoid more demanding schedules in the future—the ratchet effect. This paper explores this phenomenon under the realistic assumption that the planner cannot commit himself to a revision procedure. We show that the ratchet effect exists, in the sense that the planner may choose a scheme which is suboptimal from a static viewpoint in order to induce revelation, with the marginal price of output exceeding its optimal static value.

Title: Perfect Equilibrium in a Model of a Race
Abstract: This paper investigates perfect equilibrium in a model of a race in which two players are competing for an indivisible prize. The winner is the first player to reach the finishing line. It is shown that the behaviour of the winner of the race is often exactly as if he were the only player: the rival makes no difference. Even if competition does affect the winner's behaviour, it does so only in the first stage of the race and not thereafter. It is shown how several factors combine to determine which player will win: relative valuations of the prize, discount rates, efficiency at making progress and initial distances from the finishing line. Insofar as the model applies to patent races, it suggests that the potential competition faced by one firm in a patent race (e.g. an incumbent monopolist) may be of little or no consequence.

Title: Rational Expectations and Policy Credibility Following a Change in Regime
Abstract: We examine the dynamic path of an economy after a change in regime, when neither the policy to be followed nor the reactions of the public are known. The model is an application of Kreps and Wilson's reputation model to Barro and Gordon's macroeconomic policy game. Equilibrium is defined to be the dynamically consistent solution to a game between the government and the private sector. It involves mixed strategies and Bayesian learning by both sides until the uncertainty about government and public behaviour is resolved. The absence of complete credibility of government policy and intransigence of private sector wage demands increase the output loss of disinflation. The analysis also sheds light on the strategic nature of economic policymaking and the role of information in macroeconomics.

Title: Implementation in Dominant Strategies under Complete and Incomplete Information
Abstract: This paper shows that if a social choice rule can be implemented in dominant strategies by an indirect mechanism, but there does not exist a direct mechanism that implements it in dominant strategies, then it must be the case that the original indirect mechanism does not implement the social choice rule in Nash strategies (under complete information) or in Bayesian strategies (under imcomplete information).

Title: Econometric Modelling of the Sterling Effective Exchange Rate
Abstract: The exchange rate is recognised as a particularly tricky subject for modelling and prediction. The problems of unobservables such as expectations, of simultaneity, and of policy changes (both overt and covert) in the sample period to which models must be fitted may account for the disappointing results of recent attempts to test theories of exchange rate determination. This paper develops an appropriate empirical model to deal with these problems; it allows consideration of the proper interpretation of theoretical assumptions and determination of how far modelling for ex ante prediction can succeed.

Title: Product Quality and Imperfect Information
Abstract: This paper considers markets in which consumers are imperfectly informed about both product prices and quality levels offered by firms. We characterize necessary and sufficient conditions for existence of the various equilibrium configurations of price and quality that can arise in two paradigm cases; when all consumers prefer higher quality and when all consumers prefer lower quality. Our results suggest that firms will exploit imperfect information by charging noncompetitive prices as well as by offering other than ideal quality in the former case, but only by changing noncompetitive prices in the latter case.

Title: Some Theoretical Results on the Economics of Forestry
Abstract: The general question of forest management can be stated as follows. Suppose the planner of a piece of forest land obtains utility in any time period from the timber content of trees harvested in that period. If the planner wishes to maximize the discounted sum of such utilities starting from any initial forest, what pattern of planting and harvesting trees should it follow? This paper provides a systematic analysis to answer the above question. In particular, the optimal solution is related to the Faustmann periodic solution and the sustained yield solution, which are prominent in the forestry literature.

Title: Inventories, Stock-Outs and Production Smoothing
Abstract: If stock-outs are ignored and if demand shocks are additive, then optimal behaviour requires that the marginal cost of production (MC) be equated with the expected marginal revenue of increasing expected sales by one unit (EMR). However, with more general demand shocks (and still ignoring stock-outs), the excess of MC over EMR has the same sign as the covariance of the slope of the demand curve and the marginal valuation of inventory. The equality of EMR and MC is also broken by taking account of stock-outs, even if demand shocks are additive. If there is a production lag, then taking account of stock-outs implies that optimal behaviour will be characterized by production smoothing even if the cost of production is linear. Two alternative definitions of production smoothing are presented and optimal behaviour in the presence of stock-outs displays each type of smoothing.

Title: On the Economic Interpretation and Measurement of Optimal Capacity Utilization with Anticipatory Expectations
Abstract: This study builds on recent research giving the notion of capacity utilization clearer economic foundations. In this research optimal output Y* is defined as the minimum point on the firm's short-run average total cost curve, and capacity utilization is then computed as CU = Y / Y*, where Y is actual output. Here I extend these concepts to include adjustment costs due to changes in the stock of capital, and nonstatic expectations of future output demand and input prices. The more general notion of CU is shown to depend on the shadow values of the firm's quasi-fixed inputs, and is decomposed to isolate the effects of anticipatory expectations. An empirical comparison is then made between traditional indices and alternative economic CU measures, using annual U.S. manufacturing data 1954–1980. The calculated indices exhibit plausible patterns, which can be interpreted as the effects of nonstatic expectations and adjustment costs.

Title: Capital Utilization and Factor Specificity
Abstract: In this study a model of firm behavior that allows the level of capital utilization to be optimally chosen by cost-minimizing firms is embedded into the standard specific-factors model employed in the international trade literature. The resulting generalization of the specific-factors model provides several new insights. For instance, allowing for variable utilization in either or both sectors gives rise to a greater variety of possible trade patterns than forcing utilization to remain constant. Similarly, international differences in the willingness to work during abnormal hours generate a wider variety of trade patterns than are possible in the standard specific-factors model. Finally, this model allows a reconciliation of the "dual scarcity" explanation of the nineteenth century Anglo-American pattern of trade with the historical evidence on levels of utilization.

Title: Capital Accumulation and Foreign Investment Taxation
Abstract: This paper presents a dynamic, choice-theoretic general equilibrium model of capital accumulation in an open economy. Equilibria with and without capital mobility are described and compared. It is shown that neither is necessarily Pareto optimal and that an equilibrium with free trade in capital does not Pareto-dominate an equilibrium with autarky. The effects of restricting capital flows by taxing foreign investment earnings are discussed. It is seen that there will be no agreement within a country as to what constitutes an optimal tax.

Title: A Note on Decomposable Inequality Measures
Abstract: Cowell has shown that if an inequality measure satisfies (1) additivity, (2) decomposability (among population groups), (3) additivitiy of the group inequality measures, (4) symmetry within groups, and (5) twice differentiability, it can be written as an additive function of group measures belonging to the CES class or of the form ∑i, si, ln si, where si is the i-th person's share. Using a result from the theory of functional equations, I prove that the first two conditions, often imposed for analytical convenience, alone imply Cowell's structure. Symmetry, or other ethical postulates, can then be represented by simple parametric restrictions.

Title: The Zero Root Problem: A Note on the Dynamic Determination of the Stationary Equilibrium in Linear Models
Abstract: Singularity of the transition matrix in differential equation systems implies indeterminacy of the stationary equilibrium: we show that this indeterminacy is only apparent, and we provide the unique solution. There are many examples of, and good theoretical reasons for, singular transition matrices. The main result is that, when stability conditions arc satisfied, the resulting stationary equilibrium will depend upon the intial conditions and the parameters describing the speed of adjustment.

Title: Rational Expectations Equilibrium with Econometric Models
Abstract: We prove the existence of general economic equilibrium under uncertainty when agents form econometric models of the relationship among their private information, prices, and the state of the environment. The functional form of each agent's model is specified in advance, with a finite number of parameters to be determined. Agents are then thought of as performing linear least squares estimation of the parameters. Equilibrium requires not only that markets clear, but also that each agent be using the vector of parameter values which, within a compact convex set of parameters, gives the least squares best fit to the data that is generated by the working of the economy when agents adhere to their models.

Title: Price Setting Supergames with Capacity Constraints
Abstract: This paper examines the role of industry capacity in enforcing collusion in the context of repeated games. For a fixed capacity per firm it is shown that changes in the number of firms have a non-monotone effect on the best enforceable cartel price. This is due to the fact that while an additional firm lowers the share that each of the other firms enjoys at the collusive price it also increases the losses to each firm should the cartel fail.

Title: Preemption and Rent Equalization in the Adoption of New Technology
Abstract: We study the adoption of a new technology to illustrate the effects of preemption in games of timing. We show that the threat of preemption equalizes rents in a duopoly, but that this result does not extend to the general oligopoly game. If the gain to preemption is sufficiently small, then the optimal symmetric outcome, which involves "late" adoption, is an equilibrium. This contrasts with Reinganum's result that in precommitment equilibria there must be "diffusion". We develop a new and richer formalism for modeling games of timing, which permits a continuous-time representation of the limit of discrete-time mixed-strategy equilibria.

Title: Managerial Incentives, Investment and Aggregate Implications: Scale Effects
Abstract: We explore a managerial model of investment behaviour in which an incentive problem arises because one input factor (managerial effort) is not publicly observed. We show that an optimal incentive contract leads to investment levels which are below first-best in low states and that this phenomenon can account for greater cyclical variability in aggregate production and investment. From the perspective of incentive scheme design, a special feature of the model is that screening takes place over two variables (investment and output) rather than one as is customary.

Title: Implicit Contracts with Asymmetric Information and Bankruptcy: The Effect of Interest Rates on Layoffs
Abstract: This paper develops a model in which a firm writes labour contracts with workers and debt contracts with creditors. Firms have more information than do the owners of the factors of production and they are also subject to limited liability. We show that if the limited liability constraint is binding then the employment level is inefficient relative to a situation of symmetric information. The firm is then embedded into a partial equilibrium model in which the real rate of interest is exogenously determined. We show that increases in the real rate of interest increase the inefficiency of the optimal employment contract and lead to layoffs in more states of nature than would occur at lower real interest rates.

Title: Multinational Corporations and Trade Structure
Abstract: First, a model of horizontally and vertically integrated firms is developed. These firms are then embedded in a general equilibrium model of trading countries. It is shown how multinational corporations emerge as a result of differences across countries in factor compositions. Intersectoral, intraindustry, and intrafirm trade can coexist, and intrafirm trade takes place in invisibles (headquarter services) and intermediate inputs. It is shown how the various trade components depend on the structure of the world economy. The model predicts trade patterns which are close to observed trade patterns.

Title: Bankruptcies in Temporary Equilibrium Forward Markets With and Without Institutional Restrictions
Abstract: Sufficient conditions are found for the existence of an orderly sequence of temporary equilibria in economies with incomplete forward markets without exogenous limits on short-sales. In the absence of institutionally imposed trade restrictions, equilibrium exists under the assumption of overlapping expectations. In the institutional model a clearinghouse imposes rules of trade (interpreted as margin requirements) to reduce the likelihood of bankruptcies. Under this rule, equilibrium exists without overlapping expectations, and subsequent bankruptcies are less likely.

Title: Selecting the Best Instrumental Variables Estimator
Abstract: This paper considers the problem of finding the "best" estimator among a class that includes most of the commonly used limited information estimators in simultaneous equation systems. Concentration comparisons, based on the Edgeworth expansion of the distribution of these estimators, lead to selection rules of sufficient simplicity to be useful in applied econometric research.

Title: Equilibrium Price Distributions
Abstract: Equilibrium price distributions (for a homogeneous product) consistent with individual incentives are investigated. They arise in informationally imperfect markets in which the only primitive datum is the distribution of search costs. It is shown that single, multi- and continuous price distributions are all viable long-run phenomena depending on the nature of search costs. A method for computing equilibrium price distributions is also provided.

Title: Rawls' Maximin Criterion and Time-Consistency: Further Results
Abstract: The paper is concerned with the implications of a maximin welfare function for an intertemporal society which has a nonlinear technology at its disposal, but holds conflicting preferences over time. The complete solution given shows that time-consistency and optimality of plans may or may not be compatible. The time-consistent case is generalized to a very wide class of models. This leads to the partial invalidation of a result stated in the earlier literature on the subject.

Title: Labour Supply in a Two-Period Model: The Effect of a Nonlinear Progressive Income Tax
Abstract: Earlier studies of labour supply in a life cycle context have typically either neglected taxes completely, or represented the income tax by a linear function. The present paper studies how the qualitative conclusions of a "traditional" life cycle model of labour supply are changed when a nonlinear tax is introduced into the model. It is shown that the comparative statics results, and the characterization of the consumption and labour supply paths, depend critically on whether capital and labour income are taxed jointly or separately, and on the progressivity (nonlinearity) of the income tax. Few of the results valid for a linear income tax carry over to the nonlinear case.

Title: A Class of Dominance Solvable Common-Value Auctions
Abstract: Dominant strategies seldom exist in non-cooperative games. Moulin's concept of a dominance solvable game generalizes, dominant strategy without dramatic loss in appeal. We consider a class of common-value auctions characterized by the property that the maximum of a collection of informative signals is a sufficient statistic for the entire collection. We demonstrate that this class of second-price auctions is dominance solvable.

Title: Monopolistic Competition in the Spirit of Chamberlin: A General Model
Abstract: This paper develops a model of "large group" Chamberlinian monopolistic competition in which (1) there are many firms producing differentiated commodities, (2) each firm is negligible in that it can ignore its impact on, and hence reactions from, other firms; (3) free entry leads to zero profit of operating firms; but (4) each firm faces a downward-sloping demand curve. The existence of a monopolistically competitive equilibrium is established. In a companion paper, more particular questions such as whether the market provides too many or too few products are addressed for a special case of the model.

Title: A Theory of Credibility
Abstract: This paper presents models in which one agent must decide whether to trust another, whose motives are uncertain. Reliability can only be communicated through actions. In this context, it pays for people to build a reputation based on reliable behaviour; someone becomes credible by consistently providing accurate and valuable information or by performing useful services. The theory provides a justification for long-term arrangements without binding contracts. It also describes those situations where it pays an agent to cash in on his reputation.

Title: On Adjustment Costs and the Stability of Equilibria
Abstract: In practice one does not expect conflicting agents to move instantaneously to an equilibrium. Instead the final equilibrium is often the consequence of "disequilibrium dynamics". This paper, through the use of local game theory, introduces a general framework for disequilibrium dynamics based on the existence of adjustment costs. The analysis is presented within the context of oligopoly theory and shows that the existence of adjustment costs will in many cases result in a unique equilibrium at which market shares are inversely proportional to these costs. This paper also introduces two new solution concepts for n-person normal form games.

Title: Immobility, Rationing and Price Competition
Abstract: A model is studied where firms advertise prices and buyers play a noncooperative search game in an attempt to secure output from firms at the advertised prices. Firms face rising marginal costs and may not be willing to supply everything demanded at their price if they wind up with many buyers. It is shown that rationing will occur in equilibrium no matter how averse buyers are to this possibility. The result is specialised to a case where rationing occurs with probability one. The equilibrium price and outputs are characterised for this case.

Title: The Capital Inflows Problem Revisited: A Stylized Model of Southern Cone Disinflation
Abstract: In the late 1970s, countries in Latin America's Southern Cone initiated attempts to lower domestic inflation rates through the progressive reduction of a preannounced rate of exchange-rate devaluation. The stabilization programs gave rise to massive capital inflows, real exchange-rate appreciation, and current-account deficits. This paper develops a stylized intertemporal framework in which the effects of a credible preannounced disinflation scheme can be studied. It is shown that even when agents have perfect foresight and markets clear continuously, the "capital inflows" phenomenon and the associated real appreciation may result. While unanticipated, permanent inflation changes are neutral in the paper, anticipated inflation is neutral only in exceptional circumstances. A preannounced disinflation operates by altering the path of an expenditure-based real domestic interest rate that depends on expected changes in the prices of liquidity services and nontradable consumption goods.

Title: Oil Price Shocks, Unemployment, Investment and the Current Account: An Intertemporal Disequilibrium Analysis
Abstract: Recent work on macroeconomics of price increases of intermediate imports while theoretically rigorous and elegant, is still unable to explain the stylized facts. This paper attempts to remedy the shortcomings of earlier papers by using a two-period model to properly analyse investment and savings behaviour and hence the current account. The model also incorporates disequilibrium in first-period labour and goods markets to compare the response of countries in different disequilibrium regimes to shocks in intermediate input prices.

Title: Incentive-Compatible Debt Contracts: The One-Period Problem
Abstract: In a simple model of borrowing and lending with asymmetric information we show that the optimal, incentive-compatible debt contract is the standard debt contract. The second-best level of investment never exceeds the first-best and is strictly less when there is a positive probability of costly bankruptcy. We also compare the second-best with the results of interest-rate-taking behaviour and consider the effects of risk aversion. Finally we provide conditions under which increasing the borrower's initial net wealth must reduce total investment in the venture.

Title: Taxes, Investment and Q
Abstract: This paper attempts to provide a unified analysis of the effects of taxation on the equilibrium value of marginal q under alternative financial policies. It is shown that the q approach does not avoid all the specification problems associated with analyses based on the cost of capital. The (theoretically and empirically) crucial relationship between average and marginal q is also examined, and it is shown that, under UK and US tax rules, the possibility of winding up precludes persistent undervaluation in equilibrium.

Title: Testing the Error Components Model with Non-Normal Disturbances
Abstract: This paper derives the limit distribution of the test statistics for the error components model proposed by Breusch and Pagan under the assumption of non-normal disturbances and under a sequence of local alternatives, and shows that the Breusch-Pagan tests are robust to non-normal disturbances. The paper also points out that the Breusch-Pagan tests do not make full use of the information provided by the one-sided alternative. And it proposes a one-sided alternative test for the case where time effects are absent from the model. The newly proposed test dominates the Breusch-Pagan test in the above case.

Title: Efficiency of Sliding Plans in a Linear Model with Time-Dependent Technology
Abstract: A procedure of sliding planning is considered in a simple dynamic model of Leontief type. At every step of this procedure, a long-term plan is generated starting from a current state of the economy for a future time interval of a fixed finite length (a "forecast horizon"), but only a decision concerning the first year is implemented. Proceeding from the attained state, the next step is carried out. Matrices of input-output coefficients are assumed to vary within uniform bounds. Provided that the forecast horizon is sufficiently long, the resulting sliding planning path is proved to be in a certain sense approximately optimal.

Title: Uniqueness of Non-Walrasian Equilibrium in the Macroeconomic Model with Decreasing or Increasing Returns
Abstract: A class of three good (output, labour, money), one consumer private ownership economies is studied. With an exogenous number of identical, increasing or decreasing returns firms necessary and sufficient conditions for globally unique, non-trivial, uniform rationing non-Walrasian equilibria are obtained in terms of suitably defined "marginal propensities". Following Weddepohl a non-Walrasian equilibrium at a set of parameters with m firms producing is stable if there is no equilibrium at those parameters with m + 1 firms producing. Under the global uniqueness conditions only trivial stable equilibria occur under decreasing returns; under increasing returns multiple, non-trivial stable equilibria can occur.
