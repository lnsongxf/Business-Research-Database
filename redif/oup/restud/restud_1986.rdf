Title: Repeated Partnership Games with Imperfect Monitoring and No Discounting
Abstract: In a partnership game, each player's utility depends on the other players' actions through a commonly observed consequence (e.g. output, profit, price), which is itself a function of the players' actions and an exogenous stochastic environment. If a partnership game is repeated infinitely, and each player's payoff in the infinite game (supergame) is the long-run average of his expected one-period utilities, then efficient combinations of one-period actions can be sustained as Nash equilibria of the supergame even if the players cannot observe other players' actions or information, but can only observe the resulting consequences.

Title: An Example of a Repeated Partnership Game with Discounting and with Uniformly Inefficient Equilibria
Abstract: In this note we present an example of a repeated partnership game with imperfect monitoring in which all supergame equilibria with positive discount rates are bounded away from full efficiency uniformly in the discount rate, provided the latter is strictly positive. On the other hand, if the players do not discount the future, then every efficient one-period payoff vector that dominates the one-period equilibrium payoff vector can be attained by an equilibrium of the repeated game. Thus the correspondence that maps the players' discount rate into the corresponding set of repeated-game equilibrium payoff vectors is discontinuous at the point at which the discount rate is zero.

Title: Entry Deterrence and the Free Rider Problem
Abstract: The public good aspect of entry prevention is examined in an industry characterized by an established oligopoly facing a potential entrant. Although incumbent firms act noncooperatively, underinvestment in entry-deterrence does not occur and in fact incumbents may find themselves in a Pareto dominated arrangement (in terms of profits) by preventing entry.

Title: Information Transmission—Cournot and Bertrand Equilibria
Abstract: We examine how incentives for two duopolists to honestly share information change depending upon the nature of competition (Cournot or Bertrand) and the nature of the information structure. While in earlier papers uncertainty is about an unknown common demand intercept, in the present paper uncertainty is about unknown private costs. The different information structure reverses the incentives to share information. While with unknown common demand sharing is a dominant strategy with Bertrand competition and concealing is a dominant strategy with Cournot competition, with unknown private costs sharing is a dominant strategy with Cournot competition and concealing is a dominant strategy with Bertrand competition.

Title: Corporation Tax, Finance and the Cost of Capital
Abstract: This paper examines the influence of corporate tax exhaustion on the firm's financial and investment decisions. A dynamic programming model is used to establish effective marginal tax rates in the presence of a tax system that permits the carry forward of losses to future periods. The paper demonstrates that internal optimal financial structures may result which do not require the imposition of external constraints. The cost of capital is highly sensitive to the current taxable earnings of the firm and the implications of this for such tax transfer activities as leasing are discussed.

Title: Disequilibrium Econometrics on Micro Data
Abstract: This paper brings some empirical evidence to the construction of a more disaggregated view of disequilibrium. Individual data on firms collected by INSEE through periodic Business Surveys are used to construct the distribution of firms over the four possible disequilibrium regimes. Then the behavior of this distribution over time is analyzed by estimating dynamic conditional logit models on panel data.

Title: Instrumental Variables Estimation of Dynamic Simultaneous Systems with ARMA Errors
Abstract: This paper develops the instrumental variables estimator for a possibly incomplete, dynamic economic system with vector autoregressive moving average disturbances. Its asymptotic distribution is derived and, under fairly weak conditions, it is shown that lagged endogenous variables may be validly included in the set of instruments. Statistics are proposed for testing the order of the error process and the validity of the instruments.

Abstract: An asset pricing model with overlapping generations is developed in order to study the relationship of risk aversion and risk premia and to derive some comparative dynamic results. The main result is that greater risk aversion does not necessarily imply a greater risk premium in this type of model.

Title: Agro-Industrial Processing and Agricultural Pricing Under Uncertainty
Abstract: Processing domestically available materials for export has intuitive appeal, e.g. if transport costs are reduced. Uncertainty in the supply of the raw material can be a crucial factor. The theoretical model of this paper shows how to choose the optimal processing capacity and, relatedly, the optimal price to pay producers of the input. Issues include: decision makers' preferences; sources and nature of uncertainty; availability of inputs to produce the raw material; and technology and costs of processing. Econometric estimates of the climate-yield relation are used to simulate these decisions for the case of Senegalese groundnut processing.

Title: Bertrand-Edgeworth Oligopoly in Large Markets
Abstract: The relation between perfectly competitive and monopolistically competitive equilibria is analysed for a Bertrand-Edgeworth model of a single market in which capacity constrained firms choose prices as strategies. The market always has a Nash equilibrium in pure or mixed strategies. As the number of firms increases, the corresponding equilibria converge in distribution to a perfectly competitive price. This result provides a justification for perfect competition that is based on an explicit account of price formation. However, monopoly prices persist with a positive but vanishing probability. Regularity or well defined inverse demand functions are not required.

Title: The Dynamic Effects of Tax Law Asymmetries
Abstract: Under the laws of most countries, a distinction is made between gains and losses by businesses. Losses that must be "carried forward" are subjept to two penalties: a loss of interest, and expiration. Previous examinations have focused on the higher expected tax payments such a tax system without "full loss offset" imposes on risky projects. This paper presents a dynamic analysis of the impact of taxation on investment when gains and losses are treated asymmetrically. The results demonstrate how firm characteristics and the timing of taxes can influence behaviour.

Title: A Complete Characterization of ARMA Solutions to Linear Rational Expectations Models
Abstract: Linear rational expectations models with expectations of future endogenous variables have multiple equilibria. For a scalar model with k forward expectational lags and l backward lags, this paper characterizes the complete set of ARMA solutions. It is shown that the maximum degree solutions are ARMA (k + l, k), that the solutions of maximum degree are obtained directly from the characteristic polynomial but have arbitrary MA parameters, and that all lower degree ARMA solutions are obtained by deleting common factors in the AR and MA lag polynomials. The results are applied to several macroeconomic examples.

Title: On the Rigour of Some Misspecification Tests for Modelling Dynamic Relationships
Abstract: For regression models alternative asymptotically equivalent misspecification tests may lead to conflicting inference in small samples. Effective misspecification tests should have correct significance levels irrespective of the true parameters and any redundant regressors in the model, and reasonable power against a wide class of alternative specifications. A simulation study of various tests for serial correlation and predictive failure in models with lagged dependent variables finds many tests defective in small samples. Only particular degrees of freedom adjustments to the test statistics yield improved small sample behaviour.

Title: Complete Consistency: A Testing Analogue of Estimator Consistency
Abstract: In this note we introduce a weak optimality condition for tests, called complete consistency. We argue that complete consistency is a more appropriate weak optimality condition for tests than is test consistency. Complete consistency is a testing analogue of estimator consistency. It is shown that a sequence of estimators is consistent, if and only if certain tests based on the estimators (such as Wald or likelihood ratio tests) are completely consistent, for all simple null hypotheses. The above notwithstanding, the relationship between consistent and completely consistent tests shows that test consistency is a relevant concept. Consistent tests can be used to show the existence of, and to construct, completely consistent tests. Further, completely consistent tests cannot be generated from nested families of inconsistent tests.

Title: Disappointment and Dynamic Consistency in Choice under Uncertainty
Abstract: The central proposition of disappointment theory is that an individual forms expectations about uncertain prospects, and that if the actual consequence turns out to be worse than (or better than) that expectation, the individual experiences a sensation of disappointment (or elation) generating a decrement (or increment) of utility which modifies the basic utility derived from the consequence. By incorporating a simple disappointment-elation function into a model of individual choice, many observed violations of conventional expected utility axioms—including violations of Savage's sure-thing principle and the "isolation effect"—can be predicted and defended as rational and dynamically consistent behaviour.

Title: Rational Expectations and Price Rigidity in a Monopolistically Competitive Market
Abstract: This paper analyses monopolistically competitive markets under incomplete information, facing unanticipated disturbances. Firms determine their prices before they have information about other firms' prices, and form their expectations about the average price rationally. If the market becomes very competitive in the sense that the price elasticity of individual demand is close to infinity, then the average price is completely insensitive to short-run unanticipated disturbances. In the intermediate case, if (a) cost disturbances are uniform and (b) demand and cost disturbances are correlated, then the average price is sensitive to cost and insensitive to demand.

Title: A Note on Commodity Taxation: The Choice of Variable and the Slutsky, Hessian and Antonelli Matrices (SHAM)
Abstract: Policy problems require the specification of government choice variables, which may be prices or quantities, and the representation of preferences e.g. direct utility or distance functions. The purpose of this note is to provide an appropriate framework for switches between different descriptions of the optimization problem. We first assemble the relevant results on the matrices (Slutsky, Hessian and Antonelli) which arise in the different formulations. We then use the results to show the relationships between various analyses in the literature and finally point out how the results, whilst formally equivalent can lead to different emphases and interpretations (or misinterpretations).

Title: Pricing Optimal Distributions to Overlapping Generations: A Corollary to Efficiency Pricing
Abstract: This paper will exploit the structural similarity of the two period overlapping generations model and the dynamic capital accumulation model to provide a pricing characterization of Pareto optimal distributions. With some very simple structural interpretations, the techniques which were developed to characterize efficient capital accumulation, apply directly to the overlapping generations model of the most general form; where generations consist of heterogenous consumer types of varying lifespans.

Title: The Demand for (Differentiated) Information
Abstract: A framework for distinguishing between the quantity of information and its quality or type is presented in which information is an indivisible differentiated commodity for which satiation occurs at one unit. Uncountably many types of information are possible which can be costlessly combined by agents. Similarity of information is expressed by a metric which reflects substitution possibilities among different information structures. In the model, traders desire information only because it helps them to maximize state dependent utilities under uncertainty. Then the individual demand for information is well defined, but possibly nonconvex valued because of the indivisibilities.

Title: Adverse Selection in the Labour Market
Abstract: This paper argues that adverse selection in the labour market, when viewed as part of a three-way interaction among workers, their current employers and a universe of alternative employers, may seriously impair a worker's freedom to change jobs. When current employers are better informed about the abilities of their workers than potential alternative employers, they will presumably concentrate their efforts to prevent turnover on their better workers. If these efforts lead to fewer quits among better workers, the stream of job changers should be composed disproportionately of less able ones. This will inhibit turnover in two ways. First, firms should be unwilling to hire from the job-changing pool except at low wages. Second, workers who change jobs are marked by being part of an inferior group, which lowers their future bargaining power and wages. Models of these phenomena can be made to account for many aspects of observed labour market behaviour.

Title: The Existence of Perfect Equilibria in a Model of Growth with Altruism between Generations
Abstract: An intertemporal model of consumption and bequest behaviour is specified and analysed as a game between generations. The main feature of this game is that no a priori restrictions (like linearity) are placed on the strategy choice of generations. The paper gives an existence proof for perfect (Nash) equilibria in finite and infinite horizon versions of the model and determines characteristic properties of equilibrium strategies. The main result is to demonstrate existence of stationary perfect equilibrium if the time horizon is infinite.

Title: On the Theory of Testing for Unit Roots in Observed Time Series
Abstract: This paper provides a framework for testing for a unit root in an observed time series against some alternatives considered previously by Anderson (1948). Some new tests for the unit root null hypothesis for the errors affecting a classical regression model against the non-stationary (including explosive) alternative hypothesis are developed. The previous results of Sargan and Bhargava (1983) and the new test statistics are then applied to test the simple random walk and the random walk with a constant drift null hypotheses against stationary and non-stationary one-sided alternatives. In each case, the test statistic is simplified in order that it could be viewed as a von Neumann type ratio and the exact significance points are tabulated. Finally, the unit root null hypotheses are tested using U.S. data on the velocity of money and the Michigan PSID.

Title: Sticky Goods Prices, Flexible Asset Prices, Monopolistic Competition, and Monetary Policy
Abstract: A monetary general equilibrium asset-pricing model with sticky goods prices is developed. Goods prices are set by monopolistically competitive firms that maximize stock market value. Equilibria with underutilization of resources, excess capacity, in some states result, in contrast to previous monetary asset-pricing models. The degree of competition affects capacity utilization. Monetary policy can affect output and resource utilization, in addition to real asset prices, depending upon the amount of information available to the monetary authority.

Title: Endogeneous Protection, Factor Returns and Resource Allocation
Abstract: We consider a Heckscher-Ohlin-Samuelson trade model with two lobbies, representing the interests of factor owners, and two political parties. The lobbies contribute resources to politics, equating their returns to political and economic activity at the margin, while the parties maximize their probability of election, trading off general voter dissatisfaction with protection against the electioneering resources that favorable policies attract from the lobbies. The equilibrium level of protection of a factor and its expected rate of return increase with its relative endowment. If this relative endowment is high (low) then the factor will be better (worse) off than under free trade but at intermediate factor endowment ratios, both factors will be worse off. Under parameter changes making lobbies more sensitive to the commodity price, the lobbies contribute more resources to politics and can both be worse off even though the parties are proposing lower trade distortions.

Title: Factor Content Functions and the Theory of International Trade
Abstract: This paper introduces the concepts of direct and indirect factor trade utility functions and uses them to derive Marshallian and Hicksian factor content functions, which express the quantities of factors of production embodied in net imports as functions of the exogenous variables facing the economy. The properties of these functions are discussed and they are used to derive a number of new results. In particular, it is shown that, in certain circumstances, the existence of gains from trade is sufficient for the Heckscher-Ohlin theorem to hold in its factor content form.

Title: Exchange of Cost Information in Oligopoly
Abstract: When do oligopolists gain by sharing their private information about their costs with one another? What are the social welfare effects of such information exchange? I study these questions by comparing the oligopolists' expected profits under a cost sharing agreement with their expected profits in the Bayesian equilibrium that would arise without cost sharing. I also analyse the firms' decisions to form a trade association to share their cost data. Under conditions of linear demand and Cournot behaviour, industrywide information exchange is the unique point in the core of the trade association membership game. The exchange of cost data increases expected profits and welfare, but reduces expected consumer surplus. Cost sharing increases efficiency by raising the market shares of lower cost firms and reducing the variability of aggregate output. Consumer surplus is diminished, however, because the variance of output is reduced, and consumer surplus is a convex function of output.

Title: Market Excess Demand in Exchange Economies with Identical Preferences and Collinear Endowments
Abstract: In this paper we show that up to an arbitrary small neighbourhood of the boundary of the set of prices any given excess demand function can be considered as the excess demand of an economy with any large enough but finite number of individuals having identical preferences. Moreover, the individual endowments can be chosen collinear and in such a way that they yield any arbitrary price independent distribution of relative wealth.

Title: A Dynamic Baumol-Tobin Model of Money Demand
Abstract: This note considers a stochastic version of the Baumol-Tobin model of the demand for money. A dynamic demand function is derived for the case in which independent variables change to new, steady-state values. The (S, s) inventory policy is shown to give rise to an aggregate, partial-adjustment equation with a variable adjustment speed. The methodology is that introduced to target-threshold models by Milbourne, Buckholtz, and Wasan (1983) in their study of the Miller-Orr model.

Title: Multiple Time Series Regression with Integrated Processes
Abstract: This paper develops a general asymptotic theory of regression for processes which are integrated of order one. The theory includes vector autoregressions and multivariate regressions amongst integrated processes that are driven by innovation sequences which allow for a wide class of weak dependence and heterogeneity. The models studied cover cointegrated systems such as those advanced recently by Granger and Engle and quite general linear simultaneous equations systems with contemporaneous regressor error correlation and serially correlated errors. Problems of statistical testing in vector autoregressions and multivariate regressions with integrated processes are also studied. It is shown that the asympotic theory for conventional tests involves major departures from classical theory and raises new and important issues of the presence of nuisance parameters in the limiting distribution theory.

Title: The Estimation of "Surprise" Models and the "Surprise" Consumption Function
Abstract: In the first part of the paper we outline a method for estimating a class of models in which "news" or "surprises" appear and expectations are formed rationally. The method is an extension of the "errors-in-variables" method of McCallum and Wickens. As a by-product some of Pagan's results on the circumstances under which the commonly used "two-step" method of estimating "surprise" models is efficient are shown to be a consequence of well-known theorems on the efficiency of sub-system estimation when a subset of equations are exactly identified. In the second part of the paper the method is applied to Hall's random-walk model of consumption, which is extended to allow for stochastic interest rates and for leisure and government spending to be substitutes for private spending. The extended formulation is a great deal more successful at capturing the salient features of the data. We also derive approximate restrictions across the parameters of the model due to the rational expectations hypothesis but find that they are marginally rejected by the data. Finally, we evaluate the ability of the life-cycle with rational expectations model to encompass alternative models.

Title: Two Stage and Related Estimators and Their Applications
Abstract: This paper aims to provide a unified treatment of the properties of two stage estimators. General conditions are set forth for consistency, efficiency and correct inferences. Applications of the general theorems are made to models with expectations and diagnostic tests. The general approach frequently enables much simpler derivation of existing results, and provides a number of new ones.

Title: A Life-Cycle Consistent Empirical Model of Family Labour Supply Using Cross-Section Data
Abstract: This paper estimates a utility maximising model of the joint determination of male and female labour supplies using a sample of married couples from the U.K. Family Expenditure Survey. The emphasis is on the estimation of within period preferences that are consistent with intertemporal two-stage budgeting under uncertainty. However, the approach we adopt provides an alternative method of estimating certain aspects of life-cycle behaviour to the fixed effects λ-constant approach of Heckman and MaCurdy (1980), MaCurdy (1981) and Browning, Deaton and Irish (1985). Moreover, it relaxes some of the underlying restrictions that are implicit in these λ-constant models under uncertainty.

Title: Testing whether Unemployment Represents Intertemporal Labour Supply Behaviour
Abstract: In the Lucas-Rapping (1969) model of the labour market, fluctuations in unemployment represent individuals optimally adjusting their labour supply behaviour in response to fluctuations in wage rates over the business cycle. In this paper I propose and implement a misspecification test of the Lucas-Rapping treatment of unemployment as labour supply behaviour using panel data. This test extends previous such work with micro data by simultaneously allowing for intertemporal substitution, uncertainty and endogenous unemployment. Using the standard specification of intertemporal labour supply behaviour, I find strong evidence against this interpretation of unemployment. There are two possible interpretations of the test results. The first is that it is necessary to turn to alternative models of the labour market in which unemployed workers are off a supply function. The second is that the test results indicate the necessity of moving to more complex models of intertemporal substitution. However, given current econometric techniques and data sets, these alternative models of intertemporal substitution will be extremely difficult to test.

Title: Tax-Deferred Accounts, Constrained Choice and Estimation of Individual Saving
Abstract: The paper analyzes the effect of tax-deferred individual retirement accounts (IRAs) in the United States on net individual saving. The results are based on a model of constrained optimization with the limit on tax-deferred saving the principle constraint. The estimates suggest that contributions to IRAs represent substantial net saving increases. Were the IRA limit to be increased, only about 10 to 20% of resulting increase in IRA contributions would be taken from other savings. About 50% would come from reduced consumption and about 35% from reduced taxes.

Title: Stability of a U.K. Money Demand Equation: A Bayesian Approach to Testing Exogeneity
Abstract: The paper analyses an M3 demand for money equation for the United Kingdom. Attention is paid to the policy change that occurred in 1971 with the introduction of the measure known as Competition and Credit Control. Classical and Bayesian single equation instrumental variables procedures are developed to investigate the exogeneity of the short-term interest rate and the constancy of the parameters of the underlying relationships. The parameters of the short-term equation have changed as well as the exogeneity status of the interest rate variable but the parameters of the long-term equation appear to be less affected by the policy change.

Title: Hypothesis Testing in Unidentified Models
Abstract: An identified model is not necessary for statistical inference, but ambiguities can arise. This paper examines some simple examples and proposes a framework that distinguishes between the "refutation" and "confirmation" aspects of testing in an unidentified model. One particular problem is the interpretation given to overidentifying restrictions: a common view is that these are somehow not properly testable.

Title: Exact Inference for Continuous Time Markov Chain Models
Abstract: Methods for exact Bayesian inference under a uniform diffuse prior are set forth for the continuous time homogeneous Markov chain model. It is shown how the exact posterior distribution of any function of interest may be computed using Monte Carlo integration. The solution handles the problems of embeddability in a very natural way, and provides (to our knowledge) the only solution that systematically takes this problem into account. The methods are illustrated using several sets of data.

Title: Econometric Evaluation of Linear Macro-Economic Models
Abstract: Macro-economic models are generally designed to achieve a multiplicity of objectives and correspondingly, they have been evaluated using a vast range of statistical, econometric, economic, political and even aesthetic criteria. However, in so far as they claim to represent economic behaviour, empirical macro-economic systems are certainly open to direct evaluation and testing against data information. The last few years have witnessed a substantial growth in the literature on econometric evaluation techniques, but despite important improvements in formalising evaluation procedures and their increased scope, formidable problems confront any investigation of a high dimensional, non-linear, stochastic, dynamic structure. Since system characteristics are the prime concern of economy-wide models, it might be the case that the validity of every individual component is not essential to adequate overall performance. While this viewpoint is debatable it does draw attention to the need for system evaluation procedures, at which point data limitations pose serious constraints on formal tests. Thus a new "limited information" test of forecast encompassing is proposed, based only on forecasts and requiring no other data from a model's proprietors. The derivation, merits and drawbacks of such a test are presented together with some suggestions for testing entailed relationships and inter-equation feedbacks.

Title: Post-simulation Analysis of Monte Carlo Experiments: Interpreting Pesaran's (1974) Study of Non-nested Hypothesis Test Statistics
Abstract: "Monte Carlo experimentation in econometrics helps ‘solve’ deterministic problems by simulating stochastic analogues in which the analytical unknowns are reformulated as parameters to be estimated." (Hendry (1980)) With that in mind, Monte Carlo studies may be divided operationally into three phases: design, simulation, and post-simulation analysis. This paper provides a guide to the last of those three, post-simulation analysis, given the design and simulation of a Monte Carlo study, and uses Pesaran's (1974) study of statistics for testing non-nested hypotheses to illustrate the techniques described. A statistic is derived for testing for significant deviations between the asymptotic and (observed) finite sample properties. Further, that statistic provides the basis for analysing discrepancies between the finite sample and asymptotic properties using response surfaces. The results for Pesaran's study indicate the value of asymptotic theory in interpreting finite sample properties and certain limitations for doing so. Finally, a method is proposed for adjusting the finite sample sizes of different test statistics so that comparisons of their power may be made. Extensions to other finite sample properties are indicated.

Title: Non-Cooperative Bargaining Theory: An Introduction
Abstract: The paper provides an informal introduction to some of the main themes of the recent literature on "non-cooperative" or "sequential" bargaining models. It focuses in particular on the relationship between the new approach and the traditional axiomatic approach exemplified by "Nash bargaining theory" It illustrates the new insights offered by the non-cooperative approach, by reference to a detailed analysis of the manner in which the presence of an outside option available to one of the parties will affect the negotiated outcome. Finally, the difficulties which arise in extending this analysis to two-person bargaining with incomplete information, and to n-person bargaining, are discussed. This is a revised version of the fourth Review of Economic Studies Lecture presented in April 1985 at the joint meeting of the Association of University Teachers of Economics and the Royal Economic Society held in Oxford. The choice of lecturer is made by a panel whose members are currently Professors Hahn, Mirrlees and Nobay, and the paper is refereed in the usual way.

Title: Sunspots and Cycles
Abstract: Because sunspot equilibria seem to be of central importance for an understanding of rational expectations, we seek here to characterize completely a limited class of sunspot equilibria (stationary ones with two possible natural events) in the simplest overlapping generations model of production. We present a sufficient condition for the existence of stationary sunspot equilibria, examine how these are related to strictly periodic equilibria of the same order, and investigate how deterministic stationary equilibria bifurcate to stationary sunspot equilibria. A concluding section examines how our results survive in more general settings.

Title: Involuntary Unemployment and Worker Moral Hazard
Abstract: This paper critically examines the hypothesis that layoffs are involuntary in implicit labour contracts because they are used by employers to punish inferior worker performance. In repeated moral hazard situations, workers typically bear risk associated with whether they are chosen to be laid off even though the latter is uninformative about previous effort choices and wages are performance-contingent. However the hypothesis is unsatisfactory as optimal contracts involve involuntary retentions rather than involuntary layoffs in a wide variety of circumstances.

Title: Walrasian Indeterminacy and Keynesian Macroeconomics
Abstract: Overlapping generations models with or without production or a portfolio demand for money display a fundamental indeterminacy. Expectations matter; and they are not, in the short run, constrained by the hypotheses of agent optimization, rational expectations, and market clearing. No short run policy analysis is possible without some explicit understanding of how agents expect the economy to respond to the policy. In this framework of perfect foresight and market clearing prices, it is possible to make Keynesian assumptions about the rigidity of money wages and the exogeneity of "animal spirits" of investors, to use the standard IS-LM apparatus, and to derive Keynesian conclusions about the short run effectiveness of policy. Alternatively, starting from different but no less rational expectations, one can derive the "new classical" neutrality propositions.

Title: Social Security, Unanticipated Benefit Increases, and the Timing of Retirement
Abstract: Between 1969 and 1972, real U.S. social security retirement benefits rose by 20%. The rise was unanticipated and followed over 15 years of relatively constant real benefits. This paper proposes a model of retirement behaviour in which workers respond differently, although in a theoretically consistent manner, to the anticipated and unanticipated components of the social security benefit they can receive upon retirement. The retirement age decision in the presence of unanticipated benefit changes is shown to be a special case of utility maximization under a nonlinear budget constraint. The model is estimated using the Longitudinal Retirement History Survey.

Title: Rank-Order Contracts for a Principal with Many Agents
Abstract: For a principal with many agents, rank-order contracts remain incentive compatible even when information about agents' performance is known only to the principal because the total payment from the principal to all agents taken together is independent of the outcome that occurs. Under wider conditions than those considered previously in the literature, there is shown to exist a rank-order contract equivalent, exactly or approximately, to any (nonlinear) piece-rate contract. Under those conditions, therefore, results that depend on the unenforceability of piece rates under such asymmetric information disappear if rank-order contracts can be used.

Title: Spatial Competition with a Land Market: Hotelling and Von Thunen Unified
Abstract: We introduce into the standard spatial competition model the consumption of land by households, and study the spatial competition under the influence of a land market. In contrast to the standard assumption of a fixed, given distribution of households, we introduce the possibility of households' relocation in reaction to firms' location decisions. Thus, the spatial distribution of households is treated as endogenous, and a land market is introduced on which households compete for land-use. Households consume simultaneously land and firms' output. Accordingly, the demand of each household becomes in turn endogenous as it depends on the income left after the land rent is paid. Not surprisingly, the results obtained within this more general framework prove to be very different from the standard results. For example, in the 2- and 3-firm cases, the optimal configuration of firms is a Nash equilibrium when transport costs are high enough or the amount of vacant land is large enough. The existence property is restored in the 3-firm case when the transport costs are high enough. The introduction of vacant land causes a discontinuous change in the set of equilibrium configurations.

Title: Investment, Moral Hazard, and Occupational Licensing
Abstract: I analyse occupational licensing as an input regulation that requires minimum levels of human capital investment by professionals. By raising professionals' training levels, licensing helps alleviate moral hazard problems associated with the provision of high quality services. I also consider certification, whereby consumers are provided information about professionals' training levels. I show that licensing and certification tend to benefit consumers who value quality highly at the expense of those who do not. Licensing may raise total surplus if sellers' investments are not observable, but is Pareto-worsening if training levels are observable. Certification may, however, lead to excessive investment as a signalling device, and thus be Pareto Inferior to either licensing or to a policy of laissez-faire.

Title: Increasing Returns to Scale in Financial Intermediation and the Non-Neutrality of Government Policy
Abstract: A general equilibrium model of imperfectly competitive financial intermediaries is constructed and used to study the effects of some standard policy experiments. One-time increases in the growth rate and in the level of the stock of money have non-neutral (and sometimes surprising) effects on interest rates, the quantity of intermediated borrowing and lending, the number of intermediary firms, inflation and the price level. Optimal government macroeconomic policy is shown to reflect a tradeoff between public sector frictions and the capital market distortion created by increasing returns to scale and imperfect competition in private intermediation.

Title: On the Existence of Markov-Consistent Plans under Production Uncertainty
Abstract: Strotz (1956) and Pollak (1968) were among the first to study the behaviour of an economic agent whose preferences change over time. They suggested that such an agent would choose a "consistent plan" which they described as "the best plan that he would actually follow". A Markov-consistent plan has a particularly simple structure: current decisions are independent of past decisions, except insofar as past decisions affect the current values of state variables. Unfortunately, Markov-consistent plans do not generally exist. In this paper, we demonstrate that the existence problem dissappears for finite horizon problems when one introduces even a small amount of smooth uncertainty into production.
