Title: Racing with Uncertainty
Abstract: The paper presents two models of races in which there is both technological uncertainty and strategic interaction between competitors as the race unfolds. Most of the existing literature examines one or other of these features, but not the two combined. Our aim is to see how the efforts of competitors in a race vary with the intensity of rivalry between them. In our principal model, whch is of a one-dimensional race, it is shown that the leader in the race makes greater efforts than the follower, and efforts increase as the gap between competitors decreases. Under certain conditions the same results hold in our second, related model, which is of a two-dimensional race.

Title: Dynamic Duopoly: Prices and Quantities
Abstract: We study a dynamic model of duopoly in which firms choose both prices and quantities. If quantity (capacity) choices are relatively inflexible, firms generally carry excess (idle) capacity in equilibrium. Because of this enforcement cost, firms are unable to achieve monopoly levels. This contrasts with models in which which firms compete in either prices or quantities alone. On the other hand, if capacities are flexible firms may be able to sustain monopoly behaviour.

Title: Location Choice, Product Proliferation and Entry Deterrence
Abstract: Within a slightly modified version of Hotelling's model we reconsider the claim that the threat of entry induces existing firms to produce a larger number of products than they would otherwise. We show that entry deterrence, although optimal, need not be achieved through product proliferation. In some cases the incumbent monopolist resorts to an entry-deterring strategy based on location choice rather than product proliferation. We also show that in some cases the number of products chosen by the incumbent facing the threat of entry is strictly greater than the minimum number required to deter entry.

Title: Approximate Bertrand Equilibria in a Replicated Industry
Abstract: This paper considers the existence and properties of approximate Bertrand equilibria in a replicated industry. Price setting firms produce a homogeneous product with weakly convex costs. The main results are that: (a) Given ɛ &gt; 0, an ɛ-equilibrium exists if the industry is large enough; (b) If the ɛ is small enough, and the industry large enough, any ɛ-equilibrium is approximately competitive. These results depend on how contingent demand is specified.

Title: Demand-Driven Innovation and Spatial Competition Over Time
Abstract: This paper explores a model of innovation and spatial competition over time. A key implication of the paper is that firms' size is positively autocorrelated across time. The mechanism that generates this persistence works only in heterogenous-product markets and is based on the idea that larger firms possess better information about the design of future products. Some corroborating evidence is cited.

Title: Risk Aversion and the Choice Between Risky Prospects: The Preservation of Comparative Statics Results
Abstract: Most results in what can be termed the comparative statics of risk aversion are obtained when there is only one source of uncertainty. The primary example (which originally motivated the definition of risk aversion) is that more risk averse people are willing to pay a higher premium for insuring against risk. It is known that the results do not generally carry over when there is another source of uncertainty. The paper develops conditions under which comparative statics results are robust against the introduction of additional sources of uncertainty.

Title: Small Income Effects: A Marshallian Theory of Consumer Surplus and Downward Sloping Demand
Abstract: We formalize the Marshallian idea that when the proportion of income spent on any commodity is small then the income effects are small. If n is the number of goods, we show, under certain assumptions on preferences and prices, that the order of magnitude of the norm of the income derivative of demand is 1/√n. As a corollary we get that for the case of a single price change the percentage error in approximating the Hicksian Deadweight Loss by its Marshallian counterpart goes to zero at least at the rate 1/√n and that demand is downward sloping for n large enough.

Title: Laboratory Tests of Equilibrium Predictions with Disequilibrium Data
Abstract: We examine a common practice used within previous studies of laboratory markets, testing equilibrium models using some data from markets that have not reached an equilibrium. We examine the effect of this practice when it is applied to some laboratory markets where an appreciable number of them eventually satisfied an operational definition of an equilibrium. Our data suggest that, for our markets, significantly different equilibrium test results would be obtained when using all data available in market periods analysed in previous studies rather than using only equilibrium data. For our markets, choices made in disequilibrium are quite different from those in equilibrium.

Title: Intertemporal Equilibrium and the Transfer Paradox
Abstract: The transfer paradox may occur in a world with only two countries at a dynamically stable intertemporal competitive equilibrium. In a framework of overlapping generations with production and investment, a transfer of income may immiserize the recipient while enriching the donor. Away from the golden rule, a transfer may result in a Pareto improvement.

Title: Entry Barriers and Economic Welfare
Abstract: The relationship between economic welfare and the number of firms in a quasi-Cournot market is examined. In the first place, we presuppose the existence of a strong ("first-best") government that can enforce the marginal-cost principle to the firms along with regulating the number of firms. It is shown that there exist excessive number of firms at the free-entry quasi-Cournot equilibrium vis-à-vis the "first-best" welfare maximizing number of firms. The thrust of this result essentially survives even if we replace a Utopian "first-best" government by a "second-best" government that leaves the firms to pursue their respective profit maximization freely and engages solely in regulating the number of firms. It can be shown that the excess entry prevails again in this "second-best" world.

Title: Asymptotic Growth under Uncertainty: Existence and Uniqueness
Abstract: This paper demonstrates, using the Reflection Principle, the existence and uniqueness of the solution to the classic Solow equation under continuous time uncertainty for the class of strictly concave production functions which are continuously differentiable on the nonnegative real numbers. This class contains all CES functions with elasticity of substitution less than unity. A steady state distribution also exists for this class of production functions which have a bounded slope at the origin. A condition on the drift-variance ratio of the stochastic differential equation alone, independent of technology and the savings ratio, is found to be necessary for the existence of a steady state.

Title: Bargaining with Two-sided Incomplete Information: An Infinite Horizon Model with Alternating Offers
Abstract: This paper examines an infinite horizon bargaining model, incorporating five features: two-sided incomplete information (with potentially information-revealing strategies), an infinite horizon, uncertainly concerning the potential gains from trade, an illumination of interesting qualitative bargaining issues, and plausible (free from arbitrarily specified out-of-equilibrium conjectures) equilibria. These features, motivated in the paper, have powerful implications. A Nash equilibrium exists, and is generically both unique and sequential. Comparative static implications of variations in the game's specifications are developed. We find that natural indications of bargaining strength emerge from the model, and establish the intuitive result that an increase in a player's relative bargaining strength makes that player more likely to capture the gains from bargaining.

Title: On Bayesian Implementable Allocations
Abstract: This paper identifies several social choice correspondences which are or are not fully implementable in economic environments when agents are incompletely informed about the environment. We show that in contrast to results in the case of complete information, neither efficient allocations nor core allocations define implementable social choice correspondences. We also identify conditions under which the Rational Expectations Equilibrium correspondence is implementable. We extend the concepts of fair allocations and Lindahl allocations to economies with incomplete information, and show that envy-free allocations and Lindahl allocations are implementable under some conditions while fair allocations are not.

Title: Incentives, Compensation, and Social Welfare
Abstract: Alternative wage structures under conditions of moral hazard are analysed from a social welfare standpoint. It is argued that ex post equity judgements in an uncertainty context should incorporate a preference for "positive correlation" of utilities of different individuals. In the design of compensation schemes, this may give rise to a conflict between ex post equity objectives and the need to provide effort incentives: relative performance clauses in compensation schemes that are useful for providing incentives are undesirable from an ex post equity standpoint. This is demonstrated by showing (a) in a context of independent production uncertainties, every rankorder tournament is welfare-dominated by a set of independent (randomized) contracts, and (b) welfare-optimal compensation schemes in general depend separately on an equity and an incentive component that tend to correlate agent compensations in different directions.

Title: Economic Growth with Intergenerational Altruism
Abstract: We consider the properties of equilibrium behaviour in an aggregative growth model with intergenerational altruism. Various positive properties such as the cyclicity of equilibrium programs, and the convergence of equilibrium stocks to a steady state, are analyzed. Among other normative properties, it is established that under certain natural conditions, Nash equilibrium programs are efficient and "modified Pareto optimal" in a sense made clear in the paper, but never Pareto optimal in the traditional sense.

Title: The Information Matrix Test for the Linear Model
Abstract: We derive the information matrix test, suggested by White, for the normal fixed regressor linear model, and show that the statistic decomposes asymptotically into the sum of three independent quadratic forms. One of these is White's general test for heteroscedasticity and the remaining two components are quadratic forms in the third and fourth powers of the residuals respectively. Our results show that the test will fail to detect serial correlation and never be asymptotically optimal against heteroscedasticity, skewness and non-normal kurtosis.

Title: Testing in Models of Asymmetric Information
Abstract: This paper explores the role of testing in models of asymmetric information. We demonstrate conditions under which testing for underlying characteristics can overcome adverse selection problems and lead to a full-information competitive equilibrium. This paper provides a more general statement of Mirrlees result on the optimal use of infinite fines. Where testing cannot fully resolve the problems associated with asymmetric information, we outline the source of the difficulties. Our results, developed in the context of a labour market, can be directly extended to other environments. In problems with asymmetric information, testing to discover an agent's chosen action or underlying characteristics may significantly reduce the cost of moral hazard and adverse selection.

Title: First Mover Disadvantages with Private Information
Abstract: We consider a leader-follower game with output quantities as strategies, so as to demonstrate the reduced advantages of the Stackleberg leader in a stochastic environment with private information. At the equilibrium, the strategy of the leader reveals to the follower information about the demand. In an attempt to signal low demand, the leader contracts his output. Nevertheless, unless the leader's information is infinitely noisy, the follower can always correctly infer his signal. We find a wide range of parameter values over which the follower is better off compared to the leader.

Title: Dynamic Behaviour in Large Markets for Differentiated Products
Abstract: An important question is how well competitive models approximate models of large finite economies. For a class of differentiated products models static Nash equilibria, if they exist, always converge to competition as the number of firms increases. Dynamic Nash equilibria need not so converge. Easily checked conditions for convergence to competition do, however, exist.

Title: Noncooperative Entry Deterrence, Uncertainty, and the Free Rider Problem
Abstract: Previous authors who have considered the issue of noncooperative entry deterrence have not found the free rider problem to be a significant factor. These authors, however, have only considered models in which the exact investment needed to deter entry is known with certainty. In this paper I add uncertainty to the models investigated by these previous authors, and demonstrate that the free rider problem can be significant, but is not so in all cases. That is, for certain types of entry deterring investments the introduction of uncertainty causes the oligopoly to underinvest in entry deterrence; however, for other types no underinvestment result arises.

Title: Short-Term Contracting and Strategic Oil Reserves
Abstract: The effect of short-term contracting on resource extraction is studied, in a two-country model of international trade in oil. Countries' planners are assumed to be fully rational, with perfect information and perfect foresight. Contracts are assumed perfectly enforceable and complete, except that short-term contracts do not allow commitments to actions taken beyond the contract period. We show that short-term contracting limits countries' opportunities for intertemporal consumption-smoothing, reducing their collective tolerance for temporal variation in consumption. This tends to make them extract more slowly than in the efficient plan that results from long-term contracting.

Title: A Dynamic Specific-Factors Model of International Trade
Abstract: In a dynamic economy land and capital serve not only as factors of production but as assets which individuals use to transfer income from working periods to retirement. Changes in the terms of trade and in the endowments of fixed factors do not necessarily have the same effects on factor prices and on the composition of output as they do in a static framework. Changes in these variables affect both total savings and the amount of savings that is diverted toward investment in capital. Results derived from the traditional specific-factors model are more likely to emerge when the sector using land as a factor of production has a higher labor share than the sector using capital. In this case the land-using sector dominates factor markets more than asset markets. Once the roles for land and capital as assets are recognized, the possibility of natural resource booms that reduce steady-state welfare arises. At the same time, an increase in population can raise steady-state welfare.

Title: Strategic Delay in Bargaining
Abstract: This paper analyses a bargaining model with incomplete information in which the time between offers is an endogenous strategic variable. We find equilibria involving a delay to agreement that is due to the use of strategic time delay by bargainers to signal their relative strength. Under some specifications of the parameters, delay is present in the unique sequential equilibrium whose beliefs satisfy one intuitive restriction. This delay does not vanish as the minimal time between offers becomes small.

Title: Introductory Price as a Signal of Cost in a Model of Repeat Business
Abstract: A two-period game between firms and consumers is considered. Firms are privately informed about their individual costs, and consumers must pay a search cost in order to learn a firm's current price. Consumers thus have incentive to use introductory price as a signal of cost and, hence, second period price. Recent refinements of the sequential equilibrium concept are employed, and the resulting equilibria involve low introductory prices (introductory sales).

Title: Optimal Penal Codes in Price-setting Supergames with Capacity Constraints
Abstract: Optimal penal codes are constructed for a class of infinitely repeated games with discounting. These games can be interpreted as Bertrand oligopoly games with capacity constraints. No particular rationing rule is adopted; weak restrictions are imposed on the firms' sales functions instead. Models adopting the commonly used rationing rules are special cases of the general framework studied here. It is found that firms can be driven to their security levels by credible punishments.

Abstract: A symmetric allocation in a continuum is "multilaterally incentive compatible" if no finite coalition of privately informed agents can manipulate it by combining deception with hidden trades of exchangeable goods. Sufficient conditions for multilateral compatibility are that all agents face the same linear prices for exchangeable goods, and that indistinguishable agents face identical budget sets. The same conditions are necessary under assumptions which extend those under which the second efficiency theorem of welfare economics holds in a continuum economy. Markets for exchangeable goods emerge as binding constraints on the set of Pareto efficient allocations with private information.

Title: Commitment and Fairness in a Dynamic Regulatory Relationship
Abstract: This paper considers a multiperiod model of a regulated firm that has (stationary) private information which may be revealed through performance. If it cannot make commitments to future policies, the regulator has an incentive to exploit any information the firm reveals, and Laffont and Tirole show that there is no regulatory policy that is separating over any closed interval. A "fairness" arrangement is proposed in which the firm agrees not to quit if in future periods the regulator allows it to earn a nonnegative profit given the type it revealed in earlier periods. The properties of such arrangements are studied, and an example is presented in which both the firm and the regulator prefer a fairness arrangement to a policy feasible without commitment.

Title: A Search Model Applied to the Transition from Education to Work
Abstract: This paper presents the specification and estimation of a search model applied to the transition from education to work. The theoretical search model includes the possibility of variable search intensity. The empirical model with a reservation wage relation is estimated using maximum likelihood methods. A data set containing information on new law graduates is used for the estimation. Finally, the model is estimated for two separate subperiods to investigate the effects of market changes.

Title: Search, Wage Bargains and Cycles
Abstract: I use an equilibrium model of job matchings with a Nash wage equation to derive the response of wages and unemployment to productivity shocks. By endogenising labour's threat point, I show that wages absorb fully permanent shock but only partially temporary shocks. Hence, unemployment responds to perceived temporary shocks but not to permanent shocks.

Title: Transfer Sensitive Inequality Measures
Abstract: Transfer sensitivity has been seen as a means of strengthening the Pigou-Dalton "principle of transfers", by ensuring that more weight in the inequality assessment is attached to transfers taking place lower down in the distribution. This paper examines the concept of transfer sensitivity in detail and proposes a new definition that can be usefully applied in general contexts. The definition is based on the notion of "favourable composite transfers" which involve a regressive transfer combined with a simultaneous progressive transfer at a lower income level. The paper proceeds to identify when one distribution can be obtained from another using a sequence of progressive transfers and favourable composite transfers, and hence when all transfer sensitive Pigou-Dalton indices agree on their pairwise inequality ranking. Since agreement occurs in some situations when Pigou-Dalton indices are not unanimous, transfer sensitivity adds power to the "unambiguous" inequality judgements based on the Pigou-Dalton condition and, in particular, enables distributions whose Lorenz curves intersect to be conclusively ranked.

Title: A Theory of Monetary Exchange
Abstract: The transactions cost for alternative exchange mechanisms for the household exchange problem can be characterized by the computational complexity of the exchange process. The computational complexity for any exchange mechanism is at least nH, where n is the number of goods and H is the number of households. Imposing the conditions of conservation, nonnegativity and quid pro quo results in a command exchange mechanism whose computational complexity is nH. Multiparty barter exchange, formalized using graph theory, has computational complexity equal to the minimum of (nH2, n2H). Introducing an auxiliary good, money, reduces the computational complexity to nH. A problem with decentralized information is demonstrated.

Title: Household Equivalence Scales and Interpersonal Comparisons
Abstract: Recent papers have used household equivalence scales to construct measures of welfare inequality. This procedure rests on an often implicit value judgement, namely, that if, after adjustment for demographic characteristics, two households are on the same indifference curve, they are equally well off. That value judgement is not compelling, and there are situations in which it is ethically repugnant. This is particularly likely if tastes are functions of past experience and income.

Title: Samurai Accountant: A Theory of Auditing and Plunder
Abstract: A risk neutral principal wishes to exact a payment from a risk neutral agent whose wealth he does not know, but may verify through a costly auditing procedure. We characterize efficient schemes for the principal when he is allowed to choose schedules for preaudit and postaudit payments and audit probabilities, subject to the constraint that only monetary incentives can be used and that the principal may never make a net payment to the agent. The main results are that efficient schemes involve preaudit payments which are increasing in the agent's wealth, audit probabilities are decreasing in the agent's wealth and also satisfy certain constraints as equalities. In general, such schemes involve stochastic auditing and rebates after an audit.

Title: Reputation in the Simultaneous Play of Multiple Opponents
Abstract: Imagine that one player, the "incumbent" competes with several "entrants". Each entrant competes only with the incumbent, but observes play in all contests. Previous work shows that, as more and more entrants are added, the incumbent's reputation may dominate play of the game, if the entrants are faced in sequence. We identify conditions under which similar results obtain when the entrants are faced simultaneously, and we find specifications in which adding more simultaneous entrants has a dramatically different effect. We also show that, with either sequential or simultaneous play, incumbents need not prefer the situation in which their reputations can and do dominate play to the "informationally isolated" case in which each entrant observes only play in its own contest.

Title: Games with Discontinuous Payoffs
Abstract: We prove an equilibrium existence result for a class of games with an infinite number of strategies. Our theorem generalises an earlier result by Dasgupta and Maskin. We also identify conditions under which the limit of pure-strategy equilibria of a sequence of finite games is an equilibrium for the limit game. We apply this result to obtain new existence results for the multi-firm, l-dimensional version of Hotellings's location game. The techniques used suggest a technique for computing such equilibria.

Title: On Repeated Moral Hazard with Discounting
Abstract: In this paper, we analyze optimal contracts in an infinitely repeated agency model in which both the principal and agent discount the future. We show that there is a stationary representation of the optimal contract when the agent's conditional discounted expected utility is used as a state variable. This representation reduces the multi-period problem to a static variational problem which can be analyzed using standard variational techniques. This reduction is used to obtain several properties of the contract.

Title: Entry, Fixed Costs and the Aggregation of Private Information
Abstract: We investigate the ability of the price system to aggregate private information in a market of uncertain size and where set-up costs are incurred by entrants. It is shown that the equilibrium is random even when the totality of private information is so large that aggregate uncertainty is virtually non-existent. In particular, the limiting equilibrium does not approach the full-information, Walrasian outcome. Hence, the model identifies a technological factor (increasing returns) which gives rise to informational losses.

Title: A Decision Theoretic Model of Innovation, Technology Transfer, and Trade
Abstract: We analyse a dynamic North-South model of innovation, technology transfer, and trade. Northern firms conduct R&amp;D using labour which has alternative uses producing in the R&amp;D sector or a nontraded good sector. Since technology transfer prevents the North from fully appropriating benefits of R&amp;D, the optimal rate of innovation for either profit maximizing firms or a utility maximizing Northern planner is less than globally optimal. An increased transfer rate intensifies competition of lower wage Southern workers with Northern workers in production, so profit maximizing Northern firms (irrespective of their number or cooperation in R&amp;D) reallocate labour toward R&amp;D.

Title: Further Results on Testing AR (1) Against MA (1) Disturbances in the Linear Regression Model
Abstract: This paper examines testing for AR(1) disturbances against MA(1) disturbances in the linear regression model. A Monte Carlo experiment compares the small-sample properties of the Cox test, some linearized Cox tests, and an approximate point optimal test, as well as a Lagrange multiplier test of AR (1) disturbances against ARM A (1,1) disturbances. The main findings are that the true sizes of the asymptotic non-nested tests can differ considerably from their nominal sizes, the Lagrange multiplier test's sizes are reasonably accurate and the point optimal test is generally more powerful than the other tests when appropriate critical values are used. When sizes are controlled at an arbitrary value of the AR (1) parameter, the relative power of the Cox test is increased substantially.

Title: Alternative Asymptotically Optimal Tests and Their Application to Dynamic Specification
Abstract: A method is presented for generating test statistics which share the same first order asymptotic optimality properties of the classical statistics. Generalizing Neyman's (1959) work, the linearised classical statistic tests restrictions in implicit function form using a parameter estimator which is consistent and asymptotically normally distributed under the alternative hypothesis. By judicious choice of estimator and form of restrictions at which to evaluate the statistic, a class of asymptotically optimal statistics is obtained among which are numbered some familiar classical statistics. An application is presented for testing common factor restrictions in a single equation dynamic regression model with moving average disturbances.

Title: Necessary and Sufficient Conditions for Uniqueness of a Cournot Equilibrium
Abstract: In this paper a theorem is developed giving necessary and sufficient conditions for the uniqueness of homogeneous product Cournot equilibria. The result appears to be the strongest to date and the first to involve both necessity and sufficiency. The theorem states than an equilibrium is unique if and only if the determinant of the Jacobian of marginal profits for firms producing positive output is positive at all equilibria. The result applies to the case where profit functions are twice differentiable and pseudoconcave, industry output can be bounded, the above Jacobian is non-singular at equilibria, and marginal profits are strictly negative for non-producing firms. The proof uses fixed point index theory from differential topology.
