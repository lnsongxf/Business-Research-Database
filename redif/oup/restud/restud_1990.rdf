Title: Signalling in a Dynamic Labour Market
Abstract: This paper analyzes a multiperiod version of the Spence Job Market Signalling Model in which workers cannot commit to an education choice and firms make wage offers at any point in time. The dynamic competition combined with the incomplete information yield a multiplicity of sequential equilibria, including ones that sustain implicit collusion, even though the length of the game is finite. Emphasis is placed on equilibria that satisfy the "independence of never weak best response" criterion of Kohlberg and Mertens (1986). It is shown that in the limit, as the time between offers tends to zero, any such equilibrium results (in expectation) in the unique stable outcome of the static Spence model.

Title: Strategic Information Revelation
Abstract: We analyze the problem in which agents have non-public information and are to play an asymmetric information game. The agents may reveal some or all of their information to other agents prior to playing this game. Revelation is via exogenously specified certifiable statements. The equilibria resulting from various revelation strategies are used to determine equilibrium revelation of information. Sufficient conditions are provided for complete revelation of all private information. A number of examples are provided illustrating when revelation will or will not occur in commonly analyzed games.

Title: Dynamic Auctions
Abstract: A dynamic trading game is examined in which two uninformed buyers engage in Bertrand-like competition to attempt to purchase a single object of uncertain quality from an informed seller. It is shown that there exists a unique perfect sequential equilibrium. The game is compared to an analogous bargaining game in which a single uninformed buyer makes offers to a single seller. Despite the fact that in the equilibrium of the competitive game, buyers compete away their surplus, it is shown that sellers can often gain a higher ex ante surplus in the bargaining game.

Title: Decentralized Trading, Strategic Behaviour and the Walrasian Outcome
Abstract: For a market with a finite number of agents, pairwise matching and bargaining, it is shown that, even when the market is frictionless, the equilibrium is not necessarily competitive. It depends on the amount of information agents use. If their behaviour is conditioned only on the sets of agents present and the time, the competitive solution is the unique subgame perfect equilibrium. If agents have full information and condition their behaviour on some of it, there are also noncompetitive equilibria in which behaviour depends on specific information such as the identity of the trading partner and past events.

Title: Stationary Recursive Utility and Dynamic Programming under the Assumption of Biconvergence
Abstract: This paper introduces the concept of biconvergence, which is a weak and intuitive topological assumption on the utility function and the production function together. Concerning recursive utility, we show that, given biconvergence, the utility function is the unique admissible solution to Koopmans' equation. Concerning dynamic programming, we show that, given biconvergence, the true value function exists, it is the unique admissible solution to Bellman's equation, and it may be calculated numerically as the limit of successive approximations. Finally, we develop an overly strong sufficient condition for biconvergence which substantially weakens the Lipschitz condition used by contraction-mapping techniques.

Title: Statistical Inference in Instrumental Variables Regression with I(1) Processes
Abstract: This paper studies the asymptotic properties of instrumental variable (IV) estimates of multivariate cointegrating regressions and allows for deterministic and stochastic regressors as well as quite general deterministic processes in the data-generating mechanism. It is found that IV regressions are consistent even when the instruments are stochastically independent of the regressors. This phenomenon, which contrasts with traditional theory for stationary time series, is a beneficial artifact of spurious regression theory whereby stochastic trends in the instruments ensure their relevance asymptotically. Problems of inference are also addressed and some promising new theoretical results are reported. These involve a class of Wald tests which are modified by semiparametric corrections for serial correlation and for endogeneity. The resulting test statistics which we term fully-modified Wald tests have limiting X2 distributions, thereby removing the obstacles to inference in cointegrated systems that were presented by the nuisance parameter dependencies in earlier work. Some simulation results are reported which seek to explore the sampling behaviour of our suggested procedures. These simulations compare our fully modified (semiparametric) methods with the parametric error-correction methodology that has been extensively used in recent empirical research and with conventional least squares regression. Both the fully-modified and errorcorrection methods work well in finite samples and the sampling performance of each procedure confirms the relevance of asymptotic distribution theory, as distinct from super-consistency results, in discriminating between statistical methods.

Title: Testing for Autocorrelation in Dynamic Random Effects Models
Abstract: This article develops, tests of covariance restrictions after estimating by three-stage least squares a dynamic random effects model from panel data. The asymptotic distribution of covariance matrix estimates under non-normality is obtained. It is shown how minimum chi-square tests for interesting covariance restrictions can be calculated from a generalised linear regression involving the sample autocovariances and dummy variables. Asymptotic efficiency exploiting covariance restrictions can also be attained using a GLS estimator.

Title: Testing AR(1) Against MA(1) Disturbances in the Linear Regression Model: An Alternative Procedure
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the problem of testing the hypothesis that the disturbances of a regression model are generated by a first-order autoregressive process against the alternative assumption that they follow a first-order moving average scheme. The test proposed has the advantages of requiring only ordinary least squares estimation and of being simple to implement. Some Monte Carlo results on the finite sample behaviour of the test are provided.

Title: Inflationary Consequences of Anticipated Macroeconomic Policies
Abstract: Budget deficits implying an unbounded present value of government debt are infeasible and hence induce expectations of a future policy change. We study how expectations of a policy switch whose timing or mix between expenditure cuts, tax increases or increases in money growth rates may be uncertain, affect economic dynamics before the switch takes place. We are especially concerned with the correlation between changes in the deficit and inflation. Of particular interest is our finding that timing uncertainty may induce fluctuations in the rate of inflation that seem to be unrelated to the budget deficit, at a time when the budget deficit is responsible for inflation.

Title: The Non-Parametric Identification of Generalized Accelerated Failure-Time Models
Abstract: We consider a class of models that generalizes the popular Mixed Proportional Hazard (MPH) model for duration data: the Generalized Accelerated Failure-Time (GAFT) model. We show that the GAFT model is non-parametrically identified (up to a normalization). We then reconsider the non-parametric identification of the MPH model. We show that the class of MPH models is not closed under normalization. This implies that a finite mean of the mixing distribution is a necessary condition for (non-parametric) identification of the MPH model. It is impossible to test this hypothesis without imposing arbitrary restrictions on the base-line hazard and/or the regression function.

Title: Real Rigidities and the Non-Neutrality of Money
Abstract: Rigidities in real prices are not sufficient to create rigidities in nominal prices and real effects of nominal shocks. And, by themselves, small frictions in nominal adjustment, such as costs of changing prices, create only small non-neutralities. But this paper shows that substantial nominal rigidity can arise from a combination of real rigidities and small nominal frictions. The paper shows the connection between real and nominal rigidity given the presence of nominal frictions both in general and for two specific sources of real rigidity, one arising from goods market imperfections and the other from labour market imperfections.

Title: Predetermined Wages and Prices and the Impact of Expansionary Government Policy
Abstract: This paper characterizes the monetary equilibria of an economy with commodity and labour contracts. If government policy is not "too variable," there may exist an equilibrium with predetermined wages and prices. In this equilibrium, observed changes in the money supply to finance government purchases have persistent real effects. The paper also provides theoretical support for an inverse relationship between the degree of indexation in contracts and the persistence of policy effects.

Title: Growth and Inequality in the Dual Model of Development: The Role of Demand Factors
Abstract: This paper relates growth and income distribution in the development of a dual economy. Its originality lies in the fact that the analysis of income inequality uses the whole Lorenz curve instead of some summary measures, and that the dual economy is represented through a fully-specified general equilibrium model. Conditions for particular shifts in the Lorenz curve are derived. They mostly involve the income and price elasticities of demand faced by the traditional sector of the economy, and suggest that an unambiguous drop in income inequality is somewhat unlikely at the dual stage of development.

Title: Asset Markets and Equilibrium Processes
Abstract: The failure of the asset market to be complete causes serial dependence in output and prices, which is suboptimal. We consider an economy with white noise shocks. When the asset market is complete, an optimal, competitive allocation inherits this strong stationarity. When the asset market is only sequentially complete, prices and output necessarily display serial dependence at equilibrium. The further incompleteness of a monetary economy explains co-movements in real and nominal variables.

Title: Nonstationarity in Job Search Theory
Abstract: Generally, structural job search models are taken to be stationary. In this paper models are examined in which every exogenous variable can cause nonstationarity, for instance because its value is dependent on unemployment duration. A general differential equation that describes the evolution of the reservation wage over time is derived. As an empirical illustration a nonstationary structural model is estimated that focuses on the consequences of a downward shift in the level of benefits. It appears that the elasticity of duration with respect to the level of benefits after the shift is much larger than the elasticity with respect to the level before the shift.

Title: On The Efficiency of Matching and Related Models of Search and Unemployment
Abstract: This paper describes a simple framework for evaluating the allocative performance of economies characterized by trading frictions and unemployment. This framework integrates the normative results of earlier Diamond-Mortensen-Pissarides bilateral matching-bargaining models of trade coordination and price-setting, and consists of a set of general conditions for constrained Pareto efficient resource allocation that are applicable to conventional natural rate models. To illustrate, several conventional models of the labour market are reformulated as matching-bargaining problems and analyzed using this framework.

Title: A Theory of Signalling During Job Search, Employment Efficiency, and "Stigmatised" Jobs
Abstract: This paper discusses why redundant skilled workers may be reluctant to accept interim unskilled jobs. If skilled work is more satisfying or less arduous for highly productive workers, then such workers invest more in moving quickly between skilled jobs. Thus, high productivity workers tend to search on-the-job, and if unemployed will specialise in job search, rather than take an interim position. If individual differences in productivity are known to the worker but not the potential employer, then search strategy may be used as a productivity signal, with more than the efficient proportion of workers searching on-the-job and too few accepting interim unskilled jobs. Optimal policy requires a subsidy on interim unskilled jobs.

Title: Equilibrium in CAPM Without a Riskless Asset
Abstract: In the mean-variance CAPM without a riskless asset, the possibility of satiation sometimes leads to non-existence of general equilibrium. Moreover, because portfolio preferences are not necessarily monotone, equilibrium asset prices, when they exist, may be negative or zero. To demonstrate the possibility of non-existence, and to develop an intuitive understanding of when and why equilibrium does or does not exist, this paper fully investigates the special case of utility functions linear in mean and variance and partially extends the results to the general case.

Title: Strategic Models of Sovereign-Debt Renegotiations
Abstract: The sovereign-debt literature has often implicitly assumed that all the power in the bargaining game between debtor and creditor lies with the latter. This paper explores that assumption by analyzing three game-theoretic models of debt renegotiations. In two of the models, both of which are built on the traditional one-sector growth model, all the subgame-perfect equilibria have an extreme form in which the game's surplus is captured by the creditor. The third game has many subgame-perfect equilibria that do not have this feature, however. The roles of various assumptions in all three games are examined.

Title: Asymmetric Information Bargaining Problems with Many Agents
Abstract: A yes or no decision must be made about some issue. All agents must agree. The "Coase Theorem" asserts that the efficient outcome will always result. Suppose the value (positive or negative) that an individual attaches to an affirmative decision is privately known to that individual. It is proved, under very mild conditions, that with independent types, as the number of agents increases, the probability of an affirmative efficient decision goes to zero. An example in which it is common knowledge that an affirmative decision is efficient and yet the probability of such a decision goes to zero is given.

Title: Workers Versus Firms: Bargaining Over a Firm's Value
Abstract: We introduce a distinction between a firm and its network of workers. In a competitive world, if networks are easily lured away, the workers must receive the entire value of their contribution to the firm. How then can service firms have equity value? A model is analysed in which workers are paid less as a group than their value, even in a competitive world. The workers are assumed to have a nonwage benefit for working at the current firm; this benefit is privately known. These privately known benefits make it impossible for the workers to agree on a division of their value should they leave the existing firm for a new enterprise. The result is that the workers may receive a total compensation that is less than their contribution to the firm.

Title: Firing Costs and Labour Demand: How Bad is Eurosclerosis?
Abstract: This paper proposes a model of firms' optimal employment policies under linear adjustment costs. We find that firing costs have a larger effect on firms' propensity to fire than to hire, and (slightly) increase average long-run employment. Calibrating the model with realistic parameter values, we argue that high firing costs, slower and more uncertain growth, and lower attrition rates after the first oil shock can explain some features of employment's dynamic behaviour in the largest European countries.

Title: A Positive Theory of Fiscal Deficits and Government Debt
Abstract: This paper considers an economy in which policymakers with different preferences alternate in office as a result of elections. Government debt is used strategically by each policymaker to influence the choices of his successors. If different policymakers disagree about the desired composition of government spending between two public goods, the economy exhibits a deficits bias; that is, debt accumulation is higher than it would be with a social planner. The equilibrium level of debt is larger the larger is the degree of polarization between alternating governments and the less likely it is that the current government will be re-elected.

Title: On the Inefficiency of Two-Part Tariffs
Abstract: The partial equilibrium literature on two-part tariffs suggests that if a commodity is produced under increasing returns, efficiency can be achieved through marginal cost pricing and a suitable choice of "entry fees" (fixed charge) which may vary from consumer to consumer. We show that this partial equilibrium intuition cannot be extended beyond some special cases. Even with a consumer-specific fixed charge, it is possible that none of the equilibria yield Pareto efficiency. Furthermore, it may be impossible to achieve Pareto efficiency through any specification of taxes which are levied solely to cover losses.

Title: Joint Ownership of a Convex Technology: Comparison of Three Solutions
Abstract: A given set of agents jointly own and operate a decreasing returns to scale technology (with a single input and a single output). They all contribute some input and receive some of the output. What first best allocation is equitable? We discuss three allocation mechanisms. The Equal Benefits solution gives every agent the same benefit, computed at the supporting price. The Equal Returns solution equalizes returns (output shares/input contributions) across agents. The Constant Returns Equivalent solution gives every agent his indirect utility level at some common price of output relative to input. A lower and an upper bound on individual welfares play a key role in these axiomatic characterisation results.

Title: Implementation via Augmented Revelation Mechanisms
Abstract: Consider the problem of Bayesian implementation, i.e., of constructing mechanisms with the property that all Bayesian equilibrium outcomes agree with a given choice rule. We show that a general procedure is to start with an incentive-compatible revelation mechanism, and then augment agents' message spaces in order to eliminate undesired equilibria. Specifically, we present an Augmented Revelation Principle, which states that if there exists any mechanism that implements a given choice rule, then an augmented revelation mechanism will also implement it. This principle enables us to obtain necessary conditions for implementation. For a large class of environments these conditions are also sufficient.

Title: Bolker-Jeffrey Expected Utility Theory and Axiomatic Utilitarianism
Abstract: This paper introduces the Bolker-Jeffrey version of expected utility theory, which differs in several important respects from the versions commonly used by economists. Within the Bolker-Jeffrey theory, the paper proves a theorem first proved by Harsanyi: if social preferences are coherent and Paretian, and individual preferences are coherent, then social utility can be taken to be the sum of individual utilities. But the paper shows that in the Bolker-Jeffrey theory the proof requires very stringent assumptions. It assesses the significance of this fact.

Title: Stochastic Dominance in Regret Theory
Abstract: The regret theory of choice under uncertainty is known to admit intransitivities in preference relations. In this paper, the stochastic dominance properties of the theory are examined. It is shown that the usual definition of first stochastic dominance is not satisfied by regret-theoretic preferences and that, in general, violations of first stochastic dominance are not merely permitted but required. An exact characterization of the stochastic dominance rule corresponding to regret-theoretic preferences is presented. This concept is weaker than the usual definition, but stronger than the notion of statewise dominance in which one prospect yields a preferred outcome with probability 1.

Title: Best Upper and Lower Tchebycheff Bounds on Expected Utility
Abstract: It is useful to have bounds on expected utility in situations in which the relevant distribution is skewed. This paper assumes that the third moment of the distribution is known and uses knowledge of the first three moments to derive upper and lower Tchebycheff bounds.

Title: Prices vs. Quantities and Delegating Price Authority to a Monopolist
Abstract: This paper examines the desirability of allowing a monopolist to determine the market price. We find that none of the regulatory mechanisms previously discussed in the "prices vs. quantities"  literature strictly dominates unregulated, monopoly price-setting. Furthermore, despite suggestions by others, price-setting by a regulated monopolist whose profits coincide with society's net benefits is not always the most desirable means of control. Quantity-setting by such a monopolist may instead be the preferred choice. Combining both into one incentive-compatible mechanism provides the best regulatory scheme and one in which the regulator need not be informed about costs.

Title: Entry in Monopoly Market
Abstract: This paper develops new empirical models of market concentration from game-theoretic models of entry. We construct our models from inequality conditions that describe entrants' equilibrium strategies in simultaneous-move and sequential-move games, and use them to study the effects of entry in isolated monopoly markets for new automobiles. From estimates of the market size necessary to support one and two dealers, we conclude that monopoly dealers do not block the entry of a second dealer. We also find that entry does not cause price-cost margins to fall by much.

Title: Repeated Games with Long-run and Short-run Players
Abstract: This paper studies the set of equilibrium payoffs in repeated games with long- and short-run players and little discounting. Because the short-run players are unconcerned about the future, each equilibrium outcome is constrained to lie on their static reaction (best-response) curves. The natural extension of the folk theorem to games of this sort would simply include this constraint in the definitions of the feasible payoffs and minmax values. In fact, this extension does obtain under the assumption that each player's choice of a mixed strategy for the stage game is publicly observable but, in contrast to standard repeated games, the set of equilibrium payoffs is different if players can observe only their opponents' realized actions.

Title: Uncertainty and Delay in Bargaining
Abstract: This paper investigates the relationship between uncertainty and delay of agreement in the one-sided offer bargaining model with two-sided uncertainty where the seller makes offers. We construct a weak stationary equilibrium in which different types of the seller charge different prices in every period. We completely characterize the separating equilibrium by three regularity conditions, and show that the time interval between offers converges to zero, the seller's initial price offer in a separating equilibrium converges with probability 1 to the lowest valuation of the buyer if and only if the gain from trading is common knowledge.

Title: Adverse Selection and Renegotiation in Procurement
Abstract: As was shown by Dewatripont, optimal long-term contracts under asymmetric information are generally not time-consistent. This paper fully characterizes the equilibrium of a two-period procurement model with commitment and renegotiation. It also analyzes whether renegotiated long-term contracts yield outcomes resembling those under either unrenegotiated long-term contracts or a sequence of short-term contracts, and links the analysis with the multiple unit durable good monopoly problem.

Title: Imhof Approximations to Econometric Estimators
Abstract: The article develops new approximations to the distribution function of a general econometric estimator or test statistic from a linear model. The method relies heavily on the general arguments for the validity of Edgeworth approximations, and produces formulae of a similar type, except that, instead of using the cumulative normal distribution, an Imhof distribution is used derived from the exact distribution of a linear combination of the sample data second moments. On theoretical grounds this might be expected to give better approximations for some estimators. In practice comparisons were made between computed approximations of both types for several simple cases.

Title: The Effects of Firm Optimizing Behaviour in Matching Models
Abstract: This paper considers a matching model of which the search behaviour of Jovanovic (1979) and Albrecht and Jovanovic (1984) are special cases. The nature of the generality is that each unemployed worker has more information than firms about his average productivity. This results in wage offers falling over the length of an unemployment spell because a long spell is a signal of lower than average productivity. The results of the paper are similar to the scarring effect of Heckman and Borjas (1980) and Greenwald (1986) and the discouraged worker effect of Schweitzer and Smith (1974).

Title: Roy-Consistent Expectations
Abstract: In this paper two results are presented. Both refer to the impossibility theorem of Polemarchakis (1983). The Slutsky matrix of intratemporal and intertemporal substitution effects, associated with the individual short-run demand functions, is not arbitrary but symmetric if expectations are (strongly) Roy-consistent (and if the short-run marginal utility of income is continuously differentiable). The same matrix is symmetric and negative semi-definite under strong Royconsistency and a restriction on the expected second-order variation of future real income. These two results suppose a preliminary axiomatization of expectation functions. Weak and strong Roy-consistency are defined within this axiomatization.

Title: On the Solution of Linear Difference Equations with Rational Expectations
Abstract: This article offers a new method of solution for linear difference equations with Rational Expectations. We provide a description of the complete set of solutions which is shown to depend on arbitrary martingales. We thus avoid the use of "differences of martingales" as introduced by Gourieroux, Broze, Szafarz, while describing the general solution as a dynamic equation with lower order. At the same time we provide a simple algorithm, based on polynomial divisions, to calculate some basic solutions, namely all ARMA solutions.

Title: Comparative Dynamics via Envelope Methods in Variational Calculus
Abstract: The primal-dual methodology of Samuelson (1965) is extended and applied to a nonautonomous variational calculus problem with a fixed vector of initial stocks, fixed initial and terminal time values, a free vector of terminal stocks, and a time-independent vector of parameters. It is shown that if the solution of the variational problem is smooth enough, the qualitative effects of parameter perturbations on the entire optimal arcs can be represented by a generalized Slutsky-type matrix, which holds in integral form and is symmetric negative semidefinite. Sufficient conditions for the optimal value function to be convex in the parameters are also given.

Title: Comparative Statics and Relative Convexity
Abstract: This paper shows that if the difference of two positive semidefinite matrices is positive semidefinite then the difference of their generalized inverses is negative semidefinite. It uses this to compare comparative static behaviour over feasible sets whose distance functions have Hessians with a positive semidefinite difference. It then interprets this condition in terms of various ideas of the relative convexity of the two sets and relates it to the Le Chatelier principle.
