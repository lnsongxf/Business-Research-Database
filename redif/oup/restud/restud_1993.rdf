Title: Smart Money, Noise Trading and Stock Price Behaviour
Abstract: This paper estimates an equilibrium model of stock price behaviour in which changes in exponentially de-trended dividends and prices are normally distributed and exogenous "noise traders" interact with "smart-money" investors who have constant absolute risk aversion. The model can explain the volatility and predictability of U.S. stock returns in the period 1871–1986 using either a low discount rate (4% or below) and a large constant risk discount on the stock price, or a higher discount rate (5% or above) and noise trading correlated with fundamentals. The data are not well able to distinguish between these explanations.

Title: Income Distribution and Macroeconomics
Abstract: This paper analyzes the role of wealth distribution in macroeconomics through investment in human capital. It is shown that in the presence of credit markets' imperfections and indivisibilities in investment in human capital, the initial distribution of wealth affects aggregate output and investment both in the short and in the long run, as there are multiple steady states. This paper therefore provides an additional explanation for the persistent differences in per-capita output across countries. Furthermore, the paper shows that cross-country differences in macroeconomic adjustment to aggregate shocks can be attributed, among other factors, to differences in wealth and income distribution across countries.

Title: Search, Sticky Prices, and Inflation
Abstract: This paper examines equilibrium in a market with free entry where consumers search and firms set prices on individual units of the commodity. The prices attached to newly produced goods are continuously adjusted. Prices attached to previously produced goods can only be changed at a cost. Thus inflation reduces the real price of goods in inventory awaiting sale. The presence of previously priced goods lowers the reservation price of customers. Thus, inflation cuts into the market power created by the need to search for the good. Consumer welfare is inverse u-shaped in inflation with a strictly positive optimal inflation rate.

Title: Search with Learning from Prices: Does Increased Inflationary Uncertainty Lead to Higher Markups?
Abstract: Aggregate cost uncertainty, arising from real shocks or unanticipated inflation, reduces the informativeness of prices by scrambling relative and aggregate variations. But when agents can acquire additional information, such increased noise may in fact lead them to become better informed, and price competition will intensify. We examine these issues in a model of search with learning, where consumers search optimally from an unknown price distribution while firms price optimally given consumers' search rules. We show that the decisive factor in whether inflation variability increases or reduces the incentive to search, and thereby market efficiency, is the size of informational costs.

Title: Heterogeneity and Output Fluctuations in a Dynamic Menu-Cost Economy
Abstract: When firms face menu costs, the relation between their output and money is highly non-linear. At the aggregate level, however, this needs not be so. In this paper we study the dynamic behaviour of a menu-cost economy where firms are heterogeneous in the shocks they perceive, and the demands and adjustment costs they face. In this context we (i) generalize the Caplin and Spulber (1987) steady-state monetary-neutrality result; (ii) show that uniqueness of equilibria depends not only on the degree of strategic complementarities but also on the degree of dispersion of firms' positions in their price-cycle; (iii) characterize the path of output outside the steady state and show that as strategic complementarities become more important, expansions become longer and smoother than contractions; and (iv) show that the potential impact of monetary shocks is an increasing function of the distance of the economy from its steady state, but that an uninformed policy maker will have no effect on output on average.

Title: Incomplete Contracts, Vertical Integration, and Supply Assurance
Abstract: This paper extends the analysis of transactions cost models of vertical integration to multilateral settings. Its main focus is on supply assurance concerns which arise when several downstream firms are competing for inputs in limited supply. Integration reduces supply assurance concerns for an integrating firm but it may increase them for others. Therefore, to explain the scope of any firm, one must consider the overall network of production and distribution relations. Three fundamental questions are addressed: (1) What are the effects of different integration structures?; (2) What are the determinants of the socially efficient integration structures?; (3) In what way do equilibrium integration structures differ from socially efficient structures?

Title: Self-Selection and Monitoring in Dynamic Incentive Problems with Incomplete Contracts
Abstract: A dynamic trading problem is examined in which a monopsonistic employer tries to hire workers whose productivities and reservation wages are private information. The employer can only observe an employee's quality indirectly by monitoring a non-verifiable measure of on-the-job performance. The employer makes contract offers which employees can accept or reject. Once a contract has been accepted it is impossible for the employer to exchange messages with individual employees. On the unique stationary equilibrium path for the contracting game, the employer chooses between two mutually exclusive outcomes. In the market outcome, the employer offers long-term contracts and information is conveyed entirely through self-selection and delayed production. In the monitoring outcome, the employer offers short-term contracts, and contract renegotiation is conditioned by an employee's past performance. A simple characterization theorem is provided which illustrates the often surprising effects of improvements in information in this setting. For example, an employer who is initially offering short-term contracts to exploit performance information may stop monitoring and shift to market screening when the monitoring technology becomes more informative.

Title: Sustainable Plans and Mutual Default
Abstract: This paper presents a simple general equilibrium model of optimal taxation in which both private agents and the government can default on their debt. As a benchmark we consider Ramsey equilibria in which the government can precommit to its policies at the beginning of time, but in which private agents can default. We then consider sustainable equilibria in which both government and private agent decision rules are required to be sequentially rational. We adapt Abreu's (1988) optimal trigger strategies to completely characterize the entire set of sustainable equilibria. In particular, we show that when there is sufficiently little discounting and government consumption fluctuates enough, the Ramsey allocations and policies (in which the government never defaults) can be supported by a sustainable equilibrium. By way of an example we show that the larger the variance of government consumption the easier it is to support good outcomes. We also show for moderate discount factors that in the best sustainable equilibrium, tax rates are more volatile and debt is smaller than in the Ramsey equilibrium.

Title: Least-Squares Learning and the Stability of Equilibria with Externalities
Abstract: This paper studies the stability of competitive equilibria in a model of aggregate employment when the representative agent uses a least-squares forecasting procedure. It is shown that the Pareto inferior low employment steady state is always unstable under least-squares learning, even if it is stable under perfect foresight. The high employment steady state is stable under learning if and only if it is saddle point stable under perfect foresight. This weakens multiple equilibrium theories of coordination failure that purport to explain persistently high unemployment. The Pareto superior high employment steady state will be the focal point of individual forecasting.

Title: The Implications of Additive Community Preferences in a Multi-Consumer Economy
Abstract: We investigate the consequences of imposing additivity on community preferences. We show that there are important implications of additive community preferences that are not implied by the additivity of a single consumer's preferences. In particular, we show that imposing additivity on community preferences implies the existence of a representative consumer with a utility function in the CES family. We demonstrate the restrictive nature of these implications with three examples. Our interpretation of the results is that single consumer models are unable to adequately represent important features of multi-consumer economies.

Title: Information Matrix Test, Parameter Heterogeneity and ARCH: A Synthesis
Abstract: We apply the White information matrix (IM) test to the linear regression model with autocorrelated errors. A special case of one component of the test is found to be identical to the Engle Lagrange multiplier (LM) test for autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (ARCH). Given Chesher's interpretation of the IM test as a test for parameter heterogeneity, this establishes a connection among the IM test, ARCH and parameter variation. This also enables us to specify conditional heteroskedasticity in a more general and convenient way. Other interesting by-products of our analysis are tests for the variation in conditional and static skewness which we call tests for "heterocliticity".

Title: Identification Results for Duration Models with Multiple Spells
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the identifiability of duration models with multiple spells. We prove that the results of Elbers and Ridder (1982) and Heckman and Singer (1984) can be generalized to multi-spell models with lagged duration dependence. We also prove that without lagged duration dependence, the identification result does not depend on moment conditions or tail conditions on the mixing distribution. This result is in contrast to Ridder's (1990) result for single-spell models.

Title: A Model of Intertemporal Asset Prices Under Asymmetric Information
Abstract: This paper presents a dynamic asset-pricing model under asymmetric information. Investors have different information concerning the future growth rate of dividends. They rationally extract information from prices as well as dividends and maximize their expected utility. The model has a closed-form solution to the rational expectations equilibrium. We find that existence of uninformed investors increases the risk premium. Supply shocks can affect the risk premium only under asymmetric information. Information asymmetry among investors can increase price volatility and negative autocorrelation in returns. Less-informed investors may rationally behave like price chasers.

Title: Toward a Theory of International Currency
Abstract: We use the framework of random matching games and develop a two-country model of the world economy, in which two national currencies compete and may be circulated as media of exchange. There are multiple equilibria, which differ in the areas of circulation of the two currencies. In one equilibrium, the two national currencies are circulated only locally. In another, one currency is circulated as an international currency. There is also an equilibrium in which both currencies are accepted internationally. We also find an equilibrium in which the two currencies are directly exchanged. We first characterize the existence conditions of these equilibria in terms of the relative country size and the degree of economic integration and then use an evolutionary approach to equilibrium selection to explain the evolution of the international currency as the two economies become more integrated. Some welfare implications are also discussed. For example, a country can improve its national welfare by letting its own currency circulate internationally, provided the domestic circulation is controlled for. When the total supply is fixed, however, a resulting currency shortage may reduce the national welfare.

Title: The Economics of Rumours
Abstract: This paper studies a class of information transmission processes which we call rumours. The distinctive features of these processes are that the information transmission takes place in such a way that the recipient does not quite know whether or not to believe the information, and that the probability that someone receives the information depends on how many people already have it. Specifically, we study an example in which there is an investment project with returns only known to a few people. These people have a cost of undertaking the project and this cost is private information. The only information the other agents receive is that someone else has invested. They are not told whether that person actually knew the returns, or whether he too was just acting on the basis of his observation of others. They use their optimal Bayesian decision rule to decide whether to invest. We show that, for a wide class of alternative specifications, this decision rule has the property that a positive fraction of those who observe the rumour will not invest. In this sense a rumour cannot mislead everybody. Counter-intuitive comparative statics results are obtained. For example, more information and higher productivity may reduce welfare, while changing the speed with which the rumour spreads has no welfare effect.

Title: How Fast do Rational Agents Learn?
Abstract: A simple dynamic model of rational learning through market interaction by asymmetrically informed risk-neutral agents, uncertain about a valuation parameter but whose pooled information reveals it, is presented. The model is a variation of the classical partial equilibrium model of learning in rational expectations in which the market price is informative about the unknown parameter only through the actions of agents. It is found that learning from market prices and convergence to the rational expectations equilibrium is slow, at the rate 1/√n1/3 (where n is the number periods of market interaction), whenever the average precision of private information in the market is finite. Convergence obtains at the standard rate 1/√n if there is a positive mass of perfectly informed agents. Comparative static results on more refined measures of the speed of convergence with respect to basic technological and informational parameters are also provided.

Title: Nonergodic Economic Growth
Abstract: This paper explores the role of complementarities and incomplete markets in economic growth. We analyze the evolution of an economy composed of a countable set of industries. Individual industries exhibit non-convexities in production and are linked by localized technological complementarities. These complementarities, when strong enough, produce multiple equilibria in long-run economic activity. The equilibria have a simple probabilistic structure that demonstrates how local interactions can affect the aggregate equilibrium. The model generates interesting cross-sectional and intertemporal dynamics as coordination problems become the source of aggregate and individual industry volatility. The model also illustrates how the growth of leading sectors can cause a takeoff to a high aggregate production equilibrium.

Title: Precautionary Savings and the Permanent Income Hypothesis
Abstract: This paper derives the explicit solution of a dynamic stochastic optimal consumption problem for infinitely-lived agents whose preferences exhibit, in the presence of non-diversifiable labour income uncertainty, a constant elasticity of intertemporal substitution and constant absolute risk aversion. The constancy of the elasticity of intertemporal substitution, which implies that marginal utility at zero consumption is infinite, guarantees that the non-negativity constraint on consumption is never binding along the optimal path. The assumption of constant absolute risk aversion allows an explicit computation of human wealth, and provides a simple representation of the precautionary savings motive.

Title: A Closed-form Solution for a Model of Precautionary Saving
Abstract: This paper analyses life-cycle consumption plans and distinguishes between temporal risk aversion and intertemporal substitution. The results assume that felicity functions are quadratic and that income follows a linear model with normally distributed errors. Stochastic dynamic programming then yields closed-loop linear decision rules. Certainty equivalence no longer holds, but instead households play a min-max strategy against nature. One finds a rationale for precautionary saving and a larger sensitivity of changes in consumption to income innovations.

Title: Asymmetric Adjustment Costs in Non-linear Labour Demand Models for the Netherlands and U.K. Manufacturing Sectors
Abstract: The costs of hiring a worker generally differ in size from the firing costs. This article investigates optimal labour demand schedules for production and non-production workers of firms that operate under uncertainty and face asymmetric costs of adjusting their workforce. In the empirical part generalised methods of moments (GMM) estimates of the structural parameters of the Euler conditions for production and non-production workers are presented, together with specification and structural stability tests, using time series data of the Netherlands and U.K. manufacturing sectors. We find that asymmetric adjustment costs play an important role in the explanation of unbalanced labour demand between upward and downward movements of the business cycle. Moreover, hiring costs exceed firing costs of production workers, whereas firing costs exceed hiring costs of non-production workers.

Title: Necessary and Sufficient Conditions for Factor Price Equalization
Abstract: Although models with factor price equalization are used frequently in both theoretical and applied research in international economics, only sufficient conditions for factor price equalization have been presented in the literature. In this paper, we present necessary and sufficient conditions for FPE under quite general assumptions about the technologies of different countries. The necessary and sufficient conditions we derive are consistent with joint production, decreasing returns to scale, and substantive differences in the technologies and endowments of different countries. Our results enable us to reconcile the classical approach and the integrated equilibrium approach to factor price equalization.

Title: Efficient Sequential Bargaining
Abstract: Suppose that a seller and a buyer have private valuations for a good, and that their respective utilities from a trading mechanism are given by us and ub. (These utilities are determined by the valuation for the good, by whether a trade occurs, and by the price which is paid.) Consider the problem of maximizing E[λus + (1 − λ)ub] for some weight λ in the unit interval. It is shown in this article that, if λ is sufficiently close to zero or one, then the maximum value of this objective function attainable by a static revelation mechanism can be arbitrarily closely approximated by equilibria of the sequential bargaining games in which only a single player makes offers. That is, the welfare bound implied by the revelation principle is virtually attainable in offer/counteroffer bargaining. The main condition needed for this result is a monotone-hazard-rate assumption about the distribution of types. A class of examples is presented in which the result holds for all λ (i.e. the entire ex ante Pareto frontier).

Title: A Noncooperative Theory of Coalitional Bargaining
Abstract: We explore a sequential offers model of n-person coalitional bargaining with transferable utility and with time discounting. Our focus is on the efficiency properties of stationary equilibria of strictly superadditive games, when the discount factor δ is sufficiently large; we do, however, consider examples of other games where subgame perfectness alone is employed. It is shown that delay and the formation of inefficient subcoalitions can occur in equilibrium, the latter for some or all orders of proposer. However, efficient stationary equilibrium payoffs converge to a point in the core, as δ → 1. Strict convexity is a sufficient condition for there to exist an efficient stationary equilibrium payoff vector for sufficiently high δ. This vector converges as δ → 1 to the egalitarian allocation of Dutta and Ray (1989).

Title: Mean-preserving Portfolio Dominance
Abstract: Consider risk-averse agents with utility functions U and V holding portfolios composed of the same two (risky and riskless) assets. Then, V is (Arrow) more risk averse if in all such portfolios V invests less in the risky asset. A natural extension of this analysis of attitudes towards risk to risk itself is to establish a relation between distributions which is necessary and sufficient to induce such investment patterns in the class of all risk-averse agents. This characterization is established in this paper for distributions with equal means. Second Degree Dominance performs a similar role for the notion of ‘more risk averse’ introduced by Pratt but it is too weak for the Arrow concept.

Title: Savage's Axioms Usually Imply Violation of Strict Stochastic Dominance
Abstract: Contrary to common belief, Savage's axioms do not imply strict stochastic dominance. Instead, they usually involve violation of that. Violations occur as soon as the range of the utility function is rich enough, e.g. contains an interval, and the probability measure is, loosely speaking, "constructive". An example is given where all of Savage's axioms are satisfied, but still strict statewise monotonicity is violated: An agent is willing to exchange an act for another act that with certainty yields a strictly worse outcome. Thus book can be made against the agent. Weak stochastic dominance and weak statewise monotonicity are always satisfied, as well as strict stochastic dominance and strict statewise monotonicity when restricted to acts with finitely many outcomes.

Title: Conditional Choice Probabilities and the Estimation of Dynamic Models
Abstract: This paper develops a new method for estimating the structural parameters of (discrete choice) dynamic programming problems. The method reduces the computational burden of estimating such models. We show the valuation functions characterizing the expected future utility associated with the choices often can be represented as an easily computed function of the state variables, structural parameters, and the probabilities of choosing alternative actions for states which are feasible in the future. Under certain conditions, nonparametric estimators of these probabilities can be formed from sample information on the relative frequencies of observed choices using observations with the same (or similar) state variables. Substituting the estimators for the true conditional choice probabilities in formulating optimal decision rules, we establish the consistency and asymptotic normality of the resulting structural parameter estimators. To illustrate our new method, we estimate a dynamic model of parental contraceptive choice and fertility using data from the National Fertility Survey.

Title: Identification of Endogenous Social Effects: The Reflection Problem
Abstract: This paper examines the reflection problem that arises when a researcher observing the distribution of behaviour in a population tries to infer whether the average behaviour in some group influences the behaviour of the individuals that comprise the group. It is found that inference is not possible unless the researcher has prior information specifying the compisition of reference groups. If this information is available, the prospects for inference depend critically on the population relationship between the variables defining reference groups and those directly affecting outcomes. Inference is difficult to implossible if these variables are functionally dependent or are statistically independent. The prospects are better if the variables defining reference groups and those directly affecting outcomes are moderately related in the population.

Title: A Model of the Evolution of Duopoly: Does the Asymmetry between Firms Tend to Increase or Decrease?
Abstract: This paper is an attempt to identify some of the factors that affect the evolution of market structure in a model of dynamic competition between two firms. The stochastic evolution of the state of competition depends on the respective effort rates of the firms. The question is whether the current leader works harder than the laggard—does the ‘gap’ between firms tend to increase or decrease? We show that several effects are at work. The state tends to evolve in the direction where joint payoffs are greater. Since joint payoffs are related to joint product-market profits less joint effort costs, there are two classes of effect: the joint-profit effect and various joint-cost effects. The latter result in part from the pattern of profits, and in part from endpoint effects that give relief from efforts. Asymptotic expansions illuminate these influences. Moreover, we show by numerical simulation that there is another kind of joint-cost effect. The pattern of joint effort costs can influence the pattern of evolution of market structure, and the evolution of the pattern of market structure can influence the pattern of efforts, in a mutually self-reinforcing manner. In particular, there may be equilibria in which this last effect means that the laggard works harder than the leader even though all the other effects work in favour of the leader.

Title: Warranties, Durability, and Maintenance: Two-sided Moral Hazard in a Continuous-Time Model
Abstract: Double moral hazard in continuous time generates the familiar warranty pattern with full coverage for an initial block of time. The more complete the warranty, the better the producer's durability incentives and the worse the consumer's maintenance incentives. Using continuous time highlights the need for some warranty bound to avoid reaching the first-best as an unreasonable limit. Early in the paper, an exogenous bound is used, while later the bound arises endogenously from the possibility of abuse and repair. A quadratic example shows that the warranty's duration depends on the relative severity of the two moral hazard problems.

Title: Efficient and Nearly-Efficient Partnerships
Abstract: This paper shows in two ways that the degree to which free-riding diminishes the performance of deterministic partnerships may be less than has been generally thought. First, a necessary and sufficient condition is provided for a partnership to sustain full efficiency. It implies that many non-trivial partnerships sustain efficiency, such as generic ones with finite action spaces, and neoclassical ones with Leontief technologies. Second, approximate efficiency is shown to be achievable in a large class of partnerships, including ones with smooth and monotonic production and disutility functions. Approximate efficiency is achieved by mixed-strategy equilibria: one partner takes, with small probability, an inefficient action. The degree to which efficiency is approximated is restricted only by the amount of liability the partners can bear. Nonetheless, their equilibrium payments are not arbitrarily large.

Title: Implementation in Economies with a Continuum of Agents
Abstract: We study a general implementation problem for exchange economies with a continuum of players and private information, and test the robustness of the results for sequences of approximating finite economies. Assuming that the designer knows the distribution of the characteristics in the economy we consider continuous and unique implementation in both its equilibrium and dominant strategies versions and obtain results for general self-selective (first- and second-best) allocations. An upper hemicontinuity property of Bayesian equilibria of approximating economies for continuous mechanisms is demonstrated. Using this, we can, for example, conclude that if a given continuous mechanism implements uniquely a Walrasian allocation in the continuum economy then all Bayesian equilibria of large approximation economies will (with probability close to one) yield an allocation which is almost ex-post Pareto optimal.

Title: Consumption Growth, the Interest Rate and Aggregation
Abstract: In this paper we present empirical evidence on aggregation problems with Euler equations for consumption. Our main results are: estimates of the elasticity of intertemporal substitution for consumption are consistently lower for aggregate data than for average cohort data and the theoretical model is statistically rejected on aggregate data, not rejected on average cohort data. In trying to explain these differences we find that a major role is played by the non-linearity of the estimable equation and by omitted demographic factors (normally unobservable on aggregate data). However, even when these sources of aggregation bias are corrected for, the estimates of the elasticity of intertemporal substitution obtained from aggregate data remain lower than those obtained from average cohort data, and excess sensitivity tests reject the implications of the model. This can be explained as the result of imposing identical coefficients to cohorts who differ in preferences and/or opportunity sets.

Title: The Excess Smoothness of Consumption: Identification and Interpretation
Abstract: Deaton's observation that consumption appears to be "too smooth" is easily reconciled with the notion that consumption exhibits "excess sensitivity" to current income. The reconciliation invokes the plausible assumption that households forecast on the basis of a larger information set than the econometrician. The empirical case for excess smoothness is strengthened by showing that the innovations in permanent income can be inferred from an autoregression of income and saving, not only under the permanent income hypothesis, but also under the excess sensitivity model. Empirically, parameter restrictions imposed on the bivariate autoregression by the excess sensitivity model are not rejected.

Title: On the Flexibility of Monetary Policy: The Case of the Optimal Inflation Tax
Abstract: This paper examines optimal monetary policy under uncertainty in a context in which policy makers are able to make credible policy commitments. We study an optimal taxation problem of minimizing the social cost of financing a stochastic and exogenous level of government transfers. Since, in the basic model, the welfare costs of inflation derive only from expected inflation, the optimal monetary policy is highly responsive to the state of nature. In a benchmark case in which all shocks are transitory, the optimal policy calls for loading all the variability of government transfers on the shoulders of the inflation tax.

Title: Stochastic Devaluation Risk and the Empirical Fit of Target-Zone Models
Abstract: A time-varying stochastic devaluation risk is introduced in a model of exchange rate target zones. The model produces realistic patterns of covariation between exchange rates and interest rate differentials, which previous target zone models have been unable to do. A "drift adjustment" method to estimate devaluation expectations from data is suggested.

Title: Majority Voting and Corporate Control: The Rule of the Dominant Shareholder
Abstract: This paper incorporates a model of corporate control into a general equilibrium framework for production economies with incomplete markets. The classical objective of value maximization is extended, but is indeterminate. Instead, firms are viewed as being subject to shareholder control via some decision mechanism. As long as this decision mechanism is responsive to a unanimous preference by shareholders, shareholder control is consistent with but stronger than value maximization. Next, the particular institution of majority voting by shareholders is examined. It is shown that for generic economies, a majority rule equilibrium for a firm implies that production is optimal for the largest, or dominant, shareholder. Finally, a more realistic control mechanism is considered in which majority voting by shareholders is constrained by a group of shareholders, or Board of Directors, who control the voting agenda. The result is that shareholders not on the Board have no influence on the equilibrium production choice of the firm.

Title: Price Competition between Market Makers
Abstract: The paper explicitly models price competition in financial markets in which prices are quoted by competing dealers before future demand is observed. The strategic behaviour of informed insiders and uninformed liquidity traders implies that a growing number of market makers leads to a higher risk exposure for the individual market maker which induces higher individual bid-ask-spreads and higher transaction costs for the liquidity traders. Under certain conditions liquidity traders would prefer a monopolistic market maker rather than several competing market makers. The results hold under various assumptions on the strategy space of the market makers.

Title: Political Equilibrium, Income Distribution, and Growth
Abstract: This paper analyzes the impact of income distribution on growth when investment in human capital is the source of growth and individuals vote over the degree of redistribution in the economy. The model has three main features. First, very different patterns of income distribution are conducive to high growth at different levels of per capita income. Second, growth is associated with an externality whereby investment in human capital by one group increases the productivity of other groups, thus potentially enabling them to invest in human capital. Third, the initial pattern of income distribution and the resulting political equilibrium are crucial in determining whether the transmission of this externality is promoted, in which case growth is enhanced, or prevented, in which case growth is stopped. Using a non-overlapping generations model with voting, I derive several empirical implications. In particular, the model implies an inverted-U relation between levels of inequality and levels of income in cross-sections, but not necessarily in time series, a result that seems consistent with a number of empirical studies.

Title: Strategic Complementarity in Business Formation: Aggregate Fluctuations and Sunspot Equilibria
Abstract: The possibility of sunspot equilibria and endogenous cycles are explored in a two-sector overlapping-generations model with entry. It is shown that if prospective entrants act oligopolistically as producers but competitively as consumers then a strategic complementarity between the entry decisions of agents across sectors and across time may arise. If the complementarity is sufficiently strong, the economy will have multiple, Pareto-ranked steady states. Stationary sunspot equilibria can then be constructed as a randomization between allocations in the neighbourhood of the multiple steady states providing a source of aggregate fluctuations.

Title: Churning Bubbles
Abstract: Are stock prices determined by fundamentals or can "bubbles" exist? An important issue in this debate concerns the circumstances in which deviations from fundamentals are consistent with rational behaviour. When there is asymmetric information between investors and portfolio managers, portfolio managers have an incentive to churn; their trades are not motivated by changes in information, liquidity needs or risk sharing but rather by a desire to profit at the expense of the investors that hire them. As a result, assets can trade at prices which do not reflect their fundamentals and bubbles can exist.

Title: Rational Random Walks
Abstract: The paper examines, within the framework of a multi-dimensional one-step forward-looking model, a special category of rational expectations equilibria. Their support is infinite with two accumulation points (steady states); the stochastic motion of the system is of random-walk type. A general strategy for an existence proof—associated with the study of a dynamical system—stresses necessary conditions. In a simple overlapping-generations model, the proof is made complete—no backwards bending labour supply is required in the pure sunspot case. By continuity, heteroclinic random walk equilibria are also shown to exist when shocks are real.

Title: Debt-Constrained Asset Markets
Abstract: We develop a theory of general equilibrium with endogenous debt limits in the form of individual rationality constraints similar to those in the dynamic consistency literature. If an agent defaults on a contract, he can be excluded from future contingent claims markets trading and can have his assets seized. He cannot be excluded from spot markets trading, however, and he has some private endowments that cannot be seized. All information is publicly held and common knowledge, and there is a complete set of contingent claims markets. Since there is complete information, an agent cannot enter into a contract in which he would have an incentive to default in some state. In general there is only partial insurance: variations in consumption may be imperfectly correlated across agents; interest rates may be lower than they would be without constraints; and equilibria may be Pareto ranked.

Title: The (Mis)Behaviour of the Aggregate Price Level
Abstract: This paper investigates the response of the price level to random monetary shocks through a model of the fixed cost of changing a nominal price. It shows that in an inflationary environment, an expansionary monetary shock is accommodated faster than a contractionary monetary shock. Furthermore, when the average rate of monetary expansion increases, the lag in response to a positive shock decreases. The study also proves that the relationship between the expected rate of inflation and the variance of real prices is positive only above a critical level of expected inflation.

Title: Shadow Wages and Peasant Family Labour Supply: An Econometric Application to the Peruvian Sierra
Abstract: This paper develops a methodology for estimating structural time-allocation models for self-employed households and applies it to peasant family labour supply behaviour in the Peruvian Sierra. The opportunity costs of time, or shadow wages, of household workers are explicitly estimated from an agricultural production function. Using an instrumental variables procedure, the household's structural labour supply parameters are recovered from variation in these shadow wages. The empirical results are robust to a number of alternative specifications and diagnostic tests and lend support to the rational allocation of time by peasant households.

Title: Econometric Analysis of the Short-run Fluctuations of Households' Purchases
Abstract: Infrequency of purchase models are alternatives to those derived from the classical "utility maximization with binding non-negativity constraints" scheme for modelling purchases that occur at random dates. An extension of those models is proposed that takes into account additional information about the exact number of times households purchased during the survey period. Various methods of estimation are described and an empirical illustration is presented with data drawn from the French Food Expenditure Survey (INSEE).

Title: Characterizations of the Existence of Equilibria in Games with Discontinuous and Non-quasiconcave Payoffs
Abstract: This paper characterizes pure-strategy and dominant-strategy Nash equilibrium in non-cooperative games which may have discontinuous and/or non-quasiconcave payoffs. Conditions called diagonal transfer quasiconcavity and uniform transfer quasiconcavity are shown to be necessary and, with conditions called diagonal transfer continuity and transfer upper semicontinuity, sufficient for the existence of pure-strategy and dominant-strategy Nash equilibrium, respectively. The results are used to examine the existence or non-existence of equilibrium in some well-known economic games with discontinuous and/or non-quasiconcave payoffs. For example, we show that the failure of the existence of a pure-strategy Nash equilibrium in the Hotelling model is due to the failure of an aggregator function to be diagonal transfer quasiconcave—not the failure of payoffs to be quasiconcave, as has been elsewhere conjectured.

Title: Necessary and Sufficient Conditions for Maximization of a Class of Preference Relations
Abstract: This paper provides necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of greatest and maximal elements of weak and strict preferences, and unifies two very different approaches used in the related literature (the convexity and acyclicity approaches). Conditions called transfer FS-convexity and transfer SS-convexity are shown to be necessary and, in conjunction with transfer closedness and transfer openness, sufficient for the existence of greatest and maximal elements of weak and strict preferences, respectively. The results require neither the continuity nor convexity of preferences, and are valid for both ordered and unordered binary relations. Thus, the results generalize almost all of the theorems on existence of maximal elements of preferences that appear in the literature.
