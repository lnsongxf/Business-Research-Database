Title: Accuracy in Simulations
Abstract: Since the actual solution to intertemporal rational expectations models is usually not known, it is useful to have criteria for judging the accuracy of a given numerical solution. In this paper we propose a test for accuracy that is easy to implement and can be applied to a wide class of models without knowledge of the exact solution. We discuss the power of the test by simulating several models with the linear-quadratic approximation and with the method of parameterized expectations. We conclude that the test is powerful.

Title: Diffusion of Technical Change and the Decomposition of Output into Trend and Cycle
Abstract: In this paper we argue that modelling the trend component in real GNP as a random walk is inconsistent with its interpretation as productivity growth. As an alternative, we specify the trend as an ARIMA whose impulse response function follows an S-shaped pattern reflecting the process of diffusion of technical change. Such an ARIMA is employed to build and estimate an UCARIMA using USA postwar quarterly data. We find that our model, although more parsimonious, fits the data equally well than the standard random walk plus AR(2) cycle. Moreover, our model has a very low cycle/trend variance ratio.

Title: Informational Cycles
Abstract: This paper shows that if demand is unknown and continuously changing and if investment is costly, then output and investment are cyclical. The cycles are generated by changes in information over time, as investors increase production and thus accumulate more information about demand. These are, therefore, informational cycles. The paper also shows that the frequency of cycles depends positively on profitability and negatively on the rate of interest.

Title: Monopolistic Competition with Endogenous Specialization
Abstract: In the familiar spatial model of monopolistic competition on the circle, a product is identified by a single locational characteristic representing its brand or variety. The ability of a variety to compete with other varieties a given distance away (its "specialization" as quantified by transportation losses or how rapidly the "melting iceberg" melts) is exogenously given in the standard model. Here, specialization is a choice variable selected by the firm. A monopolistically competitive general equilibrium is derived, where the degree of specialization is endogenously determined along with other variables. Implications are noted. The central contribution is to show that the effect of endogenizing specialization is to make the Hotelling-Lancaster-Chamberlin model of monopolistic competition isomorphic to the analytically much more tractable Dixit-Stiglitz-Ethier formulation, without sacrificing the appealing concept of product "distance"

Title: Consumer Demand and the Life-Cycle Allocation of Household Expenditures
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to estimate the parameters of household preferences that determine the allocation of goods within the period and over the life cycle, using micro data. In doing so we are able to identify important effects of demographics, labour market status and other household characteristics on the intertemporal allocation of expenditure. We test the validity of the life-cycle model using excess sensitivity tests and find that controlling for demographics and labour market status variables can largely explain the excess sensitivity of consumption to anticipated changes in income.

Title: Foreign Direct Investment and the Risk of Expropriation
Abstract: When an investor, for example a transnational corporation, invests abroad it runs the risk that its investment will be expropriated for the simple reason that international contracts are practically impossible to enforce. Any agreements or contracts then undertaken by the transnational company and the host country must be designed to be self-enforcing. It could be possible for the host country and the transnational corporation to find such self-enforcing agreements if there are future gains from trade. Thus although the host country might have a short-term incentive to expropriate, it has a long-term incentive to foster good relations with potential investors to attract more investment in the future. This conflict between short-term and long-term incentives determines the type of investment contracts agreed. This paper extends previous work on the general underprovision of investment when contracts are incomplete or only partially enforceable (see e.g. Grout (1984)) to a dynamic context. It is likewise shown that investment is initially underprovided but it increases over time and for certain parameter values it tends to the efficient level. The expected future discounted returns to the transnational company decline over time, extending Vernon's observation of the obsolescing bargain (Vernon (1971)). The model is also extended to allow for capital accumulation and consideration is given to renegotiation-proof contracts.

Title: Renegotiation and Optimality in Agency Contracts
Abstract: We analyse renegotiation in a hidden action principal-agent model. Contract renegotiation offers are made by the agent. A refinement is imposed on the principal's beliefs: if precisely one action is optimal with respect to both the principal's and the agent's contracts, the principal believes that that action has been taken. With the refinement imposed, perfect-Bayesian equilibrium allocations are identical to the second best in the classical principal-agent model without renegotiation. When renegotiation is led by the agent and when equilibria satisfy the refinement, equilibrium allocations are ex ante efficient.

Title: Insider Trading without Normality
Abstract: In this paper, we analyse the existence and uniqueness of equilibrium in a particular class of monopolistic rational expectations models. We show the equivalence between the Kyle (1985) model of insider trading where the insider observes the amount of noise trading and the Kyle (1989) model of informed speculation when there is one risk-neutral insider and many risk-neutral market makers. We show that in these two equivalent models: (i) There exists a unique equilibrium independently of the distribution of uncertainty; (ii) This equilibrium minimizes the expected gains of the informed agent under incentive compatibility constraints. We extend our results to a class of signalling games.

Title: Advertising and Coordination
Abstract: When market information such as price is difficult to communicate, consumers and firms may be unable to take advantage of mutually beneficial scale economies, so that coordination failures arise. Ostensibly uninformative advertising expenditures can be used to eliminate coordination failures, by allowing an efficient firm to communicate implicitly that it offers a low price. This provides a theoretical explanation for Benham's (1972) empirical association of the ability to advertise with lower prices and larger scale. Advertising becomes necessary for optimal coordination when the identity of the efficient firm is uncertain. An application to loss-leader pricing is developed.

Title: Jobs and Chocolate: Samuelsonian Surpluses in Dynamic Models of Unemployment
Abstract: In dynamic models of unemployment in which the employed consume more than the unemployed, workers are finitely lived, and jobs are lasting, employment transfers consumption from future generations to those currently alive, resulting in a social surplus. That is, these transfers allow the current generation to consume more than its share of the output produced during its lifetime, without the increased consumption coming at the expense of future generations. Moreover, due to these intergenerational transfers, the allocation that maximizes steady-state output is Pareto dominated by another feasible allocation with a higher level of steady-state employment.

Title: Dynamic Investment Models and the Firm's Financial Policy
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the sensitivity of investment to the availability of internal funds using the hierarchy of finance approach to corporate finance. We characterize the empirical implications of this approach for dynamic investment models and test these implications using firm-level data. The model we estimate is based on the Euler equation for optimal capital accumulation in the presence of convex adjustment costs. The theoretical model explicitly allows for debt finance and financial assets. The empirical investigation uses U.K. company panel data to estimate dynamic investment models using GMM and tests the derived implications.

Title: Irreversibility and Aggregate Investment
Abstract: Investment is often irreversible: once installed, capital has little or no value unless used in production. This paper proposes and solves a model of sequential irreversible investment and characterizes the aggregate implications of microeconomic irreversibility and idiosyncratic uncertainty. If a large amount of idiosyncratic uncertainty is allowed for, the distributional dynamics induced by the nonlinear character of irreversible investment policies are capable of smoothing the dynamics of aggregate investment (relative to those of its forcing processes) to the extent required by U.S. data.

Title: Multivariate Stochastic Variance Models
Abstract: Changes in variance, or volatility, over time can be modelled using the approach based on autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (ARCH). However, the generalizations to multivariate series can be difficult to estimate and interpret. Another approach is to model variance as an unobserved stochastic process. Although it is not easy to obtain the exact likelihood function for such stochastic variance models, they tie in closely with developments in finance theory and have certain statistical attractions. This article sets up a multivariate model, discusses its statistical treatment and shows how it can be modified to capture common movements in volatility in a very natural way. The model is then fitted to daily observations on exchange rates.

Title: A Simulation Estimator for Dynamic Models of Discrete Choice
Abstract: This paper analyses a new estimator for the structural parameters of dynamic models of discrete choice. Based on an inversion theorem due to Hotz and Miller (1993), which establishes the existence of a one-to-one mapping between the conditional valuation functions for the dynamic problem and their associated conditional choice probabilities, we exploit simulation techniques to estimate models which do not possess terminal states. In this way our Conditional Choice Simulation (CCS) estimator complements the Conditional Choice Probability (CCP) estimator of Hotz and Miller (1993). Drawing on work in empirical process theory by Pakes and Pollard (1989), we establish its large sample properties, and then conduct a Monte Carlo study of Rust's (1987) model of bus engine replacement to compare its small sample properties with those of Maximum Likelihood (ML).

Title: Semiparametric Specification Testing of Non-nested Econometric Models
Abstract: We propose a specification test of a parametrically specified nonlinear model against a weakly specified non-nested alternative. We estimate the alternative model by using nonparametric regression (nearest neighbours). The test is based on the t-statistic of an artificial regression. Monte-Carlo simulations suggest that the test has good power and size characteristics.

Title: Serial Cost-Sharing of Excludable Public Goods
Abstract: Under the "Conservative Equal costs" mechanism to produce a non-excludable (one-dimensional) public good, each agent reports his demand. The lowest reported demand of public good is produced and its cost is shared equally among all agents. When the cost of producing the public good is convex, this mechanism is strategy-proof (even with respect to coalitions), anonymous and induces voluntary participation. No other mechanism shares these three properties. When the public good is excludable (its cost still convex), there is a mechanism with the same properties, that everyone prefers to conservative equal costs. This mechanism excludes the agent with the lowest (equal costs) demand from consuming (or paying for) a larger amount of the good, ameliorating the free-rider problem.

Title: Voting and Lottery Drafts as Efficient Public Goods Mechanisms
Abstract: This paper characterizes interim efficient mechanisms for public good production and cost allocation in a two-type environment with risk-neutral, quasi-linear preferences and fixed-size projects, where the distribution of the private good, as well as the public goods decision, affects social welfare. An efficient public good decision can always be accomplished by a majority voting scheme, where the number of "YES" votes required depends on the welfare weights in a simple way. The results are shown to have a natural geometry and an intuitive interpretation. We also extend these results to allow for restrictions on feasible transfer rules, ranging from the traditional unlimited transfers to the extreme case of no transfers. For a range of welfare weights, an optimal scheme is a two-stage procedure which combines a voting stage with a second stage where an even-chance lottery is used to determine who pays. We call this the "lottery draft mechanism" Since such a cost-sharing scheme does not require transfers, it follows that in many cases transfers are not necessary to achieve the optimal allocation. For other ranges of welfare weights the second stage is more complicated, but the voting stage remains the same. If transfers are completely infeasible, randomized voting rules may be optimal. The paper also provides a geometric characterization of the effects of voluntary participation constraints.

Title: Stationarity, Rationalizability and Bargaining
Abstract: Without assuming rational expectations, we examine the implications of a stationarity assumption in a standard bargaining model with one-sided incomplete information, where the seller makes an offer in each period. Instead of computing a weakly stationary equilibrium, we invoke rationalizability (Bernheim (1984) and Pearce (1984)) combined with the restriction that the buyer's acceptance rule be weakly stationary. There exists a pair of rationalizable sets of pure strategies for the seller and the buyer which are weakly stationary. We demonstrate that any initial offer from the seller induced by a strategy rationalized by a weakly stationary acceptance rule for the buyer must entail the Coase property. Our result does not presume the selection of a particular equilibrium and follows directly from the weak stationarity assumption of the buyer's acceptance rule and the rational behaviour of the players.

Title: Involuntary Layoffs in a Model with Asymmetric Information Concerning Worker Ability
Abstract: This paper examines the contract between a risk-neutral firm and its risk-averse employees, assuming that worker ability is privately learned by the firm after a period of employment. Employers in an external spot labour market attempt to infer worker quality from the observable actions taken by the firm (such as the number of workers it lays off). The threat of spot market raids distorts the optimal contract. Layoffs may be involuntary and can exceed efficient levels. A seniority layoff rule may be included in the contract to avoid the adverse selection problems that arise if layoffs are conducted on the basis of ability.

Title: Job Creation and Job Destruction in the Theory of Unemployment
Abstract: In this paper we model a job-specific shock process in the matching model of unemployment with non-cooperative wage behaviour. We obtain endogenous job creation and job destruction processes and study their properties. We show that an aggregate shock induces negative correlation between job creation and job destruction whereas a dispersion shock induces positive correlation. The job destruction process is shown to have more volatile dynamics than the job creation process. In simulations we show that an aggregate shock process proxies reasonably well the cyclical behaviour of job creation and job destruction in the United States.

Title: Ranking, Unemployment Duration, and Wages
Abstract: The paper examines the effects of the composition of unemployment on wage determination. It explores the implication of one central assumption: when firms receive multiple acceptable applications, they hire the worker who has been unemployed for the least amount of time. This assumption ("ranking") is contrasted with the assumption of random hiring ("no-ranking"). By embodying this assumption in a model of the labour market with job creation/destruction and matching, the joint behaviour of unemployment, the distribution of unemployment durations, and wages are characterized. The implication that the re-employment prospects of employed workers, were they to become unemployed, are better than those of the currently unemployed appears to have been an important feature of European unemployment experience in the 1980's.

Title: Cross-Sectional Efficiency and Labour Hoarding in a Matching Model of Unemployment
Abstract: We study positive and normative aspects of steady-state equilibrium in a market where firms of endogenous size experience idiosyncratic shocks and undergo a costly search process to hire their workers. The stylized model we propose highlights interactions between job-security provisions and sectoral shocks in determining the natural rate of unemployment, the allocation of labour, and the extent of labour hoarding, and rationalizes cross-sectional asymmetries of gross employment flows at the firm level. In our model, where productivity and search costs are dynamically heterogeneous across firms, decentralized wage bargains imply important cross-sectional inefficiencies, which overshadow the static search inefficiencies on which simpler models focus.

Title: Search Unemployment with On-the-job Search
Abstract: This paper introduces on-the-job search into the model of search equilibrium that builds on the concept of the matching function and non-cooperative wage behaviour. On-the-job search takes place only at short job tenures because of the accumulation of job-specific human capital. The model of search equilibrium retains its familiar structure but yields new results. The most interesting one is a fall in the responsiveness of unemployment to productivity shocks because of induced changes in the composition of jobs and the number of employed job seekers.

Title: Growth and Unemployment
Abstract: This paper analyses the effects of growth on long-run unemployment using a search model of equilibrium unemployment where growth arises explicitly from the introduction of new technologies that require labour reallocation for their implementation. The analysis uncovers and compares between two competing effects of growth on unemployment. The first is a capitalisation effect, whereby an increase in growth raises the capitalised returns from creating jobs and consequently reduces the equilibrium rate of unemployment. The second is a creative destruction effect whereby an increase in growth reduces the duration of a job match, thereby raising the equilibrium level of unemployment both directly, by raising the job separation rate, and indirectly, by discouraging the creation of job vacancies.

Title: Risk and Insurance in a Rural Credit Market: An Empirical Investigation in Northern Nigeria
Abstract: Credit contracts play a direct role in pooling risk between households in northern Nigeria. Repayments owed by borrowers depend on realizations of random shocks by both borrowers and lenders. The paper develops two models of state-contingent loans. The first is a competitive equilibrium in perfectly enforceable contracts. The second permits imperfect information and equilibrium default. Estimates of both models indicate that quantitatively important state-contingent payments are embedded in these loan transactions, but that a fully efficient risk-pooling equilibrium is not achieved. The research is based on a year-long survey in Zaria, Nigeria conducted by the author.

Title: Incentives and Loss of Control in an Optimal Hierarchy
Abstract: This paper studies incentives and loss of control in a hierarchy model which combines and generalizes the models of Williamson, Calvo-Wellisz and Keren-Levhari. In our model of the hierarchy, the levels of effort from managers and workers, the wage scales, the span of control and, in particular, the total number of tiers are all endogenous. Using optimal control techniques, we show that in the optimal hierarchy the wage scales and effort levels decrease as one moves down the hierarchy. As the hierarchy expands with no technological progress, workers exert less effort and are paid less, top managers work harder and are paid more and the wage distribution becomes increasingly skewed.

Title: Repeated Play, Cooperation and Coordination: An Experimental Study
Abstract: An experiment was conducted to test whether discounted repeated play leads to greater cooperation and coordination than one-shot play in a public good environment with incomplete information. The experiment was designed so that, theoretically, repeated play can sustain equilibria with substantially higher group earnings than result in the one-shot Bayesian Nash equilibrium. The design varied a number of environmental parameters, including the size of the group, and the statistical distribution of marginal rates of substitution between the public and private good. Marginal rates of substitution were private information but the statistical distribution was common knowledge. The results indicate that repetition leads to greater cooperation, and that the magnitude of these gains depends systematically both on the ability of players to monitor each other's strategy and on the environmental parameters.

Title: Cooperation in the Prisoner's Dilemma with Anonymous Random Matching
Abstract: The paper considers the repeated prisoner's dilemma in a large-population random-matching setting where players are unable to recognize their opponents. Despite the informational restrictions cooperation is still a sequential equilibrium supported by "contagious" punishments. The equilibrium does not require excessive patience, and contrary to previous thought, need not be extraordinarily fragile. It is robust to the introduction of small amounts of noise and remains nearly efficient. Extensions are discussed to models with heterogeneous rates of time preference and without public randomizations.

Title: "Once-off" and Continuing Gains from Trade
Abstract: Most economists are familiar with the static or "once-off" welfare gains created by opening an economy to trade. Much less is known about how the resource reallocations necessitated by this move affect long-run growth, and hence whether they provide dynamic or continuing welfare gains in future periods. This paper employs a dynamic Ricardian trade model to provide a decomposition of the gains from trade into "once-off" and continuing categories. In one version of the model, trade is always welfare enhancing; in the other, "once-off" losses may occur alongside dynamic gains. In both versions the magnitude of "once-off" and continuing effects are related to absolute and relative country size, similarity in production structures, rates of time preference, and the productivity of R&amp;D.

Title: The Efficiency Bound of the Mixed Proportional Hazard Model
Abstract: The semiparametric efficiency bound of the mixed proportional hazard model is derived. The density of the model factors in such a way that there exists a complete sufficient statistic for the individual heterogeneity. The efficient score is shown to be the difference between the score in the parametric direction and its conditional expectation given the sufficient statistic. Applying this result to the single-spell Weibull mixed proportional hazard model, it is shown that its information matrix is singular and there cannot exist any ^/w-consistent estimator sequence. The information of the multi-spell Weibull mixed proportional hazard model is shown to be nonsingular in general.

Title: Automatic Lag Selection in Covariance Matrix Estimation
Abstract: We propose a nonparametric method for automatically selecting the number of autocovariances to use in computing a heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation consistent covariance matrix. For a given kernel for weighting the autocovariances, we prove that our procedure is asymptotically equivalent to one that is optimal under a mean-squared error loss function. Monte Carlo simulations suggest that our procedure performs tolerably well, although it does result in size distortions.

Title: Combining Micro and Macro Data in Microeconometric Models
Abstract: Census reports can be interpreted as providing nearly exact knowledge of moments of the marginal distribution of economic variables. This information can be combined with cross-sectional or panel samples to improve accuracy of estimation. In this paper we show how to do this efficiently. We show that the gains from use of marginal information can be substantial. We also discuss how to test the compatibility of sample and marginal information.

Title: Incentives and Aggregate Shocks
Abstract: This paper presents an incentive-based theory of the dynamics of the distribution of consumption in the presence of aggregate shocks. The paper builds on the models concerning the distribution of income or consumption and incentive problems of Green (1987), Thomas and Worrall (1991), Phelan and Townsend (1991), and Atkeson and Lucas (1992). By incorporating aggregate production shocks, the model allows an examination of the interactions between individual and aggregate consumption series given incomplete insurance. Further, the methodology outlined allows the incorporation of incentive considerations to macroeconomic environments similar to Rogerson (1988) and Hansen (1985).

Title: Rotating Savings and Credit Associations, Credit Markets and Efficiency
Abstract: This paper examines the allocative performance of rotating savings and credit associations (roscas), a financial institution which is observed world-wide. We develop a model in which individuals save for an indivisible good and study roscas which distribute funds using random allocation and bidding. The allocations achieved by the two types of rosca are compared with that achieved by a credit market and with efficient allocations more generally. We find that neither type of rosca is efficient and that individuals are better off with a credit market than a bidding rosca. Nonetheless, a random rosca may sometimes yield a higher level of ex ante expected utility to prospective participants than would a credit market.

Title: Inflation Variability and Gradualist Monetary Policy
Abstract: This paper considers the optimal approach to reducing inflation when the cost of inflation is its conditional variability. Inflation is stochastically related to money growth, with unobservable time-varying autonomous and induced components. A sharp reduction in money growth provides information about the responsiveness of inflation to money, but also induces variability as the economy heads into unknown territory. Gradual policy is always optimal and the model explains why moderate-inflation countries adopt a much more gradual money growth reduction than high-inflation countries. Additionally, the analysis sheds light on the more general problem of learning with two unobservable parameters.

Title: Optimal Income Distribution Rules and Representative Consumers
Abstract: This paper derives observable properties of economies with optimal income distribution rules that specify consumers' incomes as functions of aggregate income and prices. Optimality implies that the aggregate demand function is generated by a single "representative" consumer, cf. Samuelson (1956). We derive an additional implication which, when consumers receive fixed shares of aggregate income, requires that the consumers' demands become more dispersed when aggregate income rises. This last condition has empirical support. The results relate the representative consumer's preferences to a version of Kaldor's compensation criterion and show when both can be used for normative analysis without internal inconsistency.

Title: Price and Quality in a New Product Monopoly
Abstract: In a signal-extraction model of consumer behaviour, higher prices signal higher-quality products for a new product monopoly, even without cost asymmetries across different qualities. Moreover, higher-quality products earn greater expected profits, and the monopolist has an incentive to provide even transient improvements in quality. Finally, the monopolist has a positive incentive to conduct market research about quality, and produces more information than is socially optimal.
