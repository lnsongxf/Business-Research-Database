Title: A Theory of Endogenous Commitment 
Abstract:
 Commitment is typically modelled by assigning to one of the players the
 ability to take an initial binding action. The weakness of this approach
 is that the fundamental question of who has the opportunity to commit
 cannot be addressed, as it is assumed. This paper presents a framework in
 which commitment power arises endogenously from the fundamentals of the
 model. We construct a finite dynamic game in which players are given the
 option to change their minds as often as they wish, but pay a switching
 cost if they do so. We show that for games with two players and two
 actions there is a unique subgame-perfect equilibrium with a simple
 structure. This equilibrium is independent of the order and timing of
 moves and is robust to other protocol specifications. Moreover, despite
 the perfect information nature of the model and the costly switches,
 strategic delays may arise in equilibrium. The flexibility of the model
 allows us to apply it to various environments. In particular, we study an
 entry deterrence situation. Its equilibrium is intuitive and illustrative
 of how commitment power is endogenously determined.  Copyright 2008, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Optimal Contracts with Shirking 
Abstract:
 I explicitly derive the optimal dynamic incentive contract in a standard
 continuous-time agency setting where the agent has a shirking action. My
 solution generates two dynamic contracts new to the literature. Both
 contracts include phases when the agent frequently shirks. In one
 contract, the shirking phases are relaxation periods rewarding the agent
 for good performance. In the other, the shirking phases are
 suspension-type arrangements punishing the agent for poor performance. In
 addition, I also explore the relationships between optimal contracting and
 taxes, bargaining, and renegotiation.  Copyright 2013, Oxford University Press.

Title: Optimal Bandwidth Choice for the Regression Discontinuity Estimator 
Abstract:
 We investigate the choice of the bandwidth for the regression
 discontinuity estimator. We focus on estimation by local linear
 regression, which was shown to have attractive properties (Porter, J. 2003, "Estimation in the
 Regression Discontinuity Model" (unpublished, Department of Economics,
 University of Wisconsin, Madison)). We derive the asymptotically optimal
 bandwidth under squared error loss. This optimal bandwidth depends on
 unknown functionals of the distribution of the data and we propose simple
 and consistent estimators for these functionals to obtain a fully
 data-driven bandwidth algorithm. We show that this bandwidth estimator is
 optimal according to the criterion of Li (1987, "Asymptotic Optimality for
 C<sub>p</sub>, C<sub>L</sub>, Cross-validation and Generalized
 Cross-validation: Discrete Index Set", Annals of Statistics, 15,
 958--975), although it is not unique in the sense that alternative
 consistent estimators for the unknown functionals would lead to bandwidth
 estimators with the same optimality properties. We illustrate the proposed
 bandwidth, and the sensitivity to the choices made in our algorithm, by
 applying the methods to a data set previously analysed by Lee (2008,
 "Randomized Experiments from Non-random Selection in U.S. House
 Elections", Journal of Econometrics, 142, 675--697) as well as by
 conducting a small simulation study.  Copyright , Oxford University Press.

Title: The Technology Cycle and Inequality 
Abstract:
 Motivated by the observed rise in the trade of technology, I analyse how
 technology would spread in a frictionless market. In such a world,
 low-skilled agents prefer to use old technology because it costs less;
 their skills do not justify the use of frontier technology. The model
 generates a technology-life cycle of somewhere between 68 and 124 years
 and per-capita income differential factors between 2.3 and 4.5. The model
 matches fairly well the cross-section relation between a country's income
 per capita and the average age of the technologies that its residents use.
 It is also consistent with aspects of the observed positive relation
 between income and imports of technology.  Copyright , Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Fair Income Tax 
Abstract:
 In a model where agents have unequal skills and heterogeneous preferences
 over consumption and leisure, we look for the optimal tax on the basis of
 efficiency and fairness principles and under incentive-compatibility
 constraints. The fairness principles considered here are: (1) a weak
 version of the Pigou&#x2014;Dalton transfer principle; (2) a condition
 precluding redistribution when all agents have the same skills. With such
 principles we construct and justify specific social preferences and derive
 a simple criterion for the evaluation of income tax schedules. Namely, the
 lower the greatest average tax rate over the range of low incomes, the
 better. We show that, as a consequence, the optimal tax should give the
 greatest subsidies to the working poor (the agents having the lowest skill
 and choosing the largest labour time).  Copyright 2006, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Credit Constraints, Heterogeneous Firms, and International Trade 
Abstract:
 Financial market imperfections severely restrict international trade flows
 because exporters require external capital. This article identifies and
 quantifies the three mechanisms through which credit constraints affect
 trade: the selection of heterogeneous firms into domestic production, the
 selection of domestic manufacturers into exporting, and the level of firm
 exports. I incorporate financial frictions into a heterogeneous-firm model
 and apply it to aggregate trade data for a large panel of countries. I
 establish causality by exploiting the variation in financial development
 across countries and the variation in financial vulnerability across
 sectors. About 20%--25% of the impact of credit constraints on trade is
 driven by reductions in total output. Of the additional, trade-specific
 effect, one-third reflects limited firm entry into exporting, while
 two-thirds are due to contractions in exporters' sales. Financially
 developed economies export more in financially vulnerable sectors because
 they enter more markets, ship more products to each destination, and sell
 more of each product. These results have important policy implications for
 less developed nations that rely on exports for economic growth but suffer
 from weak financial institutions.  Copyright 2013, Oxford University Press.

Title: Expectations and the Stability Problem for Optimal Monetary Policies 
Abstract:
 A fundamentals based monetary policy rule, which would be the optimal
 monetary policy without commitment when private agents have perfectly
 rational expectations, is unstable if in fact these agents follow standard
 adaptive learning rules. This problem can be overcome if private
 expectations are observed and suitably incorporated into the policy
 maker's optimal rule. These strong results extend to the case in which
 there is simultaneous learning by the policy maker and the private agents.
 Our findings show the importance of conditioning policy appropriately, not
 just on fundamentals, but also directly on observed household and firm
 expectations.  Copyright 2003, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Estimating Consumption Economies of Scale, Adult Equivalence Scales, and Household Bargaining Power 
Abstract:
 How much income would a woman living alone require to attain the same
 standard of living that she would have if she were married? What
 percentage of a married couple's expenditures are controlled by the
 husband? How much money does a couple save on consumption goods by living
 together versus living apart? We propose and estimate a collective model
 of household behaviour that permits identification and estimation of
 concepts such as these. We model households in terms of the utility
 functions of its members, a bargaining or social welfare function, and a
 consumption technology function. We demonstrate generic non-parametric
 identification of the model, and hence of a version of adult equivalence
 scales that we call "indifference scales", as well as consumption
 economies of scale, the household's resource sharing rule or members'
 bargaining power, and other related concepts.  Copyright 2013, Oxford University Press.

Title: Understanding the City Size Wage Gap 
Abstract:
 In this paper, we decompose city size wage premia into various components.
 We base these decompositions on an estimated on-the-job search model that
 incorporates latent ability, search frictions, firm-worker match quality,
 human capital accumulation, and endogenous migration between large,
 medium, and small cities. Counterfactual simulations of the model indicate
 that variation in returns to experience and differences in wage intercepts
 across location type are the most important mechanisms contributing to
 observed city size wage premia. Variation in returns to experience is more
 important for generating wage premia between large and small locations,
 while differences in wage intercepts are more important for generating
 wage premia between medium and small locations. Sorting on unobserved
 ability within education group and differences in labour market search
 frictions and distributions of firm-worker match quality contribute little
 to observed city size wage premia. These conclusions hold for separate
 samples of high school and college graduates.  Copyright 2012, Oxford University Press.

Title: Transparency and Economic Policy 
Abstract:
 We provide a two period model of political competition in which voters
 imperfectly observe the electoral promises made to other voters. Imperfect
 observability generates an incentive for candidates to offer excessive
 transfers even if voters are homogeneous and taxation is distortionary.
 Government spending is larger than in a world of perfect observability.
 Transfers are partly financed through government debt, and the size of the
 debt is higher in less transparent political systems. The model provides
 an explanation of fiscal churning; it also predicts that groups whose
 transfers are less visible to others receive higher transfers, and that
 imperfect transparency of transfers may lead to underprovision of public
 goods. From the policy perspective, the main novelty of our analysis is a
 separate evaluation of the transparency of spending and the transparency
 of revenues. We show that the transparency of the political system does
 not unambiguously improve efficiency: transparency of spending is
 beneficial, but transparency of revenues can be counterproductive because
 it endogenously leads to increased wasteful spending.  Copyright , Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Voluntarily Separable Repeated Prisoner's Dilemma 
Abstract:
 Ordinary repeated games do not apply to real societies where one can cheat
 and escape from partners. We formulate a model of endogenous relationships
 that a player can unilaterally end and start with a randomly assigned new
 partner with no information flow. Focusing on two-person, two-action
 Prisoner's Dilemma, we show that the endogenous duration of partnerships
 generates a significantly different evolutionary stability structure from
 ordinary random matching games. Monomorphic equilibria require initial
 trust building, while a polymorphic equilibrium includes earlier
 cooperators than any strategy in monomorphic equilibria and is thus more
 efficient. This is due to the non-linearity of average payoffs.  Copyright , Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Why Has House Price Dispersion Gone Up? 
Abstract:
 We set up and solve a spatial, dynamic equilibrium model of the housing
 market based on two main assumptions: households with heterogenous
 abilities flow in and out metropolitan areas in response to local wage
 shocks, and the housing supply cannot adjust instantly because of
 regulatory constraints. In our equilibrium, house prices compensate for
 cross-sectional productivity differences. We increase productivity
 dispersion in the calibrated model in order to match the 30-year increase
 in cross-sectional wage dispersion that we document based on
 metropolitan-level data. We show that the model quantitatively matches the
 observed 30-year increase in dispersion of house prices across US
 metropolitan areas. It is consistent with several other features of the
 cross-sectional distribution of house prices and wages.  Copyright , Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Strategic Delay in a Real Options Model of R&#x0026;D Competition 
Abstract:
 This paper considers irreversible investment in competing research
 projects with uncertain returns under a winner-takes-all patent system.
 Uncertainty takes two distinct forms: the technological success of the
 project is probabilistic, while the economic value of the patent to be won
 evolves stochastically over time. According to the theory of real options
 uncertainty generates an option value of delay, but with two competing
 firms the fear of preemption would appear to undermine this approach. In
 non-cooperative equilibrium two patterns of investment emerge depending on
 parameter values. In a pre-emptive leaderfollower equilibrium firms invest
 sequentially and option values are reduced by competition. A symmetric
 outcome may also occur, however, in which investment is more delayed than
 the single-firm counterpart. Comparing this with the optimal cooperative
 investment pattern, investment is found to be more delayed when firms act
 non-cooperatively as each holds back from investing in the fear of
 starting a patent race. Implications of the analysis for empirical and
 policy issues in R&#x0026;D are considered.  Copyright 2002, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Reputation and Survival: Learning in a Dynamic Signalling Model 
Abstract:
 We consider the impact of reputation on the survival of a monopolist
 selling single units in discrete time periods, whose quality is learned
 slowly. If the seller learns her own quality at the same rate as
 customers, a sufficiently bad run of luck could induce her to stop
 selling. When she knows her quality, a good seller never stops selling
 though at low reputations a bad seller does with some probability.
 Furthermore, a seller with positive, though imperfect, information sells
 for the same number of periods whether her information is private or
 public. We further consider the robustness of the central result when the
 seller's opportunities for strategic behaviour are limited.  Copyright 2003, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Sixty Years after the Magic Carpet Ride: The Long-Run Effect of the Early Childhood Environment on Social and Economic Outcomes 
Abstract:
 This paper estimates the effect of the early childhood environment on a
 large array of social and economic outcomes lasting almost 60 years. To do
 this, we exploit variation in the living conditions experienced by
 Yemenite children after being airlifted to Israel in 1949. We find that
 children who were placed in a more modern environment (i.e. with better
 sanitary and infrastructure conditions) were more likely to obtain higher
 education, marry at an older age, have fewer children, and work at age 55.
 They were also more likely to be assimilated into Israeli society, to be
 less religious, and have more worldly tastes in music and food. However,
 these effects are found mainly for women and not for men. We also find an
 effect on the next generation--children who lived in a better environment
 grew up to have children with more education.  Copyright 2011, Oxford University Press.

Title: Does One Soros Make a Difference? A Theory of Currency Crises with Large and Small Traders 
Abstract:
 Do large investors increase the vulnerability of a country to speculative
 attacks in the foreign exchange markets? To address this issue, we build a
 model of currency crises where a single large investor and a continuum of
 small investors independently decide whether to attack a currency based on
 their private information about fundamentals. Even abstracting from
 signalling, the presence of the large investor does make all other traders
 more aggressive in their selling. Relative to the case in which there is
 no large investor, small investors attack the currency when fundamentals
 are stronger. Yet, the difference can be small, or non-existent, depending
 on the relative precision of private information of the small and large
 investors. Adding signalling makes the influence of the large trader on
 small traders' behaviour much stronger.  Copyright 2004, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Endogenous Information Acquisition in Coordination Games 
Abstract:
 In the context of a "beauty-contest" coordination game (in which pay-offs
 depend on the quadratic distance of actions from an unobserved state
 variable and from the average action), players choose how much costly
 attention to pay to various informative signals. Each signal has an
 underlying accuracy (how precisely it identifies the state) and a clarity
 (how easy it is to understand). The unique linear equilibrium has
 interesting properties: the signals which receive attention are the
 clearest available, even if they have poor underlying accuracy; the number
 of signals observed falls as the complementarity of players' actions
 rises; and, if actions are more complementary, the information
 endogenously acquired in equilibrium is more public in nature. The
 consequences of "rational-inattention" constraints on information
 transmission and processing are also studied.  Copyright 2012, Oxford University Press.

Title: A Dynamic Analysis of the Market for Wide-Bodied Commercial Aircraft 
Abstract:
 This paper uses an empirical dynamic oligopoly model of the commercial
 aircraft industry to analyse industry pricing, industry performance, and
 optimal industry policy. A novel feature of the model with respect to the
 previous literature is that entry, exit, prices, and quantities are
 endogenously determined in Markov perfect equilibrium (MPE). We find that
 many unusual aspects of the aircraft data, such as high concentration and
 persistent pricing below static marginal cost, are explained by this
 model. We also find that the unconstrained MPE is quite efficient from a
 social perspective, providing only 10% less welfare on average than a
 social planner would obtain. Finally, we provide simulation evidence that
 an anti-trust policy in the form of a concentration restriction would be
 welfare reducing.  Copyright 2004, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Shifting the Blame: On Delegation and Responsibility 
Abstract:
 To fully understand the motives for delegating a decision right, it is
 important to study responsibility attributions for outcomes of delegated
 decisions. We conducted laboratory experiments in which subjects could
 either choose a fair allocation or an unfair allocation or delegate the
 choice, and we used a punishment option to elicit responsibility
 attributions. Our results show that, first, responsibility attribution can
 be effectively shifted and, second, this can constitute a strong motive
 for the delegation of a decision right. Moreover, we propose a simple
 measure of responsibility and show that this measure outperforms measures
 based on inequity aversion or reciprocity in predicting punishment
 behaviour.  Copyright 2012, Oxford University Press.

Title: The Demand for Sons 
Abstract:
 Do parents have preferences over the gender of their children, and if so,
 does this have negative consequences for daughters versus sons? In this
 paper, we show that child gender affects the marital status, family
 structure, and fertility of a significant number of American families.
 Overall, a first-born daughter is significantly less likely to be living
 with her father compared to a first-born son. Three factors are important
 in explaining this gap. First, women with first-born daughters are less
 likely to marry. Strikingly, we also find evidence that the gender of a
 child in utero affects shotgun marriages. Among women who have taken an
 ultrasound test during pregnancy, mothers who have a girl are less likely
 to be married at delivery than those who have a boy. Second, parents who
 have first-born girls are significantly more likely to be divorced. Third,
 after a divorce, fathers are much more likely to obtain custody of sons
 compared to daughters. These three factors have serious negative income
 and educational consequences for affected children. What explains these
 findings? In the last part of the paper, we turn to the relationship
 between child gender and fertility to help sort out parental gender bias
 from competing explanations for our findings. We show that the number of
 children is significantly higher in families with a first-born girl. Our
 estimates indicate that first-born daughters caused approximately 5500
 more births per year, for a total of 220,000 more births over the past 40
 years. Taken individually, each piece of empirical evidence is not
 sufficient to establish the existence of parental gender bias. But taken
 together, the weight of the evidence supports the notion that parents in
 the U.S. favour boys over girls.  Copyright 2008, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Precautionary Wealth Accumulation 
Abstract:
 When does an individual's expected wealth accumulation profile increase as
 earnings risk increases? This paper answers this question for multi-period
 models where earnings shocks are independent over time. Sufficient
 conditions are stated in terms of properties of a decision rule for
 savings and, alternatively, in terms of properties of preferences.  Copyright 2004, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Estimation and Testing of Forecast Rationality under Flexible Loss 
Abstract:
 In situations where a sequence of forecasts is observed, a common strategy
 is to examine "rationality" conditional on a given loss function. We
 examine this from a different perspective&#x02014;supposing that we have a
 family of loss functions indexed by unknown shape parameters, then given
 the forecasts can we back out the loss function parameters consistent with
 the forecasts being rational even when we do not observe the underlying
 forecasting model? We establish identification of the parameters of a
 general class of loss functions that nest popular loss functions as
 special cases and provide estimation methods and asymptotic distributional
 results for these parameters. This allows us to construct new tests of
 forecast rationality that allow for asymmetric loss. The methods are
 applied in an empirical analysis of IMF and OECD forecasts of budget
 deficits for the G7 countries. We find that allowing for asymmetric loss
 can significantly change the outcome of empirical tests of forecast
 rationality.  Copyright 2005, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Foreign Direct Investment and Exports with Growing Demand 
Abstract:
 We explore entry into a foreign market with uncertain demand growth. A
 multinational can serve the foreign demand by two modes, or by a
 combination thereof: it can export its products, or it can create
 productive capacity via foreign direct investment (FDI). The advantage of
 FDI is that it allows for lower marginal cost than exporting does. The
 disadvantage is that FDI is irreversible and, hence, entails the risk of
 creating under-utilized capacity in the case that the market turns out to
 be small. The presence of demand uncertainty and irreversibility gives
 rise to an interior solution, where the multinational, under certain
 conditions, both exports its products and does FDI.  Copyright 2003, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Gaps and Triangles 
Abstract:
 In this paper, we derive principles of optimal cyclical monetary policy in
 an economy without capital, with a cash-in-advance restriction on
 household transactions, and monopolistic firms that set prices one period
 in advance. The only distortionary policy instruments are the nominal
 interest rate and the money supply. In this environment it is feasible to
 undo both the cash-in-advance and price setting restrictions, but not the
 distortion due to monopolistic competition. We show that it is optimal to
 follow the Friedman rule, and thus offset the cash-in-advance restriction.
 We also find that, in general, it is not optimal to undo the price setting
 restriction, so that a simple criterion of eliminating gaps is not
 optimal. Sticky prices provide the planner with tools to improve upon a
 distorted flexible price allocation.  Copyright 2003, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Prices, Plant Size, and Product Quality 
Abstract:
 Drawing on uncommonly rich and representative data from the Colombian
 manufacturing census, this paper documents new empirical relationships
 between input prices, output prices, and plant size and proposes a model
 of endogenous input and output quality choices by heterogeneous firms to
 explain the observed patterns. The key empirical facts are that, on
 average within narrowly defined sectors, (1) larger plants charge more for
 their outputs and (2) larger plants pay more for their material inputs.
 The latter fact generalizes the well-known positive correlation between
 plant size and wages. Similar correlations hold between prices and export
 status. We show that the empirical patterns are consistent with a
 parsimonious extension of the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Melitz
 (2003</xref>, "The Impact of Trade on Intra-Industry Reallocations and
 Aggregate Industry Productivity," Econometrica, 71, 1695--1725) framework
 to include endogenous choice of input and output quality. Using a measure
 of the scope for quality differentiation from <xref ref-type="bibr"
 rid="bib82">Sutton (1998</xref>, Technology and Market Structure: Theory
 and History. Cambridge: MIT Press), we show that differences across
 sectors in the relationships between prices and plant size are consistent
 with our model. Available evidence suggests that differences in observable
 measures of market power do not provide a complete explanation for the
 empirical patterns. We interpret the results as supportive of the
 hypothesis that quality differences of both inputs and outputs play an
 important role in generating the price--plant size correlations.  Copyright 2012, Oxford University Press.

Title: A Directed Search Model of Inequality with Heterogeneous Skills and Skill-Biased Technology 
Abstract:
 In this paper I analyse the directed search/matching problem in an economy
 with heterogeneous skills and skill-biased technology. A unique symmetric
 equilibrium exists and is socially efficient. Matching is partially mixed
 in the equilibrium. A high-tech firm receives both skilled and unskilled
 applicants with positive probability, and favours skilled workers, while a
 low-tech firm receives only unskilled applicants. The model generates wage
 inequality among identical unskilled workers, as well as between-skill
 inequality, despite the fact that all unskilled workers perform the same
 task and have the same productivity in the two types of firms. Inequality
 has interesting responses to skill-biased technological progress, a
 general productivity slowdown, and an exogenous increase in the skill
 supply elasticity.  Copyright 2002, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Elimination of Social Security in a Dynastic Framework 
Abstract:
 Much of the existing literature on social security has taken the extreme
 assumption that individuals have little or no altruism; this paper takes
 an opposite assumption that there is full two-sided altruism. When
 households insure members that belong to the same family line, privatizing
 social security can gain public support. In our benchmark model calibrated
 to the U.S. economy, privatization without compensation is favoured by
 52&#x0025; of the population. If social security participants are fully
 compensated for their contributions, and the transition to privatization
 is financed by a combination of debt and a consumption tax, 58&#x0025;
 experience a welfare gain. These gains and the resulting public support
 for social security reform depend critically on a flexible labour market.
 If the labour supply elasticity is low, then support for privatization
 disappears.  Copyright 2007, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Executive Compensation and Short-Termist Behaviour in Speculative Markets 
Abstract:
 We present a multiperiod agency model of stock-based executive
 compensation in a speculative stock market, where investors have
 heterogeneous beliefs and stock prices may deviate from underlying
 fundamentals and include a speculative option component. This component
 arises from the option to sell the stock in the future to potentially
 overoptimistic investors. We show that optimal compensation contracts may
 emphasize short-term stock performance, at the expense of long-run
 fundamental value, as an incentive to induce managers to pursue actions
 which increase the speculative component in the stock price. Our model
 provides a different perspective on the recent corporate crisis than the
 &#x201C;rent extraction view&#x201D; of executive compensation.  Copyright 2006, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Bid-Ask Price Competition with Asymmetric Information between Market-Makers 
Abstract:
 This paper studies the effect of asymmetric information on the price
 formation process in a quote-driven market. One market-maker receives
 private information on the value of the quoted asset and repeatedly
 competes with market-makers who are uninformed. We show that despite the
 fact that the informed market-maker's quotes are public, the market is
 never strong-form efficient with certainty until the last stage. We
 characterize a reputational equilibrium in which the informed market-maker
 influences and possibly misleads the uninformed market-makers' beliefs. At
 this equilibrium, a price leadership effect arises, the informed
 market-maker's expected pay-off is positive and the rate of price
 discovery increases in the last stages of trade.  Copyright 2006, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Employment, Hours of Work and the Optimal Taxation of Low-Income Families 
Abstract:
 The optimal design of low-income support is examined using a structural
 labour supply model. The approach incorporates unobserved heterogeneity,
 fixed costs of work, childcare costs and the detailed non-convexities of
 the tax and transfer system. The analysis considers purely Pareto
 improving reforms and also optimal design under social welfare functions
 with different degrees of inequality aversion. We explore the gains from
 tagging and also examine the case for the use of hours-contingent
 payments. Using the tax schedule for lone parents in the U.K. as our
 policy environment, the results point to a reformed non-linear tax
 schedule with tax credits only optimal for low earners. The results also
 suggest a welfare improving role for tagging according to child age and
 for hours-contingent payments, although the case for the latter is
 mitigated when hours cannot be monitored or recorded accurately by the tax
 authorities.  Copyright 2012, Oxford University Press.

Title: Optimal Taxation with Private Government Information 
Abstract:
 The Ramsey model of fiscal policy implies that taxes should be smooth in
 the sense of having small variances. In contrast, empirical labour tax
 processes are smooth in the sense of being random walks; they provide
 prima facie evidence for incomplete government insurance. This paper
 considers whether private government information might lie behind such
 incomplete insurance. It shows that optimal incentive compatible policies
 exhibit limited use of state contingent debt and greater persistence in
 taxes and debt, and it argues that they are better approximations to
 empirical fiscal policies than those implied by the Ramsey model. The
 paper also establishes that optimal incentive compatible allocations
 converge to allocations such that the government's incentive compatibility
 constraint no longer binds. Generally, these limiting allocations are ones
 in which the government is maximally indebted. Their credibility and the
 interaction of incentive compatibility and credibility is briefly
 discussed.  Copyright 2004, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Cycles and Instability in a Rock--Paper--Scissors Population Game: A Continuous Time Experiment 
Abstract:
 We report laboratory experiments that use new, visually oriented software
 to explore the dynamics of 3x3 games with intransitive best
 responses. Each moment, each player is matched against the entire
 population, here 8 human subjects. A "heat map" offers instantaneous
 feedback on current profit opportunities. In the continuous slow
 adjustment treatment, we see distinct cycles in the population mix. The
 cycle amplitude, frequency and direction are consistent with the standard
 learning models. Cycles are more erratic and higher frequency in the
 instantaneous adjustment treatment. Control treatments (using simultaneous
 matching in discrete time) replicate previous results that exhibit weak or
 no cycles. Average play is approximated fairly well by Nash equilibrium,
 and an alternative point prediction, "TASP" (Time Average of the Shapley
 Polygon), captures some regularities that Nash equilibrium misses.  Copyright 2014, Oxford University Press.

Title: Stage Financing and the Role of Convertible Securities 
Abstract:
 Venture capital financing is characterized by extensive use of convertible
 securities and stage financing. In a model where a venture capitalist
 provides staged financing for a project, we illustrate an advantage of
 convertible debt (or warrants) over a mixture of debt and equity.
 Essentially, when the venture capitalist retains the option to abandon the
 project, the entrepreneur has an incentive to engage in window dressing
 and bias positively the short-term performance of the project, reducing
 the probability that it will be liquidated. An appropriately designed
 convertible security prevents such behaviour because window dressing also
 increases the probability that the venture capitalist will exercise the
 conversion option becoming the owner of a substantial fraction of the
 project's equity.  Copyright 2003, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Incentives in Competitive Search Equilibrium 
Abstract:
 This paper proposes a labour market model with job search frictions where
 workers have private information on match quality and effort. Firms use
 wage contracts to motivate workers. In addition, wages are also used to
 attract employees. We define and characterize competitive search
 equilibrium in this context, and show that it satisfies a simple modified
 Hosios rule. We also analyse the interplay between macroeconomic variables
 and optimal wage contracts. Finally, we show that private information may
 increase the responsiveness of the unemployment rate to changes in the
 aggregate productivity level and, in particular, to changes in the
 information structure.  Copyright 2011, Oxford University Press.

Title: Can Gender Parity Break the Glass Ceiling? Evidence from a Repeated Randomized Experiment 
Abstract:
 This paper studies whether the gender composition of recruiting committees
 matters. We make use of the unique evidence provided by Spanish public
 examinations, where the allocation of candidates to evaluating committees
 is random. We analyse how the chances of success of 150,000 female and
 male candidates for positions in the four main Corps of the Spanish
 Judiciary from 1987 to 2007 were affected by the gender composition of
 their evaluation committee. We find that a female (male) candidate is
 significantly less likely to be hired whenever she (he) is randomly
 assigned to a committee where the share of female (male) evaluators is
 relatively greater. Evidence from multiple choice tests suggests that this
 is due to the fact that female majority committees overestimate the
 quality of male candidates.  Copyright , Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Social Incentives in the Workplace 
Abstract:
 We present evidence on social incentives in the workplace, namely on
 whether workers' behaviour is affected by the presence of those they are
 socially tied to, even in settings where there are no externalities among
 workers due to either the production technology or the compensation scheme
 in place. To do so, we combine data on individual worker productivity from
 a firm's personnel records with information on each worker's social
 network of friends in the firm. We find that compared to when she has no
 social ties with her co-workers, a given worker's productivity is
 significantly higher when she works alongside friends who are more able
 than her, and significantly lower when she works with friends who are less
 able than her. As workers are paid piece rates based on individual
 productivity, social incentives can be quantified in monetary terms and
 are such that (i) workers who are more able than their friends are willing
 to exert less effort and forgo 10% of their earnings; (ii) workers who
 have at least one friend who is more able than themselves are willing to
 increase their effort and hence productivity by 10%. The distribution of
 worker ability is such that the net effect of social incentives on the
 firm's aggregate performance is positive. The results suggest that firms
 can exploit social incentives as an alternative to monetary incentives to
 motivate workers.  Copyright , Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Efficient Likelihood Evaluation of State-Space Representations 
Abstract:
 We develop a numerical procedure that facilitates efficient likelihood
 evaluation in applications involving non-linear and non-Gaussian
 state-space models. The procedure employs continuous approximations of
 filtering densities, and delivers unconditionally optimal global
 approximations of targeted integrands to achieve likelihood approximation.
 Optimized approximations of targeted integrands are constructed via
 efficient importance sampling. Resulting likelihood approximations are
 continuous functions of model parameters, greatly enhancing parameter
 estimation. We illustrate our procedure in applications to dynamic
 stochastic general equilibrium models.  Copyright 2013, Oxford University Press.

Title: A Dynamic Model of Privatization with Endogenous Post-Privatization Performance 
Abstract:
 This paper presents a dynamic model of privatization, driven by improved
 institutional protection of private property rights and constrained by the
 buyer's financial constraints. Government ownership is more efficient than
 private ownership when private property rights are insecure. Improved
 institutional protection of property rights over time creates the need to
 privatize. The buyer's financial constraints affect the timing of
 privatization, causing the firm's post-privatization performance either to
 improve or to deteriorate in the short run. Financial constraints also
 have the possibility of inducing an underpricing phenomenon during
 privatization where the firm is priced below both what the buyer is
 willing to pay and the buyer's ability to pay. Faster institutional
 development calls for earlier privatization, but it also has the potential
 to either create or exacerbate deadweight losses associated with
 inefficient privatization. A host of empirically testable implications are
 derived.  Copyright , Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Professionals Play Minimax 
Abstract:
 The implications of the Minimax theorem are tested using natural data. The
 tests use a unique data set from penalty kicks in professional soccer
 games. In this natural setting experts play a one-shot two-person zero-sum
 game. The results of the tests are remarkably consistent with equilibrium
 play in every respect: (i) winning probabilities are statistically
 identical across strategies for players; (ii) players' choices are
 serially independent. The tests have substantial power to distinguish
 equilibrium play from disequilibrium alternatives. These results represent
 the first time that both implications of von Neumann's Minimax theorem are
 supported under natural conditions.  Copyright 2003, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Satisficing Contracts 
Abstract:
 We propose a model of equilibrium contracting between two agents who are
 "boundedly rational" in the sense that they face time costs of
 deliberating current and future transactions. We show that equilibrium
 contracts may be incomplete and assign control rights: they may leave some
 enforceable future transactions unspecified and instead specify which
 agent has the right to decide these transactions. Control rights allow the
 controlling agent to defer time-consuming deliberations on those
 transactions to a later date, making her less inclined to prolong
 negotiations over an initial incomplete contract. Still, agents tend to
 resolve conflicts up-front by writing more complete initial contracts. A
 more complete contract can take the form of either a finer adaptation to
 future contingencies, or greater coarseness. Either way, conflicts among
 contracting agents tend to result in excessively complete contracts in the
 sense that the maximization of joint payoffs would result in less complete
 contracts.  Copyright , Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: How Changes in Financial Incentives Affect the Duration of Unemployment 
Abstract:
 This paper studies how changes in the two key parameters of unemployment
 insurance-the benefit replacement rate (RR) and the potential
 benefit duration (PBD)-affect the duration of unemployment. To
 identify such an effect we exploit a policy change introduced in 1989 by
 the Austrian government, which affected various unemployed workers
 differently: a first group experienced an increase in RR; a second group
 experienced an extension of PBD; a third group experienced both a higher
 RR and a longer PBD; and a fourth group experienced no change in the
 policy parameters. We find that unemployed workers react to the
 disincentives by an increase in unemployment duration, and our empirical
 results are consistent with the predictions of job search theory. We use
 our parameter estimates to split up the total costs to unemployment
 insurance funds into costs due to changes in the unemployment insurance
 system with unchanged behaviour and costs due to behavioural responses of
 unemployed workers. Our results indicate that costs due to behavioural
 responses are substantial.  Copyright 2006, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Name Your Own Price at Priceline.com: Strategic Bidding and Lockout Periods 
Abstract:
 A buyer suggests prices to N sellers in a time period and buys from the
 seller who accepts the bid first. The number of bidding rounds is
 determined by how frequently the buyer can make an offer. We show that
 with no limit on the frequency and without discounting, the price path is
 either kept flat initially with large jumps at the end or increasing
 steadily over time. Which class of path occurs in equilibrium depends on
 the buyer's trade-off between committing to a price ceiling versus finely
 screening the sellers' costs. With discounting, limiting the number of
 rounds mitigates the delay caused by the reluctance to raise bids in the
 first class of equilibrium and therefore can benefit the buyer. This
 result suggests why, in reality, bargaining parties often take measures to
 make their offers rigid and consequently force themselves to make fewer
 offers.  Copyright , Oxford University Press.

Title: Vertical Relationships between Manufacturers and Retailers: Inference with Limited Data 
Abstract:
 In this paper, different models of vertical relationships between
 manufacturers and retailers in the supermarket industry are compared.
 Demand estimates are used to compute price-cost margins for retailers and
 manufacturers under different supply models when wholesale prices are not
 observed. The purpose is to identify the set of margins compatible with
 the margins obtained from estimates of cost and to select the model most
 consistent with the data among non-nested competing models. The models
 considered are (1) a simple linear pricing model; (2) a vertically
 integrated model; and (3) a variety of alternative (strategic) supply
 scenarios that allow for collusion, non-linear pricing, and strategic
 behaviour with respect to private label products. Using data on yogurt
 sold in several stores in a large urban area of the U.S. the results imply
 that wholesale prices are close to marginal cost and that retailers have
 pricing power in the vertical chain. This is consistent with non-linear
 pricing by the manufacturers or high bargaining power of the retailers.  Copyright 2007, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Domestic Political Survival and International Conflict: Is Democracy Good for Peace? 
Abstract:
 We build a game-theoretic model where aggression can be triggered by
 domestic political concerns as well as the fear of being attacked. In the
 model, leaders of full and limited democracies risk losing power if they
 do not stand up to threats from abroad. In addition, the leader of a fully
 democratic country loses the support of the median voter if he attacks a
 non-hostile country. The result is a non-monotonic relationship between
 democracy and peace. Using Polity data, we classify countries as full
 democracies, limited democracies, and dictatorships. For the period
 1816--2000, Correlates of War data suggest that limited democracies are
 more aggressive than other regime types, including dictatorships, and not
 only during periods when the political regime is changing. In particular,
 a dyad of limited democracies is more likely to be involved in a
 militarized dispute than any other dyad (including "mixed" dyads, where
 the two countries have different regime types). Thus, while full
 democratization might advance the cause of peace, limited democratization
 might advance the cause of war. We also find that as the environment
 becomes more hostile, fully democratic countries become more aggressive
 faster than other regime types.  Copyright 2011, Oxford University Press.

Title: Comparative Advantage and Heterogeneous Firms 
Abstract:
 This paper examines how country, industry, and firm characteristics
 interact in general equilibrium to determine nations' responses to trade
 liberalization. When firms possess heterogeneous productivity, countries
 differ in relative factor abundance, and industries vary in factor
 intensity, falling trade costs induce reallocations of resources both
 within and across industries and countries. These reallocations generate
 substantial job turnover in all sectors, spur relatively more creative
 destruction in comparative advantage industries than in comparative
 disadvantage industries, and magnify ex ante comparative advantage to
 create additional welfare gains from trade. The improvements in aggregate
 productivity as countries liberalize dampen and can even reverse the
 real-wage losses of scarce factors.  Copyright 2007, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: The Relevance of a Choice of Auction Format in a Competitive Environment 
Abstract:
 We examine the relevance of an auction format in a competitive environment
 by comparing uniform and discriminatory price auctions with many bidders
 in a private values setting. We show that if the number of objects for
 sale is small relative to the number of bidders, then all equilibria of
 both auctions are approximately efficient and lead to approximately the
 same revenue. When the number of objects for sale is proportional to the
 number of bidders, then the particulars of the auction format matter. All
 equilibria of the uniform auction are efficient, while all of the
 equilibria of the discriminatory auction are inefficient. The relative
 revenue rankings of the auction formats can go in either direction,
 depending on the specifics of the environment. These conclusions regarding
 the efficiency and revenue ranking are in contrast to the previous
 literature, which focused on the case of independent information across
 agents.  Copyright 2006, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: What Drives Taxi Drivers? A Field Experiment on Fraud in a Market for Credence Goods 
Abstract:
 Credence goods are characterized by informational asymmetries between
 sellers and consumers that invite fraudulent behaviour by sellers. This
 article presents a natural field experiment on taxi rides in Athens,
 Greece, set up to measure different types of fraud and to examine the
 influence of passengers' presumed information and income on the extent of
 fraud. We find that passengers with inferior information about optimal
 routes are taken on significantly longer detours, while lack of
 information on the local tariff system increases the likelihood of
 manipulated bills by about fifteen percentage points. Passengers'
 perceived income seems to have no effect on fraud.  Copyright 2013, Oxford University Press.

Title: The Gambler's and Hot-Hand Fallacies: Theory and Applications 
Abstract:
 We develop a model of the gambler's fallacy--the mistaken belief that
 random sequences should exhibit systematic reversals. We show that an
 individual who holds this belief and observes a sequence of signals can
 exaggerate the magnitude of changes in an underlying state but
 underestimate their duration. When the state is constant, and so signals
 are i.i.d., the individual can predict that long streaks of similar
 signals will continue--a hot-hand fallacy. When signals are serially
 correlated, the individual typically under-reacts to short streaks,
 over-reacts to longer ones, and under-reacts to very long ones. Our model
 has implications for a number of puzzles in finance, e.g. the active-fund
 and fund-flow puzzles, and the presence of momentum and reversal in asset
 returns.  Copyright , Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Estimating Demand for Local Telephone Service with Asymmetric Information and Optional Calling Plans 
Abstract:
 In this paper, I study the theoretical and econometric implications of
 agents' uncertainty concerning their future consumption when a monopolist
 offers them either a unique, mandatory nonlinear tariff or a choice in
 advance from a menu of optional two-part tariffs. Agents' uncertainty is
 resolved through individual and privately known shocks to their types. In
 such a situation the principal may screen agents according to their ex
 ante or ex post type, by offering either a menu of optional tariffs or a
 standard nonlinear schedule. The theoretical implications of the model are
 used to evaluate a tariff experiment run by South Central Bell in two
 cities in Kentucky in 1986. The empirical approach explicitly accounts for
 the existence of informational asymmetries between local telephone users
 and the monopolist, leading to different, nested, econometric
 specifications under symmetric and asymmetric information. The empirical
 evidence suggests that there exists a significant asymmetry of information
 between consumers and the monopolist under both tariff regimes. All
 expected welfare components failed to increase with the introduction of
 optional tariffs for the estimated value of the parameters.  Copyright 2002, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Non-Bayesian Testing of a Stochastic Prediction 
Abstract:
 We propose a method to test a prediction of the distribution of a
 stochastic process. In a non-Bayesian, non-parametric setting, a predicted
 distribution is tested using a realization of the stochastic process. A
 test associates a set of realizations for each predicted distribution, on
 which the prediction passes, so that if there are no type I errors, a
 prediction assigns probability 1 to its test set. Nevertheless, these test
 sets can be "small", in the sense that "most"
 distributions assign it probability 0, and hence there are
 "few" type II errors. It is also shown that there exists
 such a test that cannot be manipulated, in the sense that an uninformed
 predictor, who is pretending to know the true distribution, is guaranteed
 to fail on an uncountable number of realizations, no matter what
 randomized prediction he employs. The notion of a small set we use is
 category I, described in more detail in the paper.  Copyright 2006, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Sequential Common-Value Auctions with Asymmetrically Informed Bidders 
Abstract:
 We study an infinitely repeated first-price auction with common values. We
 focus on one-sided incomplete information, in which one bidder learns the
 objects' value, which itself does not change over time. Learning by the
 uninformed bidder occurs only through observation of the bids. The
 proprietary information is eventually revealed, and the seller extracts
 essentially the entire rent (for large discount factors). Both players'
 pay-offs tend to 0 as the discount factor tends to 1. However, the
 uninformed bidder does relatively better than the informed bidder. We
 discuss the case of two-sided incomplete information and argue that, under
 a Markovian refinement, the outcome is pooling as information is revealed
 only insofar as it does not affect prices.  Copyright 2008, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Imitation and Belief Learning in an Oligopoly Experiment 
Abstract:
 We examine the force of three types of behavioural dynamics in
 quantity-setting triopoly experiments: (1) mimicking the successful firm,
 (2) rules based on following the exemplary firm, and (3) rules based on
 belief learning. Theoretically, these three types of rules lead to the
 competitive, the collusive, and the Cournot&#x2014;Nash outcome,
 respectively. In the experiment we employ three information treatments,
 each of which is hypothesized to be conducive to the force of one of the
 three dynamic rules. To a large extent, the results are consistent with
 the hypothesized relationships between treatments, behavioural rules, and
 outcomes.  Copyright 2002, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Bubbly Liquidity 
Abstract:
 This paper analyses the possibility and the consequences of rational
 bubbles in a dynamic economy where financially constrained firms demand
 and supply liquidity. Bubbles are more likely to emerge, the scarcer the
 supply of outside liquidity and the more limited the pledgeability of
 corporate income; they crowd investment in (out) when liquidity is
 abundant (scarce). We analyse extensions with firm heterogeneity and
 stochastic bubbles.  Copyright 2012, Oxford University Press.

Title: Cooperation in Experimental Games of Strategic Complements and Substitutes 
Abstract:
 We conduct a laboratory experiment aimed at examining whether strategic
 substitutability and strategic complementarity have an impact on the
 tendency to cooperate in finitely repeated two-player games with a
 Pareto-inefficient Nash equilibrium. We find that there is significantly
 more cooperation when actions exhibit strategic complementarities than in
 the case of strategic substitutes. The difference is to some extent driven
 by a difference in the speed with which some pairs reach stable full
 cooperation, but mainly by differences in choices of pairs that do not
 succeed in reaching full cooperation.  Copyright , Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Household Choices and Child Development 
Abstract:
 The growth in labour market participation among women with young children
 has raised concerns about its implications for child cognitive
 development. We estimate a model of the cognitive development process of
 children nested within an otherwise standard model of household behaviour.
 The household makes labour supply decisions and provides time and money
 inputs into the child quality production process during the development
 period. Our empirical results indicate that both parents' time inputs are
 important for the cognitive development of their children, particularly
 when the child is young. Money expenditures are less productive in terms
 of producing child quality. Comparative statics exercises demonstrate that
 cash transfers to households with children have small impacts on child
 quality due to the relatively low impact of money investments on child
 outcomes and the fact that a significant fraction of the transfer is spent
 on other household consumption and the leisure of the parents.  Copyright 2014, Oxford University Press.

Title: Does Income Inequality Lead to Consumption Inequality? Evidence and Theory<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN1">-super-1</xref> 
Abstract:
 Using data from the Consumer Expenditure Survey, we first document that
 the recent increase in income inequality in the U.S. has not been
 accompanied by a corresponding rise in consumption inequality. Much of
 this divergence is due to different trends in within-group inequality,
 which has increased significantly for income, but little for consumption.
 We then develop a simple framework that allows us to characterize
 analytically how within-group income inequality affects consumption
 inequality in a world in which agents can trade a full set of contingent
 consumption claims, subject to endogenous constraints emanating from the
 limited enforcement of intertemporal contracts. Finally, we quantitatively
 evaluate, in the context of a calibrated general equilibrium production
 economy, whether this set-up, or alternatively a standard incomplete
 markets model, can account for the documented stylized consumption
 inequality facts from the U.S. data.  Copyright 2006, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Large Stakes and Big Mistakes 
Abstract:
 Workers in a wide variety of jobs are paid based on performance, which is
 commonly seen as enhancing effort and productivity relative to
 non-contingent pay schemes. However, psychological research suggests that
 excessive rewards can, in some cases, result in a decline in performance.
 To test whether very high monetary rewards can decrease performance, we
 conducted a set of experiments in the U.S. and in India in which subjects
 worked on different tasks and received performance-contingent payments
 that varied in amount from small to very large relative to their typical
 levels of pay. With some important exceptions, very high reward levels had
 a detrimental effect on performance.  Copyright , Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Identifying Human-Capital Externalities: Theory with Applications 
Abstract:
 The identification of aggregate human-capital externalities is still not
 fully understood. The existing (Mincerian) approach confounds positive
 externalities with wage changes due to a downward sloping demand curve for
 human capital. As a result, the Mincerian approach yields positive
 externalities even when wages equal marginal social products. We propose
 an approach that identifies human-capital externalities, whether or not
 aggregate demand for human capital slopes downward. Another advantage of
 our approach is that it does not require estimates of the individual
 return to human capital. Applications to U.S. cities and states between
 1970 and 1990 yield no evidence of significant average-schooling
 externalities.  Copyright 2006, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Expectation Traps and Monetary Policy 
Abstract:
 Why is inflation persistently high in some periods and low in others? The
 reason may be the absence of commitment in monetary policy. In a standard
 model, absence of commitment leads to multiple equilibria, or expectation
 traps, even without trigger strategies. In these traps, expectations of
 high or low inflation lead the public to take defensive actions, which
 then make accommodating those expectations the optimal monetary policy.
 Under commitment, the equilibrium is unique and the inflation rate is low
 on average. This analysis suggests that institutions which promote
 commitment can prevent high inflation episodes from recurring.  Copyright 2003, Wiley-Blackwell.

 some citizens ignore their private information and abstain from voting, in
 deference to those with higher-quality signals. Even as the number of
 highly informed peers grows large, however, citizens with only moderate
 expertise continue voting, so that voter participation remains at
 realistic levels (e.g. 50 to 60 percent, for simple examples). The precise
 level of voter turnout, along with the margin of victory, are determined
 by the distribution of expertise. Improving a voter's information makes
 her more willing to vote, consistent with a growing body of empirical
 evidence, but makes her peers more willing to abstain, providing a new
 explanation for various empirical patterns of voting. Equilibrium
 participation is optimal, even though the marginal voter may have very
 little (e.g. below-average) expertise, and even though nonvoters'
 information is not utilized.  Copyright , Oxford University Press.

Title: Filtering Returns for Unspecified Biases in Priors when Testing Asset Pricing Theory 
Abstract:
 Procedures are presented that allow the empiricist to estimate and test
 asset pricing models on limited-liability securities without the
 assumption that the historical payoff distribution provides a consistent
 estimate of the market's prior beliefs. The procedures effectively filter
 return data for unspecified historical biases in the market's priors. They
 do not involve explicit estimation of the market's priors, and hence,
 economize on parameters. The procedures derive from a new but simple
 property of Bayesian learning, namely: if the correct likelihood is used,
 the inverse posterior at the true parameter value forms a martingale
 process relative to the learner's information filtration augmented with
 the true parameter value. Application of this central result to tests of
 asset pricing models requires a deliberate selection bias. Hence, as a
 by-product, the article establishes that biased samples contain
 information with which to falsify an asset pricing model or estimate its
 parameters. These include samples subject to, e.g. survivorship bias or
 Peso problems.  Copyright 2004, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: The Flat Rental Puzzle 
Abstract:
 Why is the price of renting an automobile "flat" as a function of its age
 or odometer value? Specifically, why is it that car rental companies do
 not offer customers the option of renting older cars at a discount,
 instead of offering only relatively new cars at full price? We also tackle
 a related puzzle: why do car rental companies trade-in their vehicles so
 early? Most US companies purchase brand new rental cars and replace them
 after 2 years or when their odometer exceeds 34,000 km. That is a very
 costly strategy due to the well-known by rapid depreciation in used car
 prices. We show that in a competitive rental market, prices are a
 declining function of odometer and cars are rented over their full
 economic lifespan. Our solution to these puzzles is that actual rental
 markets are not fully competitive and firms may be behaving suboptimally.
 We provide a case study of a large car rental company that provided us
 access to its operating data. We develop a model of the company's
 operations that predicts that the company can significantly increase its
 profits by keeping its rental cars twice as long as it currently does,
 discounting the rental prices of older vehicles to induce its customers to
 rent them. The company undertook an experiment to test our model's
 predictions. We report initial findings from this experiment which
 involved over 4500 rentals of over 500 cars in 4 locations over a 5-month
 period. The results are consistent with the predictions of our model, and
 suggest that a properly chosen declining rental price function can
 increase overall revenues. Profits also increase significantly, since
 doubling the holding period of rental cars cuts discounted replacement
 costs by nearly 40%.  Copyright , Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Tax Riots 
Abstract:
 This paper considers an optimal taxation environment where household
 income is private information, and the government randomly audits and
 punishes households found to be underreporting. We prove that the optimal
 mechanism derived using standard mechanism design techniques has a bad
 equilibrium (a tax riot) where households underreport their incomes,
 precisely because other households are expected to do so as well. We then
 consider three alternative approaches to designing a tax scheme when one
 is worried about bad equilibria.  Copyright 2008, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: An Efficient Multi-Unit Ascending Auction 
Abstract:
 We provide an ascending auction that yields an efficient outcome when
 there are many identical units for sale and bidders have interdependent
 values and downward-sloping demand. Our ascending auction both extends and
 generalizes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Ausubel's (2004)</xref> and
 yields the same outcome as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Perry and
 Reny's (2002)</xref> generalization of <xref ref-type="bibr"
 rid="R14">Vickrey's (1961)</xref> sealed-bid auction. There are two key
 features of our auction. Bidders are permitted both to express different
 demands against different bidders, as well as to increase their demands.
 The equilibrium strategies are closely related to the familiar "drop out
 when price equals value" strategy of the English auction.  Copyright 2005, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: When Does One Bad Apple Spoil the Barrel? An Evolutionary Analysis of Collective Action 
Abstract:
 This paper studies collective-action games in which the production of a
 public good requires teamwork. A leading example is a threshold game in
 which provision requires the voluntary participation of m out of n
 players. Quantal-response strategy revisions allow play to move between
 equilibria in which a team successfully provides, and an equilibrium in
 which the collective action fails. A full characterization of long-run
 play reveals the determinants of success; these include the correlation
 between players' costs of provision and their valuations for the good. The
 addition of an extra "bad apple" player can "spoil the barrel" by
 destabilizing successful teams and so offers a rationale for limiting the
 pool of possible contributors.  Copyright 2008, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Technology Shocks and Job Flows 
Abstract:
 We consider a version of the Solow growth model where technological
 progress can be investment specific or investment neutral. The labour
 market is subject to search frictions, and the existing productive units
 may fail to adopt the most recent technological advances. Technological
 progress can lead to the destruction of technologically obsolete jobs and
 cause unemployment. We calibrate the model to replicate the high
 persistence that characterizes the dynamics of firms' neutral technology
 and the frequency of firms' capital adjustment. We find that neutral
 technological advances increase job destruction and job reallocation and
 reduce aggregate employment. Investment-specific technological advances
 reduce job destruction, have mild effects on job creation, and are
 expansionary. Hence, neutral technological progress prompts Schumpeterian
 creative destruction, while investment-specific technological progress
 operates essentially as in the standard neoclassical growth model. Using
 structural VAR models, we provide support to the key dynamic implications
 of the model.  Copyright 2007, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: The Binarized Scoring Rule 
Abstract:
 We introduce a simple method for constructing a scoring rule to elicit an
 agent's belief about a random variable that is incentive compatible
 irrespective of her risk-preference. The agent receives a fixed prize when
 her prediction error, defined by a loss function specified in the
 incentive scheme, is smaller than an independently generated random number
 and earns a smaller prize otherwise. Adjusting the loss function according
 to the belief elicitation objective, the scoring rule can be used in a
 rich assortment of situations. Moreover, the scoring rule can be incentive
 compatible even when the agent is not an expected utility maximizer.
 Results from our probability elicitation experiments show that subjects'
 predictions are closer to the true probability under this scoring rule
 compared to the quadratic scoring rule.  Copyright 2013, Oxford University Press.

Title: Dynamic Mirrlees Taxation under Political Economy Constraints 
Abstract:
 We study the structure of non-linear taxes in a dynamic economy subject to
 political economy problems. In contrast to existing literature, taxes are
 set by a self-interested politician, without any commitment power, who is
 partly controlled by the citizens. We prove that: (1) a version of the
 revelation principle applies; and (2) the provision of incentives to
 politicians can be separated from the provision of incentives to
 individuals. Using these results, we provide conditions under which
 distortions created by political economy problems persist or disappear. We
 then extend these results to environments with partially benevolent
 governments and potential ex post conflict among the citizens.  Copyright , Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Dynamic Matching and Evolving Reputations 
Abstract:
 This paper introduces a general model of matching that includes evolving
 public Bayesian reputations and stochastic production. Despite productive
 complementarity, assortative matching robustly fails for high discount
 factors, unlike in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Becker (1973)</xref>.
 This failure holds around the highest (lowest) reputation agents for "high
 skill" ("low skill") technologies. We find that matches of likes
 eventually dissolve. In another life-cycle finding, young workers are paid
 less than their marginal product, and old workers more. Also, wages rise
 with tenure but need not reflect marginal products: information rents
 produce non-monotone and discontinuous wage profiles.  Copyright , Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Estimating Macroeconomic Models: A Likelihood Approach 
Abstract:
 This paper shows how particle filtering facilitates likelihood-based
 inference in dynamic macroeconomic models. The economies can be non-linear
 and/or non-normal. We describe how to use the output from the particle
 filter to estimate the structural parameters of the model, those
 characterizing preferences and technology, and to compare different
 economies. Both tasks can be implemented from either a classical or a
 Bayesian perspective. We illustrate the technique by estimating a business
 cycle model with investment-specific technological change, preference
 shocks, and stochastic volatility.  Copyright 2007, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Does Auctioning of Entry Licences Induce Collusion? An Experimental Study 
Abstract:
 We use experiments to examine whether the auctioning of entry rights
 affects the behaviour of market entrants. Standard economic arguments
 suggest that the licence fee paid at the auction will not affect pricing
 since it constitutes a sunk cost. This argument is not uncontested though,
 and this paper puts it to an experimental test. Our results indicate that
 an auction of entry licences has a significant positive effect on average
 prices in oligopoly but not in monopoly. These results are consistent with
 the conjecture that entry fees induce players to take more risk in pursuit
 of higher expected profits. In oligopoly, entry fees increase the
 probability that the market entrants coordinate on a collusive price path.
 In monopoly, taking more risk does not make sense since average prices are
 already close to the profit-maximizing price.  Copyright 2006, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Deep Habits 
Abstract:
 This paper generalizes the standard habit-formation model to an
 environment in which agents form habits over individual varieties of goods
 as opposed to over a composite consumption good. We refer to this
 preference specification as &#x201C;deep habit formation&#x201D;. Under
 deep habits, the demand function faced by individual producers depends on
 past sales. This feature is typically assumed ad hoc in customer-market
 and brand-switching-cost models. A central result of the paper is that
 deep habits give rise to countercyclical mark-ups, which is in line with
 the empirical evidence. This result is important, because ad hoc
 formulations of customer-market and switching-cost models have been
 criticized for implying procyclical and hence counterfactual mark-up
 movements. Under deep habits, consumption and wages respond procyclically
 to government-spending shocks. The paper provides econometric estimates of
 the parameters pertaining to the deep-habit model.  Copyright 2006, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Housing Market Dynamics: On the Contribution of Income Shocks and Credit Constraints<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN1">*</xref> 
Abstract:
 We propose a life-cycle model of the housing market with a property ladder
 and a credit constraint. We focus on equilibria that replicate the facts
 that credit constraints delay some households' first home purchase and
 force other households to buy a home smaller than they would like. The
 model helps us identify a powerful driver of the housing market: the
 ability of young households to afford the down payment on a starter home,
 and in particular their income. The model also highlights a channel
 whereby changes in income may yield housing price overreaction, with
 prices of trade-up homes displaying the most volatility, and a positive
 correlation between housing prices and transactions. This channel relies
 on the capital gains or losses on starter homes incurred by
 credit-constrained owners. We provide empirical support for our arguments
 with evidence from both the U.K. and the U.S.  Copyright 2006, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Verifying Competitive Equilibria in Dynamic Economies 
Abstract:
 In this paper, I examine &epsiv;-equilibria of stationary dynamic
 economies with heterogeneous agents and possibly incomplete financial
 markets. I give a simple example to show that even for arbitrarily small
 &epsiv; &gt; 0, allocation and prices can be far away from exact
 equilibrium allocations and prices. That is, errors in market clearing or
 individuals' optimality conditions do not provide enough information to
 assess the quality of an approximation. I derive a sufficient condition
 for an &epsiv;-equilibrium to be close to an exact equilibrium. If the
 economic fundamentals are semi-algebraic, one can verify computationally
 whether this condition holds. The condition can be interpreted
 economically as a robustness requirement on the set of &epsiv;-equilibria
 which form a neighbourhood of the computed approximation. I illustrate the
 main result and the computational method using an infinite horizon economy
 with overlapping generations and incomplete financial markets.  Copyright 2011, Oxford University Press.

Title: Living with Risk 
Abstract:
 Living with risk can lead to anticipatory feelings such as anxiety or
 hopefulness. Such feelings can affect the choice between lotteries that
 will be played out in the future&#x02014;choice may be motivated not only
 by the (static) risks involved but also by the desire to reduce anxiety or
 to promote savouring. This paper provides a model of preference in a
 three-period setting that is axiomatic and includes a role for
 anticipatory feelings. It is shown that the model of preference can
 accommodate intuitive patterns of demand for information such as
 information seeking when a favourable outcome is very likely and
 information aversion when it is more likely that the outcome will be
 unfavourable. Behavioural meaning is given to statements such as
 "individual 1 is anxious" and "2 is more anxious than 1". Finally, the
 model is differentiated sharply from the classic model due to Kreps and
 Porteus.  Copyright 2008, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: A Solution Concept for Majority Rule in Dynamic Settings 
Abstract:
 We define and explore the notion of a Dynamic Condorcet Winner (DCW),
 which extends the notion of a Condorcet winner to dynamic settings. We
 show that, for every DCW, every member of a large class of dynamic
 majoritarian games has an equivalent equilibrium, and that other
 equilibria are not similarly portable across this class of games.
 Existence of DCWs is guaranteed when members of the community are
 sufficiently patient. We characterize sustainable and unsustainable
 outcomes, study the effects of changes in the discount factor, investigate
 efficiency properties, and explore the potential for achieving
 renegotiation-proof outcomes. We apply this solution concept to a standard
 one-dimensional choice problem wherein agents have single-peaked
 preferences, as well as to one involving the division of a fixed aggregate
 pay-off.  Copyright , Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Limit Theorems for Estimating the Parameters of Differentiated Product Demand Systems 
Abstract:
 We provide an asymptotic distribution theory for a class of generalized
 method of moments estimators that arise in the study of differentiated
 product markets when the number of observations is associated with the
 number of products within a given market. We allow for three sources of
 error: sampling error in estimating market shares, simulation error in
 approximating the shares predicted by the model, and the underlying model
 error. It is shown that the estimators are CAN provided the size of the
 consumer sample and the number of simulation draws grow at a large enough
 rate relative to the number of products. We consider the implications of
 the results for the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Berry, Levinsohn and
 Pakes (1995)</xref> random coefficient logit model and the pure
 characteristics model analysed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Berry and
 Pakes (2002)</xref>. The required rates differ for these two frequently
 used demand models. A small Monte Carlo study shows that the differences
 in asymptotic properties of the two models are reflected, in quite a
 striking way, in the models' small sample properties. Moreover the limit
 distributions provide a good approximation to the actual Monte Carlo
 distribution of the parameter estimates. The results have important
 implications for the computational burden of the two models.  Copyright 2004, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Social Learning and Norms in a Public Goods Experiment with Inter-Generational Advice<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN1">-super-1</xref> 
Abstract:
 We study a linear public goods game using an inter-generational approach.
 Subjects in one generation leave advice for the succeeding generation via
 free-form messages. Such advice can be private knowledge (advice left by
 one player in generation t is given only to his or her immediate successor
 in generation t &#x002B; 1), public knowledge (advice left by players of
 generation t is made available to all members of generation t &#x002B; 1),
 and common knowledge (where the advice is not only public but is also read
 aloud by the experimenter). Common knowledge of advice generates a process
 of social learning that leads to high contributions and less free-riding.
 This behaviour is sustained by advice that is generally exhortative,
 suggesting high contributions, which in turn creates optimistic beliefs

Title: Collusion and Price Rigidity 
Abstract:
 We consider an infinitely repeated Bertrand game, in which prices are
 publicly observed and each firm receives a privately observed, i.i.d. cost
 shock in each period. We focus on symmetric perfect public equilibria,
 wherein any "punishments" are borne equally by all firms. We identify a
 tradeoff that is associated with collusive pricing schemes in which the
 price to be charged by each firm is strictly increasing in its cost level:
 such "fully sorting" schemes offer efficiency benefits, as they ensure
 that the lowest-cost firm makes the current sale, but they also imply an
 informational cost (distorted pricing and/or equilibrium-path price wars),
 since a higher-cost firm must be deterred from mimicking a lower-cost firm
 by charging a lower price. A rigid-pricing scheme, where a firm's
 collusive price is independent of its current cost position, sacrifices
 efficiency benefits but also diminishes the informational cost. For a wide
 range of settings, the optimal symmetric collusive scheme requires (i) the
 absence of equilibrium-path price wars and (ii) a rigid price. If firms
 are sufficiently impatient, however, the rigid-pricing scheme cannot be
 enforced, and the collusive price of lower-cost firms may be distorted
 downward in order to diminish the incentive to cheat. When the model is
 modified to include i.i.d. public demand shocks, the downward pricing
 distortion that accompanies a firm's lower-cost realization may occur only
 when current demand is high.  Copyright 2004, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: On the Origins of Property Rights: Conflict and Productionin the State of Nature 
Abstract:
 I analyse the emergence of property rights in a model of conflict and
 production in the absence of institutions of enforcement. The population
 of agents evolves dynamically through conflicts for possession of factor
 goods among pairs of randomly matched agents. Conflicts are incomplete
 information wars of attrition with an agent's type consisting of his or
 her independently drawn valuation of the prize and cost of competing for
 it. I prove equilibrium existence and show that in the steady state of the
 game, the population sorts into two stable groups (resource
 &#x201C;haves&#x201D; and &#x201C;have-nots&#x201D;) in accordance with a
 known function of their primitive types.  Copyright 2006, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Microstructure Noise, Realized Variance, and Optimal Sampling 
Abstract:
 A recent and extensive literature has pioneered the summing of squared
 observed intra-daily returns, "realized variance", to estimate the daily
 integrated variance of financial asset prices, a traditional object of
 economic interest. We show that, in the presence of market microstructure
 noise, realized variance does not identify the daily integrated variance
 of the frictionless equilibrium price. However, we demonstrate that the
 noise-induced bias at very high sampling frequencies can be appropriately
 traded off with the variance reduction obtained by high-frequency sampling
 and derive a mean-squared-error (MSE) optimal sampling theory for the
 purpose of integrated variance estimation. We show how our theory
 naturally leads to an identification procedure, which allows us to recover
 the moments of the unobserved noise; this procedure may be useful in other
 applications. Finally, using the profits obtained by option traders on the
 basis of alternative variance forecasts as our economic metric, we find
 that explicit optimization of realized variance's finite sample MSE
 properties results in accurate forecasts and considerable economic gains.  Copyright 2008, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Firm Location and the Creation and Utilization of Human Capital 
Abstract:
 This paper presents a theory of location choice that draws on insights
 from the incomplete contracts and investment flexibility (real option)
 literatures. Our analysis indicates that the choice of locating within
 rather than away from industry clusters is influenced by the extent to
 which training costs are borne by firms versus employees. In addition, the
 uncertainty about future productivity shocks and the ability of firms to
 modify the scale of their operations also influence location choice. In
 particular, we show that locating in clusters is preferred when training
 costs are borne by workers and when firm-specific productivity shocks can
 potentially be large. However, there is an incentive for firms to choose
 isolated locations when significant training costs are borne by firms.  Copyright 2007, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Uncertainty and Consumer Durables Adjustment 
Abstract:
 We characterize infrequent durables stock adjustment by consumers who also
 derive utility from non-durable consumption flows in the presence of
 idiosyncratic income uncertainty. The data we analyse include subjective
 future income uncertainty measures, which we use as instruments in the
 estimation of relevant parameters of heterogeneous consumers' dynamic
 adjustment problems. The data feature two conceptually distinct sources of
 variation: cross-sectional heterogeneity of the sampled households'
 dynamic problems, and history-dependent heterogeneity in their situation
 during the observation period. We note that the latter should affect the
 likelihood but not the size of stock adjustment decisions, and find broad
 support for theoretical predictions in formal selection-controlled
 regressions based on this insight.  Copyright 2005, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Investment Cycles and Sovereign Debt Overhang 
Abstract:
 We characterize optimal taxation of foreign capital and optimal sovereign
 debt policy in a small open economy where the government cannot commit to
 policy, seeks to insure a risk-averse domestic constituency, and is more
 impatient than the market. Optimal policy generates long-run cycles in
 both sovereign debt and foreign direct investment in an environment in
 which the first best capital stock is a constant. The expected tax on
 capital endogenously varies with the state of the economy, and investment
 is distorted by more in recessions than in booms, amplifying the effect of
 shocks. The government's lack of commitment induces a negative correlation
 between investment and the stock of government debt, a "debt overhang"
 effect. Debt relief is never Pareto improving and cannot affect the
 long-run level of investment. Furthermore, restricting the government to a
 balanced budget can eliminate the cyclical distortion of investment.  Copyright , Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Leaning Against the Wind 
Abstract:
 During financial disruptions, market makers provide liquidity by absorbing
 external selling pressure. They buy when the pressure is large, accumulate
 inventories, and sell when the pressure alleviates. This paper studies
 optimal dynamic liquidity provision in a theoretical market setting with
 large and temporary selling pressure and order-execution delays. I show
 that competitive market makers offer the socially optimal amount of
 liquidity, provided they have access to sufficient capital. If raising
 capital is costly, this suggests a policy role for lenient central bank
 lending during financial disruptions.  Copyright 2007, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Is Grameen Lending Efficient? Repayment Incentives and Insurance in Village Economies 
Abstract:
 Many believe that a key innovation by the Grameen Bank is to encourage
 borrowers to help each other in hard times. To analyse this, we study a
 mechanism design problem where borrowers share information about each
 other, but their limited side contracting ability prevents them from
 writing complete insurance contracts. We derive a lending mechanism which
 efficiently induces mutual insurance. It is necessary for borrowers to
 submit reports about each other to achieve efficiency. Such
 cross-reporting increases the bargaining power of unsuccessful borrowers,
 and is robust to collusion against the bank.  Copyright 2004, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Constrained Indirect Estimation 
Abstract:
 We develop generalized indirect estimation procedures that handle equality
 and inequality constraints on the auxiliary model parameters by extracting
 information from the relevant multipliers, and compare their asymptotic
 efficiency to maximum likelihood. We also show that, regardless of the
 validity of the restrictions, the asymptotic efficiency of such estimators
 can never decrease by explicitly considering the multipliers associated
 with additional equality constraints. Furthermore, we discuss the variety
 of effects on efficiency that can result from imposing constraints on a
 previously unrestricted model. As an example, we consider a stochastic
 volatility process estimated through a <sc>garch</sc> model with Gaussian
 or t distributed errors.  Copyright 2004, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Simulated Non-Parametric Estimation of Dynamic Models 
Abstract:
 This paper introduces a new class of parameter estimators for dynamic
 models, called simulated non-parametric estimators (SNEs). The SNE
 minimizes appropriate distances between non-parametric conditional (or
 joint) densities estimated from sample data and non-parametric conditional
 (or joint) densities estimated from data simulated out of the model of
 interest. Sample data and model-simulated data are smoothed with the same
 kernel, which considerably simplifies bandwidth selection for the purpose
 of implementing the estimator. Furthermore, the SNE displays the same
 asymptotic efficiency properties as the maximum-likelihood estimator as
 soon as the model is Markov in the observable variables. The methods
 introduced in this paper are fairly simple to implement, and possess
 finite sample properties that are well approximated by the asymptotic
 theory. We illustrate these features within typical estimation problems
 that arise in financial economics.  Copyright , Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: R&D and Productivity: Estimating Endogenous Productivity 
Abstract:
 We develop a model of endogenous productivity change to examine the impact
 of the investment in knowledge on the productivity of firms. Our dynamic
 investment model extends the tradition of the knowledge capital model of
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">Griliches (1979)</xref> that has remained
 a cornerstone of the productivity literature. Rather than constructing a
 stock of knowledge capital from a firm's observed R&D expenditures, we
 consider productivity to be unobservable to the econometrician. Our
 approach accounts for uncertainty, non-linearity, and heterogeneity across
 firms in the link between R&D and productivity. We also derive a novel
 estimator for production functions in this setting. Using an unbalanced
 panel of more than 1800 Spanish manufacturing firms in nine industries
 during the 1990s, we provide evidence of non-linearities as well as
 economically significant uncertainties in the R&D process. R&D
 expenditures play a key role in determining the differences in
 productivity across firms and the evolution of firm-level productivity
 over time.  Copyright 2013, Oxford University Press.

Title: The Optimal Inflation Rate in New Keynesian Models: Should Central Banks Raise Their Inflation Targets in Light of the Zero Lower Bound? 
Abstract:
 We study the effects of positive steady-state inflation in New Keynesian
 models subject to the zero bound on interest rates. We derive the
 utility-based welfare loss function taking into account the effects of
 positive steady-state inflation and solve for the optimal level of
 inflation in the model. For plausible calibrations with costly but
 infrequent episodes at the zero lower bound, the optimal inflation rate is
 low, typically <2% even after considering a variety of extensions,
 including optimal stabilization policy, price indexation, endogenous and
 state-dependent price stickiness, capital formation, model uncertainty,
 and downward nominal wage rigidities. On the normative side, price-level
 targeting delivers large welfare gains and a very low optimal inflation
 rate consistent with price stability. These results suggest that raising
 the inflation target is too blunt an instrument to efficiently reduce the
 severe costs of zero bound episodes.  Copyright , Oxford University Press.

Title: Bandwagons and Momentum in Sequential Voting 
Abstract:
 In this paper I show that an equilibrium exists to the sequential voting
 game in which a bandwagon begins with probability 1. These bandwagons are
 driven by a combination of beliefs and the desire of voters to vote for
 the winning candidate. Significantly, in this equilibrium the pivot
 probability for each voter is non-zero, even in an infinite population.
 Consequently, the bandwagons do not always start after one (or at most
 two) favourable decisions (as do economic cascades) and varying levels of
 informative voting are observed, consistent with observations from
 sequential voting in U.S. presidential primaries. Further, voters are
 exposed to counterintuitive incentives, referred to as &#x201C;buyers'
 remorse&#x201D;, that have been attributed to real primary voters.I also
 derive equilibrium behaviour in this environment when voting is
 simultaneous and compare the quality of information aggregation within
 each mechanism. I relate the conclusions to U.S. presidential primaries
 and find they are consistent with a common conclusion about the
 front-loading of the primary process: that in tight elections (with no
 front-runner) simultaneous voting is preferred, whereas in lopsided
 elections sequential voting is preferred. The superior performance of
 sequential voting in lopsided races is precisely because bandwagons occur.  Copyright 2007, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Insurance and Taxation over the Life Cycle 
Abstract:
 We consider a dynamic Mirrlees economy in a life-cycle context and study
 the optimal insurance arrangement. Individual productivity evolves as a
 Markov process and is private information. We use a first-order approach
 in discrete and continuous time and obtain novel theoretical and numerical
 results. Our main contribution is a formula describing the dynamics for
 the labour-income tax rate. When productivity is an AR(1) our formula
 resembles an AR(1) with a trend where: (i) the auto-regressive coefficient
 equals that of productivity; (ii) the trend term equals the covariance
 productivity with consumption growth divided by the Frisch elasticity of
 labour; and (iii) the innovations in the tax rate are the negative of
 consumption growth. The last property implies a form of short-run
 regressivity. Our simulations illustrate these results and deliver some
 novel insights. The average labour tax rises from 0% to 37% over 40 years,
 whereas the average tax on savings falls from 12% to 0% at retirement. We
 compare the second best solution to simple history-independent tax
 systems, calibrated to mimic these average tax rates. We find that
 age-dependent taxes capture a sizable fraction of the welfare gains. In
 this way, our theoretical results provide insights into simple tax
 systems.  Copyright 2013, Oxford University Press.

Title: Relational Incentives and Moral Hazard in Teams 
Abstract:
 This paper studies moral hazard in teams using a model where efforts are
 promoted via the combination of profit shares and relational contracts.
 The focus is on how these two forms of incentives interact. According to
 the degree of effort observability and the importance of future
 interaction, the optimal allocation of profit shares can range from a wide
 dispersion across players to a full concentration of shares in the hands
 of a single player. When shares are sufficiently concentrated, the
 corresponding residual claimant can also adopt the role of administering
 all relational contracts, therefore serving as an endogenously chosen
 principal.  Copyright 2007, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Inequality in Landownership, the Emergence of Human-Capital Promoting Institutions, and the Great Divergence 
Abstract:
 This paper suggests that inequality in the distribution of landownership
 adversely affected the emergence of human-capital promoting institutions
 (e.g. public schooling), and thus the pace and the nature of the
 transition from an agricultural to an industrial economy, contributing to
 the emergence of the great divergence in income per capita across
 countries. The prediction of the theory regarding the adverse effect of
 the concentration of landownership on education expenditure is established
 empirically based on evidence from the beginning of the 20th century in
 the U.S.  Copyright , Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Cooperation with Network Monitoring 
Abstract:
 This paper studies the maximum level of cooperation that can be sustained
 in perfect Bayesian equilibrium in repeated games with network monitoring,
 where players observe each other's actions either perfectly or not at all.
 The foundational result is that the maximum level of cooperation can be
 robustly sustained in grim trigger strategies. If players are equally well
 monitored, comparative statics on the maximum level of cooperation are
 highly tractable and depend on the monitoring technology only through a
 simple statistic, its effective contagiousness. Typically, cooperation in
 the provision of pure public goods is greater in larger groups, while
 cooperation in the provision of divisible public goods is greater in
 smaller groups, and making monitoring less uncertain in the second-order
 stochastic dominance sense increases cooperation. For fixed monitoring
 networks, a new notion of network centrality is developed, which
 determines which players cooperate more in a given network, as well as
 which networks support greater cooperation.  Copyright , Oxford University Press.

Title: The Economic Returns to Social Interaction: Experimental Evidence from Microfinance 
Abstract:
 Microfinance clients were randomly assigned to repayment groups that met
 either weekly or monthly during their first loan cycle, and then graduated
 to identical meeting frequency for their second loan. Long-run survey data
 and a follow-up public goods experiment reveal that clients initially
 assigned to weekly groups interact more often and exhibit a higher
 willingness to pool risk with group members from their first loan cycle
 nearly 2 years after the experiment. They were also three times less
 likely to default on their second loan. Evidence from an additional
 treatment arm shows that, holding meeting frequency fixed, the pattern is
 insensitive to repayment frequency during the first loan cycle. Taken
 together, these findings constitute the first experimental evidence on the
 economic returns to social interaction, and provide an alternative
 explanation for the success of the group lending model in reducing default
 risk.  Copyright 2013, Oxford University Press.

Title: Knowing What Others Know: Coordination Motives in Information Acquisition 
Abstract:
 We explore how optimal information choices change the predictions of
 strategic models. When a large number of agents play a game with strategic
 complementarity, information choices exhibit complementarity as well: if
 an agent wants to do what others do, they want to know what others know.
 This makes heterogeneous beliefs difficult to sustain and may generate
 multiple equilibria. In models with substitutability, agents prefer to
 differentiate their information choices. We use these theoretical results
 to examine the role of information choice in recent price-setting models
 and to propose modelling techniques that ensure equilibrium uniqueness.  Copyright , Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Labour Market Structure and Inequality: A Comparison of Italy and the U.S. 
Abstract:
 Markets with rigid labour regulations and centralized wage setting are
 often thought to be inefficient but egalitarian. Using a model of off- and
 on-the-job search and event-history, individual-level data for Italy and
 the U.S., we show that while the cross-sectional wage distributions of
 young Italian males are much more compressed than are the comparable
 distributions for young white U.S. males, the estimated search model
 implies that the distribution of lifetime welfare is no more disperse in
 the U.S. than it is in Italy. Our model implies that the high frequency of
 movements between labour market states leads to both a relatively
 equitable distribution of "long run" welfare in the U.S. and a high level
 of cross-sectional inequality.  Copyright 2002, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Individual Learning and Cooperation in Noisy Repeated Games 
Abstract:
 We investigate whether two players in a long-run relationship can maintain
 cooperation when the details of the underlying game are unknown.
 Specifically, we consider a new class of repeated games with private
 monitoring, where an unobservable state of the world influences the payoff
 functions and/or the monitoring structure. Each player privately learns
 the state over time but cannot observe what the opponent learned. We show
 that there are robust equilibria in which players eventually obtain
 payoffs as if the true state were common knowledge and players played a
 "belief-free" equilibrium. We also provide explicit equilibrium
 constructions in various economic examples.  Copyright 2014, Oxford University Press.

Title: Welfare Measurement and Measurement Error 
Abstract:
 The approximate effects of measurement error on a variety of measures of
 inequality and poverty are derived. They are shown to depend on the
 measurement error variance and functionals of the error-contaminated
 income distribution, but not on the form of the measurement error
 distribution, and to be accurate within a rich class of error-free income
 distributions and measurement error distributions. The functionals of the
 error-contaminated income distribution that approximate the measurement
 error induced distortions can be estimated. So it is possible to
 investigate the sensitivity of welfare measures to alternative amounts of
 measurement error and, when an estimate of the measurement error variance
 is available, to calculate corrected welfare measures. The methods are
 illustrated in an application using Indonesian household expenditure data.  Copyright 2002, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Media Bias and Influence: Evidence from Newspaper Endorsements 
Abstract:
 This paper investigates the relationship between media bias and the
 influence of the media on voting in the context of newspaper endorsements.
 We first develop a simple econometric model in which voters choose
 candidates under uncertainty and rely on endorsements from better informed
 sources. Newspapers are potentially biased in favour of one of the
 candidates and voters thus rationally account for the credibility of any
 endorsements. Our primary empirical finding is that endorsements are
 influential in the sense that voters are more likely to support the
 recommended candidate after publication of the endorsement. The degree of
 this influence, however, depends upon the credibility of the endorsement.
 In this way, endorsements for the Democratic candidate from left-leaning
 newspapers are less influential than are endorsements from neutral or
 right-leaning newspapers and likewise for endorsements for the Republican.
 We also find that endorsements are more influential among moderate voters
 and those more likely to be exposed to the endorsement. In sum, these
 findings suggest that voters do rely on the media for information during
 campaigns but that the extent of this reliance depends upon the degree and
 direction of any bias.  Copyright 2011, Oxford University Press.

Title: The Proximity-Concentration Tradeoff under Uncertainty 
Abstract:
 In this article, we analyse the firm's choice between serving a foreign
 market through exports or through foreign affiliate sales in an
 environment characterized by country-specific shocks to the cost of
 production. Our model predicts that country pairs with less-correlated
 output fluctuations trade more, relative to affiliate sales, whereas
 countries with more-volatile fluctuations are served relatively more by
 exporters than by foreign affiliates selling abroad. Using detailed data
 on trade and affiliate sales, we find empirical support for our model's
 predictions.  Copyright 2013, Oxford University Press.

Title: The Burden of Knowledge and the "Death of the Renaissance Man": Is Innovation Getting Harder? 
Abstract:
 This paper investigates a possibly fundamental aspect of technological
 progress. If knowledge accumulates as technology advances, then successive
 generations of innovators may face an increasing educational burden.
 Innovators can compensate through lengthening educational phases and
 narrowing expertise, but these responses come at the cost of reducing
 individual innovative capacities, with implications for the organization
 of innovative activity&#x02014;a greater reliance on teamwork&#x02014;and
 negative implications for growth. Building on this "burden of knowledge"
 mechanism, this paper first presents six facts about innovator behaviour.
 I show that age at first invention, specialization, and teamwork increase
 over time in a large micro-data set of inventors. Furthermore, in
 cross-section, specialization and teamwork appear greater in deeper areas
 of knowledge, while, surprisingly, age at first invention shows little
 variation across fields. A model then demonstrates how these facts can
 emerge in tandem. The theory further develops explicit implications for
 economic growth, providing an explanation for why productivity growth
 rates did not accelerate through the 20th century despite an enormous
 expansion in collective research effort. Upward trends in academic
 collaboration and lengthening doctorates, which have been noted in other
 research, can also be explained in this framework. The knowledge burden
 mechanism suggests that the nature of innovation is changing, with
 negative implications for long-run economic growth.  Copyright , Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: International Trade and Labour Income Risk in the U.S. 
Abstract:
 This article studies empirically the links between international trade and
 labour income risk faced by manufacturing sector workers in the U.S. We
 use longitudinal data on workers to estimate time-varying individual
 income risk at the industry level. We then combine our estimates of
 persistent labour income risk with measures of exposure to international
 trade to analyse the relationship between trade and labour income risk. We
 also study risk estimates from various subsamples of workers, such as
 those who switched to a different manufacturing industry (or out of the
 manufacturing sector altogether). Finally, we use these estimates to
 conduct a welfare analysis evaluating the benefits or costs of trade
 through the income risk channel. We find import penetration to have a
 statistically significant association with labour income risk in the U.S.
 Our welfare calculations suggest that these effects are economically
 significant.  Copyright 2014, Oxford University Press.

Title: Coalition Formation in Non-Democracies 
Abstract:
 We study the formation of a ruling coalition in non-democratic societies
 where institutions do not enable political commitments. Each individual is
 endowed with a level of political power. The ruling coalition consists of
 a subset of the individuals in the society and decides the distribution of
 resources. A ruling coalition needs to contain enough powerful members to
 win against any alternative coalition that may challenge it, and it needs
 to be self-enforcing, in the sense that none of its subcoalitions should
 be able to secede and become the new ruling coalition. We present both an
 axiomatic approach that captures these notions and determines a
 (generically) unique ruling coalition and the analysis of a dynamic game
 of coalition formation that encompasses these ideas. We establish that the
 subgame-perfect equilibria of the coalition formation game coincide with
 the set of ruling coalitions resulting from the axiomatic approach. A key
 insight of our analysis is that a coalition is made self-enforcing by the
 failure of its winning subcoalitions to be self-enforcing. This is most
 simply illustrated by the following example: with "majority rule",
 two-person coalitions are generically not self-enforcing and consequently,
 three-person coalitions are self-enforcing (unless one player is
 disproportionately powerful). We also characterize the structure of ruling
 coalitions. For example, we determine the conditions under which ruling
 coalitions are robust to small changes in the distribution of power and
 when they are fragile. We also show that when the distribution of power
 across individuals is relatively equal and there is majoritarian voting,
 only certain sizes of coalitions (e.g. with majority rule, coalitions of
 size 1, 3, 7, 15, etc.) can be the ruling coalition.  Copyright 2008, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Beyond Icebergs: Towards a Theory of Biased Globalization 
Abstract:
 In contrast to domestic trade, international trade inherently requires
 more intensive use of skilled labour with expertise in areas such as
 international business, language skills, and maritime insurance, and the
 transoceanic transportation is more capital intensive than the local
 transportation. In the presence of such bias in factor demands,
 globalization caused by an improvement in the export technologies can lead
 to a worldwide increase in the relative prices of the factors used
 intensively in international trade. Furthermore, a worldwide increase in
 the factors used intensively in international trade can lead to
 globalization. To capture these effects, we develop a flexible approach to
 model costly international trade, which includes the standard iceberg
 approach as a special case. More specifically, we extend the Ricardian
 model of trade with a continuum of goods by introducing multiple factors
 of production and by making technologies of supplying goods depend on
 whether the destination is home or abroad. If the technologies of
 supplying the same good to the two destinations differ only in total
 factor productivity, the model becomes isomorphic to the Ricardian model
 with the iceberg cost. By allowing the two technologies to differ in the
 factor intensities, our approach enables us to examine the links between
 factor endowments, factor prices, and globalization that cannot be
 captured by the iceberg approach.  Copyright 2007, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Special Interests and Technological Change 
Abstract:
 We study an OLG economy where productivity growth comes from two
 alternative sources: process innovation and learning-by-doing. There is a
 trade-off between the two in so far as frequent technological updates
 reduce the scope for learning on existing technologies. A conflict is
 shown to arise between the young and the old, because the former favour
 innovation while the latter prefer learning. We model the interaction
 between overlapping generations and policy makers as a dynamic common
 agency problem, where competing generations invest a certain amount of
 resources to lobby either for the maintenance of the current technology or
 the adoption of a new one. By focusing on truthful Markov perfect
 equilibria, we characterize the political equilibrium and show its
 dependence on the underlying demographic, technological and preference
 parameters.  Copyright 2005, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Coalition Formation with Binding Agreements 
Abstract:
 We study coalition formation in &#x201C;real time&#x201D;, a situation in
 which coalition formation is intertwined with the ongoing receipt of
 pay-offs. Agreements are assumed to be permanently binding: They can only
 be altered with the full consent of existing signatories. For
 characteristic function games we prove that equilibrium
 processes&#x2014;whether or not these are history dependent&#x2014;must
 converge to efficient absorbing states. For three-player games with
 externalities each player has enough veto power that a general efficiency
 result can be established. However, there exist four-player games in which
 all Markov equilibria are inefficient from every initial condition,
 despite the ability to write permanently binding agreements.  Copyright 2007, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: The Market for Quacks 
Abstract:
 A group of n "quacks" plays a price-competition game, facing
 a continuum of "patients" who recover with probability
 &#x03B1;, whether they acquire a quack's "treatment". If
 patients chose rationally, the market would be inactive. I assume,
 however, that patients choose according to a boundedly rational procedure,
 which reflects "anecdotal" reasoning. This element of
 bounded rationality has significant implications. The market for quacks is
 active, and patients suffer a welfare loss which behaves non-monotonically
 w.r.t. n and &#x03B1;. In an extended model that endogenizes the quacks'
 choice of "treatments", the quacks minimize the force of
 price competition by offering maximally differentiated treatments. The
 patients' welfare loss is robust to market interventions, which would
 crowd out low-quality firms in standard models. Thus, as long as the
 patients' quality of reasoning is not lifted above the anecdotal level,
 ordinary competition policies may be ineffective.  Copyright 2006, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Equilibrium in Justifiable Strategies: A Model of Reason-based Choice in Extensive-form Games 
Abstract:
 I explore the idea that people care about the justifiability of their
 decisions in the context of two-person extensive games. Each player
 justifies his strategy s with a belief b of the opponent's strategy which
 is consistent with the play path and maximally plausible (according to
 some exogenous criterion). We say that s is justifiable if against the ex
 post criticism that some other strategy s&#x2032; outperforms s against b,
 the player can argue that playing s&#x2032; would have exposed him to
 similar criticism in the opposite direction. Under a simplicity-based
 plausibility criterion, this concept implies systematic departures from
 maximizing behaviour in familiar games.  Copyright 2002, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Higher Order Risk Attitudes, Demographics, and Financial Decisions 
Abstract:
 We study the prevalence of the higher order risk attitudes of prudence and
 temperance in an experiment with a large demographically representative
 sample of participants. Under expected utility, prudence and temperance
 are defined by a convex first, and concave second, derivative of the
 utility function, and have direct implications for saving behaviour and
 portfolio choice. In the experiment, participants make pairwise choices
 that distinguish prudent from imprudent, and temperate from intemperate,
 behaviour. We correlate individuals' risk aversion, prudence, and
 temperance levels to their demographic profiles and their financial
 decisions outside the experiment. We observe that the majority of
 individuals' decisions are consistent with risk aversion, prudence, and
 temperance. Prudence is positively correlated with saving, as predicted by
 precautionary saving theory. Temperance is negatively correlated with the
 riskiness of portfolio choices.  Copyright 2014, Oxford University Press.

Title: Measurement Error Models with Auxiliary Data 
Abstract:
 We study the problem of parameter inference in (possibly non-linear and
 non-smooth) econometric models when the data are measured with error. We
 allow for arbitrary correlation between the true variables and the
 measurement errors. To solve the identification problem, we require the
 existence of an auxiliary data-set that contains information about the
 conditional distribution of the true variables given the mismeasured
 variables. Our main assumption requires that the conditional distribution
 of the true variables given the mismeasured variables is the same in the
 primary and auxiliary data. Our methods allow the auxiliary data to be a
 validation sample, where the primary and validation data are from the same
 distribution, and more importantly, a stratified sample where the
 auxiliary data-set is not from the same distribution as the primary data.
 We also show how to combine the two data-sets to obtain a more efficient
 estimator of the parameter of interest. We establish the large sample
 properties of the sieve based estimators under verifiable conditions. In
 particular, we allow for the mismeasured variables to have unbounded
 supports without employing the tedious trimming scheme typically used in
 kernel based methods. We illustrate our methods by estimating a returns to
 schooling censored quantile regression using the CPS/SSR 1978 exact match
 files where the dependent variable is measured with error of arbitrary
 kind.  Copyright 2005, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Peer Effects in Science: Evidence from the Dismissal of Scientists in Nazi Germany 
Abstract:
 This paper analyses peer effects among university scientists.
 Specifically, it investigates whether the quality and the number of peers
 affect the productivity of researchers in physics, chemistry, and
 mathematics. The usual endogeneity problems related to estimating peer
 effects are addressed by using the dismissal of scientists by the Nazi
 government in 1933 as a source of exogenous variation in the peer group of
 scientists staying in Germany. To investigate localized peer effects, I
 construct a new panel data set covering the universe of scientists at the
 German universities from 1925 to 1938 from historical sources. I find no
 evidence for peer effects at the local level. Even very high-quality
 scientists do not affect the productivity of their local peers.  Copyright 2012, Oxford University Press.

Title: Pride and Prejudice: Using Ethnic-Sounding Names and Inter-Ethnic Marriages to Identify Labour Market Discrimination 
Abstract:
 Do labour markets discriminate against workers with particular
 ethnic-sounding names? We use non-random sorting into inter-ethnic
 marriage and salient differences between Sephardic and Ashkenazi surnames
 to evaluate the causal impact of Sephardic affiliation on wages. Using the
 1995 Israeli Census, we estimate the effect of a Sephardic sounding
 surname on wages. We first compare the wages of Israeli Jewish males born
 to Sephardic fathers and Ashkenazi mothers (SA), who are more likely to
 carry a Sephardic surname, with the wages of Israeli Jewish males born to
 Ashkenazi fathers and Sephardic mothers (AS). We find that Israeli labour
 markets discriminate based on perceived ethnicity: SA workers earn
 significantly less than their AS counterparts. We then exploit the custom
 of women to adopt their husbands' surnames to disentangle actual ethnicity
 from the ethnicity perceived by the market. Consistent with ethnic
 discrimination based on surnames, we find that it is father-in-law's
 ethnicity--rather than father's ethnicity--that shapes female wage rates.
 Finally, we find that labour markets discriminate based on surname only
 when those names provide additional information about ethnicity. When
 ethnicity can be discerned from skin tone, surnames do not provide
 additional explanatory power with respect to wages.  Copyright 2014, Oxford University Press.

Title: Words, Deeds, and Lies: Strategic Behaviour in Games with Multiple Signals 
Abstract:
 We report the results of an experiment in which subjects play games
 against changing opponents. In one treatment, &#x201C;senders&#x201D; send
 &#x201C;receivers&#x201D; messages indicating intended actions in that
 round, and receivers observe senders' previous-round actions (when matched
 with another receiver). In another treatment, the receiver additionally
 observes the sender's previous-round message to the previous opponent,
 enabling him to determine whether the sender had lied. We find that
 allowing multiple signals leads to better outcomes when signals are
 aligned (all pointing to the same action), but worse outcomes when signals
 are crossed. Also, senders' signals tend to be truthful, though the degree
 of truthfulness depends on the game and treatment, and receivers'
 behaviour combines elements of pay-off maximization and reciprocity.  Copyright 2006, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Dynamic Seemingly Unrelated Cointegrating Regressions 
Abstract:
 We propose the parametric Dynamic Seemingly Unrelated Regression (DSUR)
 estimator for simultaneous estimation of multiple cointegrating
 regressions. DSUR is efficient when the equilibrium errors are correlated
 across equations and is applicable for panel cointegration estimation in
 environments where the cross section is small relative to the available
 time series. We study the asymptotic and small sample properties of the
 DSUR estimator for both heterogeneous and homogeneous cointegrating
 vectors. We then apply the method to analyse two long-standing problems in
 international economics. Our first application revisits the estimation of

Title: The Long and Short (of) Quality Ladders 
Abstract:
 Prices are typically used as proxies for countries' export quality. I
 relax this strong assumption by exploiting both price and quantity
 information to estimate the quality of products exported to the United
 States. Higher quality is assigned to products with higher market shares
 conditional on price. The estimated qualities reveal substantial
 heterogeneity in product markets' scope for quality differentiation, or
 their "quality ladders". I use this variation to explain the heterogeneous
 impact of low-wage competition on US manufacturing employment and output.
 Markets characterized by relatively short quality ladders are associated
 with larger employment and output declines resulting from low-wage
 competition.  Copyright , Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: The Cost of Recessions Revisited: A Reverse-Liquidationist View 
Abstract:
 The observation that liquidations are concentrated in recessions has long
 been the subject of controversy. One view holds that liquidations are
 beneficial in that they result in increased restructuring. Another view
 holds that this rise in restructuring is costly since liquidations are
 privately inefficient and essentially wasteful. This paper proposes an
 alternative perspective. On the basis of a combination of theory with
 empirical evidence on gross job flows and on financial and labour market
 rents, we find that, cumulatively, recessions result in reduced rather
 than increased restructuring, and that this is likely to be socially
 costly once we consider inefficiencies on both the creation and
 destruction margins.  Copyright 2005, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Endogenous Debt Constraints in Lifecycle Economies 
Abstract:
 We characterize competitive equilibria with perfect foresight in a
 deterministic, three-period pure-exchange overlapping generations economy
 with perfect information and no commitment to loan contracts. Commitment
 is replaced by an enforcement mechanism that excludes defaulters from
 asset markets for one period. For hump-shaped endowment profiles, young
 individuals face endogenous debt constraints that ration current
 consumption. Changes in current and future yields affect these
 constraints, inducing an additional income effect on rationed household
 demand that makes current and future consumption complements. This
 mechanism can lead to multiple steady states, persistent indeterminacy and
 regime switching. We show that sensitivity to shocks and complex dynamic
 behaviour are consistent with endogenous debt limits but not with
 exogenous liquidity constraints.  Copyright 2003, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Private Information, Wage Bargaining and Employment Fluctuations 
Abstract:
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Shimer (2005)</xref> pointed out that
 although we have a satisfactory theory of why some workers are unemployed
 at any given time, we don't know why the number of unemployed workers
 varies so much over time. The basic Mortensen--Pissarides model does not
 generate nearly enough volatility in unemployment for plausible parameter
 values. This paper extends the Mortensen--Pissarides model to allow for
 informational rents. Productivity is subject to publicly observed
 aggregate shocks, and to idiosyncratic shocks that are seen only by the
 employer. It is shown that there is a unique equilibrium, provided that
 the idiosyncratic shocks are not too large. The main result is that small
 fluctuations in productivity that are privately observed by employers can
 give rise to a kind of wage stickiness in equilibrium, and the
 informational rents associated with this stickiness are sufficient to
 generate relatively large unemployment fluctuations.  Copyright , Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Should Day Care be Subsidized? 
Abstract:
 In an economy with distortionary taxes on labour, can subsidies on day
 care, financed by increased taxes, raise welfare by encouraging women with
 small children to work? We show, within a stylized life-cycle framework,
 that the Ramsey optimal policy consists in equalizing consumption/leisure
 wedges over the life cycle. A simple way to implement this is to make day
 care expenses tax deductible. Modifying and calibrating our model to fit
 some key facts about labour supply in Germany, we find that the reform
 that maximizes a distribution-neutral social welfare function involves
 subsidizing day care at a rate of 50% and leads to a near doubling of
 labour supply for mothers with small children. The overall welfare gain
 from this reform corresponds to a 0.4 percent increase in consumption.  Copyright 2013, Oxford University Press.

Title: Structural Changes, Common Stochastic Trends, and Unit Roots in Panel Data 
Abstract:
 This paper studies the problem of unit root testing in the presence of
 multiple structural changes and common dynamic factors. Structural breaks
 represent infrequent regime shifts, while dynamic factors capture common
 shocks underlying the comovement of economic time series. We examine the
 modified Sargan-Bhargava (MSB) test in the panel data setting and propose
 ways to handle multiple structural changes and dynamic factors. Properties
 of the MSB test under these non-standard conditions are derived. For
 example, the test statistics are shown to be invariant, in the limit, to
 mean breaks. This invariance does not carry over to breaks in linear
 trends, where the test statistics will converge to functionals of weighted
 Brownian bridges. A simplified test statistic is then proposed, which is
 invariant to both mean and trend breaks. We further study pooled test
 statistic based on standardization and combination of p-values. Response
 surfaces for p-values of all test statistics are computed to facilitate
 the empirical implementation of the proposed methodology. The pooled tests
 are shown to have good finite sample performance.  Copyright , Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Self-Regulation and Government Oversight 
Abstract:
 Self-regulation is a feature of a number of professions. For example, in
 the U.S. the government delegates aspects of financial market regulation
 to self-regulatory organizations (SROs) like the New York Stock Exchange
 and the National Association of Securities Dealers. We analyse one
 regulatory task of an SRO, enforcing antifraud rules so agents will not
 cheat customers. Specifically, we model contracting/enforcement as a
 two-tier problem. An SRO chooses its enforcement policy: the likelihood
 that an agent is investigated for fraud and a penalty schedule. Given an
 enforcement policy, agents compete by offering contracts that maximize
 customers' expected utility. We assume that the SRO's objective is to
 maximize the welfare of its members, the agents. We show that the SRO
 chooses a more lax enforcement policy&#x02014;meaning less frequent
 investigations&#x02014;than what customers would choose. A general
 conclusion is that control of the enforcement policy governing contracts
 confers substantial market power to a group of otherwise competitive
 agents. We also investigate government oversight of the self-regulatory
 process. The threat of government enforcement leads to more enforcement by
 the SRO, just enough to pre-empt any government enforcement.  Copyright 2005, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Pairwise-Difference Estimation of a Dynamic Optimization Model 
Abstract:
 We develop a new estimation methodology for dynamic optimization models
 with unobserved shocks and deterministic accumulation of the observed
 state variables. Investment models are an important example of such
 models. Our pairwise-difference approach exploits two common features of
 these models: (1) the monotonicity of the agent's decision (policy)
 function in the shocks, conditional on the observed state variables; and
 (2) the state-contingent nature of optimal decision making which implies
 that, conditional on the observed state variables, the variation in
 observed choices across agents must be due to randomness in the shocks
 across agents. We illustrate our procedure by estimating a dynamic trading
 model for the milk production quota market in Ontario, Canada.  Copyright , Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Executive Control and Legislative Success 
Abstract:
 The higher legislative success of parliamentary governments relative to
 presidential governments has been used to argue that legislative success
 is driven by parliamentary governments' superior agenda power or their
 control of legislative majorities. We show that this approach is at odds
 with some of the empirical regularities across and within political
 systems. We then propose a legislative bargaining model to elucidate this
 puzzle. In the model, the policies of a confidence-dependent parliamentary
 government enjoy more predictable support from governing coalition members
 because their short-term policy goals are less important than the
 government's survival. Coalition support is stronger when the government
 has more agenda power and is weaker with a larger ruling coalition. We
 explore the empirical implications of these findings and their
 consequences for the comparative study of legislative institutions.  Copyright 2011, Oxford University Press.

Title: The Revealed Preference Approach to Collective Consumption Behaviour: Testing and Sharing Rule Recovery 
Abstract:
 We present a revealed preference methodology for empirically analysing
 collective consumption behaviour. First, we introduce an integer
 programming (IP) methodology for testing data consistency with collective
 consumption models that account for publicly as well as privately consumed
 goods. This IP methodology can include information on "assignable
 quantities" for private goods. Next, we show that the IP methodology
 allows for recovering the personalized (Lindahl) prices for the public
 goods and the personalized quantities for the private goods. In turn, this
 implies recovery of the sharing rule (i.e. personalized income share
 levels). An empirical application demonstrates the practical usefulness of
 the methodology.  Copyright 2011, Oxford University Press.

Title: Capital Flows to Developing Countries: The Allocation Puzzle 
Abstract:
 The textbook neoclassical growth model predicts that countries with faster
 productivity growth should invest more and attract more foreign capital.
 We show that the allocation of capital flows across developing countries
 is the opposite of this prediction: capital does not flow more to
 countries that invest and grow more. We call this puzzle the "allocation
 puzzle". Using a wedge analysis, we find that the pattern of capital flows
 is driven by national saving: the allocation puzzle is a saving puzzle.
 Further disaggregation of capital flows reveals that the allocation puzzle
 is also related to the pattern of accumulation of international reserves.
 The solution to the "allocation puzzle", thus, lies at the nexus between
 growth, saving, and international reserve accumulation. We conclude with a
 discussion of some possible avenues for research.  Copyright 2013, Oxford University Press.

Title: A Truth Serum for Non-Bayesians: Correcting Proper Scoring Rules for Risk Attitudes<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN11">*</xref> 
Abstract:
 Proper scoring rules provide convenient and highly efficient tools for
 incentive-compatible elicitations of subjective beliefs. As traditionally
 used, however, they are valid only under expected value maximization. This
 paper shows how they can be generalized to modern ("non-expected utility")
 theories of risk and ambiguity, yielding mutual benefits: users of scoring
 rules can benefit from the empirical realism of non-expected utility, and
 analysts of ambiguity attitudes can benefit from efficient measurements
 using proper scoring rules. An experiment demonstrates the feasibility of
 our generalization.  Copyright 2009, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Asymmetric Information and Adverse Selection in Mauritian Slave Auctions 
Abstract:
 Information asymmetry is a necessary prerequisite for testing adverse
 selection. This paper applies this sequence of tests to Mauritian slave
 auctions. The theory of dynamic auctions with private and common values
 suggests that when an informed participant is known to be active,
 uninformed bidders will be more aggressive and the selling price will be
 higher. We conjecture that observable family links between buyer and
 seller entailed superior information and find a strong price premium when
 a related buyer purchased a slave, indicative of information asymmetry. We
 then test for adverse selection using sale motivation. Our results
 indicate large discounts on voluntary as compared to involuntary sales.
 Consistent with adverse selection, the market anticipated that
 predominantly low-productivity slaves would be brought to the market in
 voluntary sales.  Copyright 2009, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Trading Population for Productivity: Theory and Evidence 
Abstract:
 This research argues that the differential effect of international trade
 on the demand for human capital across countries has been a major
 determinant of the distribution of income and population across the globe.
 In developed countries the gains from trade have been directed towards
 investment in education and growth in income per capita, whereas a
 significant portion of these gains in less developed economies has been
 chanelled towards population growth. Cross-country regressions establish
 that indeed trade has positive effects on fertility and negative effects
 on education in non-OECD economies, while inducing fertility decline and
 human capital formation in OECD economies.  Copyright 2008, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Time-Varying Risk, Interest Rates, and Exchange Rates in General Equilibrium 
Abstract:
 Under mild assumptions, the data indicate that fluctuations in nominal
 interest rate differentials across currencies are primarily fluctuations
 in time-varying risk. This finding is an immediate implication of the fact
 that exchange rates are roughly random walks. If most fluctuations in
 interest differentials are thought to be driven by monetary policy, then
 the data call for a theory which explains how changes in monetary policy
 change risk. Here, we propose such a theory based on a general equilibrium
 monetary model with an endogenous source of risk variation&#x02014;a
 variable degree of asset market segmentation.  Copyright , Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Dynamic Kidney Exchange 
Abstract:
 We study how barter exchanges should be conducted through a centralized
 mechanism in a dynamically evolving agent pool with time- and
 compatibility-based preferences. We derive the dynamically efficient
 two-way and multi-way exchange mechanisms that maximize total discounted
 exchange surplus. Recently several live-donor kidney exchange programmes
 were established to swap incompatible donors of end-stage kidney disease
 patients. Since kidney exchange can be modelled as a special instance of
 our more general model, dynamically efficient kidney exchange mechanisms
 are derived as corollaries. We make policy recommendations using
 simulations.  Copyright , Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Distributive Politics and the Costs of Centralization 
Abstract:
 This paper studies the choice between centralization and decentralization
 of fiscal policy in a political economy setting. With centralization,
 regional delegates vote over agendas comprising sets of region-specific
 projects. The outcome is inefficient because the choice of projects is
 insufficiently sensitive to within-region benefits. The number of projects
 funded may be non-monotonic in the strength of project externalities. The
 efficiency gains from decentralization, and the performance of
 &#x201C;constitutional rules&#x201D; (such as majority voting) which may
 be used to choose between decentralization and centralization, are then
 discussed in this framework. Weaker externalities and more heterogeneity
 between regions need not increase the efficiency gain from
 decentralization.  Copyright 2002, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: The Surprising Power of Age-Dependent Taxes 
Abstract:
 This paper provides a new, empirically driven application of the dynamic
 Mirrleesian framework by studying a feasible and potentially powerful tax
 reform: age-dependent labour income taxation. I show analytically how age
 dependence improves policy on both the intratemporal and intertemporal
 margins. I use detailed numerical simulations, calibrated with data from
 the U.S. Panel Study of Income Dynamics, to generate robust policy
 implications: age dependence (1) lowers marginal taxes on average and
 especially on high-income young workers and (2) lowers average taxes on
 all young workers relative to older workers when private saving and
 borrowing are restricted. Finally, I calculate and characterize the
 welfare gains from age dependence. Despite its simplicity, age dependence
 generates a welfare gain equal to between 0&middot;6% and 1&middot;5% of
 aggregate annual consumption, and it captures more than 60% of the gain
 from reform to the dynamic optimal policy. The gains are due to
 substantial increases in both efficiency and equity. When age dependence
 is restricted to be Pareto improving, the welfare gain is nearly as large.  Copyright 2011, Oxford University Press.

Title: Revealed Preference Analysis of Characteristics Models 
Abstract:
 Characteristics models have been found to be useful in many areas of
 economics. However, their empirical implementation tends to rely heavily
 on functional form assumptions. In this paper we develop a revealed
 preference approach to characteristics models. We derive the necessary and
 sufficient empirical conditions under which data on the market behaviour
 of heterogeneous, price-taking consumers are non-parametrically consistent
 with the consumer characteristics model. Where these conditions hold, we
 show how information may be recovered on individual consumers' marginal
 valuations of product attributes. In some cases, marginal valuations are
 point identified, and in other cases, we can only recover bounds. Where
 the conditions fail, we highlight the role which the introduction of
 unobserved product attributes can play in rationalizing the data. We
 implement these ideas using consumer panel data on the Danish milk market.  Copyright 2008, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Missing Women: Age and Disease 
Abstract:
 Relative to developed countries and some parts of the developing world,
 most notably sub-Saharan Africa, there are far fewer women than men in
 India and China. It has been argued that as many as a 100 million women
 could be missing. The possibility of gender bias at birth and the
 mistreatment of young girls are widely regarded as key explanations. We
 provide a decomposition of these missing women by age and cause of death.
 While we do not dispute the existence of severe gender bias at young ages,
 our computations yield some striking new findings: (1) the vast majority
 of missing women in India and a significant proportion of those in China
 are of adult age; (2) as a proportion of the total female population, the
 number of missing women is largest in sub-Saharan Africa, and the absolute
 numbers are comparable to those for India and China; (3) almost all the
 missing women stem from disease-by-disease comparisons and not from the
 changing composition of disease, as described by the epidemiological
 transition. Finally, using historical data, we argue that a comparable
 proportion of women was missing at the start of the 20th century in the
 United States, just as they are in India, China, and sub-Saharan Africa
 today.  Copyright , Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Directed Technical Change 
Abstract:
 For many problems in macroeconomics, development economics, labour
 economics, and international trade, whether technical change is biased
 towards particular factors is of central importance. This paper develops a
 simple framework to analyse the forces that shape these biases. There are
 two major forces affecting equilibrium bias: the price effect and the
 market size effect. While the former encourages innovations directed at
 scarce factors, the latter leads to technical change favouring abundant
 factors. The elasticity of substitution between different factors
 regulates how powerful these effects are, determining how technical change
 and factor prices respond to changes in relative supplies. If the
 elasticity of substitution is sufficiently large, the long run relative
 demand for a factor can slope up.I apply this framework to develop
 possible explanations to the following questions: why technical change
 over the past 60 years was skill biased, and why the skill bias may have
 accelerated over the past 25 years? Why new technologies introduced during
 the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries were unskill biased?
 What is the effect of biased technical change on the income gap between
 rich and poor countries? Does international trade affect the skill bias of
 technical change? What are the implications of wage push for technical
 change? Why is technical change generally labour augmenting rather than
 capital augmenting?  Copyright 2002, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Choosing the Carrot or the Stick? Endogenous Institutional Choice in Social Dilemma Situations 
Abstract:
 We analyse an experimental public goods game in which group members can
 endogenously determine whether they want to supplement a standard
 voluntary contribution mechanism with the possibility of rewarding or
 punishing other group members. We find a significantly positive effect of
 endogenous institutional choice on the level of cooperation in comparison
 to the same exogenously implemented institutions. This suggests that
 participation rights enhance cooperation in groups. With endogenous
 choice, groups typically vote for the reward option, although punishment
 is even more effective in sustaining high levels of cooperation. Our
 results are evaluated against the predictions of social preference models.  Copyright , Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Time-Consistent Public Policy 
Abstract:
 In this paper we study how a benevolent government that cannot commit to
 future policy should trade off the costs and benefits of public
 expenditure. We characterize and solve for Markov-perfect equilibria of
 the dynamic game between successive governments. The characterization
 consists of an inter-temporal first-order condition (a "generalized Euler
 equation") for the government, and we use it both to gain insight into the
 nature of the equilibrium and as a basis for computations. For a
 calibrated economy, we find that when the only tax base available to the
 government is capital income&#x02014;an inelastic source of funds at any
 point in time&#x02014;the government still refrains from taxing at
 confiscatory rates. We also find that when the only tax base is labour
 income the Markov equilibrium features less public expenditure and lower
 tax rates than the Ramsey equilibrium.  Copyright 2008, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Persistence of Employment Fluctuations: A Model of Recurring Job Loss 
Abstract:
 Standard models of employment fluctuations cannot reconcile the
 unemployment rate's remarkable persistence with the high job-finding rates
 found in worker flows data. A matching model emphasizing high hazard rates
 among newly formed firm-worker matches can resolve this shortcoming. In
 the model, matches are experience goods; consequently, newly employed
 workers face higher hazard rates. Following a job loss, workers may
 experience several short-lived jobs before finding stable employment. At
 an aggregate level, an initial burst of job loss precipitates a steady
 flow of recurring job loss. A simulation shows that this recurring job
 loss can account for the fact that the unemployment rate remains elevated
 for as much as 4 or 5 years following an initial jump.  Copyright 2004, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: A Spatial Theory of Media Slant and Voter Choice 
Abstract:
 We develop a theory of media slant as a systematic filtering of political
 news that reduces multidimensional politics to the one-dimensional space
 perceived by voters. Economic and political choices are interdependent in
 our theory: expected electoral results influence economic choices, and
 economic choices in turn influence voting behaviour. In a two-candidate
 election, we show that media favouring the front-runner will focus on
 issues unlikely to deliver a surprise, while media favouring the underdog
 will gamble for resurrection. We characterize the socially optimal slant
 and show that it coincides with the one favoured by the underdog under a
 variety of circumstances. Balanced media, giving each issue equal
 coverage, may be worse for voters than partisan media.  Copyright 2011, Oxford University Press.

Title: Increasing Competition and the Winner's Curse: Evidence from Procurement 
Abstract:
 We assess empirically the effects of the winner's curse which, in
 common-value auctions, counsels more conservative bidding as the number of
 competitors increases. First, we construct an econometric model of an
 auction in which bidders' preferences have both common- and private-value
 components, and propose a new monotone quantile approach which facilitates
 estimation of this model. Second, we estimate the model using bids from
 procurement auctions held by the State of New Jersey. For a large subset
 of these auctions, we find that median procurement costs rise as
 competition intensifies. In this setting, then, asymmetric information
 overturns the common economic wisdom that more competition is always
 desirable.  Copyright 2002, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Information Acquisition and Under-Diversification 
Abstract:
 If an investor wants to form a portfolio of risky assets and can exert
 effort to collect information on the future value of these assets before
 he invests, which assets should he learn about? The best assets to acquire
 information about are ones the investor expects to hold. But the assets
 the investor holds depend on the information he observes. We build a
 framework to solve jointly for investment and information choices, with
 general preferences and information cost functions. Although the optimal
 research strategies depend on preferences and costs, the main result is
 that the investor who can first collect information systematically
 deviates from holding a diversified portfolio. Information acquisition can
 rationalize investing in a diversified fund and a concentrated set of
 assets, an allocation often observed, but usually deemed anomalous.  Copyright , Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: The Sale of Ideas: Strategic Disclosure, Property Rights, and Contracting 
Abstract:
 Ideas are difficult to sell when buyers cannot assess an idea's value
 before it is revealed and sellers cannot protect a revealed idea. These
 problems exist in a variety of intellectual property sales ranging from
 pure ideas to poorly protected inventions and reflect the nonverifiability
 of key elements of an intellectual property sale. An expropriable partial
 disclosure can be used as a signal, allowing the seller to obtain payment
 based on the value of the remaining (undisclosed) know-how. We examine
 contracting after the disclosure and find that seller wealth is pivotal in
 supporting a partial disclosure equilibrium and in determining the payoff
 size.  Copyright 2002, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Robust Collusion with Private Information 
Abstract:
 The game-theoretic literature on collusion has been hard pressed to
 explain why a cartel should engage in price wars, without resorting to
 either impatience, symmetry restrictions, inability to communicate, or
 failure to optimize. This paper introduces a new explanation that relies
 on none of these assumptions: if the cartel's member firms have private
 information about their costs, price wars can be optimal in the face of
 complexity. Specifically, equilibria that are robust to pay-off irrelevant
 disruptions of the information environment generically cannot attain or
 approximate efficiency. An optimal robust equilibrium must allocate market
 shares inefficiently and may call for price wars under certain conditions.
 For a two-firm cartel, cost interdependence is a sufficient condition for
 price wars to arise in an optimal robust equilibrium. That optimal
 equilibria are inefficient generically applies not only to collusion games
 but also to the entire separable pay-off environment--a class that
 includes most typical economic models.  Copyright 2012, Oxford University Press.

Title: Persistent Inequality 
Abstract:
 When human capital accumulation generates pecuniary externalities across
 professions, and capital markets are imperfect, persistent inequality in
 utility and consumption is inevitable in any steady state. This is true
 irrespective of the degree of divisibility in investments. However,
 divisibility (or fineness of occupational structure) has implications for
 both the multiplicity and Pareto-efficiency of steady states.
 Indivisibilities generate a continuum of inefficient and efficient steady
 states with varying per capita income. On the other hand, perfect
 divisibility typically implies the existence of a unique steady state
 distribution which is Pareto-efficient.  Copyright 2003, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Empirical Analysis of Limit Order Markets 
Abstract:
 We provide empirical restrictions of a model of optimal order submissions
 in a limit order market. A trader's optimal order submission depends on
 the trader's valuation for the asset and the trade-offs between order
 prices, execution probabilities and picking off risks. The optimal order
 submission strategy is a monotone function of a trader's valuation for the
 asset. We test the monotonicity restriction in a sample of order
 submissions and their realized outcomes from the Stockholm Stock Exchange.
 We do not reject the monotonicity restriction for buy orders or sell
 orders considered separately, but reject the monotonicity restriction for
 buy and sell orders considered jointly.  Copyright 2004, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: The Welfare Effects of Incentive Schemes 
Abstract:
 This paper computes the change in welfare associated with the introduction
 of incentives. We calculate by how much the welfare gains of increased
 output due to incentives outweigh workers' disutility from increased
 effort. We accomplish this by studying the use of incentives by a firm in
 the check-clearing industry. Using this firm's production records, we
 model and estimate the worker's dynamic effort decision problem. We find
 that the firm's incentive scheme has a large effect on productivity,
 raising it by 12% over the sample period for the average worker. Using our
 parameter estimates, we show that the cost of increased effort due to
 incentives is equal to the dollar value of a 5% rise in productivity.
 Welfare is measured as the output produced minus the cost of effort;
 hence, the net increase in the average worker's welfare due to the
 introduction of the firm's bonus plan is 7%. Under a first-best scheme, we
 find that the net increase in welfare is 9%.  Copyright , Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Measuring Strategic Uncertainty in Coordination Games 
Abstract:
 This paper proposes a method to measure strategic uncertainty by eliciting
 certainty equivalents analogous to measuring risk attitudes in lotteries.
 We apply this method by conducting experiments on a class of one-shot
 coordination games with strategic complementarities and choices between
 simple lotteries and sure payoff alternatives, both framed in a similar
 way. Despite the multiplicity of equilibria in the coordination games,
 aggregate behaviour is fairly predictable. The pure or mixed Nash
 equilibria cannot describe subjects' behaviour. We present two global
 games with private information about monetary payoffs and about risk
 aversion. While previous literature treats the parameters of a global game
 as given, we estimate them and show that both models describe observed
 behaviour well. The global-game selection for vanishing noise of private
 signals offers a good recommendation for actual players, given the
 observed distribution of actions. We also deduce subjective beliefs and
 compare them with objective probabilities.  Copyright , Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: On the Correlation Structure of Microstructure Noise: A Financial Economic Approach 
Abstract:
 We introduce the financial economics of market microstructure to the
 financial econometrics of asset return volatility estimation. In
 particular, we derive the cross-correlation function between latent
 returns and market microstructure noise in several leading microstructure
 environments. We propose and illustrate several corresponding
 theory-inspired volatility estimators, which we apply to stock and oil
 prices. Our analysis and results are useful for assessing the validity of
 the frequently assumed independence of latent price and microstructure
 noise, for explaining observed cross-correlation patterns, for predicting
 as-yet undiscovered patterns, and most importantly, for promoting improved
 microstructure-based volatility empirics and improved empirical
 microstructure studies. Simultaneously and conversely, our analysis is far
 from the last word on the subject, as it is based on stylized benchmark
 models; it comes with a "call to action" for development and use of richer
 microstructure models in volatility estimation and beyond.  Copyright 2013, Oxford University Press.

Title: Efficient Estimation of the Parameter Path in Unstable Time Series Models 
Abstract:
 The paper investigates inference in non-linear and non-Gaussian models
 with moderately time-varying parameters. We show that for many decision
 problems, the sample information about the parameter path can be
 summarized by an artificial linear and Gaussian model, at least
 asymptotically. The approximation allows for computationally convenient
 path estimators and parameter stability tests. Also, in contrast to
 standard Bayesian techniques, the artificial model can be robustified so
 that in misspecified models, decisions about the path of the (pseudo-true)
 parameter remain as good as in a corresponding correctly specified model.  Copyright , Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Environmental Protection: A Theory of Direct and Indirect Competition for Political Influence 
Abstract:
 How is it that environmental groups can have a strong impact on
 environmental policy but without much lobbying? This paper develops a
 model of "direct" (lobbying the government) and "indirect" (persuading the
 public) competition for political influence and finds that they are
 complementary. However, an increase in the effectiveness of public
 persuasion, or a rise of public environmental awareness, induces
 substitution between the two. The findings establish that the empirical
 phenomenon of lack of political contribution from environmental groups may
 not be related to financial constraints, but to their greater
 effectiveness in public persuasion and growing public environmental
 awareness.  Copyright 2005, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Rational Pessimism, Rational Exuberance, and Asset Pricing Models 
Abstract:
 The paper estimates and examines the empirical plausibility of asset
 pricing models that attempt to explain features of financial markets such
 as the size of the equity premium and the volatility of the stock market.
 In one model, the long-run risks (LRR) model of Bansal and Yaron,
 low-frequency movements, and time-varying uncertainty in aggregate
 consumption growth are the key channels for understanding asset prices. In
 another, as typified by Campbell and Cochrane, habit formation, which
 generates time-varying risk aversion and consequently time variation in
 risk premia, is the key channel. These models are fitted to data using
 simulation estimators. Both models are found to fit the data equally well
 at conventional significance levels, and they can track quite closely a
 new measure of realized annual volatility. Further, scrutiny using a rich
 array of diagnostics suggests that the LRR model is preferred.  Copyright 2007, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Modelling Income Processes with Lots of Heterogeneity 
Abstract:
 We model earnings processes allowing for lots of heterogeneity across
 agents. We also introduce an extension to the linear ARMA model which
 allows the initial convergence in the long run to be different from that
 implied by the conventional ARMA model. This is particularly important for
 unit root tests, which are actually tests of a composite of two
 independent hypotheses. We fit to a variety of statistics including most
 of those considered by previous investigators. We use a sample drawn from
 the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID), and focus on white males with a
 high-school degree. Despite this observable homogeneity, we find more
 latent heterogeneity than previous investigators. We show that allowance
 for heterogeneity makes substantial differences to estimates of model
 parameters and to outcomes of interest. Additionally, we find strong
 evidence against the hypothesis that any worker has a unit root.  Copyright , Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Dynamic Trading and Asset Prices: Keynes vs. Hayek 
Abstract:
 We investigate the dynamics of prices, information, and expectations in a
 competitive, noisy, dynamic asset pricing equilibrium model with long-term
 investors. We argue that the fact that prices can score worse or better
 than consensus opinion in predicting the fundamentals is a product of
 endogenous short-term speculation. For a given positive level of residual
 pay-off uncertainty, if liquidity trades display low persistence, rational
 investors act like market makers and accommodate the order flow and prices
 are farther away from fundamentals compared to consensus. This defines a
 "Keynesian" region; the complementary region is "Hayekian" in that
 rational investors chase the trend and prices are systematically closer to
 fundamentals than average expectations. The standard case of no residual
 uncertainty and liquidity trading following a random walk is on the
 frontier of the two regions and identifies the set of deep parameters for
 which rational investors abide by Keynes' dictum of concentrating on an
 asset "long-term prospects and those only". The analysis also explains
 momentum and reversal in stock returns and how accommodation and
 trend-chasing strategies differ from these phenomena.  Copyright 2012, Oxford University Press.

Title: Parental Leave and Mothers' Careers: The Relative Importance of Job Protection and Cash Benefits 
Abstract:
 Job protection and cash benefits are key elements of parental leave (PL)
 systems. We study how these two policy instruments affect return-to-work
 and medium-run labour market outcomes of mothers of newborn children.
 Analysing a series of major PL policy changes in Austria, we find that
 longer cash benefits lead to a significant delay in return-to-work,
 particularly so in the period that is job-protected. Prolonged parental
 leave absence induced by these policy changes does not appear to hurt
 mothers' labour market outcomes in the medium run. We build a
 non-stationary model of job search after childbirth to isolate the role of
 the two policy instruments. The model matches return-to-work and return to
 same employer profiles under the various factual policy configurations.
 Counterfactual policy simulations indicate that a system that combines
 cash with protection dominates other systems in generating time for care
 immediately after birth while maintaining mothers' medium-run labour
 market attachment.  Copyright 2014, Oxford University Press.

Title: Estimating Intertemporal Allocation Parameters using Synthetic Residual Estimation 
Abstract:
 We present a novel structural estimation procedure for models of
 intertemporal allocation. This is based on modelling expectations errors
 directly; we refer to it as synthetic residual estimation (SRE). The
 flexibility of SRE allows us to account for measurement error in
 consumption and for heterogeneity in intertemporal allocation parameters.
 An investigation of the small sample properties of the SRE estimator
 indicates that it dominates generalized method of moments (GMM) estimation
 of both exact and approximate Euler equations in the case when we have
 short panels and noisy consumption data. We apply SRE to two panels drawn
 from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) and estimate the joint
 distribution of the discount factor and the elasticity of intertemporal
 substitution. We reject strongly homogeneity of the discount factor and
 the elasticity of intertemporal substitution. We find that, on average,
 the more educated are more patient and less willing to substitute
 intertemporally than the less educated. Within education strata, patience
 and willingness to substitute are positively correlated.  Copyright , Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Price Stability in Open Economies 
Abstract:
 This paper studies the theoretical conditions under which price stability
 is the optimal policy in a two-country open-economy model with imperfect
 competition and price stickiness. Special conditions on the levels of
 country-specific distortionary taxation and the intratemporal and
 intertemporal elasticities of substitution need to be satisfied. These
 restrictions apply to both cooperative and non-cooperative settings.
 Importantly, we show that cooperative and non-cooperative solutions do not
 coincide despite market completeness and producer currency pricing. We
 study the conditions under which quadratic approximations of single
 countries' welfare can be correctly evaluated by relying only on
 log-linear approximations of the equilibrium conditions.  Copyright 2003, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Intertemporal Distortions in the Second Best 
Author-Name: Stefania Albanesi
Author-Name: Roc Armenter
Abstract:
 This paper studies the long-run properties of intertemporal distortions in
 a broad class of second-best economies. Our unified framework encompasses
 and extends many well-known models, such as variants of the Ramsey
 taxation model with aggregate or idiosyncratic risk, and economies with
 incentive compatibility constraints due to limited commitment, political
 economy, self-enforcement or private information, or combinations of
 these. We identify a sufficient condition that rules out permanent
 intertemporal distortions: if there exists an allocation that satisfies
 all constraints and eventually converges to the limiting first-best
 allocation, then intertemporal distortions are temporary in the second
 best. This result uncovers a common optimality principle linking the
 intertemporal allocation of resources with the ability to front-load
 distortions for this broad class of environments. A series of applications
 illustrates the significance of these findings.  Copyright , Oxford University Press.

Title: Generalized Spectral Tests for Conditional Mean Models in Time Series with Conditional Heteroscedasticity of Unknown Form 
Abstract:
 Economic theories in time series contexts usually have implications on and
 only on the conditional mean dynamics of underlying economic variables. We
 propose a new class of specification tests for time series conditional
 mean models, where the dimension of the conditioning information set may
 be infinite. Both linear and nonlinear conditional mean specifications are
 covered. The tests can detect a wide range of model misspecifications in
 mean while being robust to conditional heteroscedasticity and higher order
 time-varying moments of unknown form. They check a large number of lags,
 but naturally discount higher order lags, which is consistent with the
 stylized fact that economic behaviours are more affected by the recent
 past events than by the remote past events. No specific estimation method
 is required, and the tests have the appealing "nuisance parameter free"
 property that parameter estimation uncertainty has no impact on the limit
 distribution of the tests. A simulation study shows that it is important
 to take into account the impact of conditional heteroscedasticity; failure
 to do so will cause overrejection of a correct conditional mean model. In
 a horse race competition on testing linearity in mean, our tests have
 omnibus and robust power against a variety of alternatives relative to
 some existing tests. In an application, we find that after removing
 significant but possibly spurious autocorrelations due to nonsynchronous
 trading, there still exists significant predictable nonlinearity in mean
 for S&P 500 and NASDAQ daily returns.  Copyright 2005, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Self-Correcting Information Cascades 
Abstract:
 We report experimental results from long sequences of decisions in
 environments that are theoretically prone to severe information cascades.
 Observed behaviour is much different&#x2014;information cascades are
 ephemeral. We study the implications of a theoretical model based on
 quantal response equilibrium, in which the observed cascade
 formation/collapse/formation cycles arise as equilibrium phenomena.
 Consecutive cascades may reverse states, and usually such a reversal is
 self-correcting: the cascade switches to the correct state. These
 implications are supported by the data. We extend the model to allow for
 base rate neglect and find strong evidence for overweighting of private
 information. The estimated belief trajectories indicate fast and efficient
 learning dynamics.  Copyright 2007, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: The Intergenerational State Education and Pensions 
Abstract:
 When credit markets to finance investment in human capital are missing,
 the competitive equilibrium allocation is inefficient. When generations
 overlap, this failure can be mitigated by properly designed social
 arrangements. We show that public financing of education and public
 pensions can be designed to implement an intergenerational transfer scheme
 supporting the complete market allocation. Neither the public financing of
 education nor the pension scheme we consider resemble standard ones. In
 our mechanism, via the public education system, the young borrow from the
 middle aged to invest in human capital. They pay back the debt via a
 social security tax, the proceedings of which finance pension payments.
 When the complete market allocation is achieved, the rate of return
 implicit in this borrowing-lending scheme should equal the market rate of
 return.  Copyright 2005, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Do Population Control Policies Induce More Human Capital Investment? Twins, Birth Weight and China's "One-Child" Policy 
Abstract:
 In this paper, we address the issues of whether reductions in fertility
 increase human capital investments per child and whether twinning can
 identify the quantity&#x02014;quality (Q-Q) trade-off. We show that
 estimates of the effects of twinning at higher parities on the outcomes of
 older children in prior studies do not identify family-size effects but
 are confounded by inter-child allocation effects because of the endowment
 deficit and close spacing of twins. However, examining the effects of
 twinning by birth order, net of the effects stemming from the endowment
 deficit of twins, can provide upper and lower bounds on the trade-off
 between the family size and average child quality. Our estimates, based on
 data from China, indicate that an extra child at parity one or at parity
 two, net of one component of birth-endowment effects associated with birth
 weight, significantly decreases the schooling progress, the expected
 college enrolment, grades in school and the assessed health of all
 children in the family. Despite the evident significant trade-off between
 number of children and child quality in China, the findings suggest that
 the contribution of the one-child policy in China to the development of
 its human capital was modest.  Copyright , Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Cultural Integration and Its Discontents 
Abstract:
 A community's culture is defined by the preferences and equilibrium
 behaviours of its members. Contacts among communities alter individual
 cultures through two interrelated mechanisms: behavioural adaptations
 driven by pay-offs to coordination, and preference changes shaped by
 socialization and self-persuasion. This paper explores the workings of
 these mechanisms through a model of cultural integration in which
 preferences and behaviours vary continuously. It identifies a broad set of
 conditions under which cross-cultural contacts promote cultural
 hybridization. The analysis suggests that policies to support social
 integration serve to homogenize preferences across communities, thereby
 undermining a key objective of multiculturalism. Yielding fresh insights
 into strategies pursued to influence cultural trends, it also shows that
 communities benefit from having other communities adjust their behaviours.  Copyright 2008, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Monetary Policy and Exchange Rate Volatility in a Small Open Economy 
Abstract:
 We lay out a small open economy version of the Calvo sticky price model,
 and show how the equilibrium dynamics can be reduced to a simple
 representation in domestic inflation and the output gap. We use the
 resulting framework to analyse the macroeconomic implications of three
 alternative rule-based policy regimes for the small open economy: domestic
 inflation and CPI-based Taylor rules, and an exchange rate peg. We show
 that a key difference among these regimes lies in the relative amount of
 exchange rate volatility that they entail. We also discuss a special case
 for which domestic inflation targeting constitutes the optimal policy, and
 where a simple second order approximation to the utility of the
 representative consumer can be derived and used to evaluate the welfare
 losses associated with the suboptimal rules.  Copyright 2005, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Structural Vector Autoregressions: Theory of Identification and Algorithms for Inference 
Abstract:
 Structural vector autoregressions (SVARs) are widely used for policy
 analysis and to provide stylized facts for dynamic stochastic general
 equilibrium (DSGE) models; yet no workable rank conditions to ascertain
 whether an SVAR is globally identified have been established. Moreover,
 when nonlinear identifying restrictions are used, no efficient algorithms
 exist for small-sample estimation and inference. This paper makes four
 contributions towards filling these important gaps in the literature.
 First, we establish general rank conditions for global identification of
 both identified and exactly identified models. These rank conditions are
 sufficient for general identification and are necessary and sufficient for
 exact identification. Second, we show that these conditions can be easily
 implemented and that they apply to a wide class of identifying
 restrictions, including linear and certain nonlinear restrictions. Third,
 we show that the rank condition for exactly identified models amounts to a
 straightforward counting exercise. Fourth, we develop efficient algorithms
 for small-sample estimation and inference, especially for SVARs with
 nonlinear restrictions.  Copyright , Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Consistent Testing for Stochastic Dominance under General Sampling Schemes 
Abstract:
 We propose a procedure for estimating the critical values of the extended
 Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests of Stochastic Dominance of arbitrary order in the
 general K-prospect case. We allow for the observations to be serially
 dependent and, for the first time, we can accommodate general dependence
 amongst the prospects which are to be ranked. Also, the prospects may be
 the residuals from certain conditional models, opening the way for
 conditional ranking. We also propose a test of Prospect Stochastic
 Dominance. Our method is based on subsampling and we show that the
 resulting tests are consistent and powerful against some
 N-super-&#x02212;1/2 local alternatives. We also propose some heuristic
 methods for selecting subsample size and demonstrate in simulations that
 they perform reasonably. We describe an alternative method for obtaining
 critical values based on recentring the test statistic and using
 full-sample bootstrap methods. We compare the two methods in theory and in
 practice.  Copyright 2005, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Monotonicity and Rationalizability in a Large First Price Auction 
Abstract:
 This paper proves that the monotonicity of bidding strategies together
 with the rationality of bidders implies that the winning bid in a first
 price auction converges to the competitive equilibrium price as the number
 of bidders increases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Wilson,
 1977</xref>). Instead of analysing the symmetric Nash equilibrium, we
 examine rationalizable strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Bernheim
 (1984)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Pearce (1984)</xref>) among
 the set of monotonic bidding strategies to prove that any monotonic
 rationalizable bidding strategy must be within a small neighbourhood of
 the "truthful" valuation of the object, conditioned on the signal received
 by the bidder. We obtain an information aggregation result similar to that
 of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Wilson (1977)</xref>, while dispensing
 with almost all symmetric assumptions and using a milder solution concept
 than the Nash equilibrium. In particular, if every bidder is ex ante
 identical, then any rationalizable bidding strategy must be within a small
 neighbourhood of the symmetric Nash equilibrium. In a symmetric first
 price auction, the symmetry of outcomes is implied rather than assumed.  Copyright 2005, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Effects of Free Choice Among Public Schools 
Abstract:
 In this paper, I investigate the impact of a programme in Tel-Aviv,
 Israel, that terminated an existing inter-district busing integration
 programme and allowed students free choice among public schools. The
 identification is based on difference-in-differences and regression
 discontinuity designs that yield various alternative comparison groups
 drawn from untreated tangent neighbourhoods and adjacent cities. Across
 identification methods and comparison groups, the results consistently
 suggest that choice significantly reduces the drop-out rate and increases
 the cognitive achievements of high-school students. It also improves
 behavioural outcomes such as teacher-student relationships and students'
 social acclimation and satisfaction at school, and reduces the level of
 violence and classroom disruption.  Copyright , Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: The Sullying Effect of Recessions 
Abstract:
 Previous work has established that recessions involve a
 &#x201C;cleansing&#x201D; effect, so that in downturns, only high
 productivity jobs remain. But empirical evidence suggests job quality is
 procyclical: jobs created in recessions are likely to be low-paying and
 temporary. This paper modifies previous models by adding on-the-job
 search, which leads to an additional &#x201C;sullying&#x201D; effect.
 Calibration of the model suggests this offsetting sullying effect is
 likely to be much larger than the cleansing effect, and can account for
 the procyclical match quality we observe in the data.  Copyright 2002, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Strength in Numbers: Networks as a Solution to Occupational Traps 
Abstract:
 The "new classical" theory states that families in low-skill occupations
 with low levels of human capital can stay poor from one generation to the
 next, while families in high-skill occupations with correspondingly high
 levels of human capital stay wealthy, despite being endowed with the same
 level of ability on average. This paper proposes an informal institutional
 mechanism--the community-based network--through which families belonging
 to the same neighbourhood or kinship group can bootstrap their way out of
 such low-skill occupational traps. The insight from the dynamic model that
 is developed is that once they form, new networks providing mutual support
 to their members and substituting for inherited parental human capital and
 wealth will strengthen most rapidly in historically disadvantaged
 communities, generating a correspondingly high level of intergenerational
 mobility. These predictions are successfully tested using unique data from
 India. The analysis in this paper, coupled with an emerging empirical
 literature on networks and migration, provides a new perspective on
 mobility in developing countries, with restrictive traditional networks
 decaying even as new networks supporting collective mobility form and
 strengthen over time.  Copyright 2011, Oxford University Press.

Title: Nonlinear Pricing with Random Participation 
Abstract:
 The canonical selection contracting programme takes the agent's
 participation decision as deterministic and finds the optimal contract,
 typically satisfying this constraint for the worst type. Upon weakening
 this assumption of known reservation values by introducing independent
 randomness into the agents' outside options, we find that some of the
 received wisdom from mechanism design and nonlinear pricing is not robust
 and the richer model which allows for stochastic participation affords a
 more general empirical specification. We develop a multidimensional
 methodology for addressing this class of problems, providing two important
 applications to nonlinear pricing. First, with nonlinear pricing by a
 monopolist the familiar &#x201C;nodistortion-at-the-top&#x201D; result
 persists, but in tandem with the surprising conclusion that there is
 either no distortion at the bottom or bunching. Second, in a simple model
 of product differentiated duopolists competing with nonlinear pricing we
 show that, generally, the duopoly outcome is qualitatively similar to the
 monopoly outcome. However, when marginal costs are symmetric and
 competition is sufficiently intense, distortions disappear and the
 equilibrium outcome takes a remarkably simple form: efficient quality
 allocations with cost-plus-fee pricing.  Copyright 2002, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Bank Credit Cycles 
Abstract:
 A bank determines whether potential borrowers are creditworthy, that is,
 whether they meet the bank's credit or lending standards. In making this
 determination, each bank is in competition with other banks, but without
 knowing the competitor banks' credit standards. The resulting unique form
 of competition leads to endogenous credit cycles, periodic "credit
 crunches". Empirical tests of this repeated bank lending game are
 constructed based on parameterizing public information about relative bank
 performance that is at the root of banks' beliefs about rival banks'
 lending standards. The relative performance of rival banks has predictive
 power for subsequent lending in the credit card market, where we can
 identify the main competitors. At the macroeconomic level, the relative
 bank performance of commercial and industrial loans is an autonomous
 source of macroeconomic fluctuations. In an asset pricing context, the
 relative bank performance is a priced risk factor for both banks and
 non-financial firms. The factor coefficients for non-financial firms are
 decreasing with size, consistent with smaller firms being more bank
 dependent.  Copyright 2008, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Accounting for Incomplete Pass-Through 
Abstract:
 Recent theoretical work has suggested a number of potentially important
 factors in causing incomplete pass-through of exchange rates to prices,
 including markup adjustment, local costs and barriers to price adjustment.
 We empirically analyse the determinants of incomplete pass-through in the
 coffee industry. The observed pass-through in this industry replicates key
 features of pass-through documented in aggregate data: prices respond
 sluggishly and incompletely to changes in costs. We use microdata on sales
 and prices to uncover the role of markup adjustment, local costs and
 barriers to price adjustment in determining incomplete pass-through using
 a structural oligopoly model that nests all three potential factors. The
 implied pricing model explains the main dynamic features of short and
 long-run pass-through. Local costs reduce long-run pass-through (after six
 quarters) by 59% relative to a Constant Elasticity of Substitution
 benchmark. Markup adjustment reduces pass-through by an additional 33%,
 where the extent of markup adjustment depends on the estimated
 "super-elasticity" of demand. The estimated menu costs are small (0.23% of
 revenue) and have a negligible effect on long-run pass-through but are
 quantitatively successful in explaining the delayed response of prices to
 costs. We find that delayed pass-through in the coffee industry occurs
 almost entirely at the wholesale rather than the retail level.  Copyright , Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: On the Nature of Capital Adjustment Costs 
Abstract:
 This paper studies the nature of capital adjustment at the plant level. We
 use an indirect inference procedure to estimate the structural parameters
 of a rich specification of capital adjustment costs. In effect, the
 parameters are optimally chosen to reproduce a set of moments that capture
 the non-linear relationship between investment and profitability found in
 plant-level data. Our findings indicate that a model, which mixes both
 convex and non-convex adjustment costs, fits the data best.  Copyright 2006, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Durable-Goods Monopoly with Varying Demand 
Abstract:
 This paper solves for the profit-maximizing strategy of a durable-goods
 monopolist when incoming demand varies over time. We first characterize
 the consumers' optimal purchasing decision by a cut-off rule. We then show
 that, under a monotonicity condition, the profit-maximizing cut-offs can
 be derived through a myopic algorithm, which has an intuitive marginal
 revenue interpretation. Consumers' ability to delay creates an asymmetry
 in the optimal price path, which exhibits fast increases and slow
 decreases. This asymmetry creates an upward bias in the level of prices,
 pushing them above the price charged by a firm facing the average level of
 demand. The optimal policy outperforms renting and can be implemented by a
 time-consistent best-price provision.  Copyright 2008, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Trade Liberalization, Exit, and Productivity Improvements: Evidence from Chilean Plants 
Abstract:
 This paper empirically investigates the effects of liberalized trade on
 plant productivity in the case of Chile. Chile presents an interesting
 setting to study this relationship since it underwent a massive trade
 liberalization that significantly exposed its plants to competition from
 abroad during the late 1970s and early 1980s. Methodologically, I approach
 this question in two steps. In the first step, I estimate a production
 function to obtain a measure of plant productivity. I estimate the
 production function semiparametrically to correct for the presence of
 selection and simultaneity biases in the estimates of the input
 coefficients required to construct a productivity measure. I explicitly
 incorporate plant exit in the estimation to correct for the selection
 problem induced by liquidated plants. These methodological aspects are
 important in obtaining a reliable plant-level productivity measure based
 on consistent estimates of the input coefficients. In the second step, I
 identify the impact of trade on plants' productivity in a regression
 framework allowing variation in productivity over time and across traded-
 and nontraded-goods sectors. Using plant-level panel data on Chilean
 manufacturers, I find evidence of within plant productivity improvements
 that can be attributed to a liberalized trade for the plants in the
 import-competing sector. In many cases, aggregate productivity
 improvements stem from the reshuffling of resources and output from less
 to more efficient producers.  Copyright 2002, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Ramsey Tax Cycles 
Abstract:
 This paper asks whether tax cycles or tax smoothing represents the optimal
 policy in models without any extrinsic uncertainty. To answer this
 question, I develop a general framework for studying tax cycles in a large
 class of models that feature various types of frictions. This framework
 adds various wedges, resembling tax wedges, to the labour market, to the
 product market, and to money acquisition into an otherwise frictionless
 economy, so that it nests a large class of models used for policy
 analysis. I derive a criterion for this general framework that indicates
 when cycles are welfare-improving in a frictionless economy, and why
 frictions make cycles more likely to be optimal. I then calibrate two
 models with frictions, a labour search model and a monetary model, and
 show that cycles are welfare-improving under standard preferences.  Copyright , Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Credit within the Firm 
Abstract:
 We use variation in the degree of development of local credit markets and
 matched employer--employee data to assess the role of the firm as an
 internal credit market. We find that firms operating in less financially
 developed markets offer lower entry wages but faster wage growth than
 firms in more financially developed markets. This helps firms finance
 their operations by implicitly raising funds from workers. We control for
 local market fixed effects and only exploit time variation in the degree
 of local financial development induced by an exogenous liberalization, so
 that the effect we find is unlikely to reflect unobserved local factors
 that systematically affect wage--tenure profiles. We estimate that the
 amount of credit generated by implicit lending within the firm is
 economically important and can be as large as 30 percent of the bank
 lending. Consistent with credit market imperfections opening up trade
 opportunities within the firm, we find that the internal rate of return of
 implicit loans lies between the rate at which workers savings are
 remunerated in the market and the rate that firms pay on their loans from
 banks.  Copyright , Oxford University Press.

Title: From Pigou to Extended Liability: On the Optimal Taxation of Externalities Under Imperfect Financial Markets 
Abstract:
 Pigovian taxation of externalities has limited appeal if the tortfeaser
 has insufficient resources to pay the damage when it occurs. To defend
 Pigovian taxation in the presence of judgement-proof agents, its
 proponents point at the many institutions extending liability to third
 parties. Yet little is known about the validity of Pigou's analysis in
 this context. The paper analyses the costs and benefits of extended
 liability and investigates whether full internalization is called for in
 the presence of agency costs between potential tortfeasers and providers
 of guarantees. Its contribution is two-fold. It first shows that the
 better the firms' corporate governance and the stronger their balance
 sheet, the more closely taxes should track the corresponding externality.
 It then develops the first analysis of extended liability when guarantors
 themselves may be judgement-proof, and the extension of liability may give
 rise to further externalities. Relatedly, it derives the curvature of the
 optimal taxation of externalities in a multi-plant firm.  Copyright , Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: On the Theory of Strategic Voting<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN1">-super-1</xref> 
Abstract:
 In a plurality-rule election, a group of voters must coordinate behind one
 of two challengers in order to defeat a disliked status quo. Departing
 from existing work, the support for each challenger must be inferred from
 the private observation of informative signals. The unique equilibrium
 involves limited strategic voting and incomplete coordination. This is
 driven by negative feedback: an increase in strategic voting by others
 reduces the incentives for a voter to act strategically. Strategic-voting
 incentives are lower in relatively marginal elections, after controlling
 for the distance from contention of a trailing preferred challenger. A
 calibration applied to the U.K. General Election of 1997 is consistent
 with the impact of strategic voting and the reported accuracy of voters'
 understanding of the electoral situation.  Copyright 2007, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Optimal Welfare-to-Work Programs 
Abstract:
 A Welfare-to-Work (WTW) program is a mix of government expenditures on
 various labour market policies targeted to the unemployed (e.g.
 unemployment insurance (UI), job search monitoring (JM), social assistance
 (SA), wage subsidies). This paper provides a dynamic
 principal&#x2014;agent framework suitable for analysing chief features of
 an optimal WTW program, such as the sequence and duration of the different
 policies, the dynamic pattern of payments along the unemployment spell,
 and the emergence of taxes/subsidies upon re-employment. The optimal
 program endogenously generates an absorbing policy of last resort
 (&#x201C;social assistance&#x201D;) characterized by a constant lifetime
 payment and no active participation by the agent. Human capital
 depreciation is a necessary condition for policy transitions to be part of
 an optimal WTW program. The typical sequence of policies is quite simple:
 the program starts with standard UI, then switches into monitored search
 and, finally, into SA. The optimal benefits are decreasing during
 unemployment insurance and constant during both JM and SA. Whereas taxes
 (subsidies) can be either increasing or decreasing with duration during
 UI, they must decrease (increase) during a phase of JM. In a calibration
 exercise, we use our model to analyse quantitatively the features of the
 optimal program for the U.S. economy. With respect to the existing U.S.
 system, the optimal WTW scheme delivers sizeable welfare gains to
 unskilled workers because the incentives to search for a job can be
 retained even while delivering more insurance and using costly monitoring
 less intensively.  Copyright 2007, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Estimating Ethnic Preferences Using Ethnic Housing Quotas in Singapore 
Abstract:
 This article estimates people's taste for living with own-ethnic-group
 neighbours using variation from a natural experiment in Singapore: ethnic
 housing quotas. I develop a location choice model that informs the use of
 policy variation from the quotas to address endogeneity issues well known
 in the social interactions literature. I assembled a dataset on
 neighbourhood-level ethnic proportions by matching more than 500,000 names
 in the phonebook to ethnicities. I find that all groups want to live with
 some own-ethnic-group neighbours but they also exhibit inverted U-shaped
 preferences so that once a neighbourhood has enough own ethnic neighbours,
 they would rather add a new neighbour from other groups. Welfare
 simulations show that about 30% of the neighbourhoods are within one
 standard deviation of the first-best allocation of ethnic groups.  Copyright 2013, Oxford University Press.

Title: Openness, Government Size and the Terms of Trade 
Abstract:
 This paper investigates the relationship between trade openness and the
 size of governments, both theoretically and empirically. We argue that
 openness can increase the size of governments through two channels: (1) a
 terms-of-trade externality, whereby trade lowers the domestic cost of
 taxation, and (2) the demand for insurance, whereby trade raises risk and
 public transfers. We provide a unified framework for studying and testing
 these two mechanisms. Our main theoretical prediction is that the relative
 strength of the two explanations depends on a key parameter, namely, the
 elasticity of substitution between domestic and foreign goods. Moreover,
 while the first mechanism is inefficient from the standpoint of world
 welfare, the second, instead, is optimal. In the empirical part of the
 paper, we provide new evidence on the positive association between
 openness and government size and we explore its determinants. Consistent
 with the terms-of-trade externality channel, we show that the correlation
 is contingent on a low elasticity of substitution between domestic and
 foreign goods. Our findings raise warnings that globalization may have led
 to inefficiently large governments.  Copyright , Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Optimal Monetary Policy with Uncertain Fundamentals and Dispersed Information<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN21">*</xref> 
Abstract:
 This paper studies optimal monetary policy in a model where aggregate
 fluctuations are driven by the private sector's uncertainty about the
 economy's fundamentals. Information on aggregate productivity is dispersed
 across agents and there are two aggregate shocks: a standard productivity
 shock and a "noise shock" affecting public beliefs about aggregate
 productivity. Neither the central bank nor individual agents can
 distinguish the two shocks when they are realized. Despite the lack of
 superior information, monetary policy can affect the economy's relative
 response to the two shocks. As time passes, better information on past
 fundamentals becomes available. The central bank can then adopt a
 backward-looking policy rule, based on more precise information about past
 shocks. By announcing its response to future information, the central bank
 can influence the expected real interest rate faced by forward-looking
 consumers with different beliefs and thus affect the equilibrium
 allocation. If the announced future response is sufficiently aggressive,
 the central bank can completely eliminate the effect of noise shocks.
 However, this policy is typically suboptimal, as it leads to an
 excessively compressed distribution of relative prices. The optimal
 monetary policy balances the benefits of aggregate stabilization with the
 costs in terms of cross-sectional efficiency.  Copyright , Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Mass Media Competition, Political Competition, and Public Policy 
Abstract:
 If better informed voters receive favourable policies, then mass media
 will affect policy because mass media provide most of the information
 people use in voting. This paper models the incentives of the media to
 deliver news to different groups. The increasing-returns-to-scale
 technology and advertising financing of media firms induce them to provide
 more news to large groups, such as taxpayers and dispersed consumer
 interests, and groups that are valuable to advertisers. This news bias
 alters the trade-off in political competition and therefore introduces a
 bias in public policy. The paper also discusses the effects of broadcast
 media replacing newspapers as the main information source about politics.
 The model predicts that this change should raise spending on government
 programmes used by poor and rural voters.  Copyright 2004, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Business Creation and the Stock Market 
Abstract:
 We claim that the stock market encourages business creation, innovation,
 and growth by allowing the recycling of "informed capital". Due to
 incentive and information problems, start-ups face larger costs of going
 public than mature firms. Sustaining a tight relationship with a monitor
 (bank, venture capitalist) allows them to finance their operations without
 going public until profitability prospects are clearer or incentive
 problems are less severe. However, the earlier young firms go public, the
 quicker monitors' informed capital is redirected towards new start-ups.
 Hence, when informed capital is in limited supply, factors that lower the
 costs for start-ups to go public encourage business creation.
 Technological spill-overs associated with business creation and thick
 market externalities in the young firms segment of the stock market
 provide prima facie cases for encouraging young firms to go public.  Copyright 2004, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Gradualism in Bargaining and Contribution Games 
Abstract:
 This paper identifies a source of gradualism in bargaining and
 contribution games. In the bargaining games we examine, each party can opt
 out at any time, and the outside option outcome is assumed to depend on
 the offers made in the negotiation phase. Specifically, we assume that (1)
 making a concession in the negotiation phase increases the other party's
 outside option pay-off and (2) the outside option outcome induces an
 efficiency loss as compared with a negotiated agreement. The main finding
 is that the mere presence of such history-dependent outside options forces
 equilibrium concessions in the negotiation phase to be gradual, and the
 degree of gradualism is characterized. The model also applies to
 contribution games in which the outside option may be interpreted as the
 option to implement a partial project using the total contributions made
 so far.  Copyright 2004, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Quality Sorting and Trade: Firm-level Evidence for French Wine 
Abstract:
 Empirical investigation of the quality interpretation of the Melitz (2003) model of firm
 heterogeneity and trade has been limited by the lack of direct data on
 quality. This paper matches firm-level export data with expert assessments
 of the quality of champagne producers to estimate the key parameters of
 that model. Quality monotonically increases firm-level prices, the
 probability of market entry, and export values. The estimated model--which
 calibrates the relative importance of firm-level quality and idiosyncratic
 demand--accurately predicts the average quality exported to each country.
 Simulations show that the data reject the polar alternatives where
 outcomes are based entirely on either quality or randomness.  Copyright 2012, Oxford University Press.

Title: How Important Is Human Capital? A Quantitative Theory Assessment of World Income Inequality 
Abstract:
 We build a model of heterogeneous individuals&#x02014;who make investments
 in schooling quantity and quality&#x02014;to quantify the importance of
 differences in human capital vs. total factor productivity (TFP) in
 explaining the variation in per capita income across countries. The
 production of human capital requires expenditures and time inputs; the
 relative importance of these inputs determines the predictions of the
 theory for inequality both within and across countries. We discipline our
 quantitative assessment with a calibration firmly grounded on US micro
 evidence. Since in our calibrated model economy human capital production
 requires a significant amount of expenditures, TFP changes affect
 disproportionately the benefits and costs of human capital accumulation.
 Our main finding is that human capital accumulation strongly amplifies TFP
 differences across countries: to explain a 20-fold difference in the
 output per worker, the model requires a 5-fold difference in the TFP of
 the tradable sector, vs. an 18-fold difference if human capital is fixed
 across countries.  Copyright , Wiley-Blackwell.

 rid="R4">Altonji and Shakotko (1987)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr"
 rid="R38">Topel (1991)</xref> and reinvestigate the returns to seniority
 in the United States. We begin with the same wage equation as in previous
 studies. We extend the model of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Hyslop

 inter-firm mobility decisions, which, in turn, define the individual's
 experience and seniority. We introduce into the wage equation a summary of
 the workers' entire career path. The three-equation system is estimated
 simultaneously using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID).
 We find that for each of the three education groups studied the returns to
 seniority are larger than those previously found in the literature.  Copyright , Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Regulating Exclusion from Financial Markets 
Abstract:
 We study optimal enforcement in credit markets in which the only threat
 facing a defaulting borrower is restricted access to financial markets. We
 solve for the optimal level of exclusion, and link it to observed
 institutional arrangements. Regulation in this environment must accomplish
 two objectives. First, it must prevent borrowers from defaulting on one
 bank and transferring their resources to another bank. Second, and less
 obviously, it must give banks the incentive to make sizeable loans, and to
 honour their promises of future credit. We establish that the optimal
 regulation resembles observed laws governing default on debt. Moreover, if
 debtors have the right to a "fresh start" after bankruptcy then this must
 be balanced by enforceable provisions against fraudulent conveyance. Our
 optimal regulation is robust, in that it can be implemented in a way that
 does not require the regulator to have information about either the
 borrower or lender. Our results isolate the way in which specific
 institutions surrounding bankruptcy&#x02014;namely rules governing asset
 garnishment and fraudulent conveyances&#x02014;support loan markets in
 which borrowers have no collateral.  Copyright 2004, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Wages, Experience and Seniority 
Abstract:
 In this paper we study the sources of wage growth. We identify the
 contribution to such growth of general, sector specific and firm specific
 human capital. Our results are interpretable within the context of a model
 where the returns to human capital may be heterogeneous and where firms
 may offer different combinations of entry level wages and firm specific
 human capital development. We allow for the possibility that wages are
 match specific and that workers move jobs as a result of identifying a
 better match. To estimate the average returns to experience, sector tenure
 and firm specific tenure within this context, we develop an identification
 strategy which relies on the use of firm closures. Our data source is a
 new and unique administrative data-set for Germany that includes complete
 work histories as well as individual characteristics. We find positive
 returns to experience and firm tenure for skilled workers. The returns to
 experience for unskilled workers are small and insignificant after 2 years
 of experience. Their returns to sector tenure are also zero. However,
 their returns to firm tenure are substantial.  Copyright 2005, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Input Chains and Industrialization 
Abstract:
 A key aspect of industrialization is the adoption of
 increasing-returns-to-scale, industrial, technologies. Two other
 well-documented aspects are that industrial technologies (ITs) are adopted
 throughout intermediate-input chains and that they use intermediate inputs
 intensively relative to the technologies they replace. These features of
 ITs combined imply that countries with access to similar technologies may
 have very different levels of industrialization and aggregate income, even
 if the degree of increasing returns to scale at the firm level is
 relatively small. Furthermore, a minor improvement in the productivity of
 ITs can trigger full-scale industrialization and a large increase in
 aggregate income.  Copyright 2002, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Educational Financing and Lifetime Earnings 
Abstract:
 This paper formulates and estimates a dynamic programming model of optimal
 educational financing decisions. The main purpose of the paper is to
 measure the effect of short-term parental cash transfers, received during
 school, on educational borrowing and in-school work decisions, and on
 post-graduation lifetime earnings. The estimated parameters of the model
 imply that parental cash transfers do not significantly influence
 post-graduation lifetime earnings. Long-term factors such as family
 background and prior human capital investments are more important.
 Parental cash transfers do, however, significantly determine the decision
 to borrow or work during school and the level of lifetime consumption.  Copyright 2004, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Consideration Sets and Competitive Marketing 
Abstract:
 We study a market model in which competing firms use costly marketing
 devices to influence the set of alternatives which consumers perceive as
 relevant. Consumers in our model are boundedly rational in the sense that
 they have an imperfect perception of what is relevant to their decision
 problem. They apply well-defined preferences to a "consideration set",
 which is a function of the marketing devices employed by the firms. We
 examine the implications of this behavioural model in the context of a
 competitive market model, particularly on industry profits, vertical
 product differentiation, the use of marketing devices, and consumers'
 conversion rates.  Copyright 2011, Oxford University Press.

Title: How Efficiently is Capital Allocated? Evidence from the Knitted Garment Industry in Tirupur 
Abstract:
 This paper studies the effect of community identity on investment
 behaviour in the knitted garment industry in the South Indian town of
 Tirupur. We document very large and systematic differences in both levels
 of capital stock and the capital intensity of production in firms owned by
 people from two different community groups. We argue that the differences
 in investment cannot be explained by productivity differences alone. We
 suggest that the most likely explanation is that the two communities
 differ in their access to capital.  Copyright 2004, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Urban Structure and Growth 
Abstract:
 Most economic activity occurs in cities. This creates a tension between
 local increasing returns, implied by the existence of cities, and
 aggregate constant returns, implied by balanced growth. To address this
 tension, we develop a general equilibrium theory of economic growth in an
 urban environment. In our theory, variation in the urban structure through
 the growth, birth, and death of cities is the margin that eliminates local
 increasing returns to yield constant returns to scale in the aggregate. We
 show that, consistent with the data, the theory produces a city size
 distribution that is well approximated by Zipf's law, but that also
 displays the observed systematic underrepresentation of both very small
 and very large cities. Using our model, we show that the dispersion of
 city sizes is consistent with the dispersion of productivity shocks found
 in the data.  Copyright 2007, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Discretionary Policy and Multiple Equilibria in LQ RE Models 
Abstract:
 We study stationary discretionary equilibria in dynamic linear-quadratic
 rational expectations models. Past papers have assumed that this is
 uniquely determined; we show that such models can have multiple equilibria
 in some situations. We demonstrate the existence of multiple discretionary
 equilibria using a number of examples of increasing complexity and discuss
 their potential to explain interesting economic phenomena. We investigate
 the general properties of discretionary equilibria and discuss the design
 implications for the numerical algorithms needed to find them.  Copyright , Oxford University Press.

Title: Training, Wages, and Sample Selection: Estimating Sharp Bounds on Treatment Effects 
Abstract:
 This paper empirically assesses the wage effects of the Job Corps program,
 one of the largest federally funded job training programs in the U.S. Even
 with the aid of a randomized experiment, the impact of a training program
 on wages is difficult to study because of sample selection, a pervasive
 problem in applied microeconometric research. Wage rates are only observed
 for those who are employed, and employment status itself may be affected
 by the training program. This paper develops an intuitive trimming
 procedure for bounding average treatment effects in the presence of sample
 selection. In contrast to existing methods, the procedure requires neither
 exclusion restrictions nor a bounded support for the outcome of interest.
 Identification results, estimators, and their asymptotic distribution are
 presented. The bounds suggest that the program raised wages, consistent
 with the notion that the Job Corps raises earnings by increasing human
 capital, rather than solely through encouraging work. The estimator is
 generally applicable to typical treatment evaluation problems in which
 there is nonrandom sample selection/attrition.  Copyright , Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Labour-Market Matching with Precautionary Savings and Aggregate Fluctuations 
Abstract:
 We analyse a Bewley-Huggett-Aiyagari incomplete-markets model with
 labour-market frictions. Consumers are subject to idiosyncratic employment
 shocks against which they cannot insure directly. The labour market has a
 Diamond-Mortensen-Pissarides structure: firms enter by posting vacancies
 and match with workers bilaterally, with match probabilities given by an
 aggregate matching function. Wages are determined through Nash bargaining.
 We also consider aggregate productivity shocks and a complete set of
 contingent claims conditional on this risk. We use the model to evaluate a
 tax-financed unemployment insurance scheme. Higher insurance is beneficial
 for consumption smoothing, but because it raises workers' outside option
 value, it discourages firm entry. We find that the latter effect is more
 potent for welfare outcomes; we tabulate the effects quantitatively for
 different kinds of consumers. We also demonstrate that productivity
 changes in the model&#x02014;in steady state as well as stochastic
 ones&#x02014;generate rather limited unemployment effects, unless workers
 are close to indifferent between working and not working; thus, recent
 findings are corroborated in our more general setting.  Copyright , Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Land Tenancy and Non-Contractible Investment in Rural Pakistan 
Abstract:
 Commitment failure lies at the core of incomplete contract theory, yet its
 quantitative significance has rarely been assessed. Using detailed
 plot-level data from rural Pakistan, we find that non-contractible
 investment is underprovided on tenanted land, even after controlling for
 the endogeneity of leasing decisions. Our evidence also indicates that
 moral hazard in investment effort alone cannot explain this inefficiency.
 Instead, imperfect commitment appears to be the driving mechanism, since
 even plots taken on fixed rent contracts where all the rent is paid
 upfront receive lower investment than owner-cultivated plots. We further
 show that a considerable portion of the variation in tenancy duration, and
 hence in the security of tenure, is due to heterogeneity across landlords.
 One interpretation of this finding is that landlord reputation is
 important in mitigating hold-up.  Copyright 2008, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Voting on Majority Rules 
Abstract:
 We analyse an overlapping generations model of voting on "reform
 projects". These resemble investments in that they first require some
 investment expenditure and later payoff. Since the time during which old
 people get the benefit is shorter, or because older people are more
 wealthy and hence pay more taxes, they are more conservative (against
 reforms) than young people.We show that if people vote on which majority
 should be required in future elections for a bill to become a law, the
 winning proposal specifies a supermajority. This result is very robust
 even if age related conflict is only one determinant among others for
 voting behaviour in the society.  Copyright 2004, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: A Model of TFP 
Abstract:
 This paper proposes an aggregative model of total factor productivity
 (TFP) in the spirit of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Houthakker
 (1955-1956)</xref>. It considers a frictional labour market where
 production units are subject to idiosyncratic shocks and jobs are created
 and destroyed as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Mortensen and
 Pissarides (1994)</xref>. An aggregate production function is derived by
 aggregating across micro-production units in equilibrium. The level of TFP
 is explicitly shown to depend on the underlying distribution of shocks as
 well as on all the characteristics of the labour market as summarized by
 the job-destruction decision. The model is also used to study the effects
 of labour-market policies on the level of measured TFP.  Copyright 2006, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Non-Parametric Identification and Estimation of Truncated Regression Models 
Abstract:
 In this paper, we consider non-parametric identification and estimation of
 truncated regression models in both cross-sectional and panel data
 settings. For the cross-sectional case, Lewbel and Linton (2002)
 considered non-parametric identification and estimation through continuous
 variation under a log-concavity condition on the error distribution. We
 obtain non-parametric identification under weaker conditions. In
 particular, we obtain non-parametric identification through discrete
 variation under a non-periodicity condition on the hazard function of the
 error distribution. Furthermore, we show that the presence of continuous
 regressors may lead to stronger identification results. Our non-parametric
 estimator is shown to be consistent and asymptotically normal, and
 outperforms that of Lewbel and Linton (2002) in a simulation study. For
 the panel data setting, we provide the first systematic treatment of
 non-parametric identification and estimation of the truncated panel data
 model with fixed effects by extending our treatment of the cross-sectional
 case. We also consider various other extensions.  Copyright , Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Uncertainty and Investment Dynamics 
Abstract:
 This paper shows that with (partial) irreversibility higher uncertainty
 reduces the responsiveness of investment to demand shocks. Uncertainty
 increases real option values making firms more cautious when investing or
 disinvesting. This is confirmed both numerically for a model with a rich
 mix of adjustment costs, time-varying uncertainty, and aggregation over
 investment decisions and time and also empirically for a panel of
 manufacturing firms. These &#x201C;cautionary effects&#x201D; of
 uncertainty are large&#x2014;going from the lower quartile to the upper
 quartile of the uncertainty distribution typically halves the first year
 investment response to demand shocks. This implies the responsiveness of
 firms to any given policy stimulus may be much weaker in periods of high
 uncertainty, such as after the 1973 oil crisis and September 11, 2001.  Copyright 2007, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Quantile Maximization in Decision Theory<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN16">*</xref> 
Abstract:
 This paper introduces a model of preferences, in which, given beliefs
 about uncertain outcomes, an individual evaluates an action by a quantile
 of the induced distribution. The choice rule of Quantile Maximization
 unifies maxmin and maxmax as maximizing the lowest and the highest
 quantiles of beliefs distributions, respectively, and offers a family of
 less extreme preferences. Taking preferences over acts as a primitive, we
 axiomatize Quantile Maximization in a Savage setting. Our axiomatization
 also provides a novel derivation of subjective beliefs, which demonstrates
 that neither the monotonicity nor the continuity conditions assumed in the
 literature are essential for probabilistic sophistication. We characterize
 preferences of quantile maximizers towards downside risk. We discuss how
 the distinct properties of the model, robustness and ordinality, can be
 useful in studying choice behaviour for categorical variables and in
 economic policy design. We also offer applications to poll design and
 insurance problems.  Copyright , Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Measuring Peer Effects on Youth Smoking Behaviour 
Abstract:
 This paper examines the role of peer effects in teenagers' smoking
 behaviour in the U.S.A. I present a random utility model that incorporates
 complementarity between individual and peer smoking. A Markov process
 model of smoking interactions between individuals is presented. I estimate
 the structural parameters of the model using a steady-state distribution
 that is determined by the Markov process. The empirical results strongly
 support the presence of positive peer effects. Interestingly, peer
 interactions are found to be stronger within the same gender than across
 genders. The same result is found for race. Moreover, a multiplier effect
 is found.  Copyright 2007, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Limited Depth of Reasoning and Failure of Cascade Formation in the Laboratory 
Abstract:
 We examine the robustness of information cascades in laboratory
 experiments. Apart from the situation in which each player can obtain a
 signal for free (as in the experiment by <xref ref-type="bibr"
 rid="R1">Anderson and Holt (1997)</xref>, American Economic Review, 87
 (5), 847-862), the case of costly signals is studied where players decide
 whether or not to obtain private information, at a small but positive
 cost. In the equilibrium of this game, only the first player buys a signal
 and makes a decision based on this information whereas all following
 players do not buy a signal and herd behind the first player. The
 experimental results show that too many signals are bought and the
 equilibrium prediction performs poorly. To explain these observations, the
 depth of the subjects' reasoning process is estimated, using a statistical
 error-rate model. Allowing for different error rates on different levels
 of reasoning, we find that the subjects' inferences become significantly
 more noisy on higher levels of the thought process, and that only short
 chains of reasoning are applied by the subjects.  Copyright 2004, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Dynamic Optimal Taxation with Private Information 
Abstract:
 We study dynamic optimal taxation in a class of economies with private
 information. Optimal allocations in these environments are complicated and
 history-dependent. Yet, we show that they can be implemented as
 competitive equilibria in market economies supplemented with simple tax
 systems. The market structure in these economies is similar to that in
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Bewley (1986)</xref>; agents supply labour
 and trade risk-free claims to future consumption, subject to a budget
 constraint and a debt limit. Optimal taxes are conditioned only on two
 observable characteristics&#x2014;an agent's accumulated stock of claims,
 or wealth, and her current labour income. We show that optimal taxes are
 generally non-linear and non-separable in these variables and relate the
 structure of marginal wealth and income taxation to the properties of
 agent preferences.  Copyright 2006, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Wishful Thinking in Strategic Environments 
Abstract:
 Towards developing a theory of systematic biases about strategies, I
 analyse strategic implications of a particular bias: wishful thinking
 about the strategies. I identify a player as a wishful thinker if she
 hopes to enjoy the highest pay-off that is consistent with her information
 about the others' strategies. I develop a straightforward elimination
 process that characterizes the strategy profiles that are consistent with
 wishful thinking, mutual knowledge of wishful thinking, and so on. Every
 pure-strategy Nash equilibrium is consistent with common knowledge of
 wishful thinking. For generic two-person games, I further show that the
 pure Nash equilibrium strategies are the only strategies that are
 consistent with common knowledge of wishful thinking. My analysis also
 illustrates how one can characterize the strategic implications of general
 decision rules using the tools of game theory.  Copyright 2007, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Campaign Advertising and Voter Welfare 
Abstract:
 This paper investigates the role of campaign advertising and the
 opportunity of legal restrictions on it. An electoral race is modelled as
 a signalling game with three classes of players: many voters, two
 candidates, and one interest group. The group has non-verifiable insider
 information on the candidates' quality and, on the basis of this
 information, offers a contribution to each candidate in exchange for a
 favourable policy position. Candidates spend the contributions they
 receive on non-directly informative advertising. This paper shows that:
 (1) a separating equilibrium exists in which the group contributes to a
 candidate only if the insider information about that candidate is
 positive; (2) although voters are fully rational, a ban on campaign
 advertising can be welfare-improving; and (3) split contributions may
 arise in equilibrium (and, if they arise too often, they are detrimental
 to voters).  Copyright 2002, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Optimal Lending Contracts and Firm Dynamics 
Abstract:
 We develop a general model of lending in the presence of endogenous
 borrowing constraints. Borrowing constraints arise because borrowers face
 limited liability and debt repayment cannot be perfectly enforced. In the
 model, the dynamics of debt are closely linked with the dynamics of
 borrowing constraints. In fact, borrowing constraints must satisfy a
 dynamic consistency requirement: the value of outstanding debt restricts
 current access to short-term capital, but is itself determined by future
 access to credit. This dynamic consistency is not guaranteed in models of
 exogenous borrowing constraints, where the ability to raise short-term
 capital is limited by some prespecified function of debt. We characterize
 the optimal default-free contract&#x02014;which minimizes borrowing
 constraints at all histories&#x02014;and derive implications for firm
 growth, survival, leverage and debt maturity. The model is qualitatively
 consistent with stylized facts on the growth and survival of firms.
 Comparative statics with respect to technology and default constraints are
 derived.  Copyright 2004, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Efficient Mechanisms for Public Goods with Use Exclusions 
Abstract:
 Constrained efficient provision of an excludable public good is studied in
 a model where preferences are private information. The provision level is
 asymptotically deterministic, making it possible to approximate the
 optimal mechanism with a mechanism that provides a fixed quantity of the
 good and charges fixed user fees for access. In general, the fixed fees
 involve third degree price discrimination, but, if names are uninformative
 about preferences, the analysis provides a justification for average cost
 pricing.  Copyright 2004, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Multi-Product Firms and Flexible Manufacturing in the Global Economy 
Abstract:
 We present a new model of multi-product firms (MPFs) and flexible
 manufacturing, and explore its implications in partial and general
 oligopolistic equilibrium. Globalization affects the scale and scope (or
 intensive margin and intra-firm extensive margin) of MPFs through a
 competition effect and a demand effect. The model highlights a new source
 of gains from trade: productivity increases as firms become "leaner and
 meaner", concentrating on their core competence; but also a new source of
 losses from trade: product variety may fall. Our results also hold under
 free entry, which allows in addition for adjustment along the traditional
 inter-firm extensive margin.  Copyright , Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Contracting Productivity Growth 
Abstract:
 This paper analyses the interactions between growth and the contracting
 environment in production. With incompleteness in contracting, viable
 production relationships between firms and workers, and therefore the
 profitability of industries, depend on the rates of innovation and growth.
 The speed at which new innovations arrive in turn depends on the
 profitability of production, for the usual reasons examined in the
 endogenous growth literature. We show that these interactions can have
 important implications which are consistent with observed phenomena in
 both the micro and macro environments. In particular, we demonstrate that
 a technological shock (increasing productivity of research) can, through
 this interaction, lead to a productivity slowdown and a shift in labour
 market contracts away from firms providing implicit guarantees of lifetime
 employment and towards shorter-term &#x201C;contractor&#x201D; type
 arrangements. We show the consistency of an increase in the proportion of
 the labour force under short-term employment, increased relative returns
 of workers in high-productivity sectors, and increased income inequality,
 with a productivity slowdown of finite duration.  Copyright 2003, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: A Model of Capital and Crises 
Abstract:
 We develop a model in which the capital of the intermediary sector plays a
 critical role in determining asset prices. The model is cast within a
 dynamic general equilibrium economy, and the role for intermediation is
 derived endogenously based on optimal contracting considerations. Low
 intermediary capital reduces the risk-bearing capacity of the marginal
 investor. We show how this force helps to explain patterns during
 financial crises. The model replicates the observed rise during crises in
 Sharpe ratios, conditional volatility, correlation in price movements of
 assets held by the intermediary sector, and fall in riskless interest
 rates.  Copyright 2012, Oxford University Press.

Title: Learning by Holding and Liquidity 
Abstract:
 A number of assets do not trade publicly but are sold to a restricted
 group of investors who subsequently receive private information from the
 issuers. Thus, the holders of such privately placed assets learn more
 quickly about their assets than other agents. This paper studies the
 pricing implications of this "learning by holding". In an economy in which
 investors are price takers and risk-neutral, and absent any insider
 trading or other transaction costs, we show that risky assets command an
 excess expected return over safe assets in the presence of learning by
 holding. This is reminiscent of the "credit spread puzzle"&#x02014;the
 large spread between BBB-rated and AAA-rated corporate bonds that is not
 explained by historical defaults, risk aversion, or trading frictions. The
 intuition is that the seller of a risky bond needs to offer a
 "coordination premium" that helps potential buyers overcome their fear of
 future illiquidity. Absent this premium, this fear could become
 self-justified in the presence of learning by holding because a future
 lemons problem deters current market participation, and this in turn
 vindicates the fear of a future lemons problem.  Copyright , Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Efficient Intra-Household Allocations and Distribution Factors: Implications and Identification 
Abstract:
 This paper provides an exhaustive characterization of testability and
 identifiability issues in the collective framework in the absence of price
 variation; it thus provides a theoretical underpinning for a number of
 empirical works that have been developed recently. We first provide a
 simple and general test of the Pareto-efficiency hypothesis, which is
 consistent with all possible assumptions on the private or public nature
 of goods, all possible consumption externalities between household
 members, and all types of interdependent individual preferences and
 domestic production technology. The test is proved to be necessary and
 sufficient. We then provide conditions for the identification of the
 sharing rule and the Engel curves of individual household members for a
 variety of different observational schemes.  Copyright , Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Consensus Consumer and Intertemporal Asset Pricing with Heterogeneous Beliefs 
Abstract:
 The aim of this paper is to analyse the impact of heterogeneous beliefs in
 an otherwise standard competitive complete market economy. The
 construction of a consensus probability belief, as well as a consensus
 consumer, is shown to be valid modulo an aggregation bias, which takes the
 form of a discount factor. In classical cases, the consensus probability
 belief is a risk tolerance weighted average of the individual beliefs, and
 the discount factor is proportional to beliefs dispersion. This discount
 factor makes the heterogeneous beliefs setting fundamentally different
 from the homogeneous beliefs setting, and it is consistent with the
 interpretation of beliefs heterogeneity as a source of risk.We then use
 our construction to rewrite in a simple way the equilibrium
 characteristics (market price of risk, risk premium, risk-free rate) in a
 heterogeneous beliefs framework and to analyse the impact of beliefs
 heterogeneity. Finally, we show that it is possible to construct specific
 parametrizations of the heterogeneous beliefs model that lead to globally
 higher risk premia and lower risk-free rates.  Copyright 2007, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Balance Sheet Effects, Bailout Guarantees and Financial Crises 
Abstract:
 This paper provides a model of boom-bust episodes in middle-income
 countries. It is based on sectoral differences in corporate finance: the
 nontradables sector is special in that it faces a contract enforceability
 problem and enjoys bailout guarantees. As a result, currency mismatch and
 borrowing constraints arise endogenously in that sector. This sectoral
 asymmetry allows the model to replicate the main features of observed
 boom-bust episodes. In particular, episodes begin with a lending boom and
 a real appreciation, peak in a self-fulfilling crisis during which a real
 depreciation coincides with widespread bankruptcies, and end in a
 recession and credit crunch. The nontradables sector accounts for most of
 the volatility in output and credit.  Copyright 2004, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Groupthink: Collective Delusions in Organizations and Markets 
Abstract:
 This article investigates collective denial and willful blindness in
 groups, organizations, and markets. Agents with anticipatory preferences,
 linked through an interaction structure, choose how to interpret and
 recall public signals about future prospects. Wishful thinking (denial of
 bad news) is shown to be contagious when it is harmful to others, and
 self-limiting when it is beneficial. Similarly, with Kreps--Porteus
 preferences, willful blindness (information avoidance) spreads when it
 increases the risks borne by others. This general mechanism can generate
 multiple social cognitions of reality, and in hierarchies it implies that
 realism and delusion will trickle down from the leaders. The welfare
 analysis differentiates group morale from groupthink and identifies a
 fundamental tension in organizations' attitudes towards dissent.
 Contagious exuberance can also seize asset markets, generating investment
 frenzies and crashes.  Copyright 2013, Oxford University Press.

Title: Das Human-Kapital: A Theory of the Demise of the Class Structure 
Abstract:
 This paper suggests that the demise of the capitalists&#x2014;workers
 class structure was a socio-economic transformation orchestrated by the
 capitalists in reaction to the increasing importance of human capital in
 sustaining their profit rates. Physical capital accumulation in the
 process of industrialization enhanced the importance of human capital in
 production and generated incentives for capitalists to support the
 provision of public education for the masses, triggering the demise of the
 existing class structure. The implications of the theory are consistent
 with the voting patterns on England's education reform of 1902.  Copyright 2006, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Inefficiencies from Metropolitan Political and Fiscal Decentralization: Failures of Tiebout Competition 
Abstract:
 We examine the welfare effects of provision of local public goods in an
 empirically relevant setting using a multi-community model with mobile and
 heterogeneous households and with flexible housing supplies. We
 characterize the first-best allocation and show efficiency can be
 implemented with decentralization using head taxes. We calibrate the model
 and compare welfare in property-tax equilibria, both decentralized and
 centralized, to the efficient allocation. Inefficiencies with
 decentralization and property taxation are large, dissipating most if not
 all the potential welfare gains that efficient decentralization could
 achieve. In property-tax equilibrium, centralization is frequently more
 efficient! An externality in community choice underlies the failure to
 achieve efficiency with decentralization and property taxes: poorer
 households crowd richer communities and free ride by consuming relatively
 little housing thereby avoiding taxes.  Copyright , Oxford University Press.

Title: Why are Married Men Working So Much? An Aggregate Analysis of Intra-Household Bargaining and Labour Supply 
Abstract:
 Are macro-economists mistaken in ignoring bargaining between spouses? This
 article argues that models of intra-household allocation could be useful
 for understanding aggregate labour supply trends in the U.S. since the
 1970s. A simple calculation suggests that the standard model without
 bargaining predicts a 19% decline in married-male labour supply in
 response to the narrowing of the gender gap in wages since the 1970s.
 However married-men's paid labour remained stationary over the period from
 the mid 1970s to the recession of 2001. This article develops and
 calibrates to U.S. time-use survey data a model of marital bargaining in
 which time allocations are determined jointly with equilibrium marriage
 and divorce rates. The results suggest that bargaining effects raised
 married-men's labour supply by about 2.1 weekly hours over the period, and
 reduced that of married women by 2.7 hours. Bargaining therefore has a
 relatively small impact on aggregate labour supply, but is critical for
 trends in female labour supply. Also, the narrowing of the gender wage gap
 is found to account for a weekly 1.5 hour increase in aggregate labour
 supply.  Copyright 2013, Oxford University Press.

Title: Labour Relations and Asset Returns 
Abstract:
 This paper proposes a dynamic GE model with standard business cycle
 properties that also achieves a satisfactory replication of the major
 financial stylized facts. We ride on two major ideas. First, we show that
 operating leverage, originating in the priority status of wage claims
 given the observed business cycle characteristics of the latter, magnifies
 the risk properties of the residual payments to firm owners and justifies
 a substantial risk premium. Further we build on the observation that the
 low frequency variations in income shares constitute a significant source
 of risk, one that is unlikely to be insurable. When we price this risk in
 an incomplete market framework, we obtain a GE model with return
 volatilities close to observations and a sizable equity premium. This is
 accomplished in a world of low risk aversion and standard utility function
 but with agent heterogeneity. Workers with restricted access to financial
 markets are insured by firms and the consumption and preferences of firm
 owners solely determine the pricing kernel.  Copyright 2002, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Foundations of Dominant-Strategy Mechanisms 
Abstract:
 Robert Wilson criticizes applied game theory's reliance on
 common-knowledge assumptions. In reaction to Wilson's critique, the recent
 literature of mechanism design has adopted the goal of finding detail-free
 mechanisms in order to eliminate this reliance. In practice this has meant
 restricting attention to simple mechanisms such as dominant-strategy
 mechanisms. However, there has been little theoretical foundation for this
 approach. In particular it is not clear the search for an optimal
 mechanism that does not rely on common-knowledge assumption would lead to
 simpler mechanisms rather than more complicated ones. This paper tries to
 fill the void. In the context of an expected revenue maximizing
 auctioneer, we investigate some foundations for using simple,
 dominant-strategy auctions.  Copyright 2007, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: The Three Horsemen of Riches: Plague, War, and Urbanization in Early Modern Europe 
Abstract:
 How did Europe escape the "Iron Law of Wages?" We construct a simple
 Malthusian model with two sectors and multiple steady states, and use it
 to explain why European per capita incomes and urbanization rates
 increased during the period 1350--1700. Productivity growth can only
 explain a small fraction of the rise in output per capita. Population
 dynamics--changes of the birth and death schedules--were far more
 important determinants of steady states. We show how a major shock to
 population can trigger a transition to a new steady state with higher
 per-capita income. The Black Death was such a shock, raising wages
 substantially. Because of Engel's Law, demand for urban products
 increased, and urban centers grew in size. European cities were unhealthy,
 and rising urbanization pushed up aggregate death rates. This effect was
 reinforced by diseases spread through war, financed by higher tax
 revenues. In addition, rising trade also spread diseases. In this way
 higher wages themselves reduced population pressure. We show in a
 calibration exercise that our model can account for the sustained rise in
 European urbanization as well as permanently higher per capita incomes in
 1700, without technological change. Wars contributed importantly to the
 "Rise of Europe", even if they had negative short-run effects. We thus
 trace Europe's precocious rise to economic riches to interactions of the
 plague shock with the belligerent political environment and the nature of
 cities.  Copyright 2013, Oxford University Press.

Title: The Right Man for the Job 
Abstract:
 This paper describes a search model with a continuum of worker and job
 types, free entry and transferable utility. We apply a second-order Taylor
 expansion to characterize the equilibrium, derive the "cost of search" and
 show that it is decreasing in the substitutability of worker types. This
 cost of search is then decomposed into three components: unemployment,
 vacancy costs and mismatch. Our contact technology rules out congestion
 effects between different worker types and therefore exhibits increasing
 returns to scale. One third of those increasing returns in contacts are
 shown to be absorbed by firms and workers being more choosy. The resulting
 equilibrium is not efficient. Unemployment benefits can reduce the loss by
 serving as a search subsidy. Numerical simulations of the model show that
 our Taylor expansions are quite accurate.  Copyright 2004, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Climate Contracts: A Game of Emissions, Investments, Negotiations, and Renegotiations 
Abstract:
 The paper presents a dynamic game where players contribute to a public
 bad, invest in technologies, and write incomplete contracts. Despite the n
 &plus; 1 stocks in the model, the analysis is tractable and the symmetric
 Markov perfect equilibrium unique. If only the contribution levels are
 contractible, then investments are suboptimally small if the contract is
 short term or close to its expiration date. To encourage investments, the
 optimal contract is more ambitious if it is short term, and it is tougher
 to satisfy close to its expiration date and for players with small
 investment costs. If renegotiation is possible, such an incomplete
 contract implements the first-best. The framework helps to analyse
 emissions, investments, and international environmental agreements, and
 the results have important lessons for how to design a climate treaty.  Copyright , Oxford University Press.

Title: Housing Liquidity, Mobility, and the Labour Market 
Abstract:
 We study the interactions among geographical mobility, unemployment, and
 home-ownership in an economy with heterogeneous locations, endogenous
 construction, and search frictions in the markets for both labour and
 housing. The decision of home-owners to accept job offers from other
 cities depends on how quickly they can sell their houses (i.e. the houses'
 liquidity), which in turn depends on local labour market conditions.
 Consequently, home-owners accept job offers from other cities at a lower
 rate than do renters, generating a link between home-ownership and
 unemployment both at the city level and in the aggregate. When calibrated
 to match aggregate U.S. statistics on mobility, housing, and labour flows,
 the model predicts that the effect of home-ownership on aggregate
 unemployment is small. When unemployment is high, however, changes in the
 rate of home-ownership can have economically significant effects.  Copyright , Oxford University Press.

Title: Intrinsic and Extrinsic Motivation 
Abstract:
 A central tenet of economics is that individuals respond to incentives.
 For psychologists and sociologists, in contrast, rewards and punishments
 are often counterproductive, because they undermine "intrinsic
 motivation". We reconcile these two views, showing how performance
 incentives offered by an informed principal (manager, teacher, parent) can
 adversely impact an agent's (worker, child) perception of the task, or of
 his own abilities. Incentives are then only weak reinforcers in the short
 run, and negative reinforcers in the long run. We also study the effects
 of empowerment, help and excuses on motivation, as well as situations of
 ego bashing reflecting a battle for dominance within a relationship.  Copyright 2003, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Asymmetric Cycles 
Abstract:
 I estimate a model in which new technology entails random adjustment
 needs. Rapid adjustments may cause measured productivity to decline. The
 slow-downs persist because adjustment is costly, and hence protracted. The
 model explains both the &#x201C;steepness&#x201D; and the
 &#x201C;deepness&#x201D; asymmetry of cycles. Adjustment costs amount to
 about 14&#x0025; of output and technological inefficiency to about
 28&#x0025;. Firms abandon technologies long before they are
 perfected&#x2014;current practice total factor productivity (TFP) is
 20&#x0025; below its maximal level.  Copyright 2006, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Optimal Taxation when Consumers Have Endogenous Benchmark Levels of Consumption 
Abstract:
 I examine optimal taxes in an overlapping generations economy in which
 each consumer's utility depends on consumption relative to a weighted
 average of consumption by others (the benchmark level of consumption) as
 well as on the level of the consumer's own consumption. The socially
 optimal balanced growth path is characterized by the Modified Golden Rule
 and by a condition on the intergenerational allocation of consumption in
 each period. A competitive economy can be induced to attain the social
 optimum by a lump-sum pay-as-you-go social security system and a tax on
 capital income.  Copyright 2005, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Networking off Madison Avenue 
Abstract:
 This paper studies the advertising agency industry in Manhattan to infer
 networking benefits among agencies in close spatial proximity. We use
 economic census data that allow us to distinguish locations at a fine
 level of geographic detail, so as to infer the strong effect on
 productivity of having more near advertising agency neighbours. Paying
 close attention to identification issues, we show, however, that there is
 extremely rapid spatial decay in the benefits of more near neighbours,
 even in the close quarters of southern Manhattan, a finding that is new to
 the literature. This suggests that high density of similar commercial
 establishments is important in enhancing local productivity for those
 industries found in large cities, where information sharing plays a
 critical role. Our results indicate that the benefits of more near
 neighbours are largely capitalized into rents rather than wages,
 challenging an existing literature, which estimates wage equations alone
 to infer agglomeration benefits.  Copyright 2008, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Learning by Doing vs. Learning About Match Quality: Can We Tell Them Apart? 
Abstract:
 Understanding the accumulation of match-specific capital is crucial in
 shedding light on the reasons for the prevalence of long-term employment
 relationships and on the welfare consequences of turnover in the labour
 market. One of the most important sources of match-specific capital is
 human capital acquired through match-specific learning. Such learning can
 take on two distinct forms. In the first case, workers accumulate
 match-specific human capital through learning by doing. In the second
 case, a worker and a firm in an employment relationship learn about the
 quality of the match over time, thereby acquiring valuable information. I
 construct a structural model that embeds these two learning explanations
 and show that it is possible to distinguish the two by using turnover data
 on employing firms coupled with data on workers. I use a French matched
 employer&#x2014;employee data-set to estimate the structural model using
 the Efficient Method of Moments, a simulation-based estimation method. I
 find that, while learning by doing may be present during the first six
 months of an employment relationship, learning about match quality
 dominates at longer tenures. This finding has important consequences for
 the understanding of the sources of match-specific capital and for the
 desirability of policies that alter the incentives for turnover for
 workers of different tenure.  Copyright 2007, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: International Equity Flows and Returns: A Quantitative Equilibrium Approach<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN1">-super-1</xref> 
Abstract:
 This paper considers the role of foreign investors in developed country
 equity markets. It presents a quantitative model of trading that is built
 around two new assumptions about investor sophistication: (i) both the
 foreign and domestic populations contain investors with superior
 information sets; and (ii) these knowledgeable investors have access to
 both public equity markets and private investment opportunities. The model
 delivers a unified explanation for three stylized facts about U.S.
 investors' international equity trades: (i) trading by U.S. investors
 occurs in waves of simultaneous buying and selling; (ii) U.S. investors
 build and unwind foreign equity positions gradually; and (iii) U.S.
 investors increase their market share in a country when stock prices there
 have recently been rising. The results suggest that heterogeneity within
 the foreign investor population is much more important than heterogeneity
 of investors across countries.  Copyright 2007, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Dividing Online and Offline: A Case Study 
Abstract:
 Every new method of trade offers an opportunity for economic agents to
 compare its costs and benefits relative to the status quo. Such comparison
 motivates sorting across market segments and reshapes the whole
 marketplace. The Internet provides an excellent example: it introduces
 substantial search cost savings over brick and mortar retail stores but
 imposes new obstacles for sellers to convey quality. Using sports card
 trading as a case study, we provide empirical evidence on (1) the sorting
 of product quality between the online and offline segments, (2) the
 changes for retail outlets after the Internet came into place, and (3) how
 supporting industries such as professional grading and card manufacturing
 adapted to take advantage of the new market.  Copyright 2007, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: When is it Optimal to Abandon a Fixed Exchange Rate?<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN1">-super-1</xref> 
Abstract:
 The influential Krugman-Flood-Garber (KFG) model of balance of payment
 crises assumes that a fixed exchange rate is abandoned if and only if
 international reserves reach a critical threshold value. From a positive
 standpoint, the KFG rule is at odds with many episodes in which the
 central bank has plenty of international reserves at the time of
 abandonment. We study the optimal exit policy and show that from a
 normative standpoint, the KFG rule is generally suboptimal. We consider a
 model in which the fixed exchange rate regime has become unsustainable due
 to an unexpected increase in government spending. We show that when there
 are no exit costs, it is optimal to abandon immediately. When there are
 exit costs, the optimal abandonment time is a decreasing function of the
 size of the fiscal shock. For large fiscal shocks, immediate abandonment
 is optimal. Our model is consistent with evidence suggesting that many
 countries exit fixed exchange rate regimes with still plenty of
 international reserves in the central bank's vault.  Copyright 2008, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Monetary Policy in the Open Economy Revisited: Price Setting and Exchange-Rate Flexibility 
Abstract:
 This paper develops a welfare-based model of monetary policy in an open
 economy. We examine the optimal monetary policy under commitment, focusing
 on the nature of price adjustment in determining policy. We investigate
 the implications of these policies for exchange-rate flexibility. The
 traditional approach maintains that exchange-rate flexibility is desirable
 in the presence of real country-specific shocks that require adjustment in
 relative prices. However, in the light of empirical evidence on nominal
 price response to exchange-rate changes&#x02014;specifically, that there
 appears to be a large degree of local-currency pricing (LCP) in
 industrialized countries&#x02014;the expenditure-switching role played by
 nominal exchange rates may be exaggerated in the traditional literature.
 In the presence of LCP, we find that the optimal monetary policy leads to
 a fixed exchange rate, even in the presence of country-specific shocks.
 This is true whether monetary policy is chosen cooperatively or
 non-cooperatively among countries.  Copyright 2003, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Strategic Monetary Policy with Non-Atomistic Wage Setters 
Abstract:
 Monetary policy analyses usually assume an atomistic private sector,
 thereby ignoring potential interactions between policy and wage-setting
 decisions. Yet, non-atomistic wage setters are a key feature of several
 industrialized economies. We study the economic consequence of
 non-atomistic agents and show that this qualifies previous results on the
 effects and desirability of a conservative central banker. In particular,
 the central bank aversion to inflation may have a permanent effect on
 structural employment, while no such effect emerges with atomistic agents.  Copyright 2003, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Subjective Performance and the Value of Blind Evaluation 
Abstract:
 The incentive and project selection effects of agent anonymity are
 investigated in a setting where an evaluator observes a subjective signal
 of project quality. Although the evaluator cannot commit ex ante to an
 acceptance criterion, she decides up front between informed review, where
 the agent's ability is directly observable, or blind review, where it is
 not. An ideal acceptance criterion balances the goals of incentive
 provision and project selection. Relative to this, informed review results
 in an excessively steep equilibrium acceptance policy: the standard
 applied to low-ability agents is too stringent and the standard applied to
 high-ability agents is too lenient. Blind review, in which all types face
 the same standard, often provides better incentives, but it ignores
 valuable information for selecting projects. The evaluator prefers a
 policy of blind (respectively informed) review when the ability
 distribution puts more weight on high (respectively low) types, the
 agent's pay-off from acceptance is high (respectively low), or the quality
 signal is precise (respectively imprecise). Applications discussed include
 the admissibility of character evidence in criminal trials and academic
 refereeing.  Copyright 2011, Oxford University Press.

Title: Exogenous Information, Endogenous Information, and Optimal Monetary Policy 
Abstract:
 This article studies optimal monetary policy when decision-makers in firms
 choose how much attention they devote to aggregate conditions. When the
 amount of attention that decision-makers in firms devote to aggregate
 conditions is exogenous, complete price stabilization is optimal only in
 response to shocks that cause efficient fluctuations under perfect
 information. When decision-makers in firms choose how much attention they
 devote to aggregate conditions, complete price stabilization is optimal
 also in response to shocks that cause inefficient fluctuations under
 perfect information. Hence, recognizing that decision-makers in firms can
 choose how much attention they devote to aggregate conditions has major
 implications for optimal policy.  Copyright 2014, Oxford University Press.

Title: Identifying Sorting--In Theory 
Abstract:
 Assortative matching between workers and firms provides evidence of the
 complementarities or substitutes in production. The presence of
 complementarities is important for policies that aim to achieve the
 optimal allocation of resources, e.g. unemployment insurance. We argue
 that using wage data alone, it is virtually impossible to identify whether
 assortative matching is positive or negative. Even though we cannot
 identify the sign of the sorting, we can identify the strength, i.e. the
 magnitude of the cross-partial and the associated welfare loss. We first
 show that the wage for a given worker is non-monotonic in the type of his
 employer. This is due to the fact that in a sorting model, wages reflect
 the opportunity cost of mismatch. We analytically show that this
 non-monotonicity prevents standard firm fixed effects to correlate with
 the true type of the firm. We then propose an alternative procedure that
 measures the strength of sorting in the presence of search frictions.
 Knowing the strength of sorting facilitates the measurement of the output
 loss due to mismatch.  Copyright 2011, Oxford University Press.

Title: Social Decision Theory: Choosing within and between Groups 
Abstract:
 We study the behavioural foundation of interdependent preferences, where
 the outcomes of others affect the welfare of the decision maker. These
 preferences are taken as given, not derived from more primitive ones. Our
 aim is to establish an axiomatic foundation providing the link between
 observation of choices and a functional representation which is
 convenient, free of inconsistencies and can provide the basis for
 measurement. The dependence among preferences may take place in two
 conceptually different ways, expressing two different views of the nature
 of interdependent preferences. The first is Festinger's view that the
 evaluation of peers' outcomes is useful to improve individual choices by
 learning from the comparison. The second is Veblen's view that
 interdependent preferences keep track of social status derived from a
 social value attributed to the goods one consumes. Corresponding to these
 two different views, we have two different formulations. In the first, the
 decision maker values his outcomes and those of others on the basis of his
 own utility. In the second, he ranks outcomes according to a social value
 function. We give different axiomatic foundations to these two different,
 but complementary, views of the nature of the interdependence. On the
 basis of this axiomatic foundation, we build a behavioural theory of
 comparative statics within subjects and across subjects. We characterize
 preferences according to the relative importance assigned to gains and
 losses in social domain, that is pride and envy. This parallels the
 standard analysis of private gains and losses (as well as that of regret
 and relief). We give an axiomatic foundation of interpersonal comparison
 of preferences, ordering individuals according to their sensitivity to
 social ranking. These characterizations provide the behavioural foundation
 for applied analysis of market and game equilibria with interdependent
 preferences.  Copyright , Oxford University Press.

Title: To Segregate or to Integrate: Education Politics and Democracy 
Abstract:
 How is the quality of public education affected by the presence of private
 schools for the rich? Theory and evidence suggest that the link depends
 crucially on the political system. We develop a theory that integrates
 private education and fertility decisions with voting on public schooling
 expenditures. We find that the presence of a large private education
 sector benefits public schools in a broad-based democracy where
 politicians are responsive to low-income families but crowds out public
 education spending in a society that is politically dominated by the rich.
 The main predictions of the theory are consistent with state-level data
 and micro data from the U.S. as well as cross-country evidence from the
 Programme for International Student Assessment study.  Copyright , Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Are Preferential Trade Agreements with Non-trade Objectives a Stumbling Block for Multilateral Liberalization? 
Abstract:
 In many preferential trade agreements (PTAs), countries exchange not only
 reductions in trade barriers but also cooperation in non-trade issues such
 as labour and environmental standards, intellectual property, etc. We
 provide a model of PTAs motivated by cooperation in non-trade issues and
 analyse its implications for global free trade and welfare. We find that
 such PTAs increase the cost of multilateral tariff reductions and thus
 cause a stumbling block to global free trade. This occurs because
 multilateral tariff reductions decrease the threat that can be used in
 PTAs and thus the surplus that can be extracted from them. By explicitly
 modelling the interaction between preferential and multilateral
 negotiations, we derive a testable prediction and provide novel
 econometric evidence that supports the model's key prediction. The welfare
 analysis shows that the current World Trade Organization rules allowing
 this type of PTAs may be optimal for economically large countries, thus
 the model can predict the rules we observe. We also analyse alternative
 rules that constitute a Pareto improvement.  Copyright 2007, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Social Preferences, Skill Segregation, and Wage Dynamics 
Abstract:
 We study the earning structure and the equilibrium assignment of workers
 to firms in a model in which workers have social preferences, and skills
 are perfectly substitutable in production. Firms offer long-term
 contracts, and we allow for frictions in the labour market in the form of
 mobility costs. The model delivers specific predictions about the nature
 of worker flows, about the characteristics of workplace skill segregation,
 and about wage dispersion both within and across firms. We show that
 long-term contracts in the presence of social preferences associate
 within-firm wage dispersion with novel "internal labour market" features
 such as gradual promotions, productivity-unrelated wage increases, and
 downward wage flexibility. These three dynamic features lead to
 productivity-unrelated wage volatility within firms.  Copyright 2008, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Efficient Sorting in a Dynamic Adverse-Selection Model 
Abstract:
 We discuss a class of markets for durable goods where efficiency (or
 approximate efficiency) is obtained despite the presence of information
 asymmetries. In the model, the number of times a good has changed hands
 (the vintage of the good) is an accurate signal of its quality, each
 consumer self-selects into obtaining the vintage that the social planner
 would have assigned to her, and consumers' equilibrium trading behaviour
 in secondary markets is not subject to adverse selection. We show that
 producers have the incentive to choose contracts that lead to the
 efficient allocation, and to supply the efficient output. We also provide
 a contrast between leasing contracts, resale contracts, and different
 kinds of rental contracts. Resale contracts do not lead to the efficient
 allocation. A specific kind of rental contract provides the appropriate
 incentives to consumers.  Copyright 2005, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Contracting under Incomplete Information and Social Preferences: An Experimental Study 
Abstract:
 Principal--agent models in which the agent has access to private
 information before a contract is signed are a cornerstone of contract
 theory. We have conducted an experiment with 720 participants to explore
 whether the theoretical insights are reflected by the behaviour of
 subjects in the laboratory and to what extent deviations from standard
 theory can be explained by social preferences. Investigating settings with
 both exogenous and endogenous information structures, we find that agency
 theory is indeed useful to qualitatively predict how variations in the
 degree of uncertainty affect subjects' behaviour. Regarding the
 quantitative deviations from standard predictions, our analysis based on
 several control treatments and quantal response estimations shows that
 agents' behaviour can be explained by social preferences that are less
 pronounced than in conventional ultimatum games. Principals' own social
 preferences are not an important determinant of their behaviour. However,
 when the principals make contract offers, they anticipate that social
 preferences affect agents' behaviour.  Copyright 2013, Oxford University Press.

Title: Racial Preferences in Dating 
Abstract:
 We examine racial preferences in dating. We employ a Speed Dating
 experiment that allows us to directly observe individual decisions and
 thus infer whose preferences lead to racial segregation in romantic
 relationships. Females exhibit stronger racial preferences than males. The
 richness of our data further allows us to identify many determinants of
 same-race preferences. Subjects' backgrounds, including the racial
 composition of the ZIP code where a subject grew up and the prevailing
 racial attitudes in a subject's state or country of origin, strongly
 influence same-race preferences. Older subjects and more physically
 attractive subjects exhibit weaker same-race preferences.  Copyright 2008, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Multiple Lenders and Corporate Distress: Evidence on Debt Restructuring 
Abstract:
 Multiple banking is a common characteristic of the corporate lending,
 particularly of medium-sized and large firms. However, if the firms are
 facing distress, multiple lenders may have serious coordination problems,
 as has been argued in the theoretical literature. In this paper we analyse
 the problems of multiple banking in borrower distress empirically. We rely
 on a unique panel data set that includes detailed credit-file information
 on distressed lending relationships in Germany. In particular, it includes
 information on "bank pools", a legal institution aimed at coordinating
 lender interests in distress. We find that the existence of small pools
 increases the probability of workout success and that this effect reverses
 when pools become large. We identify major determinants of pool formation,
 in particular the number of banks, the distribution of lending among
 banks, and the severity of the distress.  Copyright 2008, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Strategic Pricing, Consumer Search and the Number of Firms 
Abstract:
 We examine an oligopoly model where some consumers engage in costly
 non-sequential search to discover prices. There are three distinct
 price-dispersed equilibria characterized by low, moderate and high search
 intensity. The effects of an increase in the number of firms on search
 behaviour, expected prices, price dispersion and welfare are sensitive (i)
 to the equilibrium consumers' search intensity, and (ii) to the status quo
 number of firms. For instance, when consumers search with low intensity,
 an increase in the number of firms reduces search, does not affect
 expected price, leads to greater price dispersion and reduces welfare. In
 contrast, when consumers search with high intensity, increased competition
 results in more search and lower prices when the number of competitors in
 the market is low to begin with, but in less search and higher prices when
 the number of competitors is large. Duopoly yields identical expected
 price and price dispersion but higher welfare than an infinite number of
 firms.  Copyright 2004, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Robust Implementation in Direct Mechanisms 
Abstract:
 A social choice function is robustly implementable if there is a mechanism
 under which the process of iteratively eliminating strictly dominated
 messages lead to outcomes that agree with the social choice function for
 all beliefs at every type profile. In an interdependent-value environment
 with single-crossing preferences, we identify a contraction property on
 the preferences which together with strict ex post incentive compatibility
 is sufficient to guarantee robust implementation in the direct mechanism.
 Strict ex post incentive compatibility and the contraction property are
 also necessary for robust implementation in any mechanism, including
 indirect ones. The contraction property requires that the interdependence
 is not too high. In a linear signal model, the contraction property is
 equivalent to an interdependence matrix having all eigenvalues smaller
 than one.  Copyright 2009, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Dynamic Security Design: Convergence to Continuous Time and Asset Pricing Implications 
Abstract:
 An entrepreneur with limited liability needs to finance an infinite
 horizon investment project. An agency problem arises because she can
 divert operating cash flows before reporting them to the financiers. We
 first study the optimal contract in discrete time. This contract can be
 implemented by cash reserves, debt, and equity. The latter is split
 between the financiers and the entrepreneur and pays dividends when
 retained earnings reach a threshold. To provide appropriate incentives to
 the entrepreneur, the firm is downsized when it runs short of cash. We
 then study the continuous-time limit of the model. We prove the
 convergence of the discrete-time value functions and optimal contracts.
 Our analysis yields rich implications for the dynamics of security prices.
 Stock prices follow a diffusion reflected at the dividend barrier and
 absorbed at 0. Their volatility, as well as the leverage ratio of the
 firm, increase after bad performance. Stock prices and book-to-market
 ratios are in a non-monotonic relationship. A more severe agency problem
 entails lower price-earning ratios and firm liquidity and higher default
 risk.  Copyright 2007, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Labour Unrest and the Quality of Production: Evidence from the Construction Equipment Resale Market 
Abstract:
 This paper examines the construction equipment resale market to assess
 whether equipment produced by the world's largest manufacturer of
 construction machinery, Caterpillar, experienced lower product quality in
 facilities that underwent contract disputes during the 1990's. Analysis of
 auction data reveals that resale market participants significantly
 discounted machines produced in these dispute-affected facilities.
 Additionally, pieces of equipment produced in facilities undergoing unrest
 were resold more often, received worse appraisal reports, and had lower
 list prices. Taken together, the evidence supports the hypothesis that
 workmanship at dispute-affected facilities declined and that the resulting
 impact on the economic quality of the equipment produced was significant.
 The dispute was associated with at least $400 million in lost service
 flows due to inferior quality equipment alone.  Copyright 2008, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Urban Growth and Transportation 
Abstract:
 We estimate the effects of interstate highways on the growth of U.S.
 cities between 1983 and 2003. We find that a 10% increase in a city's
 initial stock of highways causes about a 1.5% increase in its employment
 over this 20 year period. To estimate a structural model of urban growth
 and transportation, we rely on an instrumental variables estimation that
 uses a 1947 plan of the interstate highway system, an 1898 map of
 railroads, and maps of the early explorations of the U.S. as instruments
 for 1983 highways.  Copyright , Oxford University Press.

Title: Dynamic Contracts with Moral Hazard and Adverse Selection 
Abstract:
 We study a novel dynamic principal--agent setting with moral hazard and
 adverse selection (persistent as well as repeated). In the model, an agent
 whose skills are his private information faces a finite sequence of tasks,
 one after the other. Upon arrival of each task, the agent learns its level
 of difficulty and then chooses whether to accept or refuse each task in
 turn and how much effort to exert. Although his decision to accept or
 refuse a task is publicly known, the agent's effort level is his private
 information. We characterize optimal contracts and show that the
 per-period utility of the agent approaches his per-period utility when his
 skills are publicly known, as the discount factor and the time horizon
 increase.  Copyright 2012, Oxford University Press.

Title: Inference for Extremal Conditional Quantile Models, with an Application to Market and Birthweight Risks 
Abstract:
 Quantile regression (QR) is an increasingly important empirical tool in
 economics and other sciences for analysing the impact a set of regressors
 has on the conditional distribution of an outcome. Extremal QR, or QR
 applied to the tails, is of interest in many economic and financial
 applications, such as conditional value at risk, production efficiency,
 and adjustment bands in (S,s) models. This paper provides feasible
 inference tools for extremal conditional quantile models that rely on
 extreme value approximations to the distribution of self-normalized QR
 statistics. The methods are simple to implement and can be of independent
 interest even in the univariate (non-regression) case. We illustrate the
 results with two empirical examples analysing extreme fluctuations of a
 stock return and extremely low percentiles of live infant birthweight in
 the range between 250 and 1500 g.  Copyright 2011, Oxford University Press.

Title: Financial Markets and Wages 
Abstract:
 We study a labour market equilibrium model in which firms sign optimal
 long-term contracts with workers. Firms that are financially constrained
 offer an increasing wage profile: they pay lower wages today in exchange
 for higher future wages once they become unconstrained. Because
 constrained firms grow faster, the model predicts a positive correlation
 between the growth of wages and the growth of the firm. Under some
 conditions, the model also generates a positive relation between firm size
 and wages. Using matched employer-employee data from Finland and the
 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth for the U.S., we show that the key
 dynamic properties of the model are supported by the data.  Copyright , Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Legal Institutions, Sectoral Heterogeneity, and Economic Development 
Abstract:
 Poor countries have lower PPP-adjusted investment rates and face higher
 relative prices of investment goods. It has been suggested that this
 happens either because these countries have a relatively lower TFP in
 industries producing capital goods or because they are subject to greater
 investment distortions. This paper provides a micro-foundation for the
 cross-country dispersion in investment distortions. We first document that
 firms producing capital goods face a higher level of idiosyncratic risk
 than their counterparts producing consumption goods. In a model of capital
 accumulation where the protection of investors' rights is incomplete, this
 difference in risk induces a wedge between the returns on investment in
 the two sectors. The wedge is bigger, the poorer the investor protection.
 In turn, this implies that countries endowed with weaker institutions face
 higher relative prices of investment goods, invest a lower fraction of
 their income, and end up being poorer. We find that our mechanism may be
 quantitatively important.  Copyright , Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: On the Evaluation of Economic Mobility 
Abstract:
 This paper presents a framework for the evaluation and measurement of
 &#x201C;reversal&#x201D; and &#x201C;origin independence&#x201D; as
 separate aspects of economic mobility. We show that evaluation depends on
 aversion to multi-period inequality, aversion to inter-temporal
 fluctuations, and aversion to future risk. We construct &#x201C;extended
 Atkinson indices&#x201D; that allow us to quantify the relative impact of
 reversal and origin independence on welfare. We apply our approach to the
 comparison of income mobility in Germany and in the U.S.. When aversion to
 inequality is the only consideration, the U.S. gains more from mobility
 than Germany. This reflects similar gains from reversal in the two
 countries but greater gains in the U.S. from origin independence. The
 introduction of aversion to intertemporal fluctuations and aversion to
 future risk makes the impact of mobility in the two countries more
 similar.  Copyright 2002, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: From Physical to Human Capital Accumulation: Inequality and the Process of Development 
Abstract:
 This paper develops a growth theory that captures the replacement of
 physical capital accumulation by human capital accumulation as a prime
 engine of growth along the process of development. It argues that the
 positive impact of inequality on the growth process was reversed in this
 process. In early stages of the Industrial Revolution, when physical
 capital accumulation was the prime source of growth, inequality stimulated
 development by channelling resources towards individuals with a higher
 propensity to save. As human capital emerged as a growth engine, equality
 alleviated adverse effects of credit constraints on human capital
 accumulation, stimulating the growth process.  Copyright 2004, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Productivity Dynamics with Technology Choice: An Application to Automobile Assembly 
Abstract:
 During the 1980's, all Japanese automobile producers opened assembly
 plants in North America. Industry analysts and previous research claim
 that these transplants are more productive than incumbent plants and that
 they produce with a substantially different production process. I compare
 the production processes by estimating a model that allows for
 heterogeneity in technology and productivity, both of which are
 intrinsically unobservable. The model is estimated on a panel of assembly
 plants, controlling for capacity utilization and price effects.The results
 indicate that the more recent technology uses capital more intensively and
 it has a higher elasticity of substitution between labour and capital.
 Hicks-neutral productivity growth is estimated to be lower, while
 capital-biased (labour-saving) productivity growth is higher for the new
 technology. Using the estimation results, I decompose industry-wide
 productivity growth and find plant-level changes in lean plants to be the
 most important contributor. Plant-level productivity growth is further
 decomposed to reveal the importance of capital-biased productivity growth,
 increases in the capital-labour ratio, and returns to scale.  Copyright 2003, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: The Agency Cost of Internal Collusion and Schumpeterian Growth 
Abstract:
 This paper analyses the link between the internal organization of the firm
 and the growth process. We present a Schumpeterian growth model in which
 monopoly firms face agency costs due to collusion between managers inside
 the organization. These costs affect incentives to invest and the rate of
 innovation in the economy. When collusion is self-enforcing, higher growth
 and more creative destruction shortens in turn the time horizon of
 colluding agents in the organization and makes internal collusion more
 difficult to sustain. We analyse this two-way mechanism between growth and
 agency problems and show how the transaction costs of side-contracting
 within the firm and the growth rate of the economy are simultaneously
 derived.  Copyright 2004, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Holdouts in Sovereign Debt Restructuring: A Theory of Negotiation in a Weak Contractual Environment 
Abstract:
 Why is it difficult to restructure sovereign debt in a timely manner? In
 this paper, we present a theory of the sovereign debt-restructuring
 process in which delay arises as individual creditors hold up a settlement
 in order to extract greater payments from the sovereign. We then use the
 theory to analyse recent policy proposals aimed at ensuring equal
 repayment of creditor claims. Strikingly, we show that such collective
 action policies may increase delay by encouraging free riding on
 negotiation costs, even while preventing hold-up and reducing total
 negotiation costs. A calibrated version of the model can account for
 observed delays and finds that free riding is quantitatively relevant:
 whereas in simple low-cost debt-restructuring operations, collective
 mechanisms will reduce delay by more than 60%, in high-cost complicated
 restructurings, the adoption of such mechanisms results in a doubling of
 delay.  Copyright 2012, Oxford University Press.

Title: Enforcing International Trade Agreements with Imperfect Private Monitoring 
Abstract:
 To analyse the role that the World Trade Organization (WTO) plays in
 enforcing international trade agreements, this paper first explores what
 countries can achieve alone by characterizing optimal private trigger
 strategies (PTS) under which each country triggers a punishment phase by
 imposing an explicit tariff based on privately observed imperfect signals
 of the other country's concealed trade barriers. It identifies the
 condition under which countries can restrain the use of concealed barriers
 based on PTS and establishes that countries will not reduce the
 cooperative protection level to its minimum attainable level under the
 optimal PTS. This paper then considers third-party trigger strategies
 (TTS) under which the WTO allows each country to initiate a punishment
 phase based on the WTO's judgement about potential violations. By
 comparing the optimal PTS and optimal TTS, it demonstrates that the WTO
 facilitates a better cooperative equilibrium by changing the nature of
 punishment-triggering signals from private to public, which in turn
 enables countries to use a more efficient punishment, such as an
 asymmetric and a minimum punishment.  Copyright 2011, Oxford University Press.

Title: Equilibrium Asset Prices and Investor Behaviour in the Presence of Money Illusion 
Abstract:
 This article analyses the implications of money illusion for investor
 behaviour and asset prices in a securities market economy with
 inflationary fluctuations. We provide a belief-based formulation of money
 illusion which accounts for the systematic mistakes in evaluating real and
 nominal quantities. The impact of money illusion on security prices and
 their dynamics is demonstrated to be considerable even though its welfare
 cost on investors is small in typical environments. A money-illusioned
 investor's real consumption is shown to generally depend on the price
 level, and specifically to decrease in the price level. A
 general-equilibrium analysis in the presence of money illusion generates
 implications that are consistent with several empirical regularities. In
 particular, the real bond yields and dividend price ratios are positively
 related to expected inflation, the real short rate is negatively
 correlated with realized inflation, and money illusion may induce
 predictability and excess volatility in stock returns. The basic analysis
 is generalized to incorporate heterogeneous investors with differing
 degrees of illusion.  Copyright , Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Time Varying Structural Vector Autoregressions and Monetary Policy 
Abstract:
 Monetary policy and the private sector behaviour of the U.S. economy are
 modelled as a time varying structural vector autoregression, where the
 sources of time variation are both the coefficients and the variance
 covariance matrix of the innovations. The paper develops a new, simple
 modelling strategy for the law of motion of the variance covariance matrix
 and proposes an efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm for the model
 likelihood/posterior numerical evaluation. The main empirical conclusions
 are: (1) both systematic and non-systematic monetary policy have changed
 during the last 40 years&#x02014;in particular, systematic responses of
 the interest rate to inflation and unemployment exhibit a trend toward a
 more aggressive behaviour, despite remarkable oscillations; (2) this has
 had a negligible effect on the rest of the economy. The role played by
 exogenous non-policy shocks seems more important than interest rate policy
 in explaining the high inflation and unemployment episodes in recent U.S.
 economic history.  Copyright 2005, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: The Swing Voter's Curse in the Laboratory 
Abstract:
 This paper reports the first laboratory study of the swing voter's curse
 and provides insights on the larger theoretical and empirical literature
 on "pivotal voter" models. Our experiment controls for different
 information levels of voters, as well as the size of the electorate, the
 distribution of preferences and other theoretically relevant parameters.
 The design varies the share of partisan voters and the prior belief about
 a payoff relevant state of the world. Our results support the equilibrium
 predictions of the Feddersen-Pesendorfer model. The voters act as if they
 are aware of the swing voter's curse and adjust their behaviour to
 compensate. While the compensation is not complete and there is some
 heterogeneity in individual behaviour, we find that aggregate outcomes,
 such as efficiency, turnout and margin of victory, closely track the
 theoretical predictions.  Copyright , Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Superstars and Mediocrities: Market Failure in the Discovery of Talent<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN1">-super-1</xref> 
Abstract:
 A basic problem facing most labour markets is that workers can neither
 commit to long-term wage contracts nor can they self-finance the costs of
 production. I study the effects of these imperfections when talent is
 industry-specific; it can only be revealed on the job, and once learnt
 becomes public information. I show that firms bid excessively for the pool
 of incumbent workers at the expense of trying out new talent. The
 workforce is then plagued with an unfavourable selection of individuals:
 there are too many mediocre workers, whose talent is not high enough to
 justify them crowding out novice workers with lower expected talent but
 with more upside potential. The result is an inefficiently low level of
 output coupled with higher wages for known high talents. This problem is
 most severe where information about talent is initially very imprecise and
 the complementary costs of production are high. I argue that high incomes
 in professions such as entertainment, management, and entrepreneurship,
 may be explained by the nature of the talent revelation process, rather
 than by an underlying scarcity of talent.  Copyright , Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Collusion, Delegation and Supervision with Soft Information 
Abstract:
 This paper shows that supervision with soft information is valuable
 whenever supervisors and supervisees collude under asymmetric information
 and proceeds then to derive an Equivalence Principle between
 organizational forms of supervisory and productive activities. We consider
 an organization with an agent privately informed on his productivity and a
 risk averse supervisor getting signals on the agent's type. In a
 centralized organization, the principal can communicate and contract with
 both the supervisor and the agent. However, these two agents can collude
 against the principal. In a decentralized organization, the principal only
 communicates and contracts with the supervisor who in turn sub-contracts
 with the agent. We show that the two organizations achieve the same
 outcome. We discuss this equivalence and provide various comparative
 statics results to assess the efficiency of supervisory structures.  Copyright 2003, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Optimal Redistributive Taxation in a Search Equilibrium Model 
Abstract:
 This paper characterizes optimal non-linear income taxation in an economy
 with a continuum of unobservable productivity levels and endogenous
 involuntary unemployment due to frictions in the labour markets.
 Redistributive taxation distorts labour demand and wages. Compared to
 their efficient values, gross wages, unemployment, and participation are
 lower. Average tax rates are increasing. Marginal tax rates are positive,
 even at the top. Finally, numerical simulations suggest that
 redistribution is much more important in our setting than in a comparable
 Mirrlees-type setting.  Copyright 2006, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: The Role of Portfolio Constraints in the International Propagation of Shocks 
Abstract:
 We study the comovement among stock prices and exchange rates in a
 three-good, three-country, Centre-Periphery, dynamic equilibrium model in
 which the Centre's agents face portfolio constraints. We characterize
 equilibrium in closed form for a broad class of portfolio constraints,
 solving for stock prices, terms of trade, and portfolio holdings. We show
 that portfolio constraints generate wealth transfers between the Periphery
 countries and the Centre, which increase the comovement of the stock
 prices across the Periphery. We associate this excess comovement caused by
 portfolio constraints with the phenomenon known as contagion. The model
 generates predictions consistent with other important empirical results
 such as amplification and flight-to-quality effects.  Copyright 2008, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Political Competition, Policy and Growth: Theory and Evidence from the US 
Abstract:
 This paper develops a simple model to analyse how a lack of political
 competition may lead to policies that hinder economic growth. We test the
 predictions of the model on panel data for the US states. In these data,
 we find robust evidence that lack of political competition in a state is
 associated with anti-growth policies: higher taxes, lower capital
 spending, and a reduced likelihood of using rightto- work laws. We also
 document a strong link between low political competition and low income
 growth.  Copyright , Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Reputation in Long-Run Relationships 
Abstract:
 We model a long-run relationship as an infinitely repeated game played by
 two equally patient agents. In each period, the agents play an
 extensive-form stage game of perfect information with either locally
 non-conflicting interests or strictly conflicting interests. There is
 incomplete information about the type of Player 1, while Player 2's type
 is commonly known. We show that a sufficiently patient Player 1 can
 leverage Player 2's uncertainty about his type to secure his highest
 pay-off, compatible with Player 2's individual rationality, in any perfect
 Bayesian equilibrium of the repeated game.  Copyright 2012, Oxford University Press.

Title: Managerial Skills Acquisition and the Theory of Economic Development 
Abstract:
 Why don't all countries converge rapidly to the use of most efficient or
 best practice technologies? Micro level studies suggest managerial skills
 play a key role in the adoption of modern technologies. In this paper we
 model the interactive process between on-the-job managerial skill
 acquisition and the adoption of modern technology. We use the model to
 illustrate why some countries develop managerial skills quickly and adopt
 best practice technologies, while others stay backwards. The model also
 explains why managers will not migrate from rich countries to poor
 countries, as would be needed to generate convergence. Finally we show why
 standard growth accounting exercises will incorrectly attribute a large
 proportion of managerial skills' contribution to total factor productivity
 and we quantify the importance of this bias.  Copyright , Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: The Relationship Between Education and Adult Mortality in the United States 
Abstract:
 Prior research has uncovered a large and positive correlation between
 education and health. This paper examines whether education has a causal
 impact on health. I follow synthetic cohorts using successive U.S.
 censuses to estimate the impact of educational attainment on mortality
 rates. I use compulsory education laws from 1915 to 1939 as instruments
 for education. The results suggest that education has a causal impact on
 mortality, and that this effect is perhaps larger than has been previously
 estimated in the literature.  Copyright 2005, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Optimal Delegation 
Abstract:
 We analyse the design of decision rules by a principal who faces an
 informed but biased agent and who is unable to commit to contingent
 transfers. The contracting problem reduces to a delegation problem in
 which the principal commits to a set of decisions from which the agent
 chooses his preferred one. We characterize the optimal delegation set and
 perform comparative statics on the principal's willingness to delegate and
 the agent's discretion. We also provide conditions for interval delegation
 to be optimal and show that they are satisfied when the agent's
 preferences are sufficiently aligned. Finally, we apply our results to the
 regulation of a privately informed monopolist and to the design of
 legislatives rules.  Copyright 2008, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Heterogeneity and the Non-Parametric Analysis of Consumer Choice: Conditions for Invertibility 
Abstract:
 This paper considers structural non-parametric random utility models for
 continuous choice variables with unobserved heterogeneity. We provide
 sufficient conditions on random preferences to yield reduced-form systems
 of non-parametric stochastic demand functions that allow global
 invertibility between demands and non-separable unobserved heterogeneity.
 Invertibility is essential for global identification of structural
 consumer demand models, for the existence of well-specified probability
 models of choice and for the non-parametric analysis of revealed
 stochastic preference. We distinguish between new classes of models in
 which heterogeneity is separable and non-separable in the marginal rates
 of substitution, respectively.  Copyright 2008, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Collective Labour Supply: Heterogeneity and Non-Participation 
Abstract:
 We present identification and estimation results for the
 &#x201C;collective&#x201D; model of labour supply in which there are
 discrete choices, censoring of hours, and non-participation in employment.
 We derive the collective restrictions on labour supply functions and
 contrast them with restrictions implied by the usual
 &#x201C;unitary&#x201D; framework. Using the large changes in the wage
 structure between men and women in the U.K. over the last two decades, we
 estimate a collective labour supply model for married couples without
 children. The estimates of the sharing rule show that male wages and
 employment have a strong influence on bargaining power within couples.  Copyright 2007, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Money and Prices Under Uncertainty 
Abstract:
 We study whether monetary economies display nominal indeterminacy:
 equivalently, whether monetary policy determines the path of prices under
 uncertainty. In a simple, stochastic, cash-in-advance economy, we find
 that indeterminacy arises and is characterized by the initial price level
 and a probability measure associated with state-contingent nominal bonds:
 equivalently, monetary policy determines an average, but not the
 distribution of inflation across realizations of uncertainty. The result
 does not derive from the stability of the deterministic steady state and
 is not affected essentially by price stickiness. Nominal indeterminacy may
 affect real allocations in cases we identify. Our characterization applies
 to stochastic monetary models in general, and it permits a unified
 treatment of the determinants of paths of inflation.  Copyright 2005, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Structuring and Restructuring Sovereign Debt: The Role of Seniority<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN1">-super-1</xref> 
Abstract:
 We show how the willingness-to-pay problem and lack of exclusivity in
 sovereign lending may result in an equilibrium sovereign debt structure
 that is excessively difficult to restructure. A bankruptcy regime for
 sovereigns can alleviate this inefficiency but only if it is endowed with
 far-reaching powers to enforce seniority and subordination clauses in debt
 contracts. A bankruptcy regime that makes sovereign debt easier to
 restructure without enforcing seniority may decrease welfare.  Copyright , Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: A Spatial Theory of News Consumption and Electoral Competition 
Abstract:
 We characterize the optimal editorial positions of the media in a model in
 which the media influence both voting behaviour and party policies.
 Political parties are less likely to choose partisan policies when more
 voters consume informative news. When there are two media outlets, each
 should be slightly biased relative to its audience in order to attract
 voters with relatively extreme views. Voter welfare is typically higher
 under a duopoly than under a monopoly. Two media outlets under joint
 ownership may provide more diverse viewpoints than two independent ones,
 but voter welfare is not always higher.  Copyright 2008, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Optimal Interest-Rate Smoothing 
Abstract:
 This paper considers the desirability of the observed tendency of central
 banks to adjust interest rates only gradually in response to changes in
 economic conditions. It shows, in the context of a simple model of
 optimizing private-sector behaviour, that assignment of an interest-rate
 smoothing objective to the central bank may be desirable, even when
 reduction of the magnitude of interest-rate changes is not a social
 objective in itself. This is because a response of policy to "irrelevant"
 lagged variables may be desirable owing to the way it steers
 private-sector expectations of future policy.  Copyright 2003, Wiley-Blackwell.

 they assign to individual equilibrium conditions. We derive the efficient

Title: Prices and Exchange Rates: A Theory of Disconnect 
Abstract:
 I present a sticky-wage model of exchange rate pass-through with
 heterogeneous producers and endogenous markups. The model shows that low
 levels of exchange rate pass-through to firm- and aggregate-level import
 prices coexist with large movements in trade flows. After an exchange rate
 shock, aggregate import prices are subject to a composition bias due to
 changes in the extensive margin of trade (the number of goods traded
 between countries). At the firm level, each producer adjusts its markups
 depending on its own productivity and the change in the competitive
 environment generated by the exchange rate movement. Firm-level price
 responses are asymmetric--different for appreciations and
 depreciations--and adjustments in the intensive margin of trade
 (firm-level exports) are substantial. In general equilibrium, the model
 shows that firm reallocations increase the persistence of exogenous
 shocks.  Copyright 2011, Oxford University Press.

Title: Term Length and the Effort of Politicians 
Abstract:
 We evaluate the effects of a fundamental lever of constitutional design:
 the duration of public office terms. We present a simple model grounded in
 interviews with legislators and highlight three forces shaping incentives
 to exert legislative effort. We exploit two natural experiments in the
 Argentine Congress (where term lengths were assigned randomly) to
 ascertain which forces are empirically dominant. Results for separate
 measures as well as an aggregate index of legislative effort show that
 longer terms increase effort. Shorter terms appear to discourage effort
 not due to campaign distractions but due to an investment payback logic:
 when effort yields returns over multiple periods, longer terms yield a
 higher chance of capturing those returns. A broader implication is that
 job stability may promote effort despite making individuals less
 accountable.  Copyright 2011, Oxford University Press.

Title: Learning from a Piece of Pie 
Abstract:
 We investigate the empirical content of the Nash solution to two-player
 bargaining games. The bargaining environment is described by a set of
 variables that may affect agents' preferences over the agreement sharing,
 the status quo outcome, or both. The outcomes (i.e. whether an agreement
 is reached, and if so the individual shares) and the environment
 (including the size of the pie) are known, but neither are the agents'
 utilities nor their threat points. We consider both a deterministic
 version of the model in which the econometrician observes the shares as
 deterministic functions of the variables under consideration and a
 stochastic one in which because of latent disturbances only the joint
 distribution of incomes and outcomes is recorded. We show that in the most
 general framework any outcome can be rationalized as a Nash solution.
 However, even mild exclusion restrictions generate strong implications
 that can be used to test the Nash bargaining assumption. Stronger
 conditions further allow to recover the underlying structure of the
 bargaining, and in particular, the cardinal representation of individual
 preferences in the absence of uncertainty. An implication of this finding
 is that empirical works entailing Nash bargaining could (and should) use
 much more general and robust versions than they usually do.  Copyright 2012, Oxford University Press.

Title: Communication and Learning 
Abstract:
 We study strategic information transmission in an organization consisting
 of an infinite sequence of individual decision-makers. Each decision-maker
 chooses an action and receives an informative but imperfect signal of the
 once-and-for-all realization of an unobserved state. The state affects all
 individuals' preferences over present and future decisions.
 Decision-makers do not directly observe the realized signals or actions of
 their predecessors. Instead, they must rely on cheap-talk messages in
 order to accumulate information about the state. Each decision-maker is
 therefore both a receiver of information with respect to his decision and
 a sender with respect to all future decisions. We show that if preferences
 are not perfectly aligned, "full learning" equilibria--ones in which the
 individuals' posterior beliefs eventually place full weight on the true
 state--do not exist. This is so both in the case of private communication,
 in which each individual only hears the message of his immediate
 predecessor, and in the case of public communication, in which a
 decision-maker hears the message of all his predecessors. Surprisingly, in
 the latter case full learning may be impossible even in the limit as all
 members of the organization become perfectly patient. We also consider the
 case where all individuals have access to a mediator who can work across
 time periods arbitrarily far apart. In this case, full learning equilibria
 exist.  Copyright 2012, Oxford University Press.

Title: Political Dynasties 
Abstract:
 Political dynasties have long been present in democracies, raising
 concerns that inequality in the distribution of political power may
 reflect imperfections in democratic representation. However, the
 persistence of political elites may simply reflect differences in ability
 or political vocation across families and not their entrenchment in power.
 We show that dynastic prevalence in the Congress of the U.S. is high
 compared to that in other occupations and that political dynasties do not
 merely reflect permanent differences in family characteristics. On the
 contrary, using two instrumental variable techniques we find that
 political power is self-perpetuating: legislators who hold power for
 longer become more likely to have relatives entering Congress in the
 future. Thus, in politics, power begets power.  Copyright , Wiley-Blackwell.

 journal, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">2000</xref>), Barlevy and Veronesi
 present a model of a one-period financial market, and claim that for an
 open set of parameter values, the value of information increases with the

Title: Fault Tolerant Implementation 
Abstract:
 In this paper we investigate the implementation problem arising when some
 of the players are &#x201C;faulty&#x201D; in the sense that they fail to
 act optimally. The planner and the non-faulty players only know that there
 can be at most k faulty players in the population. However, they know
 neither the identity of the faulty players, their exact number nor how
 faulty players behave. We define a solution concept which requires a
 player to optimally respond to the non-faulty players regardless of the
 identity and actions of the faulty players. We introduce a notion of fault
 tolerant implementation, which unlike standard notions of full
 implementation, also requires robustness to deviations from the
 equilibrium. The main result of this paper establishes that under
 symmetric information any choice rule that satisfies two
 properties&#x2014;k-monotonicity and no veto power&#x2014;can be
 implemented by a strategic game form if there are at least three players
 and the number of faulty players is less than 1\2n&#x2212;1. As an
 application of our result we present examples of simple mechanisms that
 implement the constrained Walrasian function and a choice rule for the
 efficient allocation of an indivisible good.  Copyright 2002, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Optimal Indirect and Capital Taxation 
Abstract:
 We consider an environment in which agents' skills are private information
 and follow arbitrary stochastic processes. We prove that it is typically
 Pareto optimal for an individual's marginal benefit of investing in
 capital to exceed his marginal cost of doing so. This wedge is consistent
 with a positive tax on capital income. We also prove that it is Pareto
 optimal for the marginal rate of substitution between any two consumption
 goods to equal the marginal rate of transformation. This lack of a wedge
 is consistent with uniform taxation of consumption goods within a period.  Copyright 2003, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Trade, Firms, and Wages: Theory and Evidence 
Abstract:
 How does trade liberalization affect wages? This is the first paper to
 consider in theory and data how the impact of final and intermediate input
 tariff cuts on workers' wages varies with the global engagement of their
 firm. Our model predicts that a fall in output tariffs lowers wages at
 import-competing firms but boosts wages at exporting firms. Similarly, a
 fall in input tariffs raises wages at import-using firms relative to those
 at firms that only source inputs locally. Using highly detailed Indonesian
 manufacturing census data for the period 1991--2000, we find considerable
 support for the model's predictions.  Copyright 2012, Oxford University Press.

Title: Self-Organization for Collective Action: An Experimental Study of Voting on Sanction Regimes 
Abstract:
 Entrusting the power to punish to a central authority is a hallmark of
 civilization, yet informal or horizontal sanctions have attracted more
 attention of late. We study experimentally a collective action dilemma and
 test whether subjects choose a formal sanction scheme that costs less than
 the surplus it makes possible, as predicted by standard economic theory,
 or instead opt for the use of informal sanctions (IS) or no sanctions. Our
 subjects choose, and succeed in using, IS surprisingly often, their voting
 decisions being responsive to the cost of formal sanctions. Adoption by
 voting enhances the efficiency of both IS and non-deterrent formal
 sanctions. Results are qualitatively confirmed under several permutations
 of the experimental design.  Copyright 2014, Oxford University Press.

Title: Overconfidence and Social Signalling 
Abstract:
 Evidence from both psychology and economics indicates that individuals
 give statements that appear to overestimate their ability compared to that
 of others. We test three theories that predict such relative
 overconfidence. The first theory argues that overconfidence can be
 generated by Bayesian updating from a common prior and truthful statements
 if individuals do not know their true type. The second theory suggests
 that self-image concerns asymmetrically affect the choice to receive new
 information about one's abilities, and this asymmetry can produce
 overconfidence. The third theory is that overconfidence is induced by the
 desire to send positive signals to others about one's own skill; this
 suggests either a bias in judgement, strategic lying, or both. We
 formulate this theory precisely. Using a large data set of relative
 ability judgements about two cognitive tests, we reject the restrictions
 imposed by the Bayesian model and also reject a key prediction of the
 self-image models that individuals with optimistic beliefs will be less
 likely to search for further information about their skill because this
 information might shatter their self-image. We provide evidence that
 personality traits strongly affect relative ability judgements in a
 pattern that is consistent with the third theory of social signalling. Our
 results together suggest that overconfidence in statements is more likely
 to be induced by social concerns than by either of the other two factors.  Copyright 2013, Oxford University Press.

Title: Minorities and Endogenous Segregation 
Abstract:
 A theoretical analysis is proposed of segregation as an equilibrium
 phenomenon in a random-matching model of the marriage market. Otherwise
 identical partners possess a pay-off-irrelevant characteristic, colour. We
 derive the set of colour-blind equilibria and show that they are
 generically constrained inefficient. Equilibrium segregation strategies
 are strategies that condition actions on the type of match. It is shown
 that distributions of types exist such that segregation equilibrium
 pay-offs Pareto dominate colour-blind pay-offs. For other distributions,
 segregation also generates conflict, where the majority unambiguously
 gains, while the minority group may lose. Giving preferential treatment,
 that is, minority bias, can increase overall welfare.  Copyright 2006, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Millian Efficiency with Endogenous Fertility 
Abstract:
 Should governments implement policies that affect fertility decisions on
 efficiency grounds? What is the correct notion of efficiency to use? To
 address these issues, this paper develops an extension of the notion of
 Pareto efficiency, referred to as Millian efficiency, to evaluate
 symmetric allocations in an overlapping generations setting with
 endogenous fertility. This extension is based on preferences of those
 agents who are actually alive, and exclusively allows for welfare
 comparisons of symmetric allocations. First, we provide necessary and
 sufficient conditions to determine whether an allocation is Millian
 efficient or not, and we show that the sufficient conditions for dynamic
 efficiency offered by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Cass (1972)</xref>
 and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Balasko and Shell (1980)</xref> cannot
 be directly applied when fertility decisions are endogenous. Second, we
 characterize Millian efficient allocations as the equilibria of a
 decentralized price mechanism, and we present a sufficient condition for
 dynamic efficiency that uses the sequence of prices associated to such
 decentralized equilibria. Finally, we analyse how intergenerational
 policies should be designed to restore efficiency and achieve net welfare
 gains in two different settings in which markets yield inefficient
 allocations: dynamic inefficiencies and financial market incompleteness
 regarding human capital. In the former, a pay-as-you-go social security
 system eliminates dynamic inefficiencies, provided pensions are explicitly
 linked with fertility decisions. In the latter, a specific link between
 social security and public education becomes a necessary condition for
 Millian efficiency.  Copyright , Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Political Motivations 
Abstract:
 Are politicians motivated by policy outcomes or by the perks of office? To
 shed light on this important question, I develop a simple model of two
 candidate electoral competitions in which candidates may be either office
 or policy motivated. In a second departure from standard formulations, the
 model incorporates both campaign and post-election behaviour of
 candidates. In this environment, I find that office-motivated candidates
 are favoured in electoral competition but that their advantage is limited
 by the electoral mechanism itself and policy-motivated candidates win a
 significant fraction of elections. More importantly, I show that the
 competitive interaction among candidates of different motivations affects
 the incentives of all candidates&#x02014;both office and policy
 motivated&#x02014;and that this competition affects policy outcomes. I
 also extend the model to explore the decision of citizens to enter
 politics and show that in all equilibria policy-motivated citizens compose
 a majority of the candidate pool.  Copyright 2008, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Other-Regarding Preferences in General Equilibrium 
Abstract:
 We study competitive market outcomes in economies where agents have
 other-regarding preferences (ORPs). We identify a separability condition
 on monotone preferences that is necessary and sufficient for one's own
 demand to be independent of the allocations and characteristics of other
 agents in the economy. Given separability, it is impossible to identify
 ORPs from market behaviour: agents behave as if they had classical
 preferences that depend only on own consumption in competitive
 equilibrium. If preferences, in addition, depend only on the final
 allocation of consumption in society, the Second Welfare Theorem holds as
 long as any increase in resources can be distributed in a way that makes
 all agents better off. The First Welfare Theorem generally does not hold.
 Allowing agents to care about their own consumption and the distribution
 of consumption possibilities in the economy, the competitive equilibria
 are efficient given prices if and only if there is no Pareto-improving
 redistribution of income.  Copyright 2011, Oxford University Press.

Title: Investor Overconfidence and the Forward Premium Puzzle 
Abstract:
 We offer an explanation for the forward premium puzzle in foreign exchange
 markets based upon investor overconfidence. In the model, overconfident
 individuals overreact to their information about future inflation, which
 causes greater overshooting in the forward rate than in the spot rate.
 Thus, when agents observe a signal of higher future inflation, the
 consequent rise in the forward premium predicts a subsequent downward
 correction of the spot rate. The model can explain the magnitude of the
 forward premium bias and several other stylized facts related to the joint
 behaviour of forward and spot exchange rates. Our approach is also
 consistent with the availability of profitable carry trade strategies.  Copyright 2011, Oxford University Press.

Title: Investment under Uncertainty in Dynamic Conflicts 
Abstract:
 This paper analyses a model in which two groups repeatedly compete with
 each other for a prize in every time period. We assume that there is a
 status quo bias: if there is a fight today, yesterday's winner is in a
 stronger position than the other group. Hence, a change of the status quo
 has long-term consequences that groups need to take into account.
 Important applications of this model include lobbying for legislation and
 political transitions through revolutions. We analyse the strategic timing
 of attacks on the status quo, which is similar to investment decisions
 under uncertainty. We find that the attack threshold is considerably lower
 than in a comparable one-period game, and that the expenditure level
 necessary to change the status quo is low in comparison to the prize; this
 provides a possible solution to Tullock's &#x201C;rent-seeking
 paradox&#x201D; in lobbying.  Copyright 2006, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: How to Organize Crime<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN1">-super-1</xref> 
Abstract:
 In criminal organizations, diffusing information widely throughout the
 organization might lead to greater internal efficiency (in particular,
 since these organizations are self-sustaining, through enhancing trust).
 However, this may come at the cost of leaving the organization more
 vulnerable to external threats such as law enforcement. We consider the
 implications of this trade-off and characterize the optimal information
 structure, rationalizing both "hierarchical" structures and organization
 in cells. Then, we focus on the role of the external authority,
 characterize optimal detection strategies, and discuss the implications of
 different forms of enforcement on the internal structure of the
 organization and policy. Finally, we discuss a number of applications and
 extensions.  Copyright 2008, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: An Axiomatic Model of Non-Bayesian Updating 
Abstract:
 This paper models an agent in a three-period setting who does not update
 according to Bayes' Rule and who is self-aware and anticipates her
 updating behaviour when formulating plans. Gul and Pesendorfer's theory of
 temptation and self-control is a key building block. The main result is a
 representation theorem that generalizes (the dynamic version of)
 Anscombe-Aumann's theorem so that both the prior and the way in which it
 is updated are subjective. The model can accommodate updating biases
 analogous to those observed by psychologists.  Copyright 2006, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Optimal Procurement Contracts with Pre-Project Planning 
Abstract:
 The paper studies procurement contracts with pre-project investigations in
 the presence of adverse selection and moral hazard. To model the
 procurer's problem, we extend a standard sequential screening model to
 endogenous information acquisition with moral hazard. The optimal contract
 displays systematic distortions in information acquisition. Due to a rent
 effect, adverse selection induces too much information acquisition to
 prevent cost overruns and too little information acquisition to prevent
 false project cancellations. Moral hazard mitigates the distortions
 related to cost overruns yet exacerbates those related to false negatives.
 The optimal mechanism is a menu of option contracts that achieves the dual
 goal of providing incentives for information acquisition and truthful
 information revelation.  Copyright 2011, Oxford University Press.

Title: Second Opinions and Price Competition: Inefficiency in the Market for Expert Advice 
Abstract:
 We consider a market in which an expert must exert costly but unobservable
 effort to identify the service that meets the consumer's need. In our
 model, experts offer competing contracts and the consumer may gather
 multiple opinions. We explore the incentives that a competitive sampling
 of prices and opinions provides for experts to exert effort and find that
 there is a tension between price competition and the equilibrium effort.
 In particular, the equilibrium fails to realize the second best welfare
 optimum. An intervention, that limits price competition via price control,
 increases welfare.  Copyright 2003, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Consumption Inequality and Intra-household Allocations 
Abstract:
 The consumption literature uses adult equivalence scales to measure
 individual-level inequality. This practice imposes the assumption that
 there is no within-household inequality. In this paper, we show that
 ignoring consumption inequality within households produces misleading
 estimates of inequality along two dimensions. To illustrate this point, we
 use a collective model of household behaviour to estimate consumption
 inequality in the U.K. from 1968 to 2001. First, the use of adult
 equivalence scales underestimates the initial level of cross-sectional
 consumption inequality by 50%, as large differences in the earnings of
 husbands and wives translate into large differences in consumption
 allocations within households. Second, we estimate the rise in
 between-household inequality has been accompanied by an offsetting
 reduction in within-household inequality. Our findings also indicate that
 increases in marital sorting on wages and hours worked can simultaneously
 explain two-thirds of the decline in within-household inequality and
 between a quarter and one-half of the rise in between-household inequality
 for one and two adult households.  Copyright 2011, Oxford University Press.

Title: Informal Insurance Arrangements with Limited Commitment: Theory and Evidence from Village Economies 
Abstract:
 Recent work on consumption allocations in village economies finds that
 idiosyncratic variation in consumption is systematically related to
 idiosyncratic variation in income, thus rejecting the hypothesis of full
 risk-pooling. We attempt to explain these observations by adding limited
 commitment as an impediment to risk-pooling. We provide a general dynamic
 model and completely characterise efficient informal insurance
 arrangements constrained by limited commitment, and test the model using
 data from three Indian villages. We find that the model can fully explain
 the dynamic response of consumption to income, but that it fails to
 explain the distribution of consumption across households.  Copyright 2002, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Cities, Workers, and Wages: A Structural Analysis of the Urban Wage Premium 
Abstract:
 Workers earn higher wages in cities vs. rural areas. This gap could arise
 because cities make workers more productive, or it could be the result of
 a non-random selection of workers into cities based on their ability and
 their endogenous history of career choices. To untangle these issues, this
 paper estimates a dynamic programming model, which embeds the choice of
 residing in a city or rural area within a model of career choices over
 time. After controlling for all the sources of selection and endogeneity,
 the estimates indicate that a given worker does earn more in the city for
 white-collar work, but not for blue-collar work. In addition, city work
 experience is found to be worth more than rural work experience in the
 rural area for white-collar work, but not for blue-collar work. These
 results support the interpretation that cities make white-collar workers
 more productive and suggest that workers may consider moving to the city
 not only in terms of locational choice, but also as a form of human
 capital investment.  Copyright 2007, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Exploring Higher Order Risk Effects 
Abstract:
 Precautionary saving has been linked to the property of prudence, and the
 property of temperance has been used to show how the presence of an
 unavoidable risk affects one's behaviour towards a second risk. These two
 higher order risk effects also play key roles in aversion to negative
 skewness and to kurtosis, respectively. This article presents a laboratory
 experiment to determine whether subjects are prudent and/or temperate. The
 experiment is based upon preferences over lottery pairs in simple 50-50
 gambles. Subjects are asked in which of two states of nature they would
 prefer to receive a zero-mean gamble. For prudence, the choices are
 between a lower and higher wealth outcome. For temperance, the choices are
 between a state with no other risk and a state with a second (independent)
 risk. The results show behavioural evidence for prudence, but they also
 show evidence of intemperate behaviour. Implications of these results for
 both expected-utility and non-expected-utility models are examined.  Copyright , Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: The Elusive Gains from International Financial Integration 
Abstract:
 Standard theoretical arguments tell us that countries with relatively
 little capital benefit from financial integration as foreign capital flows
 in and speeds up the process of convergence. We show in a calibrated
 neoclassical model that conventionally measured welfare gains from this
 type of convergence appear relatively limited for the typical emerging
 market country. The welfare gain from switching from financial autarky to
 perfect capital mobility is roughly equivalent to a 1 &#x0025; permanent
 increase in domestic consumption for the typical non-OECD country. This is
 negligible relative to the welfare gain from a take-off in domestic
 productivity of the magnitude observed in some of these countries.  Copyright 2006, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Technology&#x2014;Policy Interaction in Frictional Labour-Markets 
Abstract:
 Does capital-embodied technological change play an important role in
 shaping labour-market outcomes? To address this question, we develop a
 model with vintage capital and search-matching frictions where
 irreversible investment in new vintages of capital creates heterogeneity
 in productivity among firms, matched as well as vacant. We demonstrate
 that capital-embodied technological change reduces labour demand and
 raises equilibrium unemployment and unemployment durations. In addition,
 the presence of labour-market regulations (unemployment benefits, payroll
 taxes, and firing costs) exacerbates these effects. Thus, the model is
 qualitatively consistent with some key features of the European
 labour-market experience relative to that of the U.S.: it features a
 sharper rise in unemployment and a sharper fall in the vacancy rate and
 the labour share. A calibrated version of our model suggests that this
 technology&#x2014;policy interaction could explain a sizeable fraction of
 the observed differences between the U.S. and Europe.  Copyright 2007, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Partial Identification of the Distribution of Treatment Effects in Switching Regime Models and its Confidence Sets 
Abstract:
 In this paper, we establish sharp bounds on the joint distribution of
 potential outcomes and the distribution of treatment effects in parametric
 switching regime models with normal mean-variance mixture errors and in
 the semi-parametric switching regime models of <xref ref-type="bibr"
 rid="R30">Heckman (1990)</xref>. Our results for parametric switching
 regime models with normal mean-variance mixture errors extend some
 existing results for the Gaussian switching regime model and our results
 for semi-parametric switching regime models supplement the point
 identification results of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Heckman
 (1990)</xref>. Compared with the corresponding sharp bounds when selection
 is random, we observe that self-selection tightens the bounds on the joint
 distribution of the potential outcomes and the distribution of treatment
 effects. These bounds depend on the identified model parameters only and
 can be easily estimated once the identified model parameters are
 estimated. The important issue of inference is briefly discussed.  Copyright , Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: A Model of Asymmetric Employer Learning with Testable Implications 
Abstract:
 This paper helps close the gap between theory and empirical evidence in
 the literature on asymmetric employer learning. If an employer's private
 learning is reflected in a worker's wage and one employer's private
 information is transmitted to the next when the worker makes a job-to-job
 transition, then asymmetric employer learning will appear in wage
 regressions as learning over an employment spell. Extending previous work
 that assumes all learning takes place publicly, this paper develops wage
 regressions that test for both asymmetric employer learning and public
 learning. The empirical results, including tests of alternative
 explanations, are consistent with asymmetric employer learning's having at
 least as much of an effect on wages during an employment spell as does
 public learning. The model developed in this paper illustrates how the
 story suggested by the empirical work might unfold. It shows that outside
 firms can profitably compete with a better-informed employer through
 bidding wars, even when the worker is equally productive in all firms.
 Furthermore, this competition results in different wages for workers with
 the same publicly observable characteristics, a result that previous
 models of asymmetric learning have not produced.  Copyright , Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Temptation-Driven Preferences 
Abstract:
 "My own behaviour baffles me. For I find myself not doing what I really
 want to do but doing what I really loathe." Saint PaulWhat behaviour can
 be explained using the hypothesis that the agent faces temptation but is
 otherwise a "standard rational agent"? In earlier work, <xref
 ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Gul and Pesendorfer (2001)</xref> use a set
 betweenness axiom to restrict the set of preferences considered by <xref
 ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Dekel, Lipman and Rustichini (2001)</xref> to
 those explainable via temptation. We argue that set betweenness rules out
 plausible and interesting forms of temptation including some which may be
 important in applications. We propose a pair of alternative axioms called
 DFC, desire for commitment, and AIC, approximate improvements are chosen.
 DFC characterizes temptation as situations in which given any set of
 alternatives, the agent prefers committing herself to some particular item
 from the set rather than leaving herself the flexibility of choosing
 later. AIC is based on the idea that if adding an option to a menu
 improves the menu, it is because that option is chosen under some
 circumstances. From this interpretation, the axiom concludes that if an
 improvement is worse (as a commitment) than some commitment from the menu,
 then the best commitment from the improved menu is strictly preferred to
 facing that menu. We show that these axioms characterize a natural
 generalization of the Gul-Pesendorfer representation.  Copyright , Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Health and (Other) Asset Holdings 
Abstract:
 Despite clear evidence of correlations between financial and medical
 statuses and decisions, most models treat financial and health-related
 choices separately. This article bridges this gap by proposing a tractable
 dynamic framework for the joint determination of optimal consumption,
 portfolio holdings, health investment, and health insurance. We solve for
 the optimal rules in closed form and capitalize on this tractability to
 gain a better understanding of the conditions under which separation
 between financial and health-related decisions is sensible, and of the
 pathways through which wealth and health determine allocations, welfare
 and other variables of interest such as expected longevity or the value of
 health. Furthermore we show that the model is consistent with the observed
 patterns of individual allocations and provide realistic estimates of the
 parameters that confirm the relevance of all the main characteristics of
 the model.  Copyright 2013, Oxford University Press.

Title: Testing for Unit Roots in Small Panels with Short-run and Long-run Cross-sectional Dependencies 
Abstract:
 An IV approach, using as instruments non-linear transformations of the
 lagged levels, is explored to test for unit roots in panels with general
 dependency and heterogeneity across cross-sectional units. We allow not
 only for the cross-sectional dependencies of innovations, but also for the
 presence of co-integration across cross-sectional levels. Unbalanced
 panels and panels with differing individual short-run dynamics and
 cross-sectionally related dynamics are also permitted. We also more
 carefully formulate the unit root hypotheses in panels. In particular,
 using order statistics, we make it possible to test for and against the
 presence of unit roots in some of the individual units for a given panel.
 The individual IV t-ratios, which are the bases of our tests, are
 asymptotically and normally distributed and cross-sectionally independent.
 Therefore, the critical values of the order statistics as well as the
 usual average statistic can be easily obtained from simple elementary
 probability computations. We show via a set of simulations that our tests
 work well, whereas other existing tests fail to perform properly. As an
 illustration, we apply our tests to the panels of real exchange rates, and
 find no evidence for the purchasing power parity hypothesis, which is in
 sharp contrast with the previous studies.  Copyright , Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Gradualism in Trade Agreements with Asymmetric Countries 
Abstract:
 This paper uses recursive methods to characterize the payoff frontier of
 self-enforcing trade agreements between countries of asymmetric size. We
 show that at points on the frontier where only one country's incentive
 constraint binds, the efficient agreement will be a non-stationary one
 that starts with a positive trade distortion but eventually reaches free
 trade. Our analysis illustrates how (i) relative country size, (ii)
 consumption smoothing incentives, and (iii) sunk investments affect the
 form of efficient trade agreements. In contrast to previous work on
 gradualism, our results are obtained from a model in which the economic
 environment is stationary.  Copyright 2002, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Market Size, Trade, and Productivity 
Abstract:
 We develop a monopolistically competitive model of trade with firm
 heterogeneity&#x02014;in terms of productivity differences&#x02014;and
 endogenous differences in the "toughness" of competition across
 markets&#x02014;in terms of the number and average productivity of
 competing firms. We analyse how these features vary across markets of
 different size that are not perfectly integrated through trade; we then
 study the effects of different trade liberalization policies. In our
 model, market size and trade affect the toughness of competition, which
 then feeds back into the selection of heterogeneous producers and
 exporters in that market. Aggregate productivity and average mark-ups thus
 respond to both the size of a market and the extent of its integration
 through trade (larger, more integrated markets exhibit higher productivity
 and lower mark-ups). Our model remains highly tractable, even when
 extended to a general framework with multiple asymmetric countries
 integrated to different extents through asymmetric trade costs. We believe
 this provides a useful modelling framework that is particularly well
 suited to the analysis of trade and regional integration policy scenarios
 in an environment with heterogeneous firms and endogenous mark-ups.  Copyright 2008, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: The Revealed Preference Theory of Changing Tastes

 We analyse preferences over finite decision problems in order to model

 building on an example given by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Peleg and

Title: Monotone Equilibrium in Multi-Unit Auctions 
Abstract:
 In two-sided multi-unit auctions having a variety of payment rules,
 including uniform-price and discriminatory auctions, a monotone
 pure-strategy equilibrium (MPSE) exists when bidders are risk neutral with
 independent multi-dimensional types and interdependent values. In fact,
 all mixed-strategy equilibria are ex post allocation and interim expected
 payment equivalent to MPSE. Thus, for standard expected surplus/revenue
 analysis, there is no loss restricting attention to monotone strategies.  Copyright 2006, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Dynamic Price Competition with Network Effects 
Abstract:
 I consider a dynamic model of competition between two proprietary
 networks. Consumers die and are replaced with a constant hazard rate, and
 firms compete for new consumers to join their network by offering network
 entry prices. I derive a series of results pertaining to (a) existence and
 uniqueness of symmetric equilibria, (b) monotonicity of the pricing
 function (e.g. larger networks set higher prices), (c) network size
 dynamics (increasing dominance vs. reversion to the mean), and (d) firm
 value (how it varies with network effects). Finally, I apply my general
 framework to the study of termination charges in wireless
 telecommunications. I consider various forms of regulation and examine
 their impact on firm profits and market share dynamics.  Copyright 2011, Oxford University Press.

Title: Critical Types 
Abstract:
 How can we know in advance whether simplifying assumptions about beliefs
 will make a difference in the conclusions of game-theoretic models? We
 define critical types to be types whose rationalizable correspondence is
 sensitive to assumptions about arbitrarily high-order beliefs. We show
 that a type is critical if and only if it exhibits common belief in some
 non-trivial event. We use this characterization to show that all types in
 commonly used type spaces are critical. On the other hand, we show that
 regular types (types that are not critical) are generic, although perhaps
 inconvenient to use in applications.  Copyright 2011, Oxford University Press.

 (ii) the inflation bias and the consequent losses are larger when

 losses from higher long-term inflation dominates the welfare costs of
 losing the ability to react optimally to shocks.  Copyright 2003, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Household Need for Liquidity and the Credit Card Debt Puzzle 
Abstract:
 In the 2001 U.S. Survey of Consumer Finances, 27% of households report
 simultaneously revolving significant credit card debt and holding sizeable
 amounts of low-return liquid assets; this is known as the "credit card
 debt puzzle". In this article, I quantitatively evaluate the role of
 liquidity demand in accounting for this puzzle: households that accumulate
 credit card debt may not pay it off using their money in the bank, because
 they anticipate needing that money in situations where credit cards cannot
 be used. I characterize the puzzle in survey data, and calibrate a dynamic
 stochastic heterogeneous-agent model of household portfolio choice, where
 consumer credit and liquidity coexist as means of consumption and saving,
 where households consume a cash good and a credit good, and where cash
 consumption is subject to uncertainty. The model accounts for between 44%
 and 56% of the households in the data who hold consumer debt and liquidity
 simultaneously, and for 100% of the liquidity held by a median such
 household. Under reasonable calibration alternatives, the model can
 capture the entire puzzle group size as well. One-half of money demand in
 the model is precautionary.  Copyright 2013, Oxford University Press.

Title: Competitive Non-linear Pricing and Bundling 
Abstract:
 We examine competitive non-linear pricing in a model in which consumers
 have heterogeneous and elastic demands and can buy from more than one
 supplier. It is an equilibrium for firms to offer a menu of efficient
 two-part tariffs, where the discount for one-stop shopping is such that
 the elasticity of "demand for two-stop shopping" equals two. Compared with
 linear pricing, non-linear pricing tends to raise profit but harm
 consumers when: (i) demand is elastic, (ii) there is heterogeneity in
 consumer demand, (iii) consumers incur shopping costs when buying from
 more than one firm, and (iv) a consumer's brand preference for one product
 is correlated with her brand preference for another product. Non-linear
 pricing is more likely to lead to welfare gains when (iii) and (iv) hold,
 but (ii) does not.  Copyright , Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Firm Turnover in Imperfectly Competitive Markets<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN1">-super-1</xref> 
Abstract:
 This paper is motivated by the empirical regularity that industries differ
 greatly in the level of firm turnover and that entry and exit rates are
 positively correlated across industries. Our objective is to investigate
 the effect of fixed costs and, in particular, market size on entry and
 exit rates and hence on the age distribution of firms.We analyse a
 stochastic dynamic model of a monopolistically competitive industry. Each
 firm's efficiency is assumed to follow a Markov process. We show existence
 and uniqueness of a stationary equilibrium with simultaneous entry and
 exit: efficient firms survive, while inefficient ones leave the market and
 are replaced by new entrants. We perform comparative dynamics with respect
 to the level of fixed costs: entry costs are negatively related and fixed
 production costs positively related to entry and exit rates. A central
 empirical prediction of the model is that the level of firm turnover is
 increasing in market size. In larger markets, competition is endogenously
 more intense than in smaller markets, and so price-cost margins are
 smaller. This price competition effect implies that the marginal surviving
 firm has to be more efficient than in smaller markets. Hence, in larger
 markets, the expected lifespan of firms is shorter, and the age
 distribution of firms is first-order stochastically dominated by that in
 smaller markets.In the empirical part, the prediction on market size and
 firm turnover is tested on an industry where firms compete in well-defined
 geographical markets of different sizes. Using data on hair salons in
 Sweden, we show that an increase in market size or fixed costs shifts the
 age distribution of firms towards younger firms, as predicted by the
 model.  Copyright 2006, Wiley-Blackwell.

 white-collar employment, using data for more than 100 US occupations over
 the period 1997--2006. A model of firm behaviour based on separability
 allows derivation of the labour demand elasticity with respect to service
 offshoring for each occupation. Estimation is performed with quasi-maximum
 likelihood, to account for high degrees of censoring in the employment
 variable. The estimated elasticities are then related to proxies for the
 skill level and the degree of tradability of the occupations. Results
 suggest that service offshoring is skill-biased, because it increases
 employment in more skilled occupations relative to less skilled
 occupations. At a given skill level, however, service offshoring penalizes
 tradable occupations relative to non-tradable occupations.  Copyright , Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Supermarket Choice and Supermarket Competition in Market Equilibrium 
Abstract:
 Multi-store firms are common in the retailing industry. Theory suggests
 that cross-elasticities between stores of the same firm enhance market
 power. To evaluate the importance of this effect in the U.K. supermarket
 industry, we estimate a model of consumer choice and expenditure using
 three data sources: profit margins for each chain, a survey of consumer
 choices and a data-set of store characteristics. To permit plausible
 substitution patterns, the utility model interacts consumer and store
 characteristics. We measure market power by calculating the effect of
 merger and demerger on Nash equilibrium prices. Demerger reduces the
 prices of the largest firms by between 2 and 3.8% depending on local
 concentration; mergers between the largest firms lead to price increases
 up to 7.4%.  Copyright 2004, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Learning and Equilibrium Selection in a Monetary Overlapping Generations Model with Sticky Prices 
Abstract:
 We study adaptive learning in a monetary overlapping generations model
 with sticky prices and monopolistic competition for the case where
 learning agents observe current endogenous variables. Observability of
 current variables is essential for informational consistency of the
 learning setup with the model setup but generates multiple temporary
 equilibria when prices are flexible and prevents a straightforward
 construction of the learning dynamics. Sticky prices overcome this problem
 by avoiding simultaneity between prices and price expectations. Adaptive
 learning then robustly selects the determinate (monetary) steady state
 independent from the degree of imperfect competition. The indeterminate
 (non-monetary) steady state and non-stationary equilibria are never
 stable. Stability in a deterministic version of the model may differ
 because perfect foresight equilibria can be the limit of restricted
 perceptions equilibria of the stochastic economy with vanishing noise and
 thereby inherit different stability properties. This discontinuity at the
 zero variance of shocks suggests one should analyse learning in stochastic
 models.  Copyright 2003, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Twenty Years of Rising Inequality in U.S. Lifetime Labour Income Values 
Abstract:
 In this paper we study the evolution of lifetime labour income inequality
 by constructing present value life cycle measures that incorporate both
 earnings and employment risk. We find that, even though lifetime income
 inequality is 40% less than earnings inequality, the total increase in
 lifetime income inequality over the past 20 years is the same as earnings
 inequality. While the total increase is the same, the pathways there
 differ with earnings inequality experiencing a steady increase and
 lifetime income inequality increasing in spurts particularly in the latter
 half of the 1990s. Finally, we find the changes in lifetime income
 inequality are primarily driven by changes in earnings mobility and
 changes in the earnings distribution itself, changes in employment risk
 and the composition of the sample, such as the shift toward attaining more
 education and the ageing population, do not play a large role.  Copyright 2004, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Semiparametric Difference-in-Differences Estimators 
Abstract:
 The difference-in-differences (DID) estimator is one of the most popular
 tools for applied research in economics to evaluate the effects of public
 interventions and other treatments of interest on some relevant outcome
 variables. However, it is well known that the DID estimator is based on
 strong identifying assumptions. In particular, the conventional DID
 estimator requires that, in the absence of the treatment, the average
 outcomes for the treated and control groups would have followed parallel
 paths over time. This assumption may be implausible if pre-treatment
 characteristics that are thought to be associated with the dynamics of the
 outcome variable are unbalanced between the treated and the untreated.
 That would be the case, for example, if selection for treatment is
 influenced by individual-transitory shocks on past outcomes (Ashenfelter's
 dip). This article considers the case in which differences in observed
 characteristics create non-parallel outcome dynamics between treated and
 controls. It is shown that, in such a case, a simple two-step strategy can
 be used to estimate the average effect of the treatment for the treated.
 In addition, the estimation framework proposed in this article allows the
 use of covariates to describe how the average effect of the treatment
 varies with changes in observed characteristics.  Copyright 2005, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Committee Design with Endogenous Information 
Abstract:
 Identical agents gather costly information, and then aggregate it through
 voting. Because information is a public good, information is underprovided
 relative to the social optimum. A "good" voting rule must give incentives
 to acquire information, as well as aggregate information efficiently. A
 voting rule that requires a large plurality (in the extreme, unanimity) to
 upset the status quo can be optimal only if the information available to
 each agent is sufficiently accurate. This result is independent of the
 preferences of voters and of the cost of information.  Copyright 2004, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Engines of Liberation 
Abstract:
 Electricity was born at the dawn of the last century. Households were
 inundated with a flood of new consumer durables. What was the impact of
 this consumer durable goods revolution? It is argued here that the
 consumer goods revolution was conducive to liberating women from the home.
 To analyse this hypothesis, a Beckerian model of household production is
 developed. Households must decide whether or not to adopt the new
 technologies, and whether a married woman should work. Can such a model
 help to explain the rise in married female labour-force participation that
 occurred in the last century? Yes.  Copyright 2005, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Social Learning and Peer Effects in Consumption: Evidence from Movie Sales 
Abstract:
 Using box-office data for all movies released between 1982 and 2000, I
 quantify how much the consumption decisions of individuals depend on
 information they receive from their peers, when quality is ex ante
 uncertain. In the presence of social learning, we should see different
 box-office sales dynamics depending on whether opening weekend demand is
 higher or lower than expected. I use a unique feature of the movie
 industry to identify ex ante demand expectations: the number of screens
 dedicated to a movie in its opening weekend reflects the sales
 expectations held by profit-maximizing theatre owners. Several pieces of
 evidence are consistent with social learning. First, sales of movies with
 positive surprise and negative surprise in opening weekend demand diverge
 over time. If a movie has better than expected appeal and therefore
 experiences larger than expected sales in Week 1, consumers in Week 2
 update upward their expectations of quality, further increasing Week 2
 sales. Second, this divergence is small for movies for which consumers
 have strong priors and large for movies for which consumers have weak
 priors. Third, the effect of a surprise is stronger for audiences with
 large social networks. Finally, consumers do not respond to surprises in
 first-week sales that are orthogonal to movie quality, like weather
 shocks. Overall, social learning appears to be an important determinant of
 sales in the movie industry, accounting for 32% of sales for the typical
 movie with positive surprise. This implies the existence of a large
 "social multiplier" such that the elasticity of aggregate demand to movie
 quality is larger than the elasticity of individual demand.  Copyright 2011, Oxford University Press.

Title: Valid Inference in Partially Unstable Generalized Method of Moments Models 
Abstract:
 This paper considers time series Generalized Method of Moments (GMM)
 models where a subset of the parameters are time varying. We focus on an
 empirically relevant case with moderately large instabilities, which are
 well approximated by a local asymptotic embedding that does not allow the
 instability to be detected with certainty, even in the limit. We show that
 for many forms of the instability and a large class of GMM models, usual
 GMM inference on the subset of stable parameters is asymptotically
 unaffected by the partial instability. In the empirical analysis of
 presumably stable parameters&#x02014;such as structural parameters in
 Euler conditions&#x02014;one can thus ignore moderate instabilities in
 other parts of the model and still obtain approximately correct inference.  Copyright , Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Resale and Rent-Seeking: An Application to Ticket Markets 
Abstract:
 We estimate an equilibrium model of ticket resale in which consumers' and
 brokers' decisions in the primary market reflect rational expectations
 about the resale market. Estimation is based on a unique dataset that
 merges transaction details from both the primary and secondary markets for
 tickets to major rock concerts. In our model, the presence of a resale
 market permits tickets to be traded from low-value to high-value
 consumers, but it also stimulates costly efforts by consumers and brokers
 to obtain underpriced tickets in the primary market. We estimate that
 observed levels of resale increase allocative efficiency by 5% on average,
 but that a third of this increase is offset by increases in costly
 rent-seeking in the primary market and transaction costs in the resale
 market.  Copyright 2014, Oxford University Press.

Title: Forecasting Time Series Subject to Multiple Structural Breaks 
Abstract:
 This paper provides a new approach to forecasting time series that are
 subject to discrete structural breaks. We propose a Bayesian estimation
 and prediction procedure that allows for the possibility of new breaks
 occurring over the forecast horizon, taking account of the size and
 duration of past breaks (if any) by means of a hierarchical hidden Markov
 chain model. Predictions are formed by integrating over the parameters
 from the meta-distribution that characterizes the stochastic break-point
 process. In an application to U.S. Treasury bill rates, we find that the
 method leads to better out-of-sample forecasts than a range of alternative
 methods.  Copyright 2006, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Network Games 
Abstract:
 In contexts ranging from public goods provision to information collection,
 a player's well-being depends on his or her own action as well as on the
 actions taken by his or her neighbours. We provide a framework to analyse
 such strategic interactions when neighbourhood structure, modelled in
 terms of an underlying network of connections, affects payoffs. In our
 framework, individuals are partially informed about the structure of the
 social network. The introduction of incomplete information allows us to
 provide general results characterizing how the network structure, an
 individual's position within the network, the nature of games (strategic
 substitutes vs. complements and positive vs. negative externalities) and
 the level of information shape individual behaviour and payoffs.  Copyright , Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Statistical Discrimination with Peer Effects: Can Integration Eliminate Negative Stereotypes? 
Abstract:
 We introduce peer effects in the costs of human capital acquisition into a
 model of statistical discrimination in labour markets. This creates a link
 between the level of segregation in social networks and racial disparities
 in job assignment and wages. We show that this relationship is
 characterized by discontinuities: there is a threshold level of
 segregation below which negative stereotypes become unsustainable, and
 steady-state skill levels can change dramatically. This change can work in
 either direction: skill levels may either rise or fall in both groups.
 Which of these outcomes arises depends on the population share of the
 disadvantaged group and on the distribution of the costs of human capital
 investments. We also examine the effects of affirmative action policies in
 the presence of peer effects and provide conditions under which such
 policies eliminate negative stereotypes.  Copyright 2008, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: A Foundation for Markov Equilibria in Sequential Games with Finite Social Memory<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN18">-super-*</xref> 
Abstract:
 We study stochastic games with an infinite horizon and sequential moves
 played by an arbitrary number of players. We assume that social memory is
 finite--every player, except possibly one, is finitely lived and cannot
 observe events that are sufficiently far back in the past. This class of
 games includes games between a long-run player and a sequence of short-run
 players, and games with overlapping generations of players. An equilibrium
 is purifiable if some close-by behaviour is consistent with equilibrium
 when agents' payoffs in each period are perturbed additively and
 independently. We show that only Markov equilibria are purifiable when
 social memory is finite. Thus if a game has at most one long-run player,
 all purifiable equilibria are Markov.  Copyright 2013, Oxford University Press.

Title: Campaign Advertising and Election Outcomes: Quasi-natural Experiment Evidence from Gubernatorial Elections in Brazil 
Abstract:
 Whether campaign advertising influences election outcomes is an open
 question; a paradox given the amount spent on campaigning in general and
 TV advertising in particular. We argue that such "absence of
 documentation" is due to the focus of the empirical literature on the
 U.S., where the allocation of campaign spending and advertising is
 decentralized. We explore a quasi-natural experiment that enables us to
 mitigate the omitted variables and reverse causality problems caused by
 decentralized allocation. In Brazil, gubernatorial elections work in a
 two-round system. In the first round, candidates' TV time shares are
 determined by their coalitions' share of seats in the National Parliament.
 In the second round, TV time is split equally between the first-round
 winner and runner-up. Using differences between rounds as a source of
 variation, we find a large causal effect of TV advertising on election
 outcomes.  Copyright 2011, Oxford University Press.

Title: Optimal Dissent in Organizations 
Abstract:
 We model an organization as a two-agent hierarchy: an informed Decision
 Maker in charge of selecting projects and a (possibly) uninformed
 Implementer in charge of their execution. Both have intrinsic preferences
 over projects. This paper models the costs and benefits of divergence
 between their preferences, that is, dissent within the organization.
 Dissent is useful to (1) foster the use of objective (and sometimes
 private) information in decision making and (2) give credibility to the
 Decision Maker's choices. However, dissent comes at the cost of hurting
 the Implementer's intrinsic motivation, thereby impairing organizational
 efficiency. We show that dissent can be optimal, in particular, when
 information is useful and uncertainty is high. Moreover, dissent remains
 an optimal organizational form even when Implementers can choose their
 employer or when Decision Makers have real authority over hiring
 decisions.  Copyright , Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Information Acquisition and Reputation Dynamics 
Abstract:
 We study dynamic incentives and behaviour in markets with costly discovery
 of past transactions. In our model, a sequence of short-lived customers
 interact over time with a single long-lived firm that privately knows its
 type (good or opportunistic). Customers must pay to observe the firm's
 past behaviour. We characterize the equilibrium structure that features
 accumulation, consumption, and restoration of reputation. The
 opportunistic firm deliberately builds its reputation up to a point where
 the maximum periods of information acquired by customers do not reveal
 past opportunistic behaviour and exploits the customers who most trust the
 firm.  Copyright 2011, Oxford University Press.

Title: Stated Beliefs and Play in Normal-Form Games 
Abstract:
 Using data on one-shot games, we investigate whether players' actions can
 be viewed as responses to underlying expectations about their opponent's
 behaviour. In our laboratory experiments, subjects play a set of 14
 two-person 3&#x000D7;3 games and state beliefs about which actions they
 expect their opponents to play. The data sets from the two tasks are
 largely inconsistent. Rather, we find evidence that the subjects perceive
 the games differently when they (i) choose actions and (ii) state
 beliefs&#x02014;their stated beliefs reveal deeper strategic thinking than
 their actions. On average, they fail to best respond to their own stated
 beliefs in almost half of the games. The inconsistency is confirmed by
 estimates of a unified statistical model that jointly uses the actions and
 the belief statements. There, we can control for decision noise and
 formulate a statistical test that rejects consistency. Effects of the
 belief elicitation procedure on subsequent actions are mostly
 insignificant.  Copyright 2008, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Generalized Non-Parametric Deconvolution with an Application to Earnings Dynamics 
Abstract:
 In this paper, we construct a non-parametric estimator of the
 distributions of latent factors in linear independent multi-factor models
 under the assumption that factor loadings are known. Our approach allows
 estimation of the distributions of up to L(L&plus; 1)/2 factors given L
 measurements. The estimator uses empirical characteristic functions, like
 many available deconvolution estimators. We show that it is consistent,
 and derive asymptotic convergence rates. Monte Carlo simulations show good
 finite-sample performance, less so if distributions are highly skewed or

Title: Financial Deepening, Inequality, and Growth: A Model-Based Quantitative Evaluation<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN1">-super-1</xref> 
Abstract:
 We propose a coherent unified approach to the study of the linkages among
 economic growth, financial structure, and inequality, bringing together
 disparate theoretical and empirical literature. That is, we show how to
 conduct model-based quantitative research on transitional paths. With
 analytical and numerical methods, we calibrate and make tractable a
 prototype canonical model and take it to an application, namely, Thailand
 1976&#x2013;1996, an emerging market economy in a phase of economic
 expansion with uneven financial deepening and increasing inequality. We
 look at the expected path generated by the model and conduct robustness
 experiments. Because the actual path of the Thai economy is imagined here
 to be just one realization of many possible histories of the model
 economy, we construct a covariance-normalized squared error metric of
 closeness and find the best-fit simulation. We also construct a confidence
 region from a set of simulations and formally test the model. We broadly
 replicate the actual data and identify anomalies.  Copyright 2006, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Optimal Monetary Policy 
Abstract:
 Optimal monetary policy maximizes the welfare of a representative agent,
 given frictions in the economic environment. Constructing a model with two
 sets of frictions&#x02014;costly price adjustment by imperfectly
 competitive firms and costly exchange of wealth for goods&#x02014;we find
 optimal monetary policy is governed by two familiar principles. First, the
 average level of the nominal interest rate should be sufficiently low, as
 suggested by Milton Friedman, that there should be deflation on average.
 Yet, the Keynesian frictions imply that the optimal nominal interest rate
 is positive. Second, as various shocks occur to the real and monetary
 sectors, the price level should be largely stabilized, as suggested by
 Irving Fisher, albeit around a deflationary trend path. Since expected
 inflation is roughly constant through time, the nominal interest rate must
 therefore vary with the Fisherian determinants of the real interest rate.
 Although the monetary authority has substantial leverage over real
 activity in our model economy, it chooses real allocations that closely
 resemble those which would occur if prices were flexible. In our benchmark
 model, there is some tendency for the monetary authority to smooth nominal
 and real interest rates.  Copyright 2003, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Discrete Choice Non-Response 
Abstract:
 Missing values are endemic in the data sets available to econometricians.
 This paper suggests a semiparametrically efficient likelihood-based
 approach to deal with general non-ignorable missing data problems for
 discrete choice models. Our concern is when the dependent variable and/or
 covariates are unobserved for some sampling units. A supplementary random
 sample of observations on all covariates may be available. The key insight
 of this paper is the recognition of non-response as a modification of
 choice-based (CB) samples. Semiparametrically efficient generalized method
 of moments (GMM) estimation appropriate for CB samples is then adapted for
 the non-response framework considered in this paper. Simulation results
 for various GMM estimators proposed here are very encouraging.  Copyright , Oxford University Press.

Title: Using Stock Price Information to Regulate Firms 
Abstract:
 This paper examines the role of the information contained in stock prices
 in the regulation of privatized firms. Stock prices contain noisy but
 unbiased information about firm's future prospects that regulators can use
 to decide on some regulatory policies. The main argument developed is that
 the observation of stock price movements reduces the incentives of
 regulators to develop their own monitoring technologies and can allow them
 to commit to relatively lighthanded regulations. This protects firm's
 investments in cost reduction activities and can increase ex ante welfare.  Copyright 2002, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Compensating Variation and Hicksian Choice Probabilities in Random Utility Models that are Nonlinear in Income 
Abstract:
 In this paper we discuss Hicksian demand and compensating variation in the
 context of discrete choice. We first derive Hicksian choice probabilities
 and the distribution of the (random) expenditure function in the general
 case when the utilities are nonlinear in income. We subsequently derive
 exact and simple formulae for the expenditure and choice probabilities
 under price (policy) changes conditional on the initial utility level.
 This is of particular interest for welfare measurement because it enables
 the researcher to compute the distribution of compensating variation in a
 simple way. We also derive formulae for the joint distribution of
 expenditure, the choice before and after a policy change has been
 introduced.  Copyright 2005, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Collusion, Exclusion, and Inclusion in Random-Order Bargaining 
Abstract:
 This paper examines the profitability of three types of integration in a
 cooperative game solved by a random-order value (e.g. the Shapley value).
 Collusion between players i and j is a contract merging their resources in
 the hands of one of them, say i. This contract can be represented as a
 combination of exclusion, which lets i exclude j's resource but not use it
 himself, and inclusion, which lets i use j's resource but not exclude j
 from it. This representation yields a third-difference condition on the
 characteristic function that determines the profitability of collusion,
 generalizing existing results for specific games. Namely, collusion is
 profitable [unprofitable] when the complementarity of the colluding
 players is reduced [increased] by other players.  Copyright 2003, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Strategic Liquidity Supply and Security Design 
Abstract:
 We study how securities and issuance mechanisms can be designed to
 mitigate the adverse impact of market imperfections on liquidity. In our
 model, asset owners seek to obtain liquidity by selling claims contingent
 on privately observed future cash-flows. Liquidity suppliers can be
 competitive or strategic. In the optimal trading mechanism associated with
 an arbitrary given security, issuers with low cash-flows sell their entire
 holdings of the security, while issuers with high cash-flows are typically
 excluded from trade. By designing the security optimally, issuers can
 avoid exclusion altogether. We show that the optimal security is debt.
 Because of its low informational sensitivity, debt mitigates the adverse
 selection problem. Furthermore, by pooling all issuers with high
 cash-flows, debt also reduces the ability of a monopolistic liquidity
 supplier to exclude them from trade in order to better extract rents from
 issuers with lower cash-flows.  Copyright 2005, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Identification of Search Models using Record Statistics 
Abstract:
 This paper shows how record-value theory, a branch of statistics that
 deals with the timing and magnitude of extreme values in sequences of
 random variables, can be used to recover features of the wage offer
 distribution in conventional search models. Using National Longitudinal
 Survey of Youth (NLSY) wage data, I show that the data are not compatible
 with specifications for the offer distribution characterized by extreme
 negative skewness. In addition, I show that my approach can be used to
 construct a bound on the returns to job seniority. My results suggest that
 job seniority plays only a minor role in the wage growth of the workers
 surveyed in the NLSY.  Copyright 2008, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Nonparametric Estimation of Sample Selection Models 
Abstract:
 Sample selection models provide an important way of accounting for
 economic decisions that combine discrete and continuous choices and of
 correcting for nonrandom sampling. Nonparametric estimators for these
 models are developed in this paper. These can be used for estimating
 shapes and important economic quantities, as in standard nonparametric
 regression. Endogeneity of regressors of interest is allowed for. Series
 estimators for these models are developed, which are useful for imposing
 additivity restrictions that arise from selection corrections. Convergence
 rates and asymptotic normality results are derived. An application to
 returns to schooling among Australian young females is given.  Copyright 2003, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Incomplete Simultaneous Discrete Response Model with Multiple Equilibria 
Abstract:
 A bivariate simultaneous discrete response model which is a stochastic
 representation of equilibria in a two-person discrete game is studied. The
 presence of multiple equilibria in the underlying discrete game maps into
 a region for the exogenous variables where the model predicts a nonunique
 outcome. This is an example of an incomplete econometric structure.
 Economists using this model have made simplifying assumptions to avoid
 multiplicity. I make a distinction between incoherent models and
 incomplete models, and then analyse the model in the presence of multiple
 equilibria, showing that the model contains enough information to identify
 the parameters of interest and to obtain a well defined semiparametric
 estimator. I also show that the latter is consistent and &#x221A;n normal.
 Moreover, by exploiting the presence of multiplicity, one is able to
 obtain a more efficient estimator than the existing methods.  Copyright 2003, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Quick Job Entry or Long-Term Human Capital Development? The Dynamic Effects of Alternative Training Schemes 
Abstract:
 This article investigates how precisely short-term, job search-oriented
 training programs as opposed to long-term, human capital intensive
 training programs work. We evaluate and compare their effects on time
 until job entry, stability of employment, and earnings. Further, we
 examine the heterogeneity of treatment effects according to the timing of
 training during unemployment as well as across different subgroups of
 participants. We find that participating in short-term training reduces
 the remaining time in unemployment and moderately increases job stability.
 Long-term training programs initially prolong the remaining time in
 unemployment, but once the scheduled program end is reached participants
 exit to employment at a much faster rate than without training. In
 addition, they benefit from substantially more stable employment spells
 and higher earnings. Overall, long-term training programs are well
 effective in supporting the occupational advancement of very heterogeneous
 groups of participants, including those with generally weak labor market
 prospects. However, from a fiscal perspective only the low-cost short-term
 training schemes are cost efficient in the short run.  Copyright , Oxford University Press.

Title: Informed Trading and Portfolio Returns 
Abstract:
 We solve a multi-period model of strategic trading with long-lived
 information in multiple assets with correlated innovations in fundamental
 values. Market makers in each asset can only condition their pricing
 functions on trading in each asset. Using daily non-public data from the
 New York Stock Exchange, we test the model's predictions on the
 conditional and unconditional lead--lag relations of institutional order
 flow and returns within portfolios. We find support for the model
 prediction of positive autocorrelations in portfolio returns as well as
 the predictions for how informed order flow positively predicts future
 returns and future informed order flow. We show that these relations
 strengthen for portfolios formed from assets within the same industry,
 which likely have higher correlation of fundamental values. Furthermore,
 we discuss issues that arise when testing implications of strategic models
 with imperfect proxies for the underlying strategic behaviour.  Copyright , Oxford University Press.

Title: Optimal Unemployment Insurance and Employment History 
Abstract:
 In existing unemployment insurance programmes, it is standard to condition
 eligibility on the previous employment record of unemployed workers. The
 purpose of this article is to study conditions under which the efficient
 contract exhibits these properties. In order to do so, we characterize the
 optimal unemployment insurance contract in asymmetric information
 environments in which workers experience multiple unemployment spells. We
 show that if quits cannot be distinguished from layoffs, it is optimal to
 condition the benefits paid to unemployed workers on their employment
 history, in particular, the coverage should increase with the length of
 previous employment spells.  Copyright , Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Can Sticky Price Models Generate Volatile and Persistent Real Exchange Rates? 
Abstract:
 The central puzzle in international business cycles is that fluctuations
 in real exchange rates are volatile and persistent. We quantify the
 popular story for real exchange rate fluctuations: they are generated by
 monetary shocks interacting with sticky goods prices. If prices are held
 fixed for at least one year, risk aversion is high, and preferences are
 separable in leisure, then real exchange rates generated by the model are
 as volatile as in the data and quite persistent, but less so than in the
 data. The main discrepancy between the model and the data, the
 consumption&#x2014;real exchange rate anomaly, is that the model generates
 a high correlation between real exchange rates and the ratio of
 consumption across countries, while the data show no clear pattern between
 these variables.  Copyright 2002, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Fooling All of the People Some of the Time: A Theory of Endogenous Sequencing in Confidential Negotiations 
Abstract:
 We analyse a bargaining game in which one party, called the buyer, has the
 option of choosing the sequence of negotiations with other participants,
 called sellers. When the sequencing of negotiations is confidential and
 the sellers' goods are highly complementary, efficient, non-dissipative
 equilibria exist in which the buyer randomizes over negotiation sequences.
 In these equilibria, the buyer can obtain higher pay-offs than in pure
 strategy equilibria or in public negotiations. The degree of sequencing
 uncertainty that maximizes buyer pay-offs is inversely related to the
 aggregate bargaining power of the sellers.  Copyright 2004, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Negatively Correlated Bandits 
Abstract:
 We analyse a two-player game of strategic experimentation with two-armed
 bandits. Either player has to decide in continuous time whether to use a
 safe arm with a known pay-off or a risky arm whose expected pay-off per
 unit of time is initially unknown. This pay-off can be high or low and is
 negatively correlated across players. We characterize the set of all
 Markov perfect equilibria in the benchmark case where the risky arms are
 known to be of opposite type and construct equilibria in cut-off
 strategies for arbitrary negative correlation. All strategies and pay-offs
 are in closed form. In marked contrast to the case where both risky arms
 are of the same type, there always exists an equilibrium in cut-off
 strategies, and there always exists an equilibrium exhibiting efficient
 long-run patterns of learning. These results extend to a three-player game
 with common knowledge that exactly one risky arm is of the high pay-off
 type.  Copyright 2011, Oxford University Press.

Title: Party Formation and Policy Outcomes under Different Electoral Systems 
Abstract:
 I introduce a model of representative democracy with strategic parties,
 strategic candidates, strategic voters and multiple districts. If policy
 preferences are similar across districts and not too concentrated within
 districts, then the number of effective parties is larger under
 proportional representation (PR) than under plurality, and both electoral
 systems determine the median voter's preferred policy. However, for more
 asymmetric distributions of preferences the Duvergerian predictions can be
 reversed, and the policy outcome with PR is more moderate than the one
 with plurality. Sincere voting induces more party formation, and strategic
 voting can be observed more often under PR.  Copyright 2004, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: International Risk Sharing and the Transmission of Productivity Shocks 
Abstract:
 This paper shows that standard international business cycle models can be
 reconciled with the empirical evidence on the lack of consumption risk
 sharing. First, we show analytically that with incomplete asset markets
 productivity disturbances can have large uninsurable effects on wealth,
 depending on the value of the trade elasticity and shock persistence.
 Second, we investigate these findings quantitatively in a model calibrated
 to the U.S. economy. With the low trade elasticity estimated via a method
 of moments procedure, the consumption risk of productivity shocks is
 magnified by high terms of trade and real exchange rate (RER) volatility.
 Strong wealth effects in response to shocks raise the demand for domestic
 goods above supply, crowding out external demand and appreciating the
 terms of trade and the RER. Building upon the literature on incomplete
 markets, we then show that similar results are obtained when productivity
 shocks are nearly permanent, provided the trade elasticity is set equal to
 the high values consistent with micro-estimates. Under both approaches the
 model accounts for the low and negative correlation between the RER and
 relative (domestic to foreign) consumption in the data&#x02014;the
 "Backus-Smith puzzle".  Copyright 2008, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Identification and Estimation of Auction Models with Unobserved Heterogeneity 
Abstract:
 In many procurement auctions, the bidders' unobserved costs depend both on
 a common shock and on idiosyncratic private information. Assuming a
 multiplicative structure, I derive sufficient conditions under which the
 model is identified and propose a non-parametric estimation procedure that
 results in uniformly consistent estimators of the cost components'
 distributions. The estimation procedure is applied to data from Michigan
 highway procurement auctions. Private information is estimated to account
 for 34% of the variation in bidders' costs. It is shown that accounting
 for unobserved auction heterogeneity has important implications for the
 evaluation of the distribution of rents, efficiency, and optimal auction
 design.  Copyright 2011, Oxford University Press.

Title: Collusion via Signalling in Simultaneous Ascending Bid Auctions with Heterogeneous Objects, with and without Complementarities 
Abstract:
 Collusive equilibria exist in simultaneous ascending bid auctions with
 multiple objects, even with large complementarities in the buyers' utility
 functions. The bidders collude by dividing the objects among themselves,
 while keeping the prices low. In the most collusive equilibrium the
 complementarities are never realized. The scope for collusion however
 narrows as the ratio between the number of bidders and the number of
 objects increases.  Copyright 2002, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Market News in Commodity Price Theory: Application to the Ethiopian Grain Market 
Abstract:
 This paper examines the effect of "news" or advance information about
 future production on competitive storage behaviour and prices using a
 structural model of commodity markets. In particular, it generalizes the
 neoclassical storage model to incorporate information on future harvests,
 while allowing for seasonal production, two features important to African
 and other developing country grain markets. The model is first developed
 to suit the case of the Ethiopian grain markets, and a general model is
 then stated. The effects on welfare and price variability of the addition
 of news are discussed, as well as changes in key demand and uncertainty
 parameters. The model is shown to replicate some features of the data
 better than the model without news, particularly the high autocorrelation
 in price, and performs better in formal estimation. However, it appears
 that the incorporation of news still fails to explain the extreme seasonal
 price movements observed.  Copyright 2004, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Patterns of Skill Premia 
Abstract:
 This paper develops a model to analyse how skill premia differ over time
 and across countries, and uses this model to study the impact of
 international trade on wage inequality. Skill premia are determined by
 technology, the relative supply of skills, and trade. Technology is itself
 endogenous, and responds to profit incentives. An increase in the relative
 supply of skills, holding technology constant, reduces the skill premium.
 But an increase in the supply of skills over time also induces a change in
 technology, increasing the demand for skills. The most important result of
 the paper is that increased international trade induces skill-biased
 technical change. As a result, trade opening can cause a rise in
 inequality both in the U.S. and the less developed countries, and thanks
 to the induced skill-biased technical change, this can happen without a
 rise in the relative prices of skill-intensive goods in the U.S., which is
 the usual intervening mechanism in the standard trade models.  Copyright 2003, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Robust Predictions in Infinite-Horizon Games--an Unrefinable Folk Theorem 
Abstract:
 We show that in any game that is continuous at infinity, if a plan of
 action a<sub>i</sub> is played by a type t<sub>i</sub> in a Bayesian Nash
 equilibrium, then there are perturbations of t<sub>i</sub> for which
 a<sub>i</sub> is the only rationalizable plan and whose unique
 rationalizable belief regarding the play of the game is arbitrarily close
 to the equilibrium belief of t<sub>i</sub>. As an application to repeated
 games, we prove an unrefinable folk theorem: any individually rational and
 feasible payoff is the unique rationalizable payoff vector for some
 perturbed type profile. This is true even if perturbed types are
 restricted to believe that the repeated-game payoff structure and the
 discount factor are common knowledge.  Copyright , Oxford University Press.

Title: Wage-Tenure Contracts in a Frictional Labour Market: Firms' Strategies for Recruitment and Retention 
Abstract:
 A common assumption in equilibrium search and matching models of the
 labour market is that each firm posts a wage, to be paid to any worker
 hired. This paper considers the implications of firms posting contracts,
 in a random matching model with on-the-job search. More complex contracts
 enable firms to address both recruitment and retention problems by, for
 example, increasing the wage with tenure. The effect on the labour market
 is to reduce turnover, below the level required for efficient matching of
 workers to firms.  Copyright 2004, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Harmful Addiction 
Abstract:
 We construct an infinite horizon model of harmful addiction. Consumption
 is compulsive if it differs from what the individual would have chosen had
 commitment been available. A good is addictive if its consumption leads to
 more compulsive consumption of the same good. We analyse the welfare
 implications of drug policies and find that taxes on drugs decrease
 welfare while prohibitive policies may increase welfare. We also analyse
 the agent's demand for voluntary commitment (&#x201C;rehab&#x201D;). For
 appropriate parameters, the model predicts a cycle of addiction where the
 agent periodically checks into rehab. Between these visits his drug
 consumption increases each period.  Copyright 2007, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: The Market for Sweepstakes 
Abstract:
 This paper studies the market for monopolistically supplied sweepstakes.
 We derive equilibrium demands for fixed-prize and variable-prize
 sweepstakes and determine the profit-maximizing prize level and pay-out
 ratio respectively. It can be profitable to offer each type of sweepstake
 when there is a large enough number of weighted utility consumers who have
 constant absolute risk attitudes, are strictly averse to small as well as
 symmetric risks, and display longshot preference behaviour. Moreover, for
 the variable-prize sweepstake, the supplier will generally find it
 profitable to combine sweepstakes targeting two smaller populations, and
 offer a single sweepstake to the combined population. This implication is
 corroborated by the recent spate of mergers of smaller state lotteries
 into larger ones.  Copyright 2005, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Entry and Competition Effects in First-Price Auctions: Theory and Evidence from Procurement Auctions 
Abstract:
 Motivated by several interesting features of the highway mowing auction
 data from the Texas Department of Transportation (TDoT), we study three
 competing procurement auction models with endogenous entry. Our entry and
 bidding models provide several interesting implications. For the first
 time, we show that even within an independent private value paradigm, as
 the number of potential bidders increases, bidders' equilibrium bidding
 behaviour can become less aggressive, and the expected procurement cost
 may rise because the "entry effect" is always positive and may dominate
 the negative "competition effect". We then develop structural models of
 entry and bidding corresponding to the three models under consideration,
 controlling for unobserved auction heterogeneity, and use the recently
 developed semi-parametric Bayesian estimation method to analyse the data.
 We select the model that best fits the data, and use the corresponding
 structural estimates to quantify the "entry effect" and the "competition
 effect" with regard to the individual bids and the procurement cost.  Copyright 2009, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Monopoly Power and Distribution in Fragmented Markets: The Case of Groundwater 
Abstract:
 This paper examines monopoly power in the market for groundwater
 (irrigation water extracted by private tubewells), a market characterized
 by barriers to entry and spatial fragmentation. In Pakistan's Punjab
 region, groundwater and tenancy contracts are often interlinked, with
 share-tenants gaining access to water through the use of their landlord's
 tubewell. An analysis of groundwater transactions shows that tenants of
 tubewell owners are charged lower prices than other customers. Tubewell
 owners and their tenants also use considerably more groundwater on their
 plots than other farmers. Using detailed price and quantity data, the
 efficiency and distributional implications of this monopoly power are
 explored.  Copyright 2004, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: The Design of Optimal Education Policies 
Abstract:
 This paper studies the education policy chosen by a utilitarian
 government. In the model, households differ in their income and in their
 children's ability; income is observed by the government, but ability is
 private information. Households can use private education, but cannot
 borrow to finance it. The government can finance education with income
 tax, but at the cost of blunting the individuals' incentive to exert
 labour market effort. The optimal education policy we derive is elitist:
 it increases the spread between the educational achievement of the bright
 and the less bright individuals, compared to private provision. It is also
 such that the education received by less bright individuals depends
 positively on their parental income. Finally, the optimal education policy
 is input regressive, in the sense of Arrow (1971, Quarterly Journal of
 Economics, 38, 175&#x2013;208): households with higher income and brighter
 children contribute less in tuition fees towards the cost of the education
 system than households with lower income and less bright children.  Copyright 2002, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Taxes, Regulations, and the Value of U.S. and U.K. Corporations 
Abstract:
 We derive the quantitative implications of growth theory for U.S.
 corporate equity plus net debt over the period 1960-2001. There were large
 secular movements in corporate equity values relative to GDP, with
 dramatic declines in the 1970's and dramatic increases starting in the
 1980's and continuing throughout the 1990's. During the same period, there
 was little change in the capital&#x02014;output ratio or earnings share of
 output. We ask specifically whether the theory accounts for these
 observations. We find that it does, with the critical factor being changes
 in the U.S. tax and regulatory system. We find that the theory also
 accounts for the even larger movements in U.K. equity values relative to
 GDP in this period.  Copyright 2005, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Overturning Mundell: Fiscal Policy in a Monetary Union 
Abstract:
 Central to ongoing debates over the desirability of monetary unions is a
 supposed trade-off, outlined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Mundell
 (1961)</xref>: a monetary union reduces transactions costs but renders
 stabilization policy less effective. If shocks across countries are
 sufficiently correlated, then, according to this argument, delegating
 monetary policy to a single central bank is not very costly and a monetary
 union is desirable.This paper explores this argument in a setting with
 both monetary and fiscal policies. In an economy with monetary policy
 alone, we confirm the presence of the trade-off and find that indeed a
 monetary union will not be welfare improving if the correlation of
 national shocks is too low. However, fiscal interventions by national
 governments, combined with a central bank that has the ability to commit
 to monetary policy, overturn these results. In equilibrium, such a
 monetary union will be welfare improving for any correlation of shocks.  Copyright 2004, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: On-the-Job Search, Mismatch and Efficiency<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN18">*</xref> 
Abstract:
 This paper characterizes the equilibrium for a large class of search
 models with two-sided heterogeneity and on-the-job search. Besides the
 well-known congestion externalities, we show that on-the-job search in
 combination with monopsonistic wage setting without commitment creates a
 "business-stealing" externality. In the absence of congestion effects,
 this leads to excessive vacancy creation. Under wage setting with
 commitment this externality is absent because when posting a wage, firms
 take into account the expected productivity of future workers in their
 current jobs. If firms are able to make and respond to counteroffers, then
 they will not have to pay no-quit premia and this also leads to excessive
 vacancy creation.  Copyright , Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Institutional Quality and International Trade 
Abstract:
 Institutions&#x2014;quality of contract enforcement, property rights,
 shareholder protection, and the like&#x2014;have received a great deal of
 attention in recent years. Yet trade theory has not considered the
 implications of institutional differences, beyond treating them simply as
 different technologies or taxes. The purpose of this paper is twofold.
 First, we propose a simple model of international trade in which
 institutional differences are modelled within the framework of incomplete
 contracts. We show that doing so reverses many of the conclusions obtained
 by equating institutions with productivity. Institutional differences as a
 source of comparative advantage imply, among other things, that the less
 developed country may not gain from trade and factor prices may actually
 diverge as a result of trade. Second, we test empirically whether
 institutions act as a source of trade, using data on U.S. imports
 disaggregated by country and industry. The empirical results provide
 evidence of &#x201C;institutional content of trade&#x201D;: institutional
 differences are an important determinant of trade flows.  Copyright 2007, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: (A, f): Choice with Frames<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN1">-super-1</xref> 
Abstract:
 We develop a framework for modelling choice in the presence of framing
 effects. An extended choice function assigns a chosen element to every
 pair (A, f) where A is a set of alternatives, and f is a frame. A frame
 includes observable information that is irrelevant in the rational
 assessment of the alternatives, but nonetheless affects choice. We relate
 the new framework to the classical model of choice correspondence.
 Conditions are identified under which there exists either a transitive or
 a transitive and complete binary relation R such that an alternative x is
 chosen in some (A, f) iff x is R-maximal in the set A. We then demonstrate
 that the framework of choice correspondence misses information, which is
 essential to economic modelling, and which is incorporated in the extended
 choice function.  Copyright 2008, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Moderation in Groups: Evidence from Betting on Ice Break-ups in Alaska 
Abstract:
 We use a large sample of guessed ice break-up dates for the Tanana River
 in Alaska to study differences between outcomes of decisions made by
 individuals versus groups. We estimate the distribution of guesses
 conditional on whether they were made by individual bettors or betting
 pools. We document two major distinctions between the two sets of guesses:
 (1) the distribution of guesses made by groups of bettors appears to
 conform more to the distribution of historical break-up dates than the
 distribution of guesses made by individual bettors, and (2) the
 distribution for groups has less mass in its tails and displays lower
 variability than the distribution for individuals. We argue that these two
 pieces of evidence are consistent with the hypothesis that group decisions
 are more moderate, either because groups have to reach a compromise when
 their members disagree or because individuals with extreme opinions are
 less likely to be part of a group.  Copyright , Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Interregional Redistribution and Mobility in Federations: A Positive Approach 
Abstract:
 The paper studies the effects and the determinants of interregional
 redistribution in a model of residential and political choice. We find
 that paradoxical consequences of interjurisdictional transfers arise if
 people are mobile: while self-sufficient regions are necessarily identical
 with respect to policies and average incomes in our model, interregional
 redistribution always leads to the divergence of regional policies and per
 capita incomes. Thus, interregional redistribution prevents interregional
 equality. At the same time, however, transfers may allow for more
 interpersonal equality among the inhabitants of each region. The voting
 population may therefore in a decision over the fiscal constitution
 deliberately implement such a transfer scheme to foster regional
 divergence. Empirical evidence from panel data from OECD countries and
 Canadian provinces is consistent with the theory.  Copyright 2011, Oxford University Press.

Title: To Leave or Not to Leave: The Distribution of Bequest Motives 
Abstract:
 We examine the effect of observed and unobserved heterogeneity in the
 desire to die with positive net worth. Using a structural life-cycle model
 nested in a switching regression with unknown sample separation, we find
 that roughly three-fourths of the elderly single population has abequest
 motive. Both the presence and the magnitude of the bequest motive are
 statistically and economically significant. On average, households with a
 bequest motive spend about 25&#x0025; less on consumption expenditures. We
 conclude that, among the elderly single households in our sample, about
 four-fifths of their net wealth will be bequeathed and approximately half
 of this is due to a bequest motive.  Copyright 2007, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Identifying Distributional Characteristics in Random Coefficients Panel Data Models 
Abstract:
 We study the identification of panel models with linear
 individual-specific coefficients when T is fixed. We show identification
 of the variance of the effects under conditional uncorrelatedness.
 Identification requires restricted dependence of errors, reflecting a
 trade-off between heterogeneity and error dynamics. We show identification
 of the probability distribution of individual effects when errors follow
 an Autoregressive Moving Average process under conditional independence.
 We discuss Generalized Method of Moments estimation of moments of effects
 and errors and construct non-parametric estimators of their densities. As
 an application, we estimate the effect that a mother smoking during
 pregnancy has on her child's birth weight.  Copyright , Oxford University Press.

Title: Social Learning from Private Experiences: The Dynamics of the Selection Problem 
Abstract:
 I analyse social interactions that stem from the successive endeavours of
 new cohorts of heterogeneous decision makers to learn from the experiences
 of past cohorts. A dynamic process of information accumulation and
 decision making occurs as the members of each cohort observe the
 experiences of earlier ones, and then make choices that yield experiences
 observable by future cohorts. Decision makers face the selection problem
 as they seek to learn from observation of past actions and outcomes, while
 not observing the counterfactual outcomes that would have occurred had
 other actions been chosen. Assuming that all cohorts face the same outcome
 distributions, I show that social learning is a process of sequential
 reduction in ambiguity. The specific nature of this process, and its
 terminal state, depend critically on how decision makers make choices
 under ambiguity. I use the problem of learning about innovations to
 illustrate.  Copyright 2004, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Does Poaching Distort Training? 
Abstract:
 We analyse the efficiency of the labour market outcome in a competitive
 search equilibrium model with endogenous turnover and endogenous general
 human capital formation. We show that search frictions do not distort
 training decisions if firms and their employees are able to coordinate
 efficiently, for instance, by using long-term contracts. In the absence of
 efficient coordination devices there is too much turnover and too little
 investment in general training. Nonetheless, the number of training firms
 and the amount of training provided are constrained optimal, and training
 subsidies therefore reduce welfare.  Copyright 2004, Wiley-Blackwell.

 It is shown that in the case of Shapley regular normal form games, the
 identified set is characterized by the inclusion of the true data
 distribution within the core of a Choquet capacity, which is interpreted
 as the generalized likelihood of the model. In turn, this inclusion is
 characterized by a finite set of inequalities and efficient and easily
 implementable combinatorial methods are described to check them. In all
 normal form games, the identified set is characterized in terms of the
 value of a submodular or convex optimization program. Efficient algorithms
 are then given and compared to check inclusion of a parameter in this
 identified set. The latter are illustrated with family bargaining games
 and oligopoly entry games.  Copyright 2011, Oxford University Press.

Title: Banking: A New Monetarist Approach 
Abstract:
 We develop a model where: (i) banks take deposits and make investments;
 (ii) their liabilities facilitate third-party transactions. Other models
 have (i) or (ii), not both, although we argue they are intimately
 connected: we show that they both emerge from limited commitment. We
 describe an environment, characterize desirable allocations, and interpret
 the outcomes as banking arrangements. Banks are essential: without them,
 the set of feasible allocations is inferior. As a technical contribution,
 we characterize dynamically optimal credit allocations with frictions,
 show they involve backloading, and analyse how this interacts with
 banking. We also confront the theory with economic history.  Copyright 2013, Oxford University Press.

Title: Progressive Screening: Long-Term Contracting with a Privately Known Stochastic Process 
Abstract:
 We examine a model of long-term contracting in which the buyer is
 privately informed about the stochastic process by which her value for a
 good evolves. In addition, the realized values are also private
 information. We characterize a class of environments in which the
 profit-maximizing long-term contract offered by a monopolist takes an
 especially simple structure: we derive sufficient conditions on primitives
 under which the optimal contract consists of a menu of deterministic
 sequences of static contracts. Within each sequence, higher realized
 values lead to greater quantity provision; however, an increasing
 proportion of buyer types are excluded over time, eventually leading to
 inefficiently early termination of the relationship. Moreover, the menu
 choices differ by future generosity, with more costly (up front) plans
 guaranteeing greater quantity provision in the future. Thus, the seller
 screens process information in the initial period and then progressively
 screens across realized values so as to reduce the information rents paid
 in future periods.  Copyright , Oxford University Press.

Title: Capacity Choice Counters the Coase Conjecture 
Abstract:
 The Coase conjecture (1972) is the proposition that a durable-goods
 monopolist, who sells over time and can quickly reduce prices as sales are
 made, will price at marginal cost. We show that an arbitrarily small
 deviation from Coase's assumptions&#x02014;a deviation that applies in
 almost any practical application&#x02014;results in the failure of that
 conjecture. In particular, we examine that conjecture in a model where
 there is a vanishingly small cost for production (or sales) capacity, and
 the seller may augment capacity in every period. In the "gap case", any
 positive capacity cost ensures that in the limit, as the size of the gap
 and the time between sales periods shrink, the monopolist obtains profits
 identical to those that would prevail when she could commit ex ante to a
 fixed capacity. Those profits are at least 29.8% of the full static
 monopoly optimum.  Copyright 2008, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Manipulation and the Allocational Role of Prices 
Abstract:
 It is commonly believed that prices in secondary financial markets play an
 important allocational role because they contain information that
 facilitates the efficient allocation of resources. This paper identifies a
 limitation inherent in this role of prices. It shows that the presence of
 a feedback effect from the financial market to the real value of a firm
 creates an incentive for an uninformed trader to sell the firm's stock.
 When this happens the informativeness of the stock price decreases, and
 the beneficial allocational role of the financial market weakens. The
 trader profits from this trading strategy, partly because his trading
 distorts the firm's investment. We therefore refer to this strategy as
 manipulation. We show that trading without information is profitable only
 with sell orders, driving a wedge between the allocational implications of
 buyer and seller initiated speculation, and providing justification for
 restrictions on short sales.  Copyright 2008, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Charity as a Substitute for Reputation: Evidence from an Online Marketplace 
Abstract:
 Consumers respond positively to products tied to charity, particularly
 from sellers that are relatively new and hence have limited alternative
 means of assuring quality. We establish this result using data from a
 diverse group of eBay sellers who "experiment" with charity by varying the
 presence of a donation in a set of otherwise matched product listings.
 Most of charity's benefits accrue to sellers without extensive eBay
 histories. Consistent with charity serving as a quality signal, we find
 fewer customer complaints among charity-intensive sellers.  Copyright , Oxford University Press.

Title: Monetary Policy Committees: Individual and Collective Reputations 
Abstract:
 This paper looks at the incentives of individual members of a monetary
 policy committee to gain a reputation for inflationary toughness. I show a
 policy maker can have more or less incentive to build a reputation when
 part of a group. But, group policy making leads to higher expected social
 welfare. Not publishing individuals' votes, raises the temptation to
 inflate and lowers expected social welfare. If the culture or rules of a
 central bank puts more weight on senior policy makers, the incentive to
 build a reputation is greater, but expected social welfare may be higher
 or lower.  Copyright 2003, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Changing One's Mind when the Facts Change: Incentives of Experts and the Design of Reporting Protocols 
Abstract:
 Experts often collect and report information over time. What reporting
 protocol elicits the most information? Here, a principal receives reports
 sequentially from an agent with privately known ability, who observes two
 signals about the state of the world. The signals differ in initial
 quality and, unlike previous work, differ in quality improvement. The
 paper finds that &#x201C;mind changes&#x201D; (inconsistent reports) can
 signal talent if a smart agent improves faster. Also, sequential reports
 dominate when the principal's decision is very sensitive to information; a
 single report dominates if the mediocre agent's signals improve faster or
 the agent is likely mediocre.  Copyright 2007, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: The Theory of Assortative Matching Based on Costly Signals 
Abstract:
 We study two-sided markets with a finite number of agents on each side,
 and with two-sided incomplete information. Agents are matched
 assortatively on the basis of costly signals. Asymmetries in signalling
 activity between the two sides of the market can be explained by
 asymmetries either in size or in heterogeneity. Our main results identify
 general conditions under which the potential increase in expected output
 due to assortative matching (relative to random matching) is offset by the
 costs of signalling. Finally, we examine the limit model with a continuum
 of agents and point out differences and similarities to the finite
 version. Technically, the paper is based on the elegant theory about
 stochastic order relations among differences of order statistics,
 pioneered by Barlow and Proschan in 1966 in the framework of reliability
 theory.  Copyright , Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Estimating Production Functions Using Inputs to Control for Unobservables 
Abstract:
 We add to the methods for conditioning out serially correlated unobserved
 shocks to the production technology. We build on ideas first developed in
 Olley and Pakes (1996). They show how to use investment to control for
 correlation between input levels and the unobserved firm-specific
 productivity process. We show that intermediate inputs (those inputs which
 are typically subtracted out in a value-added production function) can
 also solve this simultaneity problem. We discuss some theoretical benefits
 of extending the proxy choice set in this direction and our empirical
 results suggest these benefits can be important.  Copyright 2003, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Ambiguity Without a State Space 
Abstract:
 Many decisions involve both imprecise probabilities and intractable states
 of the world. Objective expected utility assumes unambiguous
 probabilities; subjective expected utility assumes a completely specified
 state space. This paper analyses a third domain of preference: sets of
 consequential lotteries. Using this domain, we develop a theory of
 objective ambiguity without explicit reference to any state space. We
 characterize a representation that integrates a non-linear transformation
 of first-order expected utility with respect to a second-order measure.
 The concavity of the transformation and the weighting of the measure
 capture ambiguity aversion. We propose a definition for comparative
 ambiguity aversion.  Copyright 2008, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Information Markets and the Comovement of Asset Prices 
Abstract:
 Traditional asset pricing models predict that covariance between prices of
 different assets should be lower than what we observe in the data. This
 paper introduces markets for information that generate high price
 covariance within a rational expectations framework. When information is
 costly, rational investors only buy information about a subset of the
 assets. Because information production has high fixed costs, competitive
 producers charge more for low-demand information than for high-demand
 information. The low price of high-demand information makes investors want
 to purchase the same information that others are purchasing. When
 investors price assets using a common subset of information, news about
 one asset affects the other assets' prices; asset prices comove. The
 cross-sectional and time-series properties of comovement are consistent
 with this explanation.  Copyright 2006, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Sequentially Optimal Mechanisms<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN1">-super-1</xref> 
Abstract:
 This paper establishes that posting a price in each period is a
 revenue-maximizing allocation mechanism in a finite period model without
 commitment. A risk-neutral seller has one object to sell and faces a
 risk-neutral buyer whose valuation is private information and drawn from
 an arbitrary bounded subset of the real line. The seller has all the
 bargaining power: she designs a mechanism to sell the object at t, but if
 trade does not occur at t she can propose another mechanism at t &#x002B;
 1. We show that posting a price in each period is an optimal mechanism. A
 methodological contribution of the paper is to develop a procedure to
 characterize optimal dynamic incentive schemes under non-commitment that
 is valid irrespective of the structure of the agent's type.  Copyright 2006, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Regime Switches, Agents' Beliefs, and Post-World War II U.S. Macroeconomic Dynamics 
Abstract:
 The evolution of the U.S. economy over the past 55 years is examined
 through the lens of a micro-founded model that allows for changes in the
 behaviour of the Federal Reserve and in the volatility of structural
 shocks. Agents are aware of the possibility of regime changes and their
 beliefs matter for the law of motion underlying the macroeconomy. Monetary
 policy is identified by repeated fluctuations between a Hawk and a Dove
 regime, with the latter prevailing in the 1970s and during the recent
 crisis. To explore the role of agents' beliefs I introduce a new class of
 counterfactual simulations: beliefs counterfactuals. If, in the 1970s,
 agents had anticipated the appointment of an extremely conservative
 Chairman, inflation would have been lower and the inflation-output
 trade-off more favourable. The large drop in inflation and output at the
 end of 2008 would have been mitigated if agents had expected the Federal
 Reserve to be exceptionally active in the near future.  Copyright 2013, Oxford University Press.

Title: On-the-Job Search and Precautionary Savings 
Abstract:
 In this article, I develop and estimate a model of on-the-job search in
 which risk averse workers choose search effort and can borrow or save
 using a single risk free asset. I derive the implications for optimal
 savings behaviour in this environment and relate this to the frictions
 that characterize the endogenous earnings process implied by on-the-job
 search. Savings behaviour depends in a very intuitive way on the rate at
 which offers are received, the rate at which jobs are destroyed, and a
 worker's current rank in the wage distribution. The implication is that
 workers, who are identical in terms of preferences and opportunities, have
 substantially different savings behaviour depending on their history and
 current position in the wage distribution. The mechanism that generates
 the substantial differences in savings behaviour in the model is the
 dynamic of the "wage ladder" resulting from the search process. There is
 an important asymmetry between the incremental wage increases generated by
 on-the-job search (climbing the ladder) and the drop in income associated
 with job loss (falling off the ladder). The behaviour of workers in low
 paying jobs is primarily governed by the expectation of wage growth, while
 the behaviour of workers near the top of the distribution is driven by the
 possibility of job loss. The distributions of earnings, wealth, and
 consumption implied by the model (suitably aggregated) align reasonably
 well with the data, with the notable exception of implying substantially
 less concentration of wealth among the richest one percent of the
 population.  Copyright 2013, Oxford University Press.

Title: Estimating a Dynamic Adverse-Selection Model: Labour-Force Experience and the Changing Gender Earnings Gap 1968--1997 
Abstract:
 This paper addresses two questions: What accounts for the gender gap in
 labour-market outcomes? What are the driving forces behind the changes in
 the gender labour-market outcomes over the period 1968--1997? It
 formulates a dynamic general equilibrium model of labour supply,
 occupational sorting, and human-capital accumulation in which gender
 discrimination and an earnings gap arise endogenously. It uses this model
 to quantify the driving forces behind the decline in the gender earnings
 gap and the increase in female labour-force participation, the proportion
 of women working in professional occupations, and hours worked. It finds
 that labour-market experience is the most important factor explaining the
 gender earnings gap. In addition, statistical discrimination accounts for
 a large fraction of the observed gender earnings gap and its decline. It
 also finds that a large increase in aggregate productivity in professional
 occupations plays a major role in the increase in female labour-force
 participation, number of hours worked, and the proportion of females
 working in professional occupations. Although of less importance,
 demographic changes account for a substantial part of the increase in
 female labour-force participation and hours worked, whereas home
 production technology shocks do not.  Copyright 2012, Oxford University Press.

Abstract:
 This paper analyses a dynamic auction in which a fraction of each bid is
 sunk. Jump bidding is used by bidders to signal their private information.
 Bluffing (respectively sandbagging) occurs when a weak (respectively
 strong) player seeks to deceive his opponent into thinking that he is
 strong (respectively weak). A player with a moderate valuation bluffs by
 making a high bid and drops out if his bluff is called. A player with a
 high valuation should vary his bids and should sometimes sandbag by
 bidding low, to induce lower bids by his rival.  Copyright 2007, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Interest Rates, Irreversibility, and Backward-Bending Investment 
Abstract:
 This paper studies the effect of interest rates on investment in an
 environment where firms make irreversible investments with uncertain
 pay-offs. In this setting, changes in the interest rate affect both the
 cost of capital and the cost of delaying investment to acquire
 information. These two forces combine to generate an aggregate investment
 demand curve that is a backward-bending function of the interest rate. At
 low rates, increasing the interest rate raises investment by increasing
 the cost of delay.  Copyright 2007, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: The Decentralization of Information Processing in the Presence of Interactions 
Abstract:
 We propose a model of organizational decision making, in which information
 processing is decentralized. Our model incorporates two features of many
 actual organizations: aggregation entails a loss of useful information,
 and the decision problems of different agents interact. We assume that an
 organization forms a portfolio of risky assets, following a hierarchical
 procedure. Agents' decision rules and the organization's hierarchical
 structure are derived endogenously. Typically, in the optimal hierarchical
 structure, all agents have one subordinate, and returns to ability are at
 least as high at the bottom as at the top. However, these results can be
 reversed in the presence of returns to specialization.  Copyright 2003, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Negative Externalities and Evolutionary Implementation 
Abstract:
 We model externality abatement as an implementation problem. A social
 planner would like to ensure efficient behaviour among a group of agents
 whose actions are sources of externalities. However, the planner has
 limited information about the agents' preferences, and is unable to
 distinguish individual agents except through their action choices. We
 prove that if a concavity condition on aggregate payoffs is satisfied, the
 planner can guarantee that efficient behaviour is globally stable under a
 wide range of behaviour adjustment processes by administering a variable
 pricing scheme. Through a series of applications, we show that the
 concavity condition is naturally satisfied in settings involving negative
 externalities. We conclude by contrasting the performance of the pricing
 mechanism with that of a mechanism based on direct revelation and
 announcement dependent forcing contracts.  Copyright 2005, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: On Endogenously Staggered Prices 
Abstract:
 Taylor's model of staggered contracts is an influential explanation for
 nominal inertia and the persistent real effects of nominal shocks.
 However, in standard imperfect competition models, if agents are allowed
 to choose the timing of pricing decisions, they will typically choose to
 synchronize. This paper provides a simple model of imperfect competition
 which produces stable staggering. Our argument relies on strategic
 interaction at two levels&#x2014;between firms within an industries, and
 across industries&#x2014;and produces a continuum of staggered price
 equilibria. These equilibria are strict, and hence stable under a simple
 adaptive learning process.  Copyright 2002, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Semi-Parametric Comparison of Stochastic Volatility Models using Realized Measures 
Abstract:
 This paper proposes a procedure to test for the correct specification of
 the functional form of the volatility process within the class of
 eigenfunction stochastic volatility models. The procedure is based on the
 comparison of the moments of realized volatility measures with the
 corresponding ones of integrated volatility implied by the model under the
 null hypothesis.We first provide primitive conditions on the measurement
 error associated with the realized measure, which allow to construct
 asymptotically valid specification tests.Then we establish regularity
 conditions under which the considered realized measures, namely, realized
 volatility, bipower variation, and modified subsampled realized
 volatility, satisfy the given primitive assumptions.Finally, we provide an
 empirical illustration based on three stocks from the Dow Jones Industrial
 Average.  Copyright 2006, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Globalization and Risk Sharing 
Abstract:
 We study the effects of globalization on risk sharing and welfare. Like
 the previous literature, we assume that governments cannot commit to
 enforce the repayment of debts owed by their citizens. Unlike the previous
 literature, we assume that governments cannot discriminate between
 domestic and foreign creditors when enforcing debt payments. This creates
 novel interactions between domestic and international trade in assets. (i)
 Increases in domestic trade raise the benefits of enforcement and
 facilitate international trade. In fact, in our set-up, countries can
 obtain international risk sharing even in the absence of default
 penalties. (ii) Increases in foreign trade raise the costs of enforcement
 and hamper domestic trade. As a result, globalization may worsen domestic
 risk sharing and lower welfare. We show how these effects depend on
 various characteristics of tradable goods and explore the roles of
 borrowing limits, debt renegotiations, and trade policy.  Copyright 2011, Oxford University Press.

Title: Optimum Tariffs and Retaliation Revisited: How Country Size Matters 
Abstract:
 In his seminal work on tariff retaliation, Johnson (Review of Economic
 Studies, 21, 1953&#x2013;1954) showed that a country will
 &#x201C;win&#x201D; a bilateral &#x201C;tariff war&#x201D; if its relative
 monopoly/monopsony power in world trade is sufficiently large. However, it
 is unclear from Johnson's analysis and from subsequent research on the
 subject how this power is determined in general economic environments. An
 important goal of this paper is to address this issue. With the help of a
 neoclassical trade model in which country size is at centre stage, it is
 shown that a sufficient condition for a country to prefer a
 non-cooperative Nash tariff equilibrium (retaliation) over free trade is
 that its relative size be sufficiently large. The paper also refines the
 structure of the general trade model and generates additional
 characterization results on the importance of country size for
 best-response tariff functions, retaliatory tariffs, and welfare.  Copyright 2002, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Unemployment Risk, Labour Force Participation and Savings 
Abstract:
 This paper analyses labour force participation and precautionary savings
 in the presence of risks of being fired or failing to secure a job offer
 when out of the labour market. We use a finite horizon framework with two
 employment states and a stage utility function which is CARA in
 consumption but non-separable in leisure. The results are that there is
 precautionary labour force participation: employment risk lowers the
 reservation wage; generally it also reduces consumption. However due to
 the non-separability assumption, precautionary savings, as usually
 defined, may not be positive. We characterize the reservation wage and
 contrast the results with those in which the stage utility is additive in
 leisure and consumption. We extend the analysis to study the effects of
 cyclical variation in employment risk, of stochastic future wage rates,
 and of adding a third employment state of search.  Copyright 2003, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: The Timing of Purchases and Aggregate Fluctuations 
Abstract:
 We study the cyclical effects of the timing of durable goods purchases in
 a general equilibrium model in which both durable and non-durable goods
 are consumed and the durable good is lumpy. At the microeconomic level,
 the timing of durable goods purchases supplies some insulation for
 nondurable consumption over the cycle. At the macroeconomic level, the
 timing decisions tend to amplify and propagate wealth and income shocks.
 Our model also allows for endogenous price determination. When the price
 of the durable changes due to inflexibility of workers between sectors,
 the effect of adverse shocks is even stronger and longer.  Copyright 2005, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Monetary Union with Voluntary Participation<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN1">-super-1</xref> 
Abstract:
 A monetary union is modelled as a technology that makes a surprise policy
 deviation impossible and requires voluntarily participating countries to
 follow the same monetary policy. Within a fully dynamic context, we show
 that such an arrangement may dominate a regime with independent national
 currencies. Two new results are delivered by the voluntary participation
 assumption. First, the optimal plan is shown to respond to a country's
 temptation to leave the union by tilting both current and future policy in
 its favour. This yields a non-linear rule according to which each country
 weight in policy decisions is time-varying and depends on its incentive to
 abandon the union. Second, we show that there might be conditions such
 that a break-up of the union, as has occurred in some historical episodes,
 is efficient. The paper thus provides a first formal analysis of the
 incentives behind the formation, sustainability, and disruption of a
 monetary union.  Copyright 2006, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Aggregation, Persistence and Volatility in a Macro Model 
Abstract:
 We introduce firm heterogeneity into the standard monopolistically
 competitive real business cycle (RBC) model. The fundamental equilibrium
 path is derived and the time-series properties of aggregate GDP are
 studied analytically. Although firms' productivities are subject to
 temporary shocks, the aggregate process displays a surprising novel form
 of nonlinearity and long memory which had not been built into the model at
 the outset. This aggregate GDP turns out to have very different properties
 from log-linear time-series models such as auto-regressive (AR) models and
 their extensions. It displays very strong persistence, which ends abruptly
 with a sudden change of tendency, giving its autocorrelation function
 (ACF) an S-shape. Although persistent, it is mean-reverting, unlike the
 everlasting memory of unit-root processes. Its volatility is of a greater
 order of magnitude than that of any of its components, so small
 micro-shocks can generate large macro fluctuations. It is also
 characterized by long, asymmetric cycles of random lengths. Increased
 monopoly power tends to reduce the amplitude and increase the persistence
 of business cycles. Strikingly, we find that the empirical ACFs
 constructed from GDP data for the U.K. and the U.S. display this
 characteristic S-shape.  Copyright 2002, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Competition Between Networks: A Study of the Market for Yellow Pages 
Abstract:
 This paper estimates the importance of network effects in the market for
 Yellow Pages. I estimate three simultaneous equations: consumer demand for
 usage of a directory, advertiser demand for advertising and a publisher's
 first-order condition (derived from profit-maximizing behaviour).
 Estimation shows that advertisers value consumer usage and that consumers
 value advertising, implying a network effect. I find that internalizing
 network effects would significantly increase surplus. As an application, I
 consider whether the market benefits from monopoly (which takes advantage
 of network effects) or oligopoly (which reduces market power). I find that
 a more competitive market is preferable.  Copyright 2004, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Inventories, Markups, and Real Rigidities in Menu Cost Models 
Abstract:
 A growing consensus in New Keynesian macroeconomics is that nominal cost
 rigidities, rather than countercyclical markups, account for the bulk of
 the real effects of monetary policy shocks. We revisit these conclusions
 using theory and data on inventories. We study an economy with nominal
 rigidities in which goods are storable. Our theory predicts that if costs
 of production are sticky and markups do not vary much in response to, say,
 expansionary monetary policy, firms react by excessively accumulating
 inventories in anticipation of future cost increases. In contrast, if the
 data inventories are fairly constant over the cycle and in response to
 changes in monetary policy. We show that costs must increase and markups
 must decline sufficiently in times of a monetary expansion in order to
 reduce firm's incentive to hold inventories and thus bring the model's
 inventory predictions in line with the data. Versions of the model
 consistent with the dynamics of inventories in the data imply that
 countercyclical markups account for a sizable fraction of the response of
 real variables to monetary shocks.  Copyright , Oxford University Press.

Title: A Theory of Liquidity and Regulation of Financial Intermediation 
Abstract:
 This paper studies a Diamond-Dybvig model of providing insurance against
 unobservable liquidity shocks in the presence of unobservable trades. We
 show that competitive equilibria are inefficient. A social planner finds
 it beneficial to introduce a wedge between the interest rate implicit in
 optimal allocations and the economy's marginal rate of transformation.
 This improves risk sharing by reducing the attractiveness of joint
 deviations where agents simultaneously misrepresent their type and engage
 in trades on private markets. We propose a simple implementation of the
 optimum that imposes a constraint on the portfolio share that financial
 intermediaries invest in short-term assets.  Copyright , Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: On the Justice of Decision Rules 
Abstract:
 Which decision rules are the most efficient? Which are the best in terms
 of maximin or maximax? We study these questions for the case of a group of
 individuals faced with a collective choice from a set of alternatives. A
 key message from our results is that the set of optimal decision rules is
 well defined, particularly simple, and well known: the class of scoring
 rules. We provide the optimal scoring rules for the three different ideals
 of justice under consideration: utilitarianism (efficiency), maximin, and
 maximax. The optimal utilitarian scoring rule depends crucially on the
 probability distribution of the utilities. The optimal maximin
 (respectively maximax) scoring rule takes the optimal utilitarian scoring
 rule and applies a factor that shifts it towards negative voting
 (respectively plurality voting).  Copyright 2011, Oxford University Press.

Title: What Goods Do Countries Trade? A Quantitative Exploration of Ricardo's Ideas 
Abstract:
 The Ricardian model predicts that countries should produce and export
 relatively more in industries in which they are relatively more
 productive. Though one of the most celebrated insights in the theory of
 international trade, this prediction has received little attention in the
 empirical literature since the mid-1960s. The main reason behind this lack
 of popularity is the absence of clear theoretical foundations to guide the
 empirical analysis. Building on the seminal work of Eaton and Kortum
 ("Technology, Geography, and Trade", Econometrica, 70, 1741--1779 2002),
 we offer such foundations and use them to quantify the importance of
 Ricardian comparative advantage. In the process, we also provide a
 theoretically consistent alternative to Balassa's (1965, "An Empirical
 Demonstration of Classical Comparative Cost Theory", Review of Economics
 and Statistics, 45, 231--238) well-known index of "revealed comparative
 advantage".  Copyright 2012, Oxford University Press.

Title: Commodity Price Shocks and Civil Conflict: Evidence from Colombia 
Abstract:
 How do income shocks affect armed conflict? Theory suggests two opposite
 effects. If labour is used to appropriate resources violently, higher
 wages may lower conflict by reducing labour supplied to appropriation.
 This is the opportunity cost effect. Alternatively, a rise in contestable
 income may increase violence by raising gains from appropriation. This is
 the rapacity effect. Our article exploits exogenous price shocks in
 international commodity markets and a rich dataset on civil war in
 Colombia to assess how different income shocks affect conflict. We examine
 changes in the price of agricultural goods (which are labour intensive) as
 well as natural resources (which are not). We focus on Colombia's two
 largest exports, coffee and oil. We find that a sharp fall in coffee
 prices during the 1990s lowered wages and increased violence
 differentially in municipalities cultivating more coffee. This is
 consistent with the coffee shock inducing an opportunity cost effect. In
 contrast, a rise in oil prices increased both municipal revenue and
 violence differentially in the oil region. This is consistent with the oil
 shock inducing a rapacity effect. We also show that this pattern holds in
 six other agricultural and natural resource sectors, providing evidence
 that price shocks affect conflict in different directions depending on the
 type of the commodity.  Copyright 2013, Oxford University Press.

Title: Market Provision of Broadcasting: A Welfare Analysis 
Abstract:
 This paper presents a theory of the market provision of broadcasting and
 uses it to address the nature of market failure in the industry.
 Equilibrium advertising levels may be too low or too high, depending on
 the nuisance cost to viewers, the substitutability of programmes, and the
 expected benefits to advertisers from contacting viewers. The equilibrium
 amount of programming may also be below or above the socially optimal
 level. Perhaps surprisingly, the ability to price programming may reduce
 social surplus, while monopoly ownership may increase it.  Copyright 2005, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Occupational Mobility and Wage Inequality 
Abstract:
 In this article we argue that wage inequality and occupational mobility
 are intimately related. We are motivated by our empirical findings that
 human capital is occupation specific and that the fraction of workers
 switching occupations in the U.S. was as high as 16% a year in the early
 1970's and had increased to 21% by the mid-1990's. We develop a general
 equilibrium model with occupation-specific human capital and heterogeneous
 experience levels within occupations. We find that the model, calibrated
 to match the level of occupational mobility in the 1970's, accounts quite
 well for the level of (within-group) wage inequality in that period. Next,
 we find that the model, calibrated to match the increase in occupational
 mobility, accounts for over 90% of the increase in wage inequality between
 the 1970's and the 1990's. The theory is also quantitatively consistent
 with the level and increase in the short-term variability of earnings.  Copyright , Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Parental Job Loss and Children's School Performance 
Abstract:
 Using Norwegian register data, we estimate how children's school
 performance is affected by their parents' exposure to plant closure. Our
 estimates suggest that paternal job loss has a negative effect on
 children's school performance. In contrast, maternal job loss is
 associated with a non-significant increase in school performance.
 Importantly, the negative effect of paternal job loss appears largely
 unrelated to its effect on father's income, father's employment status, a
 shift in maternal time towards employment, marital dissolution, and
 residential relocation. A disparate effect of job loss across fathers and
 mothers is, however, consistent with recent empirical studies documenting
 that the mental distress experienced by displaced workers is generally
 more severe for men than women.  Copyright 2011, Oxford University Press.

Title: An Optimal IPO Mechanism 
Abstract:
 We analyse the optimal Initial Public Offering (IPO) mechanism in a
 multidimensional adverse selection setting where institutional investors
 have private information about the market valuation of the shares, the
 intermediary has private information about the demand, and the
 institutional investors and intermediary collude. Theorem 1 states that
 uniform pricing is optimal (all agents pay the same price) and
 characterizes the IPO price in terms of conditional expectations. Theorem
 2 states that the optimal mechanism can be implemented by a non-linear
 price schedule decreasing in the quantity allocated to retail investors.
 This is similar to IPO procedures used in the U.K. and France. Relying on
 French IPO data we perform a GMM structural estimation and test of the
 model. The price schedule is estimated and the conditions characterizing
 the optimal mechanism are not rejected.  Copyright 2002, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Detecting and Predicting Forecast Breakdowns 
Abstract:
 We propose a theoretical framework for assessing whether a forecast model
 estimated over one period can provide good forecasts over a subsequent
 period. We formalize this idea by defining a forecast breakdown as a
 situation in which the out-of-sample performance of the model, judged by
 some loss function, is significantly worse than its in-sample performance.
 Our framework, which is valid under general conditions, can be used not
 only to detect past forecast breakdowns but also to predict future ones.
 We show that main causes of forecast breakdowns are instabilities in the
 data-generating process and relate the properties of our forecast
 breakdown test to those of structural break tests. The empirical
 application finds evidence of a forecast breakdown in the Phillips' curve
 forecasts of U.S. inflation, and links it to inflation volatility and to
 changes in the monetary policy reaction function of the Fed.  Copyright , Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: A Perpetual Race to Stay Ahead 
Abstract:
 This paper presents a model of dynamic competition between two firms that
 repeatedly engage in an innovative activity. The state of
 competition&#x02014;measured by the difference between the number of
 innovations introduced by the firms&#x02014;evolves stochastically
 according to their effort level. The structure of Markov perfect
 equilibria is identified. It is generally not true that competition is
 fiercest when firms are closest. Rather, firms invest under two distinct
 circumstances: while sufficiently ahead, to outstrip their rival and
 secure a durable leadership; while behind, to regain leadership and
 prevent the situation from worsening to the point where their rival
 outstrips them.  Copyright 2004, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Information Manipulation, Coordination, and Regime Change 
Abstract:
 This article presents a model of information manipulation and political
 regime change. There is a regime that can be overthrown but only if enough
 citizens participate in an uprising. Citizens are imperfectly informed
 about the regime's ability to resist an uprising and the regime can engage
 in propaganda that, taken at face-value, makes the regime seem stronger
 than it truly is. This coordination game with endogenous information
 manipulation has a unique equilibrium and the article gives a complete
 analytic characterization of the equilibrium's comparative statics.
 Holding fixed the number of signals available to citizens, if the per-unit
 signal precision is sufficiently high then the regime is harder to
 overthrow. In contrast, if the number of signals increases, so that both
 total signal precision and the regime's costs of manipulation rise
 together, then the regime is easier to overthrow unless there are strong
 economies of scale in information control.  Copyright 2013, Oxford University Press.

Title: Partial Identification in Monotone Binary Models: Discrete Regressors and Interval Data 
Abstract:
 We investigate identification in semi-parametric binary regression models,
 y = 1(x&#x003B2;&#x0002B;&#x003C5;&#x0002B;&#x003B5; &gt; 0) when
 &#x003C5; is either discrete or measured within intervals. The error term
 &#x003B5; is assumed to be uncorrelated with a set of instruments z,
 &#x003B5; is independent of &#x003C5; conditionally on x and z, and the
 support of &#x02212;(x&#x003B2; &#x0002B; &#x003B5;) is finite. We provide
 a sharp characterization of the set of observationally equivalent
 parameters &#x003B2;. When there are as many instruments z as variables x,
 the bounds of the identified intervals of the different scalar components
 &#x003B2;<sub>k</sub> of parameter &#x003B2; can be expressed as simple
 moments of the data. Also, in the case of interval data, we show that
 additional information on the distribution of &#x003C5; within intervals
 shrinks the identified set. Specifically, the closer the conditional
 distribution of &#x003C5; given z is to uniformity, the smaller is the
 identified set. Point identified is achieved if and only if &#x003C5; is
 uniform within intervals.  Copyright 2008, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Gross Credit Flows 
Abstract:
 The paper estimates gross credit flows for the U.S. banking system between
 1979 and 1999 and shows that sizable gross flows coexist at any phase of
 the cycle, even within narrowly defined loan categories, bank size
 categories, and regional units. To investigate the macroeconomic
 dimensions of gross credit flows, the paper studies the cyclical behaviour
 of aggregate credit flows and documents three key cyclical facts. First,
 excess credit reallocation is countercyclical: for any given rate of
 change of net credit, gross flows are larger in a recession than in a
 boom. Second, gross credit flows are highly volatile, with a cyclical
 volatility which appears more than an order of magnitude larger than GDP
 volatility. Third, credit contraction is more volatile than credit
 expansion. Furthermore, the behaviour of gross flows over the 1991
 recession suggests that persistent and historically high credit
 contraction is a key feature of the relatively mild cyclical downturn. The
 results lend some support to aggregate models that emphasize the
 asymmetric behaviour of credit expansion and credit contractions.  Copyright 2005, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Education Quality and Development Accounting 
Abstract:
 This paper measures the role of quality-adjusted years of schooling in
 accounting for cross-country output per worker differences. While data on
 years of schooling are readily available, data on education quality are
 not. I use the returns to schooling of foreign-educated immigrants in the
 U.S. to measure the education quality of their birth country. Immigrants
 from developed countries earn higher returns than do immigrants from
 developing countries. I show how to incorporate this measure of education
 quality into an otherwise standard development accounting exercise. The
 main result is that cross-country differences in education quality are
 roughly as important as cross-country differences in years of schooling in
 accounting for output per worker differences, raising the total
 contribution of education from 10% to 20% of output per worker
 differences.  Copyright 2012, Oxford University Press.

Title: Competence and Ideology 
Abstract:
 We develop a dynamic repeated election model in which citizen candidates
 are distinguished by both their ideology and valence. Voters observe an
 incumbent's valence and policy choices but only know the challenger's
 party. Our model provides a rich set of novel results. In contrast to
 existing predictions from static models, we prove that dynamic
 considerations make higher-valence incumbents more likely to compromise
 and win re-election, even though they compromise to more extreme policies.
 Consequently, we find that the correlation between valence and extremist
 policies rises with office-holder seniority. This result may help explain
 previous empirical findings. Despite this result, we establish that the
 whole electorate gains from improvements in the distribution of valences.
 In contrast, fixing average valence, the greater dispersion in valence
 associated with a high-valence political elite always benefits the median
 voter but can harm a majority of voters when voters are sufficiently risk
 averse. We then consider interest groups (IGs) or activists who search for
 candidates with better skills. We derive a complete theoretical
 explanation for the intuitive conjectures that policies are more extreme
 when IGs and activists have more extreme ideologies, and that such
 extremism reduces the welfare of all voters.  Copyright 2011, Oxford University Press.

Title: Stochastic Search Equilibrium 
Abstract:
 We study equilibrium wage and employment dynamics in a class of popular
 search models with wage posting, in the presence of aggregate productivity
 shocks. Firms offer and commit to (Markov) contracts, which specify a wage
 contingent on all payoff-relevant states, but must pay equally all of
 their workers, who have limited commitment and are free to quit at any
 time. We find sufficient conditions for the existence and uniqueness of a
 stochastic search equilibrium in such contracts, which is Rank Preserving
 [RP]: larger and more productive firms offer more generous contracts to
 their workers in all states of the world. On the RP equilibrium path,
 turnover is always efficient as workers always move from less to more
 productive firms. The resulting stochastic dynamics of firm size provide
 an intuitive explanation for the empirical finding that large employers
 have more cyclical job creation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">Moscarini
 and Postel-Vinay, 2012</xref>). Finally, computation of RP equilibrium
 contracts is tractable.  Copyright 2013, Oxford University Press.

Title: An Elementary Theory of Global Supply Chains 
Abstract:
 This article develops an elementary theory of global supply chains. We
 consider a world economy with an arbitrary number of countries, one factor
 of production, a continuum of intermediate goods and one final good.
 Production of the final good is sequential and subject to mistakes. In the
 unique free trade equilibrium, countries with lower probabilities of
 making mistakes at all stages specialize in later stages of production.
 Using this simple theoretical framework, we offer a first look at how
 vertical specialization shapes the interdependence of nations.  Copyright , Oxford University Press.

Title: Preemption Games with Private Information 
Abstract:
 Preemption games are widely used to model economic problems such as patent
 races. We introduce private information into these games and allow for
 this information to stochastically change over time. This reflects, e.g.
 how R&D competitors improve their innovations over time and keep these
 innovations secret before patenting them. The analysis initially appears
 intractable because of the complexity of the equilibrium updating of
 beliefs on opponents' information. However, we demonstrate the existence
 of a class of equilibria and calculate these equilibria in closed form. We
 find that the expected durations in these equilibria are longer than when
 players' information is public but, in some cases, shorter than in the
 collusive outcome. Hence, R&D secrecy slows down innovation disclosure.  Copyright 2011, Oxford University Press.

Title: Peer Effects and Social Networks in Education 
Abstract:
 We develop a model that shows that, at the Nash equilibrium, the outcome
 of each individual embedded in a network is proportional to his/her
 Katz-Bonacich centrality measure. This measure takes into account both
 direct and indirect friends of each individual, but puts less weight to
 his/her distant friends. We then bring the model to the data using a very
 detailed dataset of adolescent friendship networks. We show that, after
 controlling for observable individual characteristics and unobservable
 network specific factors, a standard deviation increase in the
 Katz-Bonacich centrality increases the pupil school performance by more
 than 7% of one standard deviation.  Copyright 2009, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Fiscal Policy with Heterogeneous Agents and Incomplete Markets 
Abstract:
 I undertake a quantitative investigation into the short run effects of
 changes in the timing of proportional income taxes for model economies in
 which heterogeneous households face a borrowing constraint. Temporary tax
 changes are found to have large real effects. In the benchmark model, a
 temporary tax cut increases aggregate consumption on impact by around 29
 cents for every dollar of tax revenue lost. Comparing the benchmark
 incomplete-markets model to a complete-markets economy, income tax cuts
 provide a larger boost to consumption and a smaller investment stimulus
 when asset markets are incomplete.  Copyright 2005, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Learning Under Ambiguity 
Abstract:
 This paper considers learning when the distinction between risk and
 ambiguity matters. It first describes thought experiments, dynamic
 variants of those provided by Ellsberg, that highlight a sense in which
 the Bayesian learning model is extreme&#x2014;it models agents who are
 implausibly ambitious about what they can learn in complicated
 environments. The paper then provides a generalization of the Bayesian
 model that accommodates the intuitive choices in the thought experiments.
 In particular, the model allows decision-makers' confidence about the
 environment to change&#x2014;along with beliefs&#x2014;as they learn. A
 portfolio choice application compares the effect of changes in confidence
 under ambiguity vs. changes in estimation risk under Bayesian learning.
 The former is shown to induce a trend towards more stock market
 participation and investment even when the latter does not.  Copyright 2007, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Evolution of Preferences<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN1">-super-1</xref> 
Abstract:
 We endogenize preferences using the &#x201C;indirect evolutionary
 approach&#x201D;. Individuals are randomly matched to play a two-person
 game. Individual (subjective) preferences determine their behaviour and
 may differ from the actual (objective) pay-offs that determine fitness.
 Matched individuals may observe the opponents' preferences perfectly, not
 at all, or with some in-between probability. When preferences are
 observable, a stable outcome must be efficient. When they are not
 observable, a stable outcome must be a Nash equilibrium and all strict
 equilibria are stable. We show that, for pure-strategy outcomes, these
 conclusions are robust to allowing almost perfect, and almost no,
 observability, with the notable exception that inefficient strict
 equilibria may fail to be stable with any arbitrarily small degree of
 observability (despite being stable with no observability).  Copyright 2007, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Explaining and Forecasting Results of the Self-sufficiency Project 
Abstract:
 This paper studies the self-sufficiency project (SSP), a controlled
 randomized experiment concerning welfare, by estimating a model of
 endogenous skill accumulation, multidimensional job opportunities, and
 time-varying opportunity costs of labour market time. Methods for
 estimating dynamic programming models with unobserved heterogeneity are
 extended to account for unexpected policy interventions and endogenous
 sample selection and initial conditions. Parameters are identified and
 consistently estimated by imposing optimal responses to the exact form of
 the SSP earnings supplement and the experimental program, which induces
 exogenous variation between treatment groups and within groups as
 treatment progresses. The estimated model tracks primary outcomes well in
 and out of sample, except for underestimating trends in the sample of new
 welfare applicants. Predictions from counterfactual experiments run
 counter to non-structural results reported elsewhere, and they suggest
 that details of the SSP's design are critical for interpretation of
 results. The separate SSP Plus treatment may have longer lasting and more
 generalized impacts than the in-sample impacts suggest.  Copyright , Oxford University Press.

Title: A Continuous-Time Version of the Principal-Agent Problem 
Abstract:
 This paper describes a new continuous-time principal-agent model, in which
 the output is a diffusion process with drift determined by the agent's
 unobserved effort. The risk-averse agent receives consumption
 continuously. The optimal contract, based on the agent's continuation
 value as a state variable, is computed by a new method using a
 differential equation. During employment, the output path stochastically
 drives the agent's continuation value until it reaches a point that
 triggers retirement, quitting, replacement, or promotion. The paper
 explores how the dynamics of the agent's wages and effort, as well as the
 optimal mix of short-term and long-term incentives, depend on the
 contractual environment.  Copyright 2008, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: The Mean Voter Theorem: Necessary and Sufficient Conditions for Convergent Equilibrium 
Abstract:
 Formal models of elections have emphasized the convergence of party
 leaders towards the centre of the electoral distribution. This paper
 attempts to resolve the apparent disparity between the formal result and
 the perception of political divergence by considering a model
 incorporating valence. Valence can be interpreted as the non-policy basis
 of political judgement made by the electorate concerning the quality of
 political contenders. The theorem presented here shows that there is a
 necessary condition for convergence. The condition involves the difference
 in party valences and the electoral variance. When the condition fails,
 the low-valence parties will be forced to adopt policy positions far from
 the electoral centre. The inference appears to be substantiated by an
 empirical model of the Israel election in 1996.  Copyright 2007, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: How Q and Cash Flow Affect Investment without Frictions: An Analytic Explanation 
Abstract:
 We derive a closed-form solution for Tobin's Q in a stochastic dynamic
 framework. We show analytically that investment is positively related to
 Tobin's Q and cash flow, even in the absence of adjustment costs or
 financing frictions. Both Q and investment move in the same direction as
 expected revenue growth, so changes in expected revenue growth induce Q
 and investment to comove positively. Similarly, shocks to current cash
 flow, arising from shocks to the user cost of capital in our model, cause
 investment and cash flow per unit of capital to comove positively.
 Furthermore, we show that this alternative mechanism for the relationship
 among investment, Q, and cash flow delivers larger cash flow effects for
 smaller- and faster-growing firms, as observed in the data. Moreover, the
 empirically small sensitivity of investment to Tobin's Q does not imply
 implausibly large adjustment costs in our model (since there are no
 adjustment costs). Calibrating the model generates values of Q similar to
 those in the data; investment is more sensitive to cash flow than it is to
 Q, and both responses are of empirically plausible magnitudes.  Copyright 2011, Oxford University Press.

Title: Inefficient Credit Booms 
Abstract:
 This paper studies the welfare properties of competitive equilibria in an
 economy with financial frictions hit by aggregate shocks. In particular,
 it shows that competitive financial contracts can result in excessive
 borrowing ex ante and excessive volatility ex post. Even though from a
 first-best perspective the equilibrium always displays under-borrowing,
 from a second-best point of view excessive borrowing can arise. The
 inefficiency is due to the combination of limited commitment in financial
 contracts and the fact that asset prices are determined in a spot market.
 This generates a pecuniary externality that is not internalized in private
 contracts. The model provides a framework to evaluate preventive policies,
 which can be used during a credit boom to reduce the expected costs of a
 financial crisis.  Copyright 2008, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Adverse Selection and Convertible Bonds 
Abstract:
 Informational asymmetries between a firm and investors may lead to adverse
 selection in capital markets. This paper demonstrates that when the market
 obtains noisy information about a firm over time, this adverse selection
 problem can be costlessly solved by issuing callable convertible bonds
 with restrictive call provisions. Such securities can be designed to make
 the payoff to new claimholders independent of the private information of
 the manager. This eliminates the possibility of any dilution of equity or
 underinvestment and implements the symmetric information outcome in either
 a pooling or a separating equilibrium. The same first-best efficient
 outcome can also be implemented by issuing floating-price and mandatory
 convertibles.  Copyright 2011, Oxford University Press.

Title: Arms Races and Negotiations 
Abstract:
 Two players simultaneously decide whether or not to acquire new weapons in
 an arms race game. Each player's type determines his propensity to arm.
 Types are private information, and are independently drawn from a
 continuous distribution. With probability close to one, the best outcome
 for each player is for neither to acquire new weapons (although each
 prefers to acquire new weapons if he thinks the opponent will). There is a
 small probability that a player is a dominant strategy type who always
 prefers to acquire new weapons. We find conditions under which the unique
 Bayesian-Nash equilibrium involves an arms race with probability one.
 However, if the probability that a player is a dominant strategy type is
 sufficiently small, then there is an equilibrium of the cheap-talk
 extension of the game where the probability of an arms race is close to
 zero.  Copyright 2004, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Private Information and Intertemporal Job Assignments<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN1">-super-1</xref> 
Abstract:
 This paper studies the assignment of people to projects over time in a
 model with private information. The combination of risk neutrality with
 incomplete contracts that restrict the ability of an agent to report on
 interim states is a force for long-term assignments. More generally,
 however, rotating agents can be valuable because it conceals information
 from agents, which mitigates incentive constraints. With complete
 contracts that communicate interim states, rotation allows for even more
 concealment possibilities and better-targeted incentives. Furthermore, it
 allows for the reporting of interim shocks at no cost to the principal.
 Properties of the production technology are also shown to matter.
 Substitutability of intertemporal effort is a force for long-term
 assignments, while coordination with Nash equilibrium strategies is a
 force for job rotation.  Copyright 2006, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Identification-Robust Estimation and Testing of the Zero-Beta CAPM 
Abstract:
 We propose exact simulation-based procedures for: (i) testing
 mean-variance efficiency when the zero-beta rate is unknown; (ii) building
 confidence intervals for the zero-beta rate. On observing that this
 parameter may be weakly identified, we propose likelihood-ratio-type tests
 as well as Fieller-type procedures based on a Hotelling-HAC statistic,
 which are robust to weak identification and allow for non-Gaussian
 distributions including parametric GARCH structures. The
 Fieller-Hotelling-HAC procedure also accounts (asymptotically) for general
 forms of heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation. We propose confidence
 sets for the zero-beta rate based on "inverting" exact tests for this
 parameter; for both procedures proposed, these sets can be interpreted as
 multivariate extensions of the classic Fieller method for inference on
 ratios. The exact distribution of likelihood-ratio-type statistics for
 testing efficiency is studied under both the null and the alternative
 hypotheses. The relevant nuisance parameter structure is established and
 finite-sample bound procedures are proposed, which extend and improve
 available Gaussian-specific bounds. Finite-sample distributional
 invariance results are also demonstrated analytically for the HAC
 statistic proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">MacKinlay and
 Richardson (1991)</xref>. We study invariance to portfolio repacking for
 the tests and confidence sets proposed. The statistical properties of the
 proposed methods are analysed through a Monte Carlo study and compared
 with alternative available methods. Empirical results on NYSE returns show
 that exact confidence sets are very different from asymptotic ones, and
 allowing for non-Gaussian distributions affects inference results.
 Simulation and empirical evidence suggests that likelihood-ratio-type
 statistics--with p-values corrected using the Maximized Monte Carlo test
 method--are generally preferable to their multivariate
 Fieller-Hotelling-HAC counterparts from the viewpoints of size control and
 power.  Copyright 2013, Oxford University Press.

Title: Judgemental Overconfidence, Self-Monitoring, and Trading Performance in an Experimental Financial Market 
Abstract:
 We measure the degree of overconfidence in judgement (in the form of
 miscalibration, i.e. the tendency to overestimate the precision of one's
 information) and self-monitoring (a form of attentiveness to social cues)
 of 245 participants and also observe their behaviour in an experimental
 financial market under asymmetric information. Miscalibrated traders,
 underestimating the conditional uncertainty about the asset value, are
 expected to be especially vulnerable to the winner's curse. High
 self-monitors are expected to behave strategically and achieve superior
 results. Our empirical results show that miscalibration reduces and
 self-monitoring enhances trading performance. The effect of the
 psychological variables is strong for men but non-existent for women.  Copyright 2005, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Taxes and Time Allocation: Evidence from Single Women and Men 
Abstract:
 The classic model of Becker (1965,
 "A Theory of the Allocation of Time", Economic Journal, 125, 493--517)
 suggests that labour supply decisions should be analysed within the
 broader context of time allocation and market good consumption choices,
 but most empirical work on policy has focused exclusively on measuring
 impacts on market work. This paper examines how income taxes affect time
 allocation during the entire day and how these time allocation decisions
 interact with expenditure patterns. Using the Panel Study of Income
 Dynamics from 1975 to 2004, we analyse the response of single women's
 housework, labour supply, and other time to variation in tax and transfer
 schedules across income levels, number of children, states, and time. We
 find that when the economic reward to participating in the labour force
 increases, market work increases and housework decreases, with the
 decrease in housework accounting for approximately two-thirds of the
 increase in market work. Analysis of repeated cross sections of time diary
 data from 1975 to 2004 shows that "home production" decreases
 substantially when market hours of work increase in response to policy
 changes. Data on expenditures show some evidence that expenditures on
 market goods likely to substitute for housework increase in response to a
 greater incentive to join the labour force. The baseline estimates imply
 that the elasticity of substitution between consumption of home and market
 goods is 2.61. The results are consistent with the Becker model.
 Meanwhile, single men show little response to changes in tax policy, and
 we are able to rule out an elasticity of substitution between home and
 market goods for this group of more than 1.66.  Copyright , Oxford University Press.

Title: Equilibrium Directed Search with Multiple Applications 
Abstract:
 We analyse a model of equilibrium directed search in a large labour
 market. Each worker, observing the wages posted at all vacancies, makes a
 fixed, finite number of applications, a. We allow for the possibility of
 ex post competition should more than one vacancy want to hire the same
 worker. For each a, there is a unique symmetric equilibrium in which all
 vacancies post the same wage. When a = 1, the common posted wage lies
 between the competitive and monopsony levels, and equilibrium is
 efficient. When a &#x003E; 1, all vacancies post the monopsony wage. Some
 workers fail to find a job, some find a job at the monopsony wage, and
 some-those for whom there is competition-get the competitive
 wage. Equilibrium is inefficient when a &#x003E; 1; in particular, there
 is excessive vacancy creation.  Copyright 2006, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: A New Test of Borrowing Constraints for Education 
Abstract:
 We discuss a simple model in which parents and children make investments
 in the children's education and investments for other purposes and parents
 can transfer cash to their children. We show that for an identifiable set
 of parent--child pairs, parents will rationally underinvest in their
 child's education. For these parent--child pairs, additional financial aid
 will increase educational attainment. The model highlights an important
 feature of higher education finance, the "expected family contribution"
 (EFC) that is based on income, assets, and other factors. The EFC is
 neither legally guaranteed nor universally offered: our model identifies
 the set of families that are disproportionately likely to not provide
 their full EFC. Using a common proxy for financial aid, we show, in data
 from the Health and Retirement Study, that financial aid increases the
 educational attainment of children whose families are more likely than
 others to underinvest in education. Financial aid has no effect on the
 educational attainment of children in other families. The theory and
 empirical evidence identifies a set of children who face quantitatively
 important borrowing constraints for higher education.  Copyright 2012, Oxford University Press.

Title: Investment Incentives in Procurement Auctions 
Abstract:
 This paper investigates firms' incentives to invest in cost reduction in
 the first price sealed bid auction, a format largely used for procurement.
 Two central features of the model are that we allow firms to be
 heterogeneous and that investment is observable. We find that firms will
 tend to underinvest in cost reduction because they anticipate fiercer
 head-on competition. Using the second price auction as a benchmark, we
 also find that the first price auction will elicit less investment from
 market participants and that this is socially inefficient. These results
 have implications for market design when investment is important.  Copyright 2004, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Endowments, Output, and the Bias of Directed Innovation 
Abstract:
 In this paper, I ask the question: Does the output-mix of countries change
 in response to changes in factor endowments? If so: How long does it take?
 Using data on capital, as well as skilled and unskilled labour employed in
 three-digit International Standard Industrial Classification (ISIC)
 manufacturing industries for a sample of 27 developing and developed
 countries over the 1973--1990 period, I find that the output-mix of
 countries does not change in response to endowment changes, even after 15
 years. This answer raises another question: How then do countries absorb
 changes in factor endowments? The data show that in both the short and
 long runs, an increase in the supply of a production factor reduces its
 rate of return and makes it more intensively used in all sectors of the
 economy: changes in production techniques. In the long run, the point
 estimate is that the reduction in the rate of return is more than 50%
 larger than in the short run. This is consistent with induced innovations
 being predominantly biased towards the scarce factor.  Copyright , Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: On the Faustian Dynamics of Policy and Political Power 
Abstract:
 This paper examines the Faustian dynamics of policy and power. We posit a
 general class of dynamic games in which current policies affect the future
 distribution of political power, resulting in the following "Faustian
 trade-off": if the current ruler chooses his preferred policy, he then
 sacrifices future political power; yet if he wants to preserve his future
 power, he must sacrifice his present policy objectives. The trade-off
 comes from the fact that the current political ruler/pivotal voter cannot
 uncouple the direct effect of his policy from its indirect effect on
 future power. A policy-endogenous (PE) equilibrium describes this
 endogenous transfer of power and the resulting evolution of policy and
 political power over time. We show that the Faustian trade-off in a PE
 equilibrium is decomposed into two basic rationales. The political
 preservation effect induces more tempered policy choices than if one's
 policy choice did not affect one's political fortunes. However, the
 reformation effect induces "more aggressive" policies in order to exploit
 the productivity gains from policies chosen by even more aggressive
 successors. We distinguish between political systems that give rise to
 monotone Faustian dynamics--political power that progressively evolves
 towards more fiscally liberal types of leaders--and cyclical Faustian
 dynamics--political power that oscillates between liberal and conservative
 types of leaders. In each case, we show that the Faustian trade-off
 moderates the choices of each type of leader.  Copyright 2011, Oxford University Press.

Title: Discrete Bids and Empirical Inference in Divisible Good Auctions 
Abstract:
 I examine a model of a uniform price auction of a perfectly divisible good
 with private information in which the bidders submit discrete bidpoints
 rather than continuous downward sloping demand functions. I characterize
 necessary conditions for equilibrium bidding. The characterization reveals
 a close relationship between bidding in multiunit auctions and
 oligopolistic behaviour. I demonstrate that a recently proposed indirect
 approach to the revenue comparisons of discriminatory and uniform price
 auctions is not valid if bid functions have steps. In particular, bidders
 may bid above their marginal valuation in a uniform price auction. In
 order to demonstrate that discrete bidding can have important consequences
 for empirical analysis I use my model to examine a data set consisting of
 individual bids in uniform price treasury auctions of the Czech
 government. I propose an alternative method for evaluating the performance
 of the employed mechanism. My results suggest that the uniform price
 auction performs well, both in terms of efficiency of the allocation and
 in terms of revenue maximization. I estimate that the employed mechanism
 failed to extract at most 3 basis points in terms of the annual yield of
 T-bills worth of expected surplus while implementing an allocation
 resulting in almost all the efficient surplus. Failing to account for
 discreteness of bids would in my application result in overestimating the
 unextracted revenue by more than 50%.  Copyright 2011, Oxford University Press.

Title: Sovereign Debt without Default Penalties 
Abstract:
 We develop a theory of sovereign borrowing where default penalties are not
 implementable. We show that when debt is held by both domestic and foreign
 agents, the median voter might have an interest in serving it. Our theory
 has important practical implications regarding (a) the role of financial
 intermediaries in sovereign lending, (b) the effect of capital flows on
 price volatility including the possible overvaluation of debt to the point
 that the median voter is priced out of the market, and (c) debt
 restructuring where creditors are highly dispersed.  Copyright 2009, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Taste Variation in Discrete Choice Models 
Abstract:
 This paper develops an extension of the classical multinomial logit model
 which approximates a class of models obtained when there is uncontrolled
 taste variation across agents and choices in addition to the stochastic
 noise inherent in the logit model. Unlike semiparametric and parametric
 alternatives, the extended logit model is easy to estimate even when there
 are many potential choices. Unlike parametric alternatives, it does not
 require the specification of a distribution of varying tastes. The
 extended logit model can give a quick indication of the impact of taste
 variation on estimates and it generates estimates of the covariances of
 the taste shifters. It can be used as an exploratory device en route to
 the construction of a model incorporating a particular form of random
 taste variation and it can be used to determine whether such effort is
 required at all. When the amount of taste variation is not excessive the
 approximate model can be adequate itself. The model nests the conventional
 logit model which leads to a misspecification diagnostic. A method for
 estimating the model using conventional logit model software is proposed,
 asymptotic properties of estimators are derived and an application is
 presented.  Copyright 2002, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Money and Information 
Abstract:
 This paper investigates the role of money in markets in which producers
 have private information about the quality of the goods they supply. When
 the fraction of high-quality producers in the economy is given, money
 promotes the production of high-quality goods, which improves the quality
 mix and welfare unambiguously. When this fraction is endogenous, however,
 we find that money can decrease welfare relative to the barter
 equilibrium. The origin of this inefficiency is that money provides
 consumption insurance to low-quality producers, which can result in a
 higher fraction of low-quality producers in the monetary equilibrium.
 Finally, we find that most often agents acquire more costly information in
 the monetary equilibrium than in the barter equilibrium. Consequently,
 money is welfare-enhancing because it promotes useful production and
 exchange, but not because it saves information costs.  Copyright 2004, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Incentives for Unaware Agents 
Abstract:
 The paper introduces the problem of unawareness into principal--agent
 theory and discusses optimal incentive contracts when the agent may be
 unaware of her action space. Depending on the agent's default behaviour,
 it can be optimal for the principal to propose an incomplete contract
 (that keeps the agent unaware) or a complete contract. The key trade-off
 is that of enlarging the agent's choice set versus adding costly incentive
 constraints. If agents differ in their unawareness, optimal contracts show
 a self-reinforcing pattern: if there are few unaware agents in the economy
 optimal contracts promote awareness, if unawareness is wide spread optimal
 contracts shroud the contracting environment, thus keeping the agent
 unaware.  Copyright , Oxford University Press.

Title: The Intergenerational Transmission of Risk and Trust Attitudes 
Abstract:
 Recent theories endogenize the attitude endowments of individuals,
 assuming that they are shaped by the attitudes of parents and other role
 models. This paper tests empirically for the relevance of three aspects of
 the attitude transmission process highlighted in this theoretical
 literature: (1) transmission of attitudes from parents to children; (2) an
 impact of prevailing attitudes in the local environment on child
 attitudes; and (3) positive assortative mating of parents, which enhances
 the ability of a parent to pass on his or her attitudes to the child. We
 focus on two fundamentally important attitudes, willingness to take risks
 and willingness to trust others. We find empirical support for all three
 aspects, providing an empirical underpinning for the literature. An
 investigation of underlying mechanisms shows that socialization is
 important in the transmission process. Various parental characteristics
 and aspects of family structure are found to strengthen the socialization
 process, with implications for modeling the socialization production
 function and for policies focused on affecting children's non-cognitive
 skills. The paper also provides evidence that the transmission of risk and
 trust attitudes affects a wide variety of child outcomes, implying a
 potentially large total effect on children's economic situation.  Copyright 2012, Oxford University Press.

Title: Information, Liquidity, Asset Prices, and Monetary Policy 
Abstract:
 What determines which assets are used in transactions? We develop a
 framework where the extent to which assets are recognizable determines the
 extent to which they are acceptable in exchange--i.e. it determines their
 liquidity. Recognizability and liquidity are endogenized by allowing
 agents to invest in information. We analyse the effects of monetary
 policy. There can be multiple equilibria, with different transaction
 patterns, and these patterns are not invariant to policy. We show that
 small changes in information may generate large responses in asset prices,
 allocations, and welfare. We also discuss some issues in international
 economics, including exchange rates and dollarization.  Copyright , Oxford University Press.

Title: Information Projection: Model and Applications 
Abstract:
 People exaggerate the extent to which their information is shared with
 others. This paper introduces the concept of such information projection
 and provides a simple but widely applicable model. The key application
 describes a novel agency conflict in a frictionless learning environment.
 When monitoring with ex post information, biased evaluators exaggerate how
 much experts could have known ex ante and underestimate experts on
 average. Experts, to defend their reputations, are too eager to base
 predictions on ex ante information that substitutes for the information
 jurors independently learn ex post and too reluctant to base predictions
 on ex ante information that complements the information jurors
 independently learn ex post. Instruments that mitigate Bayesian agency
 conflicts are either ineffective or directly backfire. Applications to
 defensive medicine are discussed.  Copyright , Oxford University Press.

Title: Initiating Bargaining
Abstract:
 While there is an extensive literature on how economic agents bargain to
 divide an asset, little is known about the decision to initiate bargaining
 and how the initiation affects the outcome of bargaining. We address these
 questions in the context of high-stakes poker tournaments in which the
 last few players often negotiate the division of the remaining prize money
 rather than risk playing the tournament to the end. In 63% of the
 tournaments in our sample players enter into negotiations, and in 31%,
 they successfully reach an agreement. We find that the identity of the
 player who initiates bargaining affects whether a deal is completed but
 does not affect the terms of the eventual deal. The initiator tends to
 have a weaker than average position at the table, but the likelihood that
 a deal will be completed increases in the initiator's strength in the game
 and history of winning past tournaments. These findings indicate that
 initiating negotiations conveys information that is relevant to whether a
 deal will emerge. Nevertheless, initiating bargaining does not affect the
 initiator's pay-off in a completed deal. Lastly, we find strong evidence
 that bargaining tends to be initiated and is more likely to be successful
 when participants' stakes are about equal, consistent with the theoretical
 work of Cramton, Gibbons and Klemperer
 (1987, "Dissolving a Partnership Efficiently", Econometrica, 55,
 615--632).  Copyright 2011, Oxford University Press.

Title: Wealth Inequality and Intergenerational Links 
Abstract:
 Previous work has had difficulty generating household saving behaviour
 that makes the distribution of wealth much more concentrated than that of
 labour earnings, and that makes the richest households hold onto large
 amounts of wealth, even during very old age. I construct a quantitative,
 general equilibrium, overlapping-generations model in which parents and
 children are linked by accidental and voluntary bequests and by earnings
 ability. I show that voluntary bequests can explain the emergence of large
 estates, while accidental bequests alone cannot, and that adding earnings
 persistence within families increases wealth concentration even more. I
 also show that the introduction of a bequest motive generates lifetime
 savings profiles more consistent with the data.  Copyright 2004, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Household Intertemporal Behaviour: A Collective Characterization and a Test of Commitment 
Abstract:
 In this paper, a formal test of intra-household commitment is derived and
 performed. To that end, two models of household intertemporal behaviour
 are developed. In both models, household members are characterized by
 individual preferences. In the first formulation, household decisions are
 always on the ex ante Pareto frontier. In the second model, the assumption
 of intra-household commitment required by ex ante efficiency is relaxed.
 It is shown that the full-efficiency household Euler equations are nested
 in the no-commitment Euler equations. Using this result, the hypothesis
 that household members can commit to future allocations of resources is
 tested using the Consumer Expenditure Survey. I strongly reject this
 hypothesis. It is also shown that the standard unitary framework is a
 special case of the full-efficiency model. However, if household members
 are not able to commit, household intertemporal behaviour cannot be
 characterized using the standard life-cycle model. These findings have two
 main implications. First, policy makers can change household behaviour by
 modifying the decision power of individual household members. Second, to
 evaluate programmes designed to improve the welfare of household members,
 it would be beneficial to replace the standard unitary model with a
 characterization of household behaviour that allows for lack of
 commitment.  Copyright 2007, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Learning to Wait: A Laboratory Investigation 
Abstract:
 Human subjects decide when to sink a fixed cost C to seize an irreversible
 investment opportunity whose value V is governed by Brownian motion. The
 optimal policy is to invest when V first crosses a threshold V* = (1
 &#x0002B; w*)C, where the wait option premium w* depends on drift,
 volatility, and expiration hazard parameters. Subjects in the Low w*
 treatment on average invest at values quite close to optimum. Subjects in
 the two Medium and the High w* treatments invested at values below
 optimum, but with the predicted ordering, and values approached the
 optimum by the last block of 20 periods.  Copyright , Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Strategic Communication with Lying Costs 
Abstract:
 I study a model of strategic communication between an uninformed Receiver
 and an informed but upwardly biased Sender. The Sender bears a cost of
 lying, or more broadly, of misrepresenting his private information. The
 main results show that inflated language naturally arises in this
 environment, where the Sender (almost) always claims to be of a higher
 type than he would with complete information. Regardless of the intensity
 of lying cost, there is incomplete separation, with some pooling on the
 highest messages. The degree of language inflation and how much
 information is revealed depend upon the intensity of lying cost. The
 analysis delivers a framework to span a class of cheap-talk and verifiable
 disclosure games, unifying the polar predictions they make under large
 conflicts of interest. I use the model to discuss how the degree of
 manipulability of information can affect the trade-off between delegation
 and communication.  Copyright 2009, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Learning and Information Aggregation in an Exit Game 
Abstract:
 We analyse information aggregation in a stopping game with uncertain
 pay-offs that are correlated across players. Players learn from their own
 private experiences as well as by observing the actions of other players.
 We give a full characterization of the symmetric mixed strategy
 equilibrium, and show that information aggregates in randomly occurring
 exit waves. Observational learning induces the players to stay in the game
 longer. The equilibria display aggregate randomness even for large numbers
 of players.  Copyright 2011, Oxford University Press.

Title: Politicians, Taxes and Debt 
Abstract:
 The standard analysis of the efficient management of income taxes and debt
 assumes a benevolent government and ignores potential distortions arising
 from rent-seeking politicians. This paper departs from this framework by
 assuming that a rent-seeking politician chooses policies. If the
 politician chooses extractive policies, citizens throw him out of power.
 We analyse the efficient sustainable equilibrium. Unlike in the standard
 economy, temporary economic shocks generate volatile and persistent
 changes in taxes along the equilibrium path. This serves to optimally
 limit rent-seeking by the politician and to optimally generate support for
 the politician from the citizens. Taxes resembling those of the benevolent
 government are very costly since the government over-saves and resources
 are wasted on rents. Political distortions thus cause the complete debt
 market to behave as if it were incomplete. However, in contrast to an
 incomplete market economy, in the long run, taxes do not converge to zero,
 and under some conditions, they resemble taxes under a benevolent
 government.  Copyright , Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: The Economics of Clear Advice and Extreme Options 
Abstract:
 I study a principal-agent model in which the agent collects information
 and then chooses a verifiable action. I show that the principal can find
 it desirable to constrain the agent's action set even though there is no
 disagreement about the ranking of actions ex post. The elimination or
 penalization of "intermediate" actions, which are optimal when information
 is poor, improves incentives for information collection. I characterize
 optimal action sets when the agent is infinitely risk averse with respect
 to income shocks and optimal incentive schemes when the agent is risk
 neutral.  Copyright 2005, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: On the Mechanics of Firm Growth 
Abstract:
 The Pareto-like tail of the size distribution of firms can arise from
 random growth of productivity or stochastic accumulation of capital. If
 the shocks that give rise to firm growth are perfectly correlated within a
 firm, then the growth rates of small and large firms are equally volatile,
 contrary to what is found in the data. If firm growth is the result of
 many independent shocks within a firm, it can take hundreds of years for a
 few large firms to emerge. This paper describes an economy with both types
 of shocks that can account for the thick-tailed firm size distribution,
 high entry and exit rates, and the relatively young age of large firms.
 The economy is one in which aggregate growth is driven by the creation of
 new products by both new and incumbent firms. Some new firms have better
 ideas than others and choose to implement those ideas at a more rapid
 pace. Eventually, such firms slow down when the quality of their ideas
 reverts to the mean. As in the data, average growth rates in a cross
 section of firms will appear to be independent of firm size, for all but
 the smallest firms.  Copyright 2011, Oxford University Press.

Title: Strategic Delegation By Unobservable Incentive Contracts 
Abstract:
 Many strategic interactions in the real world take place among delegates
 empowered to act on behalf of others. Although there may be a multitude of
 reasons why delegation arises in reality, one intriguing possibility is
 that it yields a strategic advantage to the delegating party. In the case
 where only one party has the option to delegate, we analyse the
 possibility that strategic delegation arises as an equilibrium outcome
 under completely unobservable incentive contracts within the class of
 two-person extensive form games. We show that delegation may arise solely
 due to strategic reasons in quite general economic environments even under
 unobservable contracts. Furthermore, under some reasonable restrictions on
 out-of-equilibrium beliefs and actions of the outside party, strategic
 delegation is shown to be the only equilibrium outcome.  Copyright 2004, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Estimation and Forecasting in Models with Multiple Breaks 
Abstract:
 This paper develops a new approach to change-point modelling that allows
 the number of change-points in the observed sample to be unknown. The
 model we develop assumes that regime durations have a Poisson
 distribution. It approximately nests the two most common approaches: the
 time-varying parameter (TVP) model with a change-point every period and
 the change-point model with a small number of regimes. We focus
 considerable attention on the construction of reasonable hierarchical
 priors both for regime durations and for the parameters that characterize
 each regime. A Markov chain Monte Carlo posterior sampler is constructed
 to estimate a version of our model, which allows for change in conditional
 means and variances. We show how real-time forecasting can be done in an
 efficient manner using sequential importance sampling. Our techniques are
 found to work well in an empirical exercise involving U.S. GDP growth and
 inflation. Empirical results suggest that the number of change-points is
 larger than previously estimated in these series and the implied model is
 similar to a TVP (with stochastic volatility) model.  Copyright 2007, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Rent-sharing, Holdup, and Wages: Evidence from Matched Panel Data 
Abstract:
 Rent-sharing by workers can reduce the incentives for investment if some
 of the returns to sunk capital are captured in higher wages. We propose a
 simple measure of this "holdup" effect based on the size of the wage
 offset for firm-specific capital accumulation. Using Social Security
 earnings records for workers in the Veneto region of Italy linked to
 detailed financial data for their employers, we find strong evidence of
 rent-sharing, with an elasticity of wages with respect to potential rents
 per worker of around 4%, arising mainly at larger firms with higher
 price-cost margins. On the other hand, we find little evidence that
 bargaining lowers the return on investment. Instead, firm-level bargaining
 appears to split the rents after deducting the full cost of capital.  Copyright 2014, Oxford University Press.

Title: The Effects of a Right to Silence 
Abstract:
 Contrary to conventional wisdom, a right to silence can reduce wrongful
 convictions of innocent suspects who tell police the truth, and may reduce
 the overall conviction rate without affecting the confession rate. We
 establish these conclusions by modelling interrogation as a game in which
 suspects are privately informed of their type, but do not know the content
 of witness reports. Our model has testable implications which distinguish
 it from competing models. The best data rejects competing models, but does
 not reject our model.  Copyright 2005, Wiley-Blackwell.

Abstract:
 The Ellsberg paradox demonstrates that people's beliefs over uncertain

 if a risk averse decision maker, who has a well defined Bayesian prior,
 perceives an Ellsberg type decision problem as possibly composed of a
 bundle of several positively correlated problems, she will be uncertainty
 averse. We generalize this argument and derive sufficient conditions for
 uncertainty aversion.  Copyright 2005, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: The Control of Politicians in Divided Societies: The Politics of Fear 
Abstract:
 Autocrats in many developing countries have extracted enormous personal
 rents from power. In addition, they have imposed inefficient policies
 including pervasive patronage spending. I present a model in which the
 presence of ethnic identities and the absence of institutionalized
 succession processes allow the ruler to elicit support from a sizeable
 share of the population despite large reductions in welfare. The fear of
 falling under an equally inefficient and venal ruler that favours another
 group is enough to discipline supporters. The model predicts extensive use
 of patronage, ethnic bias in taxation, and spending patterns and unveils a
 new mechanism through which economic frictions translate into increased
 rent extraction by the leader. These predictions are consistent with the
 experiences of bad governance, ethnic bias, wasteful policies, and
 kleptocracy in post-colonial Africa.  Copyright 2007, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Interdependent Durations 
Abstract:
 This paper studies the identification of a simultaneous equation model
 involving duration measures. It proposes a game theoretic model in which
 durations are determined by strategic agents. In the absence of strategic
 motives, the model delivers a version of the generalized accelerated
 failure time model. In its most general form, the system resembles a
 classical simultaneous equation model in which endogenous variables
 interact with observable and unobservable exogenous components to
 characterize an economic environment. In this paper, the endogenous
 variables are the individually chosen equilibrium durations. Even though a
 unique solution to the game is not always attainable in this context, the
 structural elements of the economic system are shown to be
 semi-parametrically identified. We also present a brief discussion of
 estimation ideas and a set of simulation studies on the model.  Copyright , Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Income Distribution and Demand-Induced Innovations 
Abstract:
 We introduce non-homothetic preferences into an innovation-based growth
 model and study how income and wealth inequality affect economic growth.
 We identify a (positive) price effect-where increasing inequality
 allows innovators to charge higher prices and (negative) market-size
 effects-with higher inequality implying smaller markets for new
 goods and/or a slower transition of new goods into mass markets. It turns
 out that price effects dominate market-size effects. We also show that a
 redistribution from the poor to the rich may be Pareto improving for low
 levels of inequality.  Copyright 2006, Wiley-Blackwell.

Abstract:
 For a nonexcludable public good with benefit and cost functions
 independent of the number of participants, this paper studies second-best
 allocations under Bayesian interim incentive compatibility and interim
 individual rationality. As the number of participants becomes large,
 second-best provision levels converge in distribution to first-best levels
 if the latter are bounded. Second-best provision levels become large in
 absolute terms but small relative to first-best levels if benefit and cost
 functions are isoelastic. In contrast, for an excludable public good, the
 ratio of second-best to first-best levels is bounded away from zero.  Copyright 2003, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Vertical Contracts in the Video Rental Industry<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN1">-super-1</xref> 
Abstract:
 A large body of theoretical work has explored the channels through which
 vertical contracts can induce efficiency improvements. However, it is also
 important to study vertical contracts empirically in order to gain insight
 into the relative size of different types of efficiency gains. In this
 paper, I empirically analyse a contractual innovation in the vertically
 separated video rental industry. Prior to 1998, video stores obtained
 inventory from movie distributors using simple linear-pricing contracts.
 In 1998, revenue-sharing contracts were widely adopted. I investigate the
 effect of the introduction of revenue-sharing contracts on firms' profits
 and consumer welfare. I analyse a new panel data set of home video
 retailers that includes information on individual retailers' contract and
 inventory choices, as well as rentals and contract terms for 246 movie
 titles and 6137 retailers in the U.S. during each week of 1998 and 1999
 and the first half of 2000. A structural econometric model of firms'
 behaviour is developed that describes the nature of firms' contract
 choices. Estimates from this model indicate that both upstream and
 downstream profits increase by 10% under the revenue-sharing contract for
 popular titles. For less popular titles, the effects can be even larger. I
 also estimate that consumers benefit when revenue-sharing contracts are
 adopted.  Copyright 2008, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Bargaining and Reputation in Search Markets 
Abstract:
 This article considers a two-sided search market where firms and workers
 are paired to bargain over a unit surplus. The matching market serves as
 an endogenous outside option for the agents. The market includes
 inflexible commitment types who demand a constant portion of any match
 surplus. The frequency of such types is determined in equilibrium.An
 equilibrium where there are significant delays in reaching an agreement
 and where negotiations occasionally break down on the equilibrium path is
 constructed. Such an equilibrium exists and commitment types affect
 bargaining dynamics even if the equilibrium frequency of such types is
 negligible. If the inflows of firms and workers into the market are
 symmetric, then bargaining involves two-sided reputation building and
 reputation concerns lead to delays and inefficiency. Access to the market
 exacerbates bargaining inefficiencies caused by inflexible types. If the
 inflows of workers and firms are sufficiently asymmetric, then bargaining
 involves one-sided reputation and commitment types determine the terms of
 trade.  Copyright 2014, Oxford University Press.

Title: Sales Talk, Cancellation Terms and the Role of Consumer Protection 
Abstract:
 This article analyses contract cancellation and product return policies in
 markets in which sellers advise customers about the suitability of their
 offering. When customers are fully rational, it is optimal for sellers to
 offer the right to cancel or return on favourable terms. A generous return
 policy makes the seller's "cheap talk" at the point of sale credible. This
 observation provides a possible explanation for the excess refund puzzle
 and also has implications for the management of customer reviews. When
 customers are credulous, instead, sellers have an incentive to set
 unfavourable terms to exploit the inflated beliefs they induce in their
 customers. The imposition of a minimum statutory standard improves welfare
 and consumer surplus when customers are credulous. In contrast,
 competition policy reduces contractual inefficiencies with rational
 customers, but it is not effective with credulous customers.  Copyright 2013, Oxford University Press.

Title: On Price Caps Under Uncertainty 
Abstract:
 This paper shows how standard arguments supporting the imposition of price
 caps break down in the presence of demand uncertainty. In particular,
 though in the deterministic case the introduction or lowering of a price
 cap (above marginal cost) results in increased production, increased total
 welfare, decreased prices, and increased consumer welfare, we show that
 all of the above comparative statics predictions fail for generic
 uncertain demand functions. For example, for price caps sufficiently close
 to marginal cost, a decrease in the price cap always leads to a decrease
 in production and total welfare under certain mild conditions. Under
 stronger regularity assumptions, all of the monotone comparative statics
 predictions from the deterministic case also do not hold for a generic
 uncertain demand if we restrict attention to price caps in an arbitrary
 fixed interval (as long as the price caps are binding for some values in
 that interval).  Copyright 2007, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Bayesian Learning in Social Networks 
Abstract:
 We study the (perfect Bayesian) equilibrium of a sequential learning model
 over a general social network. Each individual receives a signal about the
 underlying state of the world, observes the past actions of a
 stochastically generated neighbourhood of individuals, and chooses one of
 two possible actions. The stochastic process generating the neighbourhoods
 defines the network topology. We characterize pure strategy equilibria for
 arbitrary stochastic and deterministic social networks and characterize
 the conditions under which there will be asymptotic learning--convergence
 (in probability) to the right action as the social network becomes large.
 We show that when private beliefs are unbounded (meaning that the implied
 likelihood ratios are unbounded), there will be asymptotic learning as
 long as there is some minimal amount of "expansion in observations". We
 also characterize conditions under which there will be asymptotic learning
 when private beliefs are bounded.  Copyright 2011, Oxford University Press.

Title: Broadband Internet: An Information Superhighway to Sex Crime? 
Abstract:
 Does internet use trigger sex crime? We use unique Norwegian data on crime
 and internet adoption to shed light on this question. A public program
 with limited funding rolled out broadband access points in 2000--2008, and
 provides plausibly exogenous variation in internet use. Our instrumental
 variables estimates show that internet use is associated with a
 substantial increase in both reports, charges and convictions of rape and
 other sex crimes. We present a conceptual framework that highlights three
 mechanisms for how internet use may affect reported sex crime, namely a
 reporting effect, a matching effect on potential offenders and victims,
 and a direct effect on sex crime propensity. To investigate the importance
 of these mechanisms, we use data on individual reporting behaviour, police
 investigations, and criminal charges and convictions. None of the analyses
 we perform suggest that the positive relationship between internet use and
 sex crime is driven by changes in reporting behaviour. Our findings
 suggest that the direct effect on sex crime propensity is positive and
 non-negligible, possibly as a result of increased consumption of
 pornography.  Copyright 2013, Oxford University Press.

Title: Piece Rates, Fixed Wages and Incentives: Evidence from a Field Experiment 
Abstract:
 Data from a field experiment are used to estimate the gain in productivity
 that is realized when workers are paid piece rates rather than fixed
 wages. The experiment was conducted within a tree-planting firm and
 provides daily observations on individual worker productivity under both
 compensation systems. Unrestricted statistical methods estimate the
 productivity gain to be 20%. Since planting conditions potentially affect
 incentives, structural econometric methods are used to generalize the
 experimental results to out-of-sample conditions. The structural results
 suggest that the average productivity gain, outside of the experimental
 conditions, would be at least 21.7%.  Copyright 2004, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Consumption Commitments and Employment Contracts 
Abstract:
 We examine an economy in which the cost of consuming some goods can be
 reduced by making commitments that reduce flexibility. We show that such
 consumption commitments can induce consumers with risk-neutral underlying
 utility functions to be risk averse over small variations in income, but
 sometimes to seek risk over large variations. As a result, optimal
 employment contracts will smooth wages conditional on being employed, but
 may incorporate a possibility of unemployment.  Copyright 2008, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Redistribution, Fiscal Competition, and the Politics of Economic Integration 
Abstract:
 The paper examines the consequences of the economic integration of factor
 markets in a model with two countries that redistribute income among their
 residents. The social benefits in each country are financed by a source
 based tax on capital which is democratically chosen by its inhabitants. If
 either capital or labour is internationally mobile, the countries engage
 in fiscal competition and the partial integration of capital or labour
 markets is detrimental to the countries' redistributive ability. A move
 from partial to full integration, however, may alleviate rather than
 intensify fiscal competition, particularly, if the two countries face
 sufficiently similar economic and political conditions. In such a
 situation, for example, tax competition for mobile capital is softened as
 the labour market becomes more integrated and even vanishes if both
 factors are fully mobile. As a result, there is more redistribution in
 equilibrium and a majority of the population in each country is strictly
 better off.  Copyright 2002, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Leadership, Coordination, and Corporate Culture 
Abstract:
 What is the role of leaders in large organizations? We propose a model in
 which a leader helps to overcome a misalignment of followers' incentives
 that inhibits coordination, while adapting the organization to a changing
 environment. Good leadership requires vision and special personality
 traits such as conviction or resoluteness to enhance the credibility of
 mission statements and to effectively rally agents around them.
 Resoluteness allows leaders to overcome a time-consistency problem that
 arises from the fact that leaders learn about the best course of action
 for the organization over time. However, resoluteness also inhibits
 bottom-up information flow from followers. The optimal level of
 resoluteness depends on followers' signal quality and the corporate
 culture of the organization.  Copyright 2013, Oxford University Press.

Title: Governing Adaptation<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN1">-super-1</xref> 
Abstract:
 To remain competitive, an organization must both respond to information
 about its environment and coordinate its activities. We analyse how the
 allocation of decision rights within an organizational hierarchy
 influences the organization's ability to solve such problems of
 coordinated adaptation when information is both soft and distributed
 inside the organization and the organizational participants behave
 strategically. The results show that, contrary to the common intuition,
 the performance differential between centralized and decentralized
 decision-making is non-monotone in the importance of coordination.
 Further, both these common structures are dominated by asymmetric
 structures in sufficiently asymmetric environments (such as a small
 division developing a new product in the presence of a large division with
 an established product). Finally, if the incentive conflicts between the
 participants can be made sufficiently small, centralized decision-making
 is always dominated by decentralized decision-making.  Copyright 2008, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: A Search-Theoretic Model of the Retail Market for Illicit Drugs 
Abstract:
 A search-theoretic model of the retail market for illegal drugs is
 developed. Trade occurs in bilateral, potentially long-lived matches
 between sellers and buyers. Buyers incur search costs when experimenting
 with a new seller. Moral hazard is present because buyers learn purity
 only after a trade is made. This model is consistent with some new
 stylized facts about the drugs market, and it is informative for policy
 design. The effectiveness of different enforcement strategies is
 evaluated, including some novel ones that leverage the moral hazard
 present in the market.  Copyright , Oxford University Press.

Title: Labour Market Rigidities, Trade and Unemployment 
Abstract:
 We study a two-country, two-sector model of international trade in which
 one sector produces homogeneous products and the other produces
 differentiated products. Both sectors are subjected to search and matching
 frictions in the labour market and wage bargaining. As a result, some of
 the workers searching for jobs end up being unemployed. Countries are
 similar except for frictions in their labour markets, such as efficiency
 of matching and costs of posting vacancies, which can vary across the
 sectors. The differentiated-product industry has firm heterogeneity and
 monopolistic competition. We study the interaction of labour market
 rigidities and trade impediments in shaping welfare, trade flows,
 productivity, and unemployment. We show that both countries gain from
 trade. A country with relatively lower frictions in the
 differentiated-product industry exports differentiated products on net. A
 country benefits from lowering frictions in its differentiated sector's
 labour market, but this harms the country's trade partner. Alternatively,
 a simultaneous, proportional lowering of labour market frictions in the
 differentiated sectors of both countries benefits both of them. The
 opening to trade raises a country's rate of unemployment if its relative
 labour market frictions in the differentiated sector are low, and it
 reduces the rate of unemployment if its relative labour market frictions
 in the differentiated sector are high. Cross-country differences in rates
 of unemployment exhibit rich patterns. In particular, lower labour market
 frictions do not ensure lower unemployment, and unemployment and welfare
 can both rise in response to falling labour market frictions and falling
 trade costs.  Copyright , Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Monotone Matching in Perfect and Imperfect Worlds 
Abstract:
 We study frictionless matching in large economies with and without market
 imperfections, providing sufficient conditions for monotone matching that
 are weaker than those previously known. Necessary conditions, which depend
 on a key analytical object we call the surplus function, are also offered.
 Changes in the surplus yield valuable information about the comparative
 statics of matching patterns across environments. We apply our framework
 to some examples adapted from the literature, accounting for and extending
 several comparative-static and welfare results. We also explore the
 dependence of the matching pattern on the type distribution.  Copyright 2002, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Building the Family Nest: Premarital Investments, Marriage Markets, and Spousal Allocations 
Abstract:
 We develop a transferable utility model of the household in which the
 marriage market is characterized by (negative or positive) assortative
 matching, and spousal allocations are determined by premarital
 investments. We demonstrate that all sharing rules along the assortative
 order support efficient outcomes both in terms of premarital investments
 and intra-household allocations. The efficiency of premarital choices and
 household allocations then enables us to show that, for each couple, the
 marriage market generates a unique and maritally sustainable sharing rule
 that is a function of the distribution of premarital endowments and the
 sex ratios in the market. According to our results, transfers among
 spouses occur on two margins: premarital investments and intra-marital
 spousal allocations. Asymmetries in the sex ratios in the marriage markets
 produce gender differences in premarital investments and consumption that
 are larger for individuals with small premarital endowments than those
 with larger endowments. A corollary of these findings is that, when men
 are in short supply in the marriage markets, women can invest more than
 men even when the returns to investment are lower or the costs are higher
 for women.  Copyright 2007, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Intertemporal Labour Supply with Search Frictions 
Abstract:
 Starting in the 1970's, wage inequality and the number of hours worked by
 employed U.S. prime-age male workers have both increased. We argue that
 these two facts are related. We use a labour market model with on-the-job
 search where by working longer hours individuals acquire greater skills.
 Since job candidates are ranked by productivity, greater skills not only
 increase worker's productivity in the current job but also help the worker
 to obtain better jobs. When job offers become more dispersed, wage
 inequality increases and workers work longer hours to obtain better jobs.
 As a result, average hours per worker in the economy increase. This
 mechanism accounts for around two-thirds of the increase in hours observed
 in data. Part of the increase is inefficient since workers obtain better
 jobs at the expense of other workers competing for the same jobs.  Copyright , Oxford University Press.

Title: A Non-Parametric Test of Exogeneity 
Abstract:
 This paper presents a test for exogeneity of explanatory variables that
 minimizes the need for auxiliary assumptions that are not required by the
 definition of exogeneity. It concerns inference about a non-parametric
 function g that is identified by a conditional moment restriction
 involving instrumental variables (IV). A test of the hypothesis that g is
 the mean of a random variable Y conditional on a covariate X is developed
 that is not subject to the ill-posed inverse problem of non-parametric IV
 estimation. The test is consistent whenever g differs from E (Y &#x2223;
 X) on a set of non-zero probability. The usefulness of this new exogeneity
 test is displayed through Monte Carlo experiments and an application to
 estimation of non-parametric consumer expansion paths.  Copyright 2007, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Preferences Over Sets of Lotteries<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN1">-super-1</xref> 
Abstract:
 This paper studies a model in which in period 1, a decision-maker chooses
 a set of lotteries and in period 2, Nature chooses a lottery from the set
 chosen by the decision-maker and the decision-maker consumes the lottery
 chosen by Nature. Larger sets are interpreted as representing more
 ambiguous objective information about the lottery that will be consumed.
 The axioms imposed on preferences over sets of lotteries generalize those
 often imposed on preferences over single lotteries in the existing
 literature. A decision-maker who satisfies these axioms evaluates sets of
 lotteries according to a weighted average of the expected utilities of the
 best and the worst lottery in a set, with the weights interpreted as a
 measure of (comparative) attitude to objective ambiguity.  Copyright 2007, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: War Signals: A Theory of Trade, Trust, and Conflict 
Abstract:
 We construct a theory of persistent civil conflicts, where persistence is
 driven by the endogenous dynamics of inter-ethnic trust and trade. In
 times of peace, agents belonging to two groups are randomly matched to
 trade bilaterally. Trade hinges on trust and cooperation. The onset of
 conflict signals that the aggressor has a low propensity to cooperate,
 harming future trust and trade. Agents observe the history of conflicts
 and update their beliefs over time. The theory predicts that civil wars
 are persistent. Moreover, even accidental conflicts that do not reflect
 economic fundamentals erode trust, and can plunge a society into a vicious
 cycle of recurrent conflicts (a war trap). The incidence of conflict can
 be reduced by policies abating cultural barriers, fostering inter-ethnic
 trade and human capital, and shifting beliefs. Coercive peace policies,
 such as peacekeeping forces or externally imposed regime changes, have no
 enduring effects.  Copyright 2013, Oxford University Press.

Title: Optimal Information Disclosure in Auctions and the Handicap Auction 
Abstract:
 We analyse a situation where a monopolist is selling an indivisible good
 to risk-neutral buyers who only have an estimate of their private
 valuations. The seller can release, without observing, certain additional
 signals that affect the buyers' valuations. Our main result is that in the
 expected revenue-maximizing mechanism, the seller makes available all the
 information that she can, and her expected revenue is the same as it would
 be if she could observe the part of the information that is
 &#x201C;new&#x201D; to the buyers. We also show that this mechanism can be
 implemented by what we call a handicap auction in interesting
 applications. In the first round of this auction, each buyer picks a price
 premium from a menu offered by the seller (a smaller premium costs more).
 Then the seller releases the additional signals. In the second round, the
 buyers bid in a second-price auction where the winner pays the sum of his
 premium and the second highest non-negative bid. In the case of a single
 buyer, this mechanism simplifies to a menu of European call options.  Copyright 2007, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Empirical Implications of Equilibrium Bidding in First-Price, Symmetric, Common Value Auctions 
Abstract:
 This paper studies federal auctions for wildcat leases on the Outer
 Continental Shelf from 1954 to 1970. These are leases where bidders
 privately acquire (at some cost) noisy, but equally informative, signals
 about the amount of oil and gas that may be present. We develop tests of
 rational and equilibrium bidding in a common values model that are
 implemented using data on bids and ex post values. We also use data on
 tract location and ex post values to test the comparative static
 prediction that bidders may bid less aggressively in common value auctions
 when they expect more competition. We find that bidders are aware of the
 &#x201C;winner's curse&#x201D; and their bidding is largely consistent
 with equilibrium.  Copyright 2003, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Evolutionary Implementation and Congestion Pricing 
Abstract:
 We consider an implementation problem faced by a planner who manages a
 roadway network. The problem entails both hidden information and hidden
 actions. We solve the planner's problem by introducing a new class of
 mechanisms and a new notion of implementation. The mechanisms, called
 price schemes, attach transfers to the available routes; they do not
 involve direct revelation. The method of implementation is evolutionary,
 requiring that players who follow any reasonable myopic adjustment process
 eventually learn to behave as the planner desires. We show that efficient
 behaviour can be guaranteed using simple, decentralized price schemes.  Copyright 2002, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Social Networks and the Dynamics of Labour Market Outcomes: Evidence from Refugees Resettled in the U.S. 
Abstract:
 This paper examines the dynamic implications of social networks for the
 labour market outcomes of refugees resettled in the U.S. A theoretical
 model of job information transmission shows that the relationship between
 social network size and labour market outcomes is heterogeneous and
 depends on the vintage of network members: an increase in network size can
 negatively impact some cohorts in a network while benefiting others. To
 test this prediction, I use new data on political refugees resettled in
 the U.S. and exploit the fact that these refugees are distributed across
 cities by a resettlement agency, precluding individuals from sorting. The
 results indicate that an increase in the number of social network members
 resettled in the same year or one year prior to a new arrival leads to a
 deterioration of outcomes, while a greater number of tenured network
 members improves the probability of employment and raises the hourly wage.  Copyright 2012, Oxford University Press.

Title: A Multiplier Approach to Understanding the Macro Implications of Household Finance 
Abstract:
 Our paper examines the impact of heterogeneous trading technologies for
 households on asset prices and the distribution of wealth. We distinguish
 between passive traders who hold fixed portfolios of stocks and bonds, and
 active traders who adjust their portfolios to changes in expected returns.
 To solve the model, we derive an optimal consumption sharing rule that
 does not depend on the trading technology, and we derive an aggregation
 result for state prices. This allows us to solve for equilibrium prices
 and allocations without having to search for market clearing prices in
 each asset market separately. We show that the fraction of total wealth
 held by active traders, not the fraction held by all participants, is
 critical for asset prices because only these traders respond to variation
 in state prices and hence absorb the residual aggregate risk created by
 non-participants. We calibrate the heterogeneity in trading technologies
 to match the equity premium and the risk-free rate. The calibrated model
 reproduces the skewness and kurtosis of the wealth distribution in the
 data. In contrast to existing asset pricing models with heterogeneous
 agents, our model matches the high volatility of returns and the low
 volatility of the risk-free rate.  Copyright 2011, Oxford University Press.

Title: Consumption-Based Asset Pricing with Higher Cumulants 
Author-Name: Ian W. Martin
Abstract:
 I extend the Epstein--Zin-lognormal consumption-based asset-pricing model
 to allow for general i.i.d. consumption growth. Information about the
 higher moments--equivalently, cumulants--of consumption growth is encoded
 in the cumulant-generating function. I use the framework to analyse
 economies with rare disasters, and argue that the importance of such
 disasters is a double-edged sword: parameters that govern the frequency
 and sizes of rare disasters are critically important for asset pricing,
 but extremely hard to calibrate. I show how to sidestep this issue by
 using observable asset prices to make inferences without having to
 estimate higher moments of the underlying consumption process. Extensions
 of the model allow consumption to diverge from dividends, and for
 non-i.i.d. consumption growth.  Copyright 2013, Oxford University Press.

Title: Beliefs and Private Monitoring 
Abstract:
 This paper develops new recursive, set based methods for studying repeated
 games with private monitoring. For any finite-state strategy profile, we
 find necessary and sufficient conditions for whether there exists a
 distribution over initial states such that the strategy, together with
 this distribution, form a correlated sequential equilibrium (CSE). Also,
 for any given correlation device for determining initial states (including
 degenerate cases where players' initial states are common knowledge), we
 provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the correlation device and
 strategy to be a CSE, or in the case of a degenerate correlation device,
 for the strategy to be a sequential equilibrium. We also consider several
 applications. In these, we show that the methods are computationally
 feasible, and how to construct and verify equilibria in a secret
 price-setting game.  Copyright , Oxford University Press.

Title: Testing for Localization Using Micro-Geographic Data 
Abstract:
 To study the detailed location patterns of industries, and particularly
 the tendency for industries to cluster relative to overall manufacturing,
 we develop distance-based tests of localization. In contrast to previous
 studies, our approach allows us to assess the statistical significance of
 departures from randomness. In addition, we treat space as continuous
 instead of using an arbitrary collection of geographical units. This
 avoids problems relating to scale and borders. We apply these tests to an
 exhaustive U.K. data-set. For four-digit industries, we find that (i) 52%
 of them are localized at a 5% confidence level, (ii) localization mostly
 takes place at small scales below 50 km, (iii) the degree of localization
 is very skewed, and (iv) industries follow broad sectoral patterns with
 respect to localization. Depending on the industry, smaller establishments
 can be the main drivers of both localization and dispersion. Three-digit
 sectors show similar patterns of localization at small scales as well as a
 tendency to localize at medium scales.  Copyright 2005, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Assessing the Equalizing Force of Mobility Using Short Panels: France, 1990-2000 
Abstract:
 In this paper, we document whether and how much the equalizing force of
 earnings mobility has changed in France in the 1990's. For this purpose,
 we use a representative three-year panel, the French Labour Force Survey.
 We develop a model of earnings dynamics that combines a flexible
 specification of marginal earnings distributions (to fit the large
 cross-sectional dimension of the data) with a tight parametric
 representation of the dynamics (adapted to the short time-series
 dimension). Log earnings are modelled as the sum of a deterministic
 component, an individual fixed effect and a transitory component which is
 assumed first-order Markov. The transition probability of the transitory
 component is modelled as a one-parameter Plackett copula. We estimate this
 model using a sequential expectation-maximization algorithm.We exploit the
 estimated model to study employment/earnings inequality in France over the
 1990-2002 period. We show that, in phase with business-cycle fluctuations
 (a recession in 1993 and two peaks in 1990 and 2000), earnings mobility
 decreases when cross-section inequality and unemployment risk increase. We
 simulate individual earnings trajectories and compute present values of
 lifetime earnings for various horizons. Inequality presents a hump-shaped
 evolution over the period, with a 9% increase between 1990 and 1995 and a
 decrease afterwards. Accounting for unemployment yields an increase of
 11%. Moreover, this increase is persistent, as it translates into a 12%
 increase in the variance of log present values. The ratio of inequality in
 present values to inequality in one-year earnings, a natural measure of
 immobility or of the persistence of inequality, remains remarkably
 constant over the business cycle.  Copyright , Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Monetary Policy Shifts and the Term Structure 
Abstract:
 We estimate the effect of shifts in monetary policy using the term
 structure of interest rates. In our no-arbitrage model, the short rate
 follows a version of the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Taylor's
 (1993</xref>, "Discretion Versus Policy Rules in Practice",
 Carnegie-Rochester Conference Series on Public Policy, 39, 195--214) rule
 where the coefficients on the output gap and inflation vary over time. The
 monetary policy loading on the output gap has averaged around 0&middot;4
 and has not changed very much over time. The overall response of the yield
 curve to output gap components is relatively small. In contrast, the
 inflation loading has changed substantially over the last 50 years and
 ranges from close to zero in 2003 to a high of 2&middot;4 in 1983.
 Long-term bonds are sensitive to inflation policy shifts with increases in
 inflation loadings leading to higher short rates and widening yield
 spreads.  Copyright 2011, Oxford University Press.

Title: Financial Contracting Theory Meets the Real World: An Empirical Analysis of Venture Capital Contracts 
Abstract:
 We compare the characteristics of real-world financial contracts to their
 counterparts in financial contracting theory. We do so by studying the
 actual contracts between venture capitalists (VCs) and entrepreneurs. The
 distinguishing characteristic of VC financings is that they allow VCs to
 separately allocate cash flow rights, board rights, voting rights,
 liquidation rights, and other control rights. We describe and measure
 these rights. We then interpret our results in relation to existing
 financial contracting theories. We also describe the interrelation and the
 evolution across financing rounds of the different rights.  Copyright 2003, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: A Structural Approach to Identifying the Sources of Local Currency Price Stability 
Abstract:
 The inertia of the local currency prices of traded goods in the face of
 exchange rate changes is a well-documented phenomenon in International
 Economics. This paper develops a structural model to identify the sources
 of this local currency price stability and applies it to micro-data from
 the beer market. The empirical procedure exploits manufacturers' and
 retailers' first-order conditions in conjunction with detailed information
 on the frequency of price adjustments following exchange rate changes to
 quantify the relative importance of local non-traded cost components,
 markup adjustment by manufacturers and retailers, and nominal price
 rigidities in the incomplete transmission of such changes to prices. We
 find that, on average, approximately 60% of the incomplete exchange rate
 pass-through is due to local non-traded costs; 8% to markup adjustment;
 30% to the existence of own brand price adjustment costs; and 1% to the
 indirect/strategic effect of such costs, though these results vary
 considerably across individual brands according to their market shares.  Copyright , Oxford University Press.

Title: Unravelling of Dynamic Sorting 
Abstract:
 We consider a two-sided, finite-horizon search and matching model with
 heterogeneous types and complementarity between types. The quality of the
 pool of potential partners deteriorates as agents who have found mutually
 agreeable matches exit the market. When search is costless and all agents
 participate in each matching round, the market performs a sorting function
 in that high types of agents have multiple chances to match with their
 peers. However, this sorting function is lost if agents incur an
 arbitrarily small cost in order to participate in each round. With a
 sufficiently rich type space, the market unravels as almost all agents
 rush to participate in the first round and match and exit with anyone they
 meet.  Copyright 2005, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Liquidity, Risk, and Occupational Choices 
Abstract:
 We explore which financial constraints matter most in the choice of
 becoming an entrepreneur. We consider a randomly assigned welfare
 programme in rural Mexico and show that cash transfers significantly
 increase entry into entrepreneurship. We then exploit cross-household
 variation in the timing of these transfers and find that current
 occupational choices are significantly more responsive to the transfers
 expected for the future than to those currently received. Guided by a
 simple occupational choice model, we argue that the programme has promoted
 entrepreneurship by enhancing willingness to bear risk as opposed to
 simply relaxing current liquidity constraints.  Copyright 2013, Oxford University Press.

Title: Endogeneity in Semiparametric Binary Response Models 
Abstract:
 This paper develops and implements semiparametric methods for estimating
 binary response (binary choice) models with continuous endogenous
 regressors. It extends existing results on semiparametric estimation in
 single-index binary response models to the case of endogenous regressors.
 It develops a control function approach to account for endogeneity in
 triangular and fully simultaneous binary response models. The proposed
 estimation method is applied to estimate the income effect in a labour
 market participation problem using a large micro data-set from the British
 Family Expenditure Survey. The semiparametric estimator is found to
 perform well, detecting a significant attenuation bias. The proposed
 estimator is contrasted to the corresponding probit and linear probability
 specifications.  Copyright 2004, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Cross-Border Mergers as Instruments of Comparative Advantage 
Abstract:
 A two-country model of oligopoly in general equilibrium is used to show
 how changes in market structure accompany the process of trade and
 capital-market liberalization. The model predicts that bilateral mergers
 in which low-cost firms buy out higher-cost foreign rivals are profitable
 under Cournot competition. As a result, trade liberalization can trigger
 international merger waves, in the process encouraging countries to
 specialize and trade more in accordance with comparative advantage. With
 symmetric countries, welfare is likely to rise, though the distribution of
 income always shifts towards profits.  Copyright 2007, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: A Folk Theorem for Repeated Sequential Games 
Abstract:
 We study repeated sequential games where players may not move
 simultaneously in stage games. We introduce the concept of effective
 minimax for sequential games and establish a Folk theorem for repeated
 sequential games. The Folk theorem asserts that any feasible payoff vector
 where every player receives more than his effective minimax value in a
 sequential stage game can be supported by a subgame perfect equilibrium in
 the corresponding repeated sequential game when players are sufficiently
 patient.  The results of this paper generalize those of Wen (1994), and of
 Fudenberg and Maskin (1986). The model of repeated sequential games and
 the concept of effective minimax provide an alternative view to the
 Anti-Folk theorem of Lagunoff and Matsui (1997) for asynchronously
 repeated pure coordination games.  Copyright 2002, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Are Chinese Cities Too Small? 
Abstract:
 This paper models and estimates net urban agglomeration economies for
 cities. Economic models of cities postulate an inverted U shape of real
 income per worker against city employment, where the inverted U shifts
 with industrial composition across the urban hierarchy of cities. This
 relationship has never been estimated, in part because of data
 requirements. China has the necessary data and context. We find that urban
 agglomeration benefits are high&#x2014;real incomes per worker rise
 sharply with increases in city size from a low level. They level out
 nearer the peak and then decline very slowly past the peak. We find that a
 large fraction of cities in China are undersized due to nationally
 imposed, strong migration restrictions, resulting in large income losses.  Copyright 2006, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Statistical Discrimination and Efficiency 
Abstract:
 This paper asks whether statistical discrimination is a market failure. I
 consider the problem for a utilitarian social planner who operates in an
 environment that can generate statistical discrimination as an equilibrium
 phenomenon. It is found that there are potential efficiency gains from
 discrimination in terms of reduced "mismatch" between workers and jobs.
 Whether the solution to the planning problem involves discrimination
 depends on the trade-off between the informational gains of specialization
 and the losses in terms of increased investment costs.  Copyright 2003, Wiley-Blackwell.

 optimally delegates control to an &#x201C;intermediary&#x201D;, and show
 that keeping a veto-right typically reduces the expected utility of the

Title: The More We Know about the Fundamental, the Less We Agree on the Price 
Abstract:
 I allow trading horizon heterogeneity across groups in a standard
 differential information model of a financial market. This approach can
 explain the well-established phenomenon that, after a public announcement,
 trading volume increases, more private information is incorporated into
 prices and volatility increases. In such environments, public information
 has the important secondary role of helping agents learn about the
 information of other agents. Therefore, whenever the correlation between
 the private information of different groups is sufficiently low, a public
 announcement increases disagreement among short-horizon traders regarding
 the expected selling price even as it decreases disagreement about the
 fundamental value of the asset. Additional testable implications are also
 suggested.  Copyright , Oxford University Press.

Title: Contracting with Diversely Naive Agents 
Abstract:
 In standard contract-theoretic models, the underlying assumption is that
 agent types differ in their preference or cost parameters, and the
 principal's objective is to design contracts in order to screen this type.
 We study a contract-theoretic model in which the heterogeneity among agent
 types is of a &#x201C;cognitive&#x201D; nature. In our model, the agent
 has dynamically inconsistent preferences. Agent types differ only in their
 degree of &#x201C;sophistication&#x201D;, that is, their ability to
 forecast the change in their future tastes. We fully characterize the menu
 of contracts which the principal offers in order to screen the agent's
 sophistication. The menu does not exclude any type: it provides a perfect
 commitment device for relatively sophisticated types, and
 &#x201C;exploitative&#x201D; contracts which involve speculation with
 relatively naive types. More naive types are more heavily exploited and
 generate a greater profit for the principal. Our results allow us to
 interpret real-life contractual arrangements in a variety of industries.  Copyright 2006, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Household Electricity Demand, Revisited 
Abstract:
 Recent efforts to restructure electricity markets have renewed interest in
 assessing how consumers respond to price changes. This paper develops a
 model for evaluating the effects of alternative tariff designs on
 electricity use. The model concurrently addresses several interrelated
 difficulties posed by nonlinear pricing, heterogeneity in consumer price
 sensitivity, and consumption aggregation over appliances and time. We
 estimate the model using extensive data for a representative sample of
 1300 California households. The results imply a strikingly skewed
 distribution of household electricity price elasticities in the
 population, with a small fraction of households accounting for most
 aggregate demand response. We then estimate the aggregate and
 distributional consequences of recent tariff structure changes in
 California, the consumption effects of which have been the subject of
 considerable debate.  Copyright 2005, Wiley-Blackwell.

 as an activity that requires search for a partner and
 relationship-specific investments that are governed by incomplete

 the thickness of the domestic and foreign market for input suppliers, the
 relative cost of searching in each market, the relative cost of
 customizing inputs and the nature of the contracting environment in each
 country.  Copyright 2005, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Meetings with Costly Participation: An Empirical Analysis 
Abstract:
 Using data from the Mid-Atlantic surf clam and ocean quahog fishery, we
 find that firms with a preference for extreme, rather than moderate,
 policies are much more likely to participate in public meetings where
 regulation is determined. We also find that participation rates are higher
 for larger, closer, and more influential firms. These results: (1) improve
 our understanding of a very common institution for resource allocation,
 "meetings with costly participation", (2) they refine our intuition about
 regulatory capture, (3) they provide broad confirmation of the recent
 theoretical literature predicting that polarization and bipartisanship
 should emerge under a variety of democratic institutions, and finally, (4)
 they may help to explain management problems in U.S. fisheries.  Copyright 2005, Wiley-Blackwell.

 departures from the stable model. We make two contributions to this
 literature. First, we consider a large class of persistent breaking
 processes that lead to asymptotically equivalent efficient tests. Our
 class allows for many or relatively few breaks, clustered breaks,
 regularly occurring breaks, or smooth transitions to changes in the
 regression coefficients. Thus, asymptotically nothing is gained by knowing
 the exact breaking process of the class. Second, we provide a test
 statistic that is simple to compute, avoids any need for searching over
 high dimensions when there are many breaks, is valid for a wide range of
 data-generating processes and has good power and size properties even in
 heteroscedastic models.  Copyright 2006, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: An Assignment Theory of Foreign Direct Investment 
Abstract:
 We develop an assignment theory to analyse the volume and composition of
 foreign direct investment (FDI). Firms conduct FDI by either engaging in
 greenfield investment or in cross-border acquisitions. Cross-border
 acquisitions involve firms trading heterogeneous corporate assets to
 exploit complementarities, while greenfield FDI involves setting up a new
 production division in the foreign country. In equilibrium, greenfield FDI
 and cross-border acquisitions coexist within the same industry, but the
 composition of FDI between these modes varies with firm and country
 characteristics. Firms engaging in greenfield investment are
 systematically more efficient than those engaging in cross-border
 acquisitions. Furthermore, most FDI takes the form of cross-border
 acquisitions when production-cost differences between countries are small,
 while greenfield investment plays a more important role for FDI from
 high-cost into low-cost countries. These results capture important
 features of the data.  Copyright 2008, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Orthogonal Parameters and Panel Data 
Abstract:
 This paper describes a class of consistent estimators for short panels
 with fixed effects. The method is to find an orthogonal reparametrization
 of the fixed effects and then to integrate the new effects from the
 likelihood with respect to an appropriately chosen prior density. The
 resulting marginal posterior densities of the common parameters have modes
 that are shown to be consistent in the models examined here. The main
 result concerns the first-order autoregressive model with agent specific
 intercepts where the likelihood is conditional on the set of initial
 observations. This paper provides a consistent likelihoodbased estimator
 for this model. Some numerical illustrations are given. The first-order
 conditions for the posterior mode can also be thought of as new moment
 conditions for GMM estimation.  Copyright 2002, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Buying Shares and/or Votes for Corporate Control 
Abstract:
 We explore how allowing votes to be traded separately of shares may affect
 the efficiency of corporate control contests. Our basic set-up and the
 nature of the questions continue the work of <xref ref-type="bibr"
 rid="bib15">Grossman and Hart (1980)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr"
 rid="bib17">Harris and Raviv (1988)</xref>, and Blair, Golbe and Gerard
 (1989). We consider three cases with respect to the allowable price offers
 (for shares and for votes when they can be traded separately):
 unrestricted price offers, quantity-restricted price offers, and price
 offers contingent on winning. Our main results are characterizations of
 the equilibria and of the circumstances under which vote buying is
 harmful. We show that allowing votes to be traded separately of shares
 results in inefficiencies in all the cases we study. Similarly allowing
 quantity-restricted offers is also harmful, but allowing conditional
 offers is not in itself detrimental to efficiency. The paper also makes a
 methodological contribution to the analysis of takeover games with
 atomless shareholders. It provides a way of dealing with asymmetric
 equilibria that must be dealt with for a complete analysis and it proves
 existence of an equilibrium.  Copyright 2012, Oxford University Press.

Title: The War of Information 
Abstract:
 We analyse political contests (campaigns) between two parties with
 opposing interests. Parties provide costly information to voters who
 choose a policy. The information flow is continuous and stops when both
 parties quit. Parties' actions are strategic substitutes: increasing one
 party's cost makes that party provide more and its opponent provide less
 information. For voters, parties' actions are complements and hence
 raising the advantaged party's cost may be beneficial. Asymmetric
 information adds a signalling component resulting in a belief threshold at
 which the informed party's decision to continue campaigning offsets other
 unfavourable information.  Copyright 2012, Oxford University Press.

Title: A Major in Science? Initial Beliefs and Final Outcomes for College Major and Dropout 
Abstract:
 Taking advantage of unique longitudinal data, we provide the first
 characterization of what college students believe at the time of entrance
 about their final major, relate these beliefs to actual major outcomes,
 and provide an understanding of why students hold the initial beliefs
 about majors that they do. The data collection and analysis are based
 directly on a conceptual model in which a student's final major is best
 viewed as the end result of a learning process. We find that students
 enter school quite optimistic about obtaining a science degree, but that
 relatively few students end up graduating with a science degree. The
 substantial overoptimism about completing a degree in science can be
 attributed largely to students beginning school with misperceptions about
 their ability to perform well academically in science.  Copyright 2014, Oxford University Press.

Title: Eliciting Welfare Preferences from Behavioural Data Sets 
Abstract:
 An individual displays various preference orderings in different
 payoff-irrelevant circumstances. It is assumed that the variation in the
 observed preference orderings is the outcome of some cognitive process
 that distorts the underlying preferences of the individual. We introduce a
 framework for eliciting the individual's underlying preferences in such
 cases and then demonstrate it for two cognitive processes--satisficing and
 small assessment errors.  Copyright 2012, Oxford University Press.

Title: The Effect of Immigration along the Distribution of Wages 
Abstract:
 This paper analyses the effect immigration has on the wages of native
 workers. Unlike most previous work, we estimate wage effects along the
 distribution of native wages. We derive a flexible empirical strategy that
 does not rely on pre-allocating immigrants to particular skill groups. In
 our empirical analysis, we demonstrate that immigrants downgrade
 considerably upon arrival. As for the effects on native wages, we find a
 pattern of effects whereby immigration depresses wages below the 20th
 percentile of the wage distribution but leads to slight wage increases in
 the upper part of the wage distribution. This pattern mirrors the evidence
 on the location of immigrants in the wage distribution. We suggest that
 possible explanations for the overall slightly positive effect on native
 wages, besides standard immigration surplus arguments, could involve
 deviations of immigrant remuneration from contribution to production
 either because of initial mismatch or immigrant downgrading.  Copyright , Oxford University Press.

Title: Education Choices in Mexico: Using a Structural Model and a Randomized Experiment to Evaluate PROGRESA 
Abstract:
 In this paper, we use an economic model to analyse data from a major
 randomized social experiment, namely PROGRESA in Mexico, and to evaluate
 its impact on school participation. We show the usefulness of using
 experimental data to estimate a structural economic model as well as the
 importance of a structural model in interpreting experimental results. The
 availability of the experiment also allows us to estimate the program's
 general equilibrium effects, which we then incorporate into our
 simulations. Our main findings are (i) the program's grant has a much
 stronger impact on school enrolment than an equivalent reduction in child
 wages; (ii) the program has a positive effect on the enrollment of
 children, especially after primary school; this result is well replicated
 by the parsimonious structural model; (iii) there are sizeable effects of
 the program on child wages, which, however, reduce the effectiveness of
 the program only marginally; and (iv) a revenue neutral change in the
 program that would increase the grant for secondary school children while
 eliminating for the primary school children would have a substantially
 larger effect on enrollment of the latter, while having minor effects on
 the former.  Copyright 2012, Oxford University Press.

Title: Learning and Complementarities in Speculative Attacks 
Abstract:
 We study a model where the aggregate trading of currency speculators
 reveals new information to the central bank and affects its policy
 decision. We show that the learning process gives rise to coordination
 motives among speculators leading to large currency attacks and
 introducing non-fundamental volatility into exchange rates and policy
 decisions. We show that the central bank can improve the ex ante
 effectiveness of its policy by committing to put a lower weight ex post on
 the information from the market, and that transparency may either increase
 or decrease the effectiveness of learning from the market, depending on
 how it is implemented.  Copyright 2011, Oxford University Press.

Title: Contractual Incompleteness, Unemployment, and Labour Market Segmentation 
Abstract:
 This article provides evidence that involuntary unemployment, and the
 segmentation of labour markets into firms offering "good" and "bad" jobs,
 may both arise as a consequence of contractual incompleteness. We provide
 a simple model that illustrates how unemployment and market segmentation
 may jointly emerge as part of a market equilibrium in environments where
 work effort is not third-party verifiable. Using experimental labour
 markets that differ only in the verifiability of effort, we demonstrate
 empirically that contractual incompleteness can cause unemployment and
 segmentation. Our data are also consistent with the key channels through
 which the model explains the emergence of both phenomena.  Copyright 2014, Oxford University Press.

 This paper sets out necessary and sufficient empirical conditions for
 rational intrinsic habits models in the revealed preference tradition of

 be computationally straightforward and to yield set identification for
 certain features of the model. The ideas outlined are applied to a
 microeconomic panel dataset. The addition of habit formation to the
 discounted utility model is shown to improve the rationalizability of the
 microdata considerably. Even if habit formation is rejected, it is shown
 that modest and plausible allowance for heterogeneity in prices and
 interest rates is sufficient to bring consumption behaviour into line with
 the theory.  Copyright , Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Optimal Electoral Timing: Exercise Wisely and You May Live Longer<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN1">-super-1</xref> 
Abstract:
 The timing of elections is flexible in many countries. We study this
 optimization by first creating a Bayesian learning model of a
 mean-reverting political support process. We then explore optimal
 electoral timing, modelling it as a renewable American option with
 interacting waiting and stopping values. Inter alia, we show that the
 expected longevity is a convex, then concave, function of the support.
 Finally, we calibrate our model to the post-1945 Labour-Tory U.K. rivalry.
 Our story quite well explains when the elections were called. We also show
 that election options approximately double the expected time in power in
 the current streak.  Copyright 2008, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Endogenous Group Formation via Unproductive Costs 
Abstract:
 Sacrifice is widely believed to enhance cooperation in churches, communes,
 gangs, clans, military units, and many other groups. We find that
 sacrifice can also work in the lab, apart from special ideologies,
 identities, or interactions. Our subjects play a modified VCM game--one in
 which they can voluntarily join groups that provide reduced rates of
 return on private investment. This leads to both endogenous sorting
 (because free-riders tend to reject the reduced-rate option) and
 substitution (because reduced private productivity favours increased club
 involvement). Seemingly unproductive costs thus serve to screen out
 free-riders, attract conditional cooperators, boost club production, and
 increase member welfare. The sacrifice mechanism is simple and
 particularly useful where monitoring difficulties impede punishment,
 exclusion, fees, and other more standard solutions.  Copyright 2013, Oxford University Press.

Title: Candidates, Credibility, and Re-election Incentives 
Abstract:
 I study elections between citizen-candidates who cannot make binding
 policy commitments before taking office, but who are accountable to voters
 due to the possibility of re-election. In each period a representative
 voter chooses among heterogeneous candidates with known policy
 preferences. The elected candidate chooses the policy to implement, and
 how much rent-seeking to engage in, when in office. As the voter decides
 both which candidate to elect and, subsequently, whether the candidate is
 retained, this framework integrates elements of electoral competition and
 electoral accountability. I show that, in the best stationary equilibrium,
 when utility functions are concave over policy, non-median candidates are
 elected over candidates with policy preferences more closely aligned with
 the voter. In this equilibrium, there are two candidates who are elected
 at some history, and the policies these candidates implement in office do
 not converge. This divergence incentivizes candidates to engage in less
 rent-seeking, increasing voter welfare.  Copyright 2013, Oxford University Press.

Title: Partisan Social Happiness 
Abstract:
 We use a new approach to study questions in political economy that relies
 on data on the subjective well-being of a large sample of people living in
 the OECD over the period 1975-1992. Controlling for the personal
 characteristics of the respondents, year and country fixed effects and
 country-specific time trends, we find that the data describe social
 happiness functions for left-wing and right-wing individuals where
 inflation and unemployment enter negatively. We use these functions to
 test the root assumption of partisan business cycle models. The evidence
 is consistent with the hypothesis that left-wing individuals care more
 about unemployment relative to inflation than right-wingers.
 Interestingly, we find that individuals declare themselves to be happier
 when the party they support is in power, even after controlling for
 macroeconomic variables. The effect of politics is large. Finally, we find
 that these partisan differences cannot be traced back to income
 differences. That is, it is misleading to assume&#x02014;as it is done in
 the previous literature&#x02014;that the poor (rich) behave similarly to
 the left (right). For example, inflation and unemployment do not have
 differential effects across rich and poor and the happiness levels of
 these two groups are unaffected by the identity of the party in power. Our
 findings are hard to explain using median voter models but are to be
 expected in a partisan world.  Copyright 2005, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Group Formation in Risk-Sharing Arrangements 
Abstract:
 We study informal insurance within communities, explicitly recognizing the
 possibility that subgroups of individuals may destabilize insurance
 arrangements among the larger group. We therefore consider self-enforcing
 risk-sharing agreements that are robust not only to single-person
 deviations but also to potential deviations by subgroups. However, such
 deviations must be credible, in the sense that the subgroup must pass
 exactly the same test that we apply to the entire group; it must itself
 employ some self-enforcing risk-sharing agreement. We observe that the
 stability of subgroups is inimical to the stability of the group as a
 whole. Two surprising consequences of this analysis are that stable groups
 have (uniformly) bounded size, a result in sharp contrast to the
 individual-deviation problem, and that the degree of risk-sharing in a
 community is generally non-monotonic in the level of uncertainty or need
 for insurance in the community.  Copyright 2003, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Gradualism and Irreversibility 
Abstract:
 This paper considers a class of two-player dynamic games in which each
 player controls a one-dimensional action variable, interpreted as a level
 of cooperation. The dynamics are due to an irreversibility constraint:
 neither player can ever reduce his cooperation level. Payoffs are
 decreasing in one's own action, increasing in one's opponent's action. We
 characterize efficient symmetric equilibrium action paths; actions rise
 gradually over time and converge, when payoffs are smooth, to a level
 strictly below the one-shot efficient level, no matter how little
 discounting takes place. The analysis is extended to incorporate
 sequential moves and asymmetric equilibria.  Copyright 2002, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: A Model of Money and Credit, with Application to the Credit Card Debt Puzzle 
Abstract:
 Many individuals simultaneously have significant credit card debt and
 money in the bank. The credit card debt puzzle is as follows: given high
 interest rates on credit cards and low rates on bank accounts, why not pay
 down debt? While some economists go to elaborate lengths to explain this,
 we argue it is a special case of the rate of return dominance puzzle from
 monetary economics. We extend standard monetary theory to incorporate
 consumer debt, which is interesting in its own right since developing
 models where money and credit coexist is a long-standing challenge. Our
 model is quite tractable&#x02014;for example, it readily yields nice
 existence and characterization results&#x02014;and helps put into context
 recent discussions of consumer debt.  Copyright 2008, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Slavery and Other Property Rights<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN1">-super-1</xref> 
Abstract:
 The institution of slavery is found mostly at intermediate stages of
 agricultural development and less often among hunter-gatherers and
 advanced agrarian societies. We explain this pattern in a growth model
 with land and labour as inputs in production and an endogenously
 determined property rights institution. The economy endogenously transits
 from an egalitarian state with equal property rights to a despotic slave
 society where the elite own both people and land; thereafter, it
 endogenously transits into a free labour society, where the elite own the
 land but people are free.  Copyright , Wiley-Blackwell.

 under Ambiguity", Econometrica, 73 (6), 1849--1892). The analysis uses the
 static two-asset portfolio problem with one safe asset and one uncertain
 one. While it is intuitive that more ambiguity aversion would reduce
 demand for the uncertain asset, this is not necessarily the case. We
 derive sufficient conditions for a reduction in the demand for the
 uncertain asset and for an increase in the equity premium. An example that
 meets the sufficient conditions is when the set of plausible distributions
 for returns on the uncertain asset can be ranked according to their
 monotone likelihood ratio. It is also shown how ambiguity aversion
 distorts the price kernel in the alternative portfolio problem with
 complete markets for contingent claims.  Copyright 2011, Oxford University Press.

Title: Make Trade Not War? 
Abstract:
 This paper analyses theoretically and empirically the relationship between
 military conflicts and trade. We show that the conventional wisdom that
 trade promotes peace is only partially true even in a model where trade is
 economically beneficial, military conflicts reduce trade, and leaders are
 rational. When war can occur because of the presence of asymmetric
 information, the probability of escalation is lower for countries that
 trade more bilaterally because of the opportunity cost associated with the
 loss of trade gains. However, countries more open to global trade have a
 higher probability of war because multilateral trade openness decreases
 bilateral dependence to any given country and the cost of a bilateral
 conflict. We test our predictions on a large data set of military
 conflicts on the 1950-2000 period. Using different strategies to solve the
 endogeneity issues, including instrumental variables, we find robust
 evidence for the contrasting effects of bilateral and multilateral trade
 openness. For proximate countries, we find that trade has had a
 surprisingly large effect on their probability of military conflict.  Copyright 2008, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Getting Parents Involved: A Field Experiment in Deprived Schools 
Abstract:
 This article provides evidence that schools can influence parents'
 involvement in education, and this has causal effects on pupils'
 behaviour. Furthermore, it shows how the impact of more involved parents
 on their children is amplified at the class level by peer group
 interaction. We build on a large-scale controlled experiment run in a
 French deprived educational district, where parents of middle-school
 children were invited to participate in a simple program of parent--school
 meetings on how to get better involved in their children's education. At
 the end of the school year, we find that treated families have increased
 their school-and home-based involvement activities. In turn, pupils of
 treatment classes have developed more positive behaviour and attitudes in
 school, notably in terms of truancy and disciplinary sanctions (with
 effects-size around 15% of a standard deviation). However, test scores did
 not improve under the intervention. Our results suggest that parents are
 an input for schooling policies and it is possible to influence important
 aspects of the schooling process at low cost.  Copyright 2014, Oxford University Press.

Title: The Concept of Income in a General Equilibrium 
Abstract:
 This paper derives a concept of aggregate real income for a competitive
 economy in general equilibrium consisting of heterogeneous infinitely
 lived people and relates it to current and future consumption
 possibilities. An important characteristic of our measure of income, which
 we call Real Income, is that deflation is carried out using a consumption
 deflator rather than any price index of output. We suggest that it may be
 inappropriate to regard capital gains as income. We also present a
 coherent treatment of the effects of changes to the terms of trade on Real
 Income and explain the implications of this for resource-exporting
 economies.  Copyright 2006, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Why Do Voters Dismantle Checks and Balances? 
Abstract:
 Voters often dismantle constitutional checks and balances on the
 executive. If such checks and balances limit presidential abuses of power
 and rents, why do voters support their removal? We argue that by reducing
 politician rents, checks and balances also make it cheaper to bribe or
 influence politicians through non-electoral means. In weakly
 institutionalized polities where such non-electoral influences,
 particularly by the better organized elite, are a major concern, voters
 may prefer a political system without checks and balances as a way of
 insulating politicians from these influences. When they do so, they are
 effectively accepting a certain amount of politician (presidential) rents
 in return for redistribution. We show that checks and balances are less
 likely to emerge when the elite is better organized and is more likely to
 be able to influence or bribe politicians, and when inequality and
 potential taxes are high (which makes redistribution more valuable to the
 majority). We also provide case study evidence from Bolivia, Ecuador, and
 Venezuela consistent with the model.  Copyright 2013, Oxford University Press.

Title: Strategic Communication Networks 
Abstract:
 We consider situations in which every agent would like to take an action
 that is coordinated with those of others, as well as close to a common
 state of nature, with the ideal proximity to that state varying across
 agents. Before this coordination game is played, agents decide to whom
 they reveal their private information about the state. The information
 transmission occurring in the cheap-talk communication stage is
 characterized by a strategic communication network whose links represent
 truthful information transmission. In equilibrium, whether communication
 takes place between two agents depends not only on the conflict of
 interest between these agents, but also on the number and preferences of
 the other agents with whom they communicate. In particular, communication
 to a large group of recipients may be feasible even though communication
 to a small subset of that group may not be. We show that agents who are
 more central in terms of preference tend to communicate more and to have a
 greater impact on decisions.  Copyright , Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: The Effects of Health, Wealth, and Wages on Labour Supply and Retirement Behaviour 
Abstract:
 This paper estimates a life cycle model of labour supply, retirement, and
 savings behaviour in which future health status and wages are uncertain.
 Individuals face a fixed cost of work and cannot borrow against future
 labour, pension, or Social Security income. The method of simulated
 moments is used to match the life cycle profiles of labour force
 participation, hours worked, and assets that are estimated from the data
 to those that are generated by the model. The model establishes that the
 tax structure of the Social Security system and pensions are key
 determinants of the high observed job exit rates at ages 62 and 65.
 Removing the tax wedge embedded in the Social Security earnings test for
 individuals aged 65 and older would delay job exit by almost one year. By
 contrast, Social Security benefit levels, health, and borrowing
 constraints are less important determinants of job exit at older ages. For
 example, reducing Social Security benefits by 20% would cause workers to
 delay exit from the labour force by only three months.  Copyright 2005, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Inattentive Producers 
Abstract:
 I present and solve the problem of a producer who faces costs of
 acquiring, absorbing, and processing information. I establish a series of
 theoretical results describing the producer's behaviour. First, I find the
 conditions under which the producer prefers to set a plan for the price he
 or she charges, or instead prefers to set a plan for the quantity he or
 she sells. Second, I show that the agent rationally chooses to be
 inattentive to news, only sporadically updating his or her information. I
 solve for the optimal length of inattentiveness and characterize its
 determinants. Third, I explicitly aggregate the behaviour of many such
 producers. I apply these results to a model of inflation. I find that the
 model can fit the quantitative facts on post-war inflation remarkably
 well, that it is a good forecaster of future inflation, and that it
 survives the Lucas critique by fitting also the pre-war facts on inflation
 moderately well.  Copyright 2006, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Taxation and Household Labour Supply 
Abstract:
 We evaluate reforms to the U.S. tax system in a life cycle set-up with
 heterogeneous married and single households and with an operative
 extensive margin in labour supply. We restrict our model with observations
 on gender and skill premia, labour-force participation of married females
 across skill groups, children, and the structure of marital sorting. We
 concentrate on two revenue-neutral tax reforms: a proportional income tax
 and a reform in which married individuals file taxes separately (separate
 filing). Our findings indicate that tax reforms are accompanied by large
 increases in labour supply that differ across demographic groups, with the
 bulk of the increase coming from married females. Under a proportional
 income tax reform, married females account for more than 50% of the
 changes in hours across steady states, while under separate filing reform,
 married females account for all the change in hours.  Copyright , Oxford University Press.

Title: Thinking Ahead: The Decision Problem 
Abstract:
 We propose a model of costly decision making based on time-costs of
 deliberating current and future decisions. We model an individual
 decision-maker's thinking process as a thought-experiment that takes time,
 and lets the decision maker 'think ahead' about future decision problems
 in yet unrealized states of nature. By formulating an intertemporal,
 state-contingent, planning problem which may involve costly deliberation
 in every state of nature, and by letting the decision maker deliberate
 ahead of the realization of a state, we attempt to capture the basic
 observation that individuals generally do not think through a complete
 action plan. Instead, individuals prioritize their thinking and leave
 deliberations on less important decisions to the time or event when they
 arise.  Copyright 2009, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Labour Market Regulations and the Sectoral Reallocation of Workers: The Case of Trade Reforms 
Abstract:
 In this paper I highlight the importance of incorporating the
 institutional features of local labour markets into the analysis of trade
 reforms. A trade reform is often deemed beneficial because the elimination
 of trade barriers allows labour to reallocate towards those sectors in the
 economy in which the country has a comparative advantage. The amount and
 speed of the reallocation, however, and the post-reform behaviour of
 output, productivity and welfare, will depend on how regulated the labour
 market is. First, I document that high firing costs slow down the
 intersectoral reallocation of labour after a trade reform. Second, in
 order to isolate the effect of firing costs on labour reallocation, output
 and welfare after a trade reform, I build a dynamic general equilibrium
 model. I find that if a country does not liberalize its labour market at
 the outset of its trade reform, the intersectoral reallocation of workers
 will be 30% slower, and as much as 30% of the gains in real output and
 labour productivity in the years following the trade reform will be lost.
 From a policy standpoint, the message is that while trade reforms are
 desirable, they need to be complemented by labour market reforms in order
 to be fully successful.  Copyright 2009, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Efficient Allocations in Dynamic Private Information Economies with Persistent Shocks: A First-Order Approach 
Abstract:
 This article studies efficient allocations in a dynamic private
 information economy with a continuum of idiosyncratic shocks that are
 persistent. I develop a first-order approach for this environment and show
 that the problem has a simple recursive structure that relies on only a
 small number of state variables, making the problem tractable. I find
 sufficient conditions that guarantee that the first-order approach is
 valid. To illustrate the first-order approach I numerically compute the
 efficient allocations in a Mirrleesean economy with productivity shocks
 that follow a random walk and verify the validity of the first-order
 approach. I show that persistent shocks create a new trade-off where the
 social planner decreases the informational rent of the agent today at the
 cost of providing higher insurance in the future.  Copyright 2013, Oxford University Press.

Title: A Pure Theory of Job Security and Labour Income Risk 
Abstract:
 Models of labour market equilibrium where forward-looking decisions
 maximize both profits and labour income on a risk-neutral basis offer
 valuable insights into the effects of employment protection legislation.
 Since risk-neutral behaviour in the labour market presumes perfect
 insurance, however, job security provisions plays no useful role in such
 models. This paper studies a stylized model of dynamic labour market
 interactions where labour reallocation costs are partly financed by
 uninsured workers' consumption flows. In the resulting second-best
 equilibrium, provisions that shift labour reallocation costs to
 risk-neutral employers can increase productive efficiency if their
 administrative dead-weight costs are not too large, and increase workers'
 welfare as long as employers' firing costs at least partly finance
 workers' mobility.  Copyright 2004, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Escaping Nash Inflation 
Abstract:
 An ordinary differential equation (ODE) gives the mean dynamics that
 govern the convergence to self-confirming equilibria of self-referential
 systems under discounted least squares learning. Another ODE governs
 escape dynamics that recurrently propel away from a selfconfirming
 equilibrium. In a model with a unique self-confirming equilibrium, the
 escape dynamics make the government discover too strong a version of the
 natural rate hypothesis. The escape route dynamics cause recurrent
 outcomes close to the Ramsey (commitment) inflation rate in a model with
 an adaptive government.&#x201C;If an unlikely event occurs, it is very
 likely to occur in the most likly way.&#x201D;Michael Harrison  Copyright 2002, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Strategic Voting over Strategic Proposals 
Abstract:
 Prior research on "strategic voting" has reached the conclusion that
 unanimity rule is uniquely bad: it results in destruction of information,
 and hence makes voters worse off. We show that this conclusion depends
 critically on the assumption that the issue being voted on is exogenous,
 that is, independent of the voting rule used. We depart from the existing
 literature by endogenizing the proposal that is put to a vote, and
 establish that under many circumstances unanimity rule makes voters better
 off. Moreover, in some cases unanimity rule also makes the proposer better
 off, even when he has diametrically opposing preferences. In this case,
 unanimity is the Pareto dominant voting rule. Voters prefer unanimity rule
 because it induces the proposing individual to make a more attractive
 proposal. The proposing individual prefers unanimity rule because the
 acceptance probabilities for moderate proposals are higher. We apply our
 results to jury trials and debt restructuring.  Copyright , Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Undescribable Events 
Abstract:
 We develop a model of undescribable events. Examples of events that are
 well understood by economic agents but are prohibitively difficult to
 describe in advance abound in real life. This notion has also pervaded a
 substantial amount of economic literature. Undescribable events in our
 model are understood by economic agents-their consequences and
 probabilities are known-but are such that every finite description
 of such events necessarily leaves out relevant features that have a
 non-negligible impact on the parties' expected utilities. We illustrate
 our results using a simple coinsurance problem as a backdrop. When the
 only uncertainty faced by the two agents is an undescribable event the
 optimal finite coinsurance contract is no contract at all.  Copyright 2006, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Pay-as-you-go Social Security and the Distribution of Altruistic Transfers 
Abstract:
 This paper studies the impact of an unfunded social security system on the
 distribution of altruistic transfers in a framework where savings are due
 to both life cycle and random altruistic motivations. We show that the
 effect of social security on the distribution of these transfers depends
 crucially on the strength of the bequest motive in explaining savings
 behaviour. We measure this strength by the expected weight that
 individuals attach to the utility of future generations. On the one hand,
 if the bequest motive is strong, then an increase in the social security
 tax raises the bequests left by altruistic parents. On the other hand,
 when the importance of altruism in motivating savings is sufficiently low,
 the increase in the social security tax could result in a reduction of the
 bequests left by altruistic parents under some conditions on the attitude
 of individuals toward risk and on the relative returns associated with
 private saving and social security. Some implications concerning the
 transitional effects of introducing an unfunded social security scheme are
 also discussed.  Copyright 2003, Wiley-Blackwell.

Title: Gender Interactions within Hierarchies: Evidence from the Political Arena 
Abstract:
 This paper studies gender interactions within hierarchical organizations
 using a large data set on the duration of Italian municipal governments
 elected between 1993 and 2003. A municipal government can be viewed as a
 hierarchy, whose stability over time depends on the degree of cooperation
 between and within ranks. We find that in municipalities headed by female
 mayors, the probability of early termination of the legislature is higher.
 This result persists and becomes stronger when we control for municipality
 fixed effects as well as for non-random sorting of women into
 municipalities using regression discontinuity in gender-mixed electoral
 races decided by a narrow margin. The likelihood that a female mayor
 survives until the end of her term is lowest when the council is entirely
 male and in regions with less favourable attitudes towards working women.
 This evidence is suggestive that group dynamics are an important factor in
 driving the gender difference. Other interpretations receive less support
 in the data. Our results may provide an alternative explanation for the
 underrepresentation of women in leadership positions.  Copyright , Oxford University Press.
