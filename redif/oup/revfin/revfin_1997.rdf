Title: Is Mean-Variance Analysis Vacuous: Or was Beta Still Born?
Abstract: We show in any economy trading options, with investors having mean-variance preferences, that there are arbitrage opportunities resulting from negative prices for out of the money call options. The theoretical implication of this inconsistency is that mean-variance analysis is vacuous. The practical implications of this inconsistency are investigated by developing an option pricing model for a CAPM type economy. It is observed that negative call prices begin to appear at strikes that are two standard deviations out of the money. Such out-of-the money options often trade. For near money options, the CAPM option pricing model is shown to permit estimation of the mean return on the underlying asset, its volatility and the length of the planning horizon. The model is estimated on S&amp;P 500 futures options data covering the period January 1992–September 1994. It is found that the mean rate of return though positive, is poorly identified. The estimates for the volatility are stable and average 11%, while those for the planning horizon average 0.95. The hypothesis that the planning horizon is a year can not be rejected. The one parameter Black–Scholes model also marginally outperforms the three parameter CAPM model with average percentage errors being respectively, 3.74% and 4.5%. This out performance of the Black–Scholes model is taken as evidence consistent with the mean-variance analysis being vacuous in a practical sense as well.

Title: Warrants on the London Stock Exchange: Pricing Biases and Investor Confusion
Abstract: This study of warrants on the London Stock Exchange examines whether they display particular pricing biases and whether investors understand how to value them at the time of issue. In a sample of 72 warrants on closed-end funds (investment trusts) over the 1985–94 period, more than one third of the 12,673 prices are anomalously low. The other two thirds behave like stock options, with lower volatility when they are in-the-money or have a long time until maturity. Despite their frequent undervaluation, it is rational to add warrants to a new equity issue. An examination of 127 new equity issues (95 with warrants) reveals that attaching warrants significantly increases market value. The reason for this appears to be investor confusion: they do not seem to understand that the more the warrants are worth, the less the value of the ordinary shares.

Title: The Effect of Illegal Insider Trading on Takeover Premia
Abstract: This paper empirically investigates whether illegal insider trading increases the premium a bidder pays for a target. Illegal insider trading is trading by traditional corporate insiders, as well as others in a position of trust and confidence (e.g. investment bankers, lawyers), based on material, non-public information (‘inside information’). The paper examines the premia of takeovers with known illegal insider trading and compares them to a control sample of takeovers matched by industry, time period, and size that do not have detected illegal insider trading. After controlling for differences in merger characteristics, such as number of bidders, type of offer, form of payment, etc., we find that takeovers with detected illegal insider trading have takeover premia which are approximately 10 percentage points, or almost one-third, higher than the control sample. We conduct additional tests in an attempt to determine the direction of causality between illegal insider trading and takeover premia size and explore the effect of potential detection bias. The results suggest both that illegal inside traders base their trades on factors other than premia size, and that illegal insider trading in takeovers with large premia is not necessarily more likely to be detected. Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that the illegal insider trading itself tends to create larger takeover premia.

Title: Two Closed-Form Formulas for the Futures Price in the Presence of a Quality Option
Abstract: The paper derives closed-form formulas for the futures price in the presence of a multi-asset quality option. This is done for two cases: In the first one the underlying assets are zero coupon bonds with different maturities in the single-factor Vasicek model. In the second one these are commodities in a multi-factor setting, again with Vasicek interest rate uncertainty.

Title: The Dynamics of Short-Term Interest Rate Volatility Reconsidered
Abstract: In this paper we present and estimate a model of short-term interest rate volatility that encompasses both the level effect of Chan, Karolyi, Longstaff and Sanders (1992) and the conditional heteroskedasticity effect of the GARCH class of models. This flexible specification allows different effects to dominate as the level of the interest rate varies. We also investigate implications for the pricing of bond options. Our findings indicate that the inclusion of a volatility effect reduces the estimate of the level effect, and has option implications that differ significantly from the Chan, Karolyi, Longstaff and Sanders (1992) model.

Title: Monitoring, Implicit Contracting, and the Lack of Permanence of Leveraged Buyouts
Abstract: We present a possible explanation for the lack of permanence of the very high levels of concentration of ownership that accompany leveraged buyouts. We first argue that some diffusion of ownership can be beneficial to the shareholders of a firm by encouraging the employees of the firm to enter into implicit contracts with the firm. The level of concentration of ownership that maximizes firm value is therefore that which trades off the well-known gains from monitoring with the gains from implicit contracting. We then argue that, in the process of concentrating the ownership of a firm that has excessively diffuse ownership to a level that maximizes firm value, investors in leveraged buyouts will choose an initial level of concentration of ownership that is very high. They will do so in order to put pressure on managers to breach existing implicit contracts. Following the breach of these contracts, investors will decrease the level of concentration of ownership to the level that maximizes firm value. There will be no further breach of implicit contracts, for such breach is incidental to the transformation of the firm from one that has excessively diffuse ownership to one that has the optimal level of diffusion of ownership. No change in the concentration of ownership therefore occurs once the level of diffusion of ownership that maximizes firm value has been attained. JEL Classification: G30.

Title: Matching Organizational Structure with Firm Attributes: A Study of Master Limited Partnerships
Abstract: To create value and reduce agency costs, firms adopt available organizational structures that match their attributes. This paper studies the characteristics of firms that choose to become master limited partnerships (MLPs). The MLP sample is dominated by firms in low-growth industries that have highly focused operations and superior profitability compared to their industry peers. After becoming an MLP, sample firms reduce capital expenditures and increase cash distributions, taking advantage of their focus, profitability, and status as non-taxable entities. A subsample of MLPs subsequently change back to corporate form. After becoming corporations, these firms reverse course by cutting cash distributions and increasing capital spending. This cycle demonstrates how firms restructure to adopt organizational forms that best fit their needs.

Title: Corporate Restructuring in Response to Performance Decline: Impact of Ownership, Governance and Lenders
Abstract: Firms in performance decline may choose a variety of restructuring strategies for recovery with conflicting welfare implications for different stakeholders such as shareholders, lenders and managers. Choice of recovery strategies is therefore determined by the complex interplay of ownership structure, corporate governance and lender monitoring of such firms. For a sample of 297 U.K. firms experiencing relative stock return decline during 1987–93, we examine the impact of these factors as well as other control factors on their turnaround strategies. Strategy choices during the decline year and two post-decline years are modelled with logit regressions. Our results show that turnaround strategy choices are significantly influenced by both agency and control variables. While there is agreement among stakeholders on certain strategies there is also evidence of conflict of interests among them. Thereis further evidence of shifting coalitions of stakeholders for or against certain strategies.

Title: Top Management Compensation and the Structure of the Board of Directors in Commercial Banks
Abstract: We examine the relationship between top management compensation and the structure of the board of directors for a sample of commercial banks. We find that boards with more reputable outside directors compensate managers more heavily with long-term incentives (stock and stock options) than with cash (salary and bonus). We also find a significant positive correlation between the future performance of our sample banks and the proportion of their managers’ compensation in the form of long-term incentives. Taken together, these results suggest that boards with highly reputed outside directors are more effective in providing managers with the appropriate incentives and thus ensuring better future firm performance. Another indication of the effectiveness of these boards is our finding that they compensate managers more heavily with long-term incentives (instead of cash) when these managers are more entrenched. We also find very little evidence of mutually beneficial back-scratching or collusion between outside directors and senior managers when setting management compensation. But boards with long-serving outside directors are less effective in creating appropriate management incentives.

Title: Determinants of Intercorporate Shareholdings
Abstract: This paper examines why firms choose to spend resources on acquiring ownership rights in other firms. Based on a unique data base of every individual intercorporate shareholding on the Oslo Stock Exchange during the period 1980–1994, we find that such investments serve at least three functions. First, they play a role incorporate governance, as managers in firms with low insider holdings, diffuse ownership structure and high free cash flow tend to mutually acquire equity stakes in each other, possibly in a collective attempt to protect their human capital in the market for corporate control. Second, interfirm equity holdings serve as financial slack for growing firms, reducing potential adverse selection costs by providing an internal funding source for new investments in long-term assets. Finally, our findings also suggest that intercorporate shareholdings are an integrated part of the investor’s cash flow management system by being a liquidity buffer when cash inflows and cash outflows are non-synchronous.
