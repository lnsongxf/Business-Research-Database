Title: Learning about Risk: Some Lessons from Insurance
Abstract: This paper argues that in the fundamental subject of financial risk analysis, some valuable lessons may be drawn from insurance. The probability of ruin, defined as a first passage time, carries a dynamic element whose absence in Value at Risk is one liability, among others. Extreme value theory, which has been successfully applied to insurance shortly after it was introduced in probability, may offer a coherent framework for analyzing the extreme moves such as the ones observed in recent foreign exchange and financial crises. Lastly, we show that the genuine hazards generated by global capital markets and illustrated by the events of summer 1998, generate a market incompleteness that existing models of defaultable bonds do not fully address. In contrast, the long experience of risk premium analysis in the insurance and reinsurance industry, as well as the existence of historical data on natural disasters, render the valuation of catastrophe bonds less perilous than that of defaultable bonds.

Title: Bank Capital Standards for Market Risk: A Welfare Analysis
Abstract: We propose a simple model that is suitable for evaluating alternative bank capital regulatory proposals for market risk. Our model formalizes the conflict between bank objectives and regulatory goals. Banks' decisions represent a tension between their desire to exploit the deposit-insurance put option and their desire to preserve franchise value. Regulators seek to balance the social value of deposits in mediating transactions against the deadweight costs of failure resolution. Our social welfare criterion is standard: a weighted average agents' utilities. We demonstrate that banks do not incrementally alter their portfolio risk as the economic environment changes. Rather, banks either choose the minimal feasible risk or the maximal feasible risk. This pattern, in turn, drives regulatory decisions: The first goal of the regulator is to induce banks to choose the minimal risk level. For all nontrivial cases, unregulated banks fail to choose the first-best allocations. Traditional ex-ante capital requirements can induce banks to choose the socially-optimal level of portfolio risk, but the required capital is often inefficiently high. In contrast, variants of the Federal Reserve Board's precommitment proposal imply far smaller efficiency losses, and achieve allocations at or nearthe first-best for most reasonable model specifications. The ex-post penalties required for the optimal implementation of precommitment are not excessively large. The welfare gains from precommitment are even higher when the precommitment penalty function is precluded from sending banks into default. We conclude that state-contingent regulatory mechanisms, of which the precommitment approach is an example, offer the possibility of substantial gains in regulatory efficiency, relative to traditional state non-contingent regulation.

Title: Non-Linear Value-at-Risk
Abstract: Value-at-risk methods which employ a linear ("delta only") approximation to the relation between instrument values and the underlying risk factors are unlikely to be robust when applied to portfolios containing non-linear contracts such as options. The most widely used alternative to the delta-only approach involves revaluing each contract for a large number of simulated values of the underlying factors. In this paper we explore an alternative approach which uses a quadratic approximation to the relation between asset values and the risk factors. This method (i) is likely to be better adapted than the linear method to the problem of assessing risk in portfolios containing non-linear assets, (ii) is less computationally intensive than simulation using full-revaluation and (iii) in common with the delta-only method, operates at the level of portfolio characteristics (deltas and gammas) rather than individual instruments.

Title: Corporate Hedging: The Relevance of Contract Specifications and Banking Relationships
Abstract: This article examines the contribution of hedging to firm value and the cost of hedging in a unified framework. Optimal hedging and firm value are explicitly linked to firm risk, the type of debt covenants and the relative priority of the hedging contract. It is shown that in some cases hedging is possible only if the counterparty to the forward contract also holds a significant portion of the debt. Also, the spread in the hedging contract reduces the optimal amount of hedging to less than the minimum-variance hedge ratio. Among other results this article elucidates why some firms hedge using forward contracts while other firms hedge in the futures markets, as well as why higher priority forward contracts are more efficient hedging vehicles.

Title: Corporate Risk Management for Multinational Corporations: Financial and Operational Hedging Policies
Abstract: Under what conditions will a multinational corporation alter its operations to manage its risk exposure? We show that multinational firms will engage in operational hedging only when both exchange rate uncertainty and demand uncertainty are present. Operational hedging is less important for managing short-term exposures, since demand uncertainty is lower in the short term. Operational hedging is also less important for commodity-based firms, which face price but not quantity uncertainty. When the fixed costs of establishing a plant are low or the variability of the exchange rate is high, a firm may benefit from establishing plants in both the domestic and foreign location. Capacity allocated to the foreign location relative to the domestic location will increase when the variability of foreign demand increases relative to the variability of domestic demand or when the expected profit margin is larger. For firms with plants in both a domestic and foreign location, the foreign currency cash flow generally will not be independent of the exchange rate and consequently the optimal financial hedging policy cannot be implemented with forward contracts alone. We show that the optimal financial hedging policy can be implemented using foreign currency call and put options and forward contracts.

Title: Capital Structure, Information Acquisition and Investment Decisions in an Industry Framework
Abstract: This paper analyzes the relationship between a firm's capital structure and its information acquisition prior to capital budgeting decisions. It is found that low-growth industries can sustain a large number of levered firms. In these industries, leverage is negatively related to a firm's incentive to acquire information during the capital budgeting process. In contrast, high-growth industries only sustain a small number of levered firms. In these industries, levered firms acquire more information than all-equity financed firms. The model yields empirical predictions regarding the effects of leverage on the expected amount and the volatility of corporate investment.While leverage does not affect firm value, highly levered firms generate a more volatile cash flow than firms with low debt levels.

Title: Security Design, Insider Monitoring, and Financial Market Equilibrium
Abstract: This paper considers a problem of security design in the presence of monitoring done by a large investor to discipline the management of a firm. Since the large investor enjoys only part of the benefits generated by her monitoring activities but incurs all the associated costs, the design and amount of security need to be structured so as to motivate her to maintain an efficient level of monitoring, if no other mechanism exists to make her commit to specific levels of monitoring in advance. By assuming that the large investor takes account of the effect of the issued amount of security on the revenues received, we show that the optimal security is a debt-like security such as standard debt with a positive probability of default, or debt with call options. We also verify that the financial market equilibrium is constrained Pareto optimal. JEL classification codes: D82, G10, G30, G32.

Title: The Predictive Power of the French Market Volatility Index: A Multi Horizons Study
Abstract: The main purpose of this paper is to examine empirically the time series properties of the French Market Volatility Index (VX1). We also examine the VX1's ability to forecast future realized market volatility and finds a strong relationship. More importantly, we show how the index can be used to generate volatility forecasts over different horizons and that these forecasts are reasonably accurate predictors of future realized volatility.

Title: A Model for Studying the Effect of EMU on European Yield Curves
Abstract: In January 1999, the European monetary union (EMU) was formally launched with 11 member countries. However, before May 1998 there was considerable uncertainty about who would join EMU, and whether the project would start on time. When a monetary union is formed, exchange rates between the member countries are irrevocably fixed, and yield spreads stemming from exchange-rate risk are eliminated. As a direct consequence, EMU affected the prices of long-term bonds well before 1999, but quantifying this effect can be difficult when there is uncertainty about the monetary union. We address these issues and develop a bond-pricing model which explicitly takes into account that a country may join a monetary union at a future, unspecified date. The empirical results show that a narrow EMU, consisting of Germany, France and the Benelux countries, has been priced with almost 100% probability throughout the period 1995—1998, whereas, on average, the implied probability of joining EMU has been somewhat lower for the other EU countries. However, in the period leading up to May 1998, the estimated probabilities have increased considerably for the countries that joined EMU in January 1999. JEL classification codes: G12, G13, F36.

Title: The Market for Corporate Control and the Agency Paradigm
Abstract: The paper analyzes the role of agency driven takeover activity. The analysis shows that takeovers can play an important role in reducing agency costs even though the gains from the corporate restructuring that follows the takeovers are zero, which counters existing models of agency driven takeover activity. The model can therefore form the basis for deriving empirical predictions which discriminate between the "agency paradigm" and the "corporate restructuring paradigm" of takeover activity. Negative post-merger performance (Agrawal et al., 1992), which is inconsistent with corporate restructuring is consistent with this model, and that takeover target's investment levels are below or at the average (Servaes 1994), which is inconsistent with the free cash flow theory is also consistent with this model.

Title: Stochastic Volatility With an Ornstein–Uhlenbeck Process: An Extension
Abstract: In this paper, we reexamine and extend the stochastic volatility model of Stein and Stein (S&amp;S) (1991) where volatility follows a mean–reverting Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process. Using Fourier inversion techniques we are able to allow for correlation between instantaneous volatilities and the underlying stock returns. A closed-form pricing solution for European options is derived and some numerical examples are given. In addition, we discuss the boundary behaviour of the instantaneous volatility at v(t) = 0 and show that S&amp;S do not work with an absolute value process of volatility. JEL Classification: G13

Title: When are Options Overpriced? The Black—Scholes Model and Alternative Characterisations of the Pricing Kernel
Abstract: An important determinant of option prices is the elasticity of the pricing kernel used to price all claims in the economy. In this paper, we first show that for a given forward price of the underlying asset, option prices are higher when the elasticity of the pricing kernel is declining than when it is constant. We then investigate the implications of the elasticity of the pricing kernel for the stochastic process followed by the underlying asset. Given that the underlying information process follows a geometric Brownian motion, we demonstrate that constant elasticity of the pricing kernel is equivalent to a Brownian motion for the forward price of the underlying asset, so that the Black–Scholes formula correctly prices options on the asset. In contrast, declining elasticity implies that the forward price process is no longer a Brownian motion: it has higher volatility and exhibits autocorrelation. In this case, the Black–Scholes formula underprices all options.

Title: Are Investors Sensitive to the Quality and the Disclosure of Financial Statements?
Abstract: This paper investigates the influence of Swiss firms' disclosure policy and of their financial analysts' coverage on stock price abnormal reactions to the publication of the annual reports. It first shows that, after controlling for the number of analysts, the absolute abnormal returns are significantly and positively affected by the rating measure used as a proxy of the informational quality of annual reports. It furthermore emphasises asymmetry in the relationship between stock price abnormal reactions and two informational variables, namely the quality of the firm's disclosure policy and its financial analysts' coverage. It appears that while positive abnormal returns are significantly and positively related to the rating variable, negative abnormal returns are only affected by the number of financial analysts. The inverse relationship between abnormal negative returns and the financial analysts' coverage supports the fact that competition among analysts reduces investors' adverse selection problem. Finally, the study evidences a non-linear relationship between rating and positive abnormal returns which is meaningful for the "good" and "very good type" firms and thus emphasises the signaling role played by a firm's financial disclosure policy.

Title: The Predictability of Short-Horizon Stock Returns
Abstract: This examines the predictability of short-horizon stock returns in the UK. We show that the subsequent return reversal of previous extreme performers is unlikely to be caused by either lead-lag effects or inventory imbalances, the most likely explanation being market overreaction. A market or trading based explanation is reinforced by the finding that these return reversals are asymmetric, being less significant after bad news. Further, we find that the lower transacting stocks exhibit the stronger return reversals, in direct contrast to both the existing US evidence and the implication that liquidity effects can explain the return reversals.

Title: The Vouchers Privatization Process as a Price Discovery Mechanism
Abstract: The privatization process through which governments transfer their holdings vary from one country to another. The coupon (or voucher) privatization process, which has been frequently utilized in Eastern Europe, is generally characterized by a transfer of government holdings to the public for less than their full economic value. The vouchers process in the Czech Republic, specifically, is a case in which the transfer was practically free and in which foreign participation was banned. As such, and in the absence of an actual flow of funds, the process constituted an interesting large-scale experiment of a price discovery mechanism whose empirical conclusions are inconclusive. On the one hand, the variance of the expected outcomes declines during this process, but on the other hand, the participants could obtain superior outcomes using public information, while some, who had access to private information, may performed even better. Thus, wondering whether the process in the Czech Republic served as an efficient price discovery mechanism, additional potential distortions should be investigated: (i) the specific rules of the process through which the public exchanged bidding points for shares, or (ii) the role that funds' managers played, in lieu of the potential conflict between their objective functions and those of the shareholders of these funds, and (iii) lack of uniformity in information reporting standards. Generally, a failure to discover prices may lead to inefficiency in capital markets, because of the potential distortion of relative prices. If, in fact, the process in the Czech Republic, during the ‘second wave’, in which most of the shares of over 800 companies were transferred to the private sector, did not serve as an immediate price discovery mechanism, the ‘damage’, if any, was probably not significant, since it was not associated with a massive reallocation of funds, and the market could eventually correct itself once real funds started to pour in, in reaction to post-process relative prices.

Title: Asset Pricing Specification Errors and Performance Evaluation
Abstract: Many evaluation techniques typically measure performance as deviations of average returns on actively managed funds from those predicted by some asset pricing model. Empirical evidence, however, has so far suggested that all asset pricing models lack empirical support, implying that the models contain mis-specification errors to various degrees. Evaluating mutual fund performance relative to any of these models thus becomes problematic. In this paper, we propose an approach to performance measurement that emphasizes minimizing explicitly the pricing error associated with an asset pricing function which is employed to compute performance measures. This approach is henceforth called the minimum specification-error (MSE) method. We also discuss the statistical properties for implementing MSE performance measure. To demonstrate the significance of the pricing error confounded in evaluation measurement, we contrast our methodology with the Grinblatt and Titman (1989) period weighting approach and with the empirical implementation of Chen and Knez (1996). We find that the greater the pricing error of passive assets, the larger the performance measures. Given the average pricing error generated from a collection of 163 diverse passive portfolios used in this analysis the performance values assigned to a large number of the funds become statistically and economically insignificant.

Title: Index Option Pricing Models with Stochastic Volatility and Stochastic Interest Rates
Abstract: This paper specifies a multivariate stochastic volatility (SV) model for the S&amp;P500 index and spot interest rate processes. We first estimate the multivariate SV model via the efficient method of moments (EMM) technique based on observations of underlying state variables, and then investigate the respective effects of stochastic interest rates, stochastic volatility, and asymmetric S&amp;P500 index returns on option prices. We compute option prices using both reprojected underlying historical volatilities and the implied risk premium of stochastic volatility to gauge each model's performance through direct comparison with observed market option prices on the index. Our major empirical findings are summarized as follows. First, while allowing for stochastic volatilitycan reduce the pricing errors and allowing for asymmetric volatility or "leverage effect" does help to explain the skewness of the volatility "smile", allowing for stochastic interest rates has minimal impact on option prices in our case. Second, similar to Melino and Turnbull (1990), our empirical findings strongly suggest the existence of a non-zero risk premium for stochastic volatility of asset returns. Based on the implied volatility risk premium, the SV models can largely reduce the option pricing errors, suggesting the importance of incorporating the information from the options market in pricing options. Finally, both the model diagnostics and option pricing errors in our study suggest that the Gaussian SV model is not sufficient in modeling short-term kurtosis of asset returns, an SV model with fatter-tailed noise or jump component may have better explanatory power.

Title: Valuation of Barrier Options in a Black–Scholes Setup with Jump Risk
Abstract: This paper discusses the pitfalls in the pricing of barrier options using approximations of the underlying continuous processes via discrete lattice models. To prevent from numerical deficiencies, the space axis is discretized first, and not the time axis. In a Black–Scholes setup, models with improved convergence properties are constructed: a trinomial model and a randomized trinomial model where price changes occur at the jump times of a Poisson process. These lattice models are sufficiently general to handle options with multiple barriers: the numerical difficulties are resolved and extrapolation yields even more accurate results. In a last step, we extend the Black–Scholes setup and incorporate unpredictable discontinuous price movements. The randomized trinomial model can easily be extended to this case, inheriting its superior convergence properties. JEL classification: C63, G12, G13.

Title: The Valuation of Contingent Claims under Portfolio Constraints: Reservation Buying and Selling Prices
Abstract: With constrained portfolios contingent claims do not generally have a unique price that rules out arbitrage opportunities. Earlier studies have demonstrated that when there are constraints onthe hedge portfolio, a no-arbitrage price interval for any contingent claim exists. I consider the more realistic case where the constraints are imposed on the total portfolio of each investor and define reservation buying and selling prices for contingent claims. I derive properties of these prices, show how they can be computed numerically, and study two simple examples in which the reservation prices and the corresponding hedging strategies are compared to the Black–Scholes setting.
