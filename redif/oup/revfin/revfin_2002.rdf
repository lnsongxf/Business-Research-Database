Title: Optimal Decision-Making with Time Diversification
Abstract: One of the most enduring topics in financial theory is the persistence of investment risk across time. Traditional finance lacks methods for considering and hedging non-diversifiable risks. This paper is based on the general equilibrium model of Allen and Gale (1997). We extend their model in various directions: the intermediary is a firm and not a planner, financial markets are assumed to be incomplete, and the mechanism of intergenerational risk-sharing is endogenously determined. Our model allows for the analysis of optimal behavior of individuals and the intermediary together with the respective feedback processes. JEL classification codes: G10, G20, D91

Title: The Disciplining Role of Leverage in Dutch Firms
Abstract: In this study we investigate the role of leverage in disciplining overinvestment problems. We measure the relationships between leverage, Tobin's q and corporate governance characteristics for Dutch listed firms. Besides, our empirical analysis tests for determinants of leverage from tax and bankruptcy theories. Representing growth opportunities, q is expected to be an agency-based determinant of leverage. Simultaneously,q represents firm value, which is determined by leverage and governance structures. We tes a structural equations model in which we deal with this simultaneous nature of the relation between leverage and q. Our results indicate that Dutch managers avoid the disciplining role of debt, when they are most likely to overinvest. Leverage is mainly determined by tax advantages and bankruptcy costs. In addition, we test the impact of leverage on excess investment.We do not find a difference in the influence of leverage on investment between potential overinvestors and other firms. This confirms that the disciplinary role of leverage in Dutch firms is absent. JEL classification code: G32

Title: Endogenous Managerial Incentives and the Optimal Combination of Debt and Dividend Commitments
Abstract: This paper studies the optimal combination of debt and dividend commitments in an agency model of the firm. Financial policy is relevant because ex-post information asymmetryrequires managerial rewards to depend on the ability to meet financial commitments. If perquisite or inside information problems exist in isolation, debt-based incentives as assumed inprevious studies result endogenously. If the problems exist simultaneously, dividends can beoptimal even when they appear excessively costly as a signal and unduly lenient as a disciplining device. The reason is that the set of dynamically consistent rewards increases when debt commitments are augmented with dividend commitments, and a larger set of ex-post rewards is more valuable as ex-ante decisions become more complex.

Title: The Interest Rate Exposure of Nonfinancial Corporations
Abstract: Many interest rates are as volatile as exchange rates and thus represent an equally important source of risk for corporations. While this is true not only for financial institutions, but for other corporations as well, little is known about the interest rateexposure of nonfinancial firms. Consequently, this paper investigates the impact of interest rate risk on a large sample of nonfinancial corporations. It presents empirical evidence for the existence of linear and nonlinear exposures with regard to movements invarious interest rate variables. The interest rate exposure is empirically determinedbymeasures of firm liquidity, but not by financial leverage. JEL classification codes: G3, F4, F3

Title: The Processing of Non-Anticipated Information in Financial Markets: Analyzing the Impact of Surprises in the Employment Report
Abstract: This paper delineates the simultaneous impact of non-anticipated information on mean and variance of the intraday return process by including appropriate variables accounting for the news flow into both the mean and the variance function. This allows us to differentiate between the consistent price reaction to surprising news and the traders' uncertainty about the precise price impact of this information. Focussing on the US employment report, we find that headline information is almost instantaneously incorporated into T-bond futures prices. Nevertheless, large surprises, and ‘bad’ news in particular, create considerable uncertainty. In contrast, if surprises in related headlines cross-validate each other, less room for differences of opinion is left and hence volatility is decreased. JEL classification codes: E44, G14.

Title: Do Firms Use Derivatives to Reduce their Dependence on External Capital Markets?
Abstract: This study investigates if the use of derivatives by corporations is likely to affect their financing strategies. I find a strong positive relation between the minimum revenue guaranteed by hedging and investment expenditure. This result implies that hedging increases the likelihood that investments can be financed internally. I also find that firms tend to finance their investment expenditures externally rather than internally. If external capital is more costly than internal capital it would clearly be in a firm's interestto reduce its dependence on external capital. Consistent with this result, Ifind that the median firm that does not hedge finances 100% of its investment expenditures externally, while the median firm that hedges finances only 86% of investments externally.

Title: The Book-to-Market and Size Effects in a General Asset Pricing Model: Evidence from Seven National Markets
Abstract: The positive relation of returns with Book-to-Market ratio (BE/ME) and their negative relation withMarket Value(MVE) remains strong under a general stochastic discount function (SDF) that does not depend on a specific asset pricing model and avoids potentially serious simultaneity biases inherent in the Fama and French three-factor model. However, we find that SDFs that include the equivalent of the HML portfolio do not span all asset sub-spaces, even with additional conditioning information. Finally, macro and financial variables we introduce to the pricing functions do not offer an alternative explanation of the BE/ME effect. JEL Classification codes: G10, G12, G15, G30.

Title: Suspension of Convertibility versus Deposit Insurance: A Welfare Comparison
Abstract: This paper introduces risk-averse preferences in Chari and Jagannathan (1988). A first motivation for this extension is to give a positive role for afinancial intermediary in the economy, who offers risk-sharing contracts toliquidity seeking individuals. In this framework, both informationinduced anpure panic runs will occur. The second motivation is to complete Chari and Jagannathan's welfare analysis by comparing suspension of convertibility and deposit insurance, given their relative benefits and costs (of randomizationin meeting liquidity needs or deadweight taxation). It is shown that the choice between the two contracts depends on the level of risk aversion, the intertemporal discount factor and the attributes about the underlying technology.

Title: Production and the Real Rate of Interest: A Sample Path Equilibrium
Abstract: This paper examines a multiperiod production economy where investors do not observe the realizations of productivity factors or security expected returns. Unlike previous work, which expresses the equilibrium conditions as functions of unobservable (to both real-world investors and empiricists) moments of the distributions of returns, we express the equilibrium real rate as a function of the observable sample paths of realizations of returns. We provide a framework for empirically testing this and other asset pricing models without outside-the-model econometric assumptions needed for producing the unobservable moments of returns. We construct versions of the restrictions for any time interval between observations. JEL classification codes: E43, G12, D92, D80, D51.

Title: Risk Preferences Heterogeneity: Evidence from Asset Markets
Abstract: Using asset market data, as well as theoretical relations between investors’ preferences, option-implied, risk-neutral, probability distribution functions (PDFs,) and index-implied, actual, PDFs, this paper extracts a time-series of investors’ relative risk aversion (RRA) functions. Based on results recently derived by Benninga and Mayshar (2000), these functions are used to recover the evolution of risk preferences heterogeneity. Applying non-parametric estimation on European call options written on the S &amp; P500 index, we find that: (i) the RRA functions are decreasing; and (ii) the constructed risk preferences heterogeneity series is positively correlated in a static, as well as a dynamic, setup with a prevalent proxy for investors heterogeneity, namely, the spread between auction- and market-yields of Treasury bills.

Title: Seasoned Equity Issues in a Closely Held Market: Evidence from France
Abstract: This paper examines seasoned equity offerings in France. Even though a rights offering is the primary flotation method, French companies are increasingly using the relatively expensive public offering method. We show that the market reaction to the announcement of seasoned equity issues is significantly negative for rights issues and insignificantly negative for public offerings. Our results suggest that the adverse selection effect is greater for rights issues than for public offerings, due to stronger underwriter certification for the public offerings. We find that the share price effect is positively related to blockholders take-up renouncements for firms with prior concentrated ownership. For these firms, the favourable ownership dispersion effect offsets the adverse selection effect. JEL Classification: G32, G14 and D80.

Title: American-style Indexed Executive Stock Options
Abstract: This paper develops a new pricing model for American-style indexed executive stock options. We rely on a basic model framework and an indexation scheme first proposed by Johnson and Tian (2000a) in their analysis of European-style indexed options. Our derivation of the valuation formula represents an instructive example of the usefulness of the change-of-numeraire technique. In the paper's numerical section we implement the valuation formula and demonstrate that not only may the early exercise premium be significant but also that the delta of the American-style option is typically much larger than the delta of the otherwise identical (value-matched) European-style option. Vega is higher for indexed options than for conventional options but largely independent of whether the options are European- or American-style. This has important implications for the design of executive compensation contracts. We finally extend the analysis to cover the case where the option contracts are subject to delayed vesting. We show that for realistic parameter values, delayed vesting leads only to a moderate reduction in the value of the American-style indexed executive stock option. JEL classifications: G13, G34, J33.

Title: Market Discipline in the Governance of U.S. Bank Holding Companies: Monitoring vs. Influencing
Abstract: Market discipline is an article of faith among financial economists, and the use of market discipline as a regulatory tool is gaining credibility. Effective market discipline involves two distinct components: security holders' ability to accurately assess the condition of a firm (monitoring) and their ability to cause subsequent managerial actions to reflect those assessments (influence). Substantial evidence supports the existence of market monitoring. However, the existing evidence about market influence involves relatively rare events such as management turnover. This paper seeks evidence that U.S. bank holding companies' security price changes reliably influence subsequent managerial actions. Although we identify some patterns consistent with beneficial market influences, our methodology does not provide strong evidence that stock or (especially) bond investors regularly influence managerial actions. Day-to-day market influence remains, for the moment, more a matter of faith than of empirical evidence. JEL classification codes: G21, G38, G14

Title: The Skill Profile of Central Bankers and Supervisors
Abstract: Using a new database covering some 91 supervisory agencies, this paper examines how important various skilled experts are in the supervisory process and the relative usage of different kinds of such experts. We seek to explore what kind of perspective supervisors in different institutional settings may adopt: a macro-oriented perspective or a more micro-approach? The answer to this question is relevant, as there is evidence that many financial crises have been macro-induced. It is found that central banks employ more economists and fewer lawyers in their supervisory/financial stability wing than non-central bank supervisory agencies. This result would indicate that an institutional setting with direct or indirect central bank involvement is more likely to produce a macro-approach. Next, there are significant economies of scale in financial supervision, though this can be measured by several alternative variables (e.g., the relative scale of bank intermediation). Finally, there do not appear to be major economies of scope. A more complex financial system with a well-developed stock market would need both more supervisors as well as more skilled ones.

Title: Enhancing Bank Transparency: A Re-assessment
Abstract: Transparency regulation aims at reducing financial fragility by strengthening market discipline. There are, however, two elementary properties of banking that may render such regulation inefficient at best and detrimental at worst. First, an extensive financial safety net may eliminate the disciplinary effect of transparency regulation. Second, achieving transparency is costly for banks, as it dilutes their charter values, and hence also reduces their private costs of risk-taking. We consider both the direct costs of complying with disclosure requirements and the indirect transparency costs stemming from imperfect property rights governing information and particularly infer the conditions under which transparency regulation cannot reduce financial fragility.
