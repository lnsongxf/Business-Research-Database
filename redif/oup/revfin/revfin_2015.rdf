Title: Assessing Measures of Order Flow Toxicity and Early Warning Signals for Market Turbulence
Abstract: Following the "flash crash" on May 6, 2010, warning signals for impending market stress have been in high demand, yet only the VPIN metric of Easley, López de Prado, and O’Hara (ELO) has claimed success. In addition, ELO find the metric useful in predicting short-term volatility. VPIN involves decomposing volume into active buys and sells. We utilize quotes and trade data to construct an accurate trade classification measure for E-mini S&P 500 futures. Against this benchmark, the ELO Bulk Volume Classification (BVC) scheme is inferior to a standard tick rule. Moreover, VPIN predicts volatility solely because increasing volatility induces systematic classification errors in the BVC procedure. We conclude that VPIN is unsuitable for capturing order flow toxicity or signaling ensuing market turbulence.

Title: China’s Pseudo-monetary Policy
Abstract: China’s monetary stimulation after the global financial crisis rapidly boosted its GDP. We argue that its efficacy derives from state control over its banking and corporate sectors. Beijing ordered state-owned banks to lend and they lent. Beijing ordered centrally-controlled state-owned enterprises (SOEs) to invest and they invested. Our data show much of this investment was highly leveraged purchases of real estate and land prices rises occurred where these SOEs were active buyers. This episode mimics the credit channel for monetary policy, but actually entails internal transfers between arms of the government pressuring on real estate prices upwards.

Title: Monetary Policy, Risk-Taking, and Pricing: Evidence from a Quasi-Natural Experiment
Abstract: We study the risk-taking channel of monetary policy in Bolivia, a dollarized country where monetary changes are transmitted exogenously from the USA. We find that a lower policy rate spurs the granting of riskier loans, to borrowers with worse credit histories, lower ex-ante internal ratings, and weaker ex-post performance (acutely so when the rate subsequently increases). Effects are stronger for small firms borrowing from multiple banks. To uniquely identify risk-taking, we assess collateral coverage, expected returns, and risk premia of the newly granted riskier loans, finding that their returns and premia are actually lower, especially at banks suffering from agency problems.

Title: Systemic Risk in Europe
Abstract: Systemic risk may be defined as the propensity of a financial institution to be undercapitalized when the financial system as a whole is undercapitalized. In this article, we investigate the case of non-US institutions, with several factors explaining the dynamics of financial firms returns and with asynchronicity of time zones. We apply this methodology to the 196 largest European financial firms and estimate their systemic risk over the 2000–12 period. We find that, for certain countries, the cost for the taxpayer to rescue the riskiest domestic banks is so high that some banks might be considered too big to be saved.

Title: Depositors’ Perception of "Too-Big-to-Fail"
Abstract: We exploit the exogenous shock to the Brazilian banking system caused by the international turmoil of 2008 and find evidence that the run to systemically important banks is better explained by the perception of a too-big-to-fail policy than by bank fundamentals. We infer that the extra inflow of deposits received by systemically important banks during crises gives them an important competitive advantage. Our analysis also indicates that a bank’s share of funding from institutional investors affects the nonfinancial firms’ and institutional investors’ decision to run.

Title: Strategic Cross-Trading in the U.S. Stock Market
Abstract: We model and test for the role of heterogeneously informed, strategic multi-asset speculation for cross-price impact—the impact of trades in one asset on the prices of other (even unrelated) assets—in the U.S. stock market. Our investigation of the trading activity in New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation System (NASDAQ) stocks between 1993 and 2004 reveals that, consistent with our model, (1) daily order imbalance in one industry or random stock has a significant, persistent, and robust impact on daily returns of other (even unrelated) industries or random stocks; (2) cross-price impact is often negative; and (3) both direct (i.e., an asset’s own) and absolute (i.e., unsigned) cross-price impact are smaller when speculators are more numerous, greater when market-wide dispersion of beliefs is higher, and greater among stocks dealt by the same specialist.

Title: Insuring Nonverifiable Losses
Abstract: Insurance contracts are often complex and difficult to verify outside the insurance relation. We show that standard one-period insurance policies with an upper limit and a deductible are the optimal incentive-compatible contracts in a competitive market with repeated interaction. Optimal group insurance policies involve a joint upper limit and individual deductibles; insurance brokers can play a role implementing such contracts for their clients. Our model provides new insights and predictions about the determinants of insurance.

Title: Social Engagement and Stock Market Participation
Abstract: We investigate the separate and joint influences of social engagement measures on stock market participation and find that socially engaged individuals are more likely to participate. Consistent with Granovetter’s theory of social networks we find that a weak tie (measured by social group involvement) has a positive effect on stock market participation whereas a strong tie (measured by frequency of talking to neighbors) has no effect. More trusting individuals are more likely to participate in the stock market, as are those who identify with a political party. In contrast, the degree to which religion is important appears to have little impact.

Title: Consumption Volatility and the Cross-Section of Stock Returns
Abstract: I derive and test multi-horizon implications of a consumption-based equilibrium model featuring fluctuating expected growth and volatility. My setup allows consumption dynamics to be estimated jointly with covariance risk prices in a single-stage generalized method of moment, and then inferences from asset pricing tests reflect uncertainty coming from factor estimation. I show that changes in consumption volatility are the key driver for explaining major asset pricing anomalies across risk horizons, while other factors play no or a secondary role. Value stocks and past long-term losers pay higher average returns mainly because they covary more negatively with these changes than what other stocks do.

Title: Recession Prediction Using Yield Curve and Stock Market Liquidity Deviation Measures
Abstract: This article extends the benchmark Estrella and Hardouvelis term spread approach to recession forecasting by including the stock market macro liquidity deviation factor. We use a probit framework to predict recessions, as defined by the NBER between 1959Q1 and 2011Q4. We find that combining the yield curve parameter with the stock market liquidity deviation significantly improves our ability to predict the onset of a US recession, based both on in-sample and out-of-sample tests. In addition, changes in stock market depth further increase the accuracy of the model. We suggest that economic forecasters and those charged with conducting economic stabilization policy more generally would benefit from monitoring not only the yield curve but also stock market depth and liquidity, and their deviation from one another.

Title: Equilibrium Predictability, Term Structure of Equity Premia, and Other Return Characteristics
Abstract: This article presents a structural model of aggregate return characteristics based on a one-channel Bansal and Yaron (2004) economy under recursive preferences. The results rest on an endogenously determined price–dividend ratio that is not exponentially affine, which implies time-variation and predictability of equity premia. The predictability coefficient itself is stochastic. This provides theoretical foundations for recent works in predictability like Dangl and Halling (2011). In longer horizons, the predictability relationship is highly volatile making it difficult to make inferences about long-horizon predictability.

Title: Portfolio Optimization Using Forward-Looking Information
Abstract: We develop a new family of estimators of the covariance matrix that relies solely on forward-looking information. It uses only current prices of plain-vanilla options. In an out-of-sample study, we show that a minimum variance strategy based on these fully-implied estimators outperforms several benchmark strategies, including various strategies based on historical estimates, index investing, and 1/N investing. The outperformance originates in crisis periods when information flow and information asymmetry are high. Although the historical benchmark strategies improve when more recent data are used, they never outperform fully-implied strategies. Thus, our results suggest that investors are better off relying on forward-looking information.

Title: Ending "Too Big To Fail": Government Promises Versus Investor Perceptions
Abstract: Can a government credibly promise not to bailout firms whose failure would have major negative systemic consequences? Our analysis of Korea’s 1997–98 crisis suggests an answer: No. Despite a general "no bailout" policy during the crisis, the largest Korean corporate groups—facing severe financial and governance problems—could still borrow heavily from households by issuing bonds at prices implying very low expected default risk. The evidence suggests "too big to fail" beliefs were not eliminated by government promises because investors believed that this policy was not time consistent. Subsequent bailouts confirmed the market view that creditors would be protected.

Title: Multiple Bank Lending, Creditor Rights, and Information Sharing
Abstract: Multiple bank lending induces borrowers to take too much debt when creditor rights are poorly protected; moreover, banks wish to engage in opportunistic lending at their competitors’ expenses if borrowers’ collateral is sufficiently risky. These incentives lead to credit rationing and positive-profit interest rates, possibly exceeding the monopoly level. If banks share information about past debts and seniority via credit reporting systems, the incentive to overborrow is mitigated: interest and default rates decrease; credit access improves if the value of collateral is not very volatile, but worsens otherwise. Recent empirical studies report evidence consistent with these predictions. The article also shows that private and social incentives to share information are not necessarily aligned.

Title: The Effects of Government-Sponsored Venture Capital: International Evidence
Abstract: This article examines enterprises funded by government-sponsored venture capitalists (GVCs). We find that enterprises funded by both GVCs and private venture capitalists (PVCs) obtain more investment than enterprises funded purely by PVCs, and much more than those funded purely by GVCs. Also, markets with more GVC funding have more VC funding per enterprise and more VC-funded enterprises, suggesting that GVC finance largely augments rather than displaces PVC finance. There is also a positive association between mixed GVC/PVC funding and successful exits, as measured by initial public offerings (IPOs) and acquisitions, attributable largely to the additional investment.

Title: Performance Terms in CEO Compensation Contracts
Abstract: In December 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued new rules that require enhanced disclosure on how firms tie CEO compensation to performance. We use this new available data to study the terms of performance-based awards in CEO compensation contracts in S&P 500 firms. We observe large variations in the choice of performance measures. Our evidence is consistent with predictions from optimal contracting theories: firms rely on performance measures that are more informative of CEO actions.

Title: Small Banks and Local Economic Development
Abstract: This article discusses the effects of small banks on economic growth. We first theoretically show that small banks operating at a regional level can spur local economic growth. As compared with big interregional banks, small regional banks are more effective in promoting local economic growth, especially in regions with lower initial endowments and severe credit rationing. We then test the model predictions using a sample of German banks and corresponding regional statistics. We find that small regional banks are more important funding providers in regions with low access to finance. The empirical results support the theoretical hypotheses.

Title: Financial Network Systemic Risk Contributions
Abstract: We propose the realized systemic risk beta as a measure of financial companies’ contribution to systemic risk, given network interdependence between firms’ tail risk exposures. Conditional on statistically pre-identified network spillover effects and market and balance sheet information, we define the realized systemic risk beta as the total time-varying marginal effect of a firm’s Value-at-risk (VaR) on the system’s VaR. Statistical inference reveals a multitude of relevant risk spillover channels and determines companies’ systemic importance in the US financial system. Our approach can be used to monitor companies’ systemic importance, enabling transparent macroprudential supervision.

Title: Household Portfolio Risk
Abstract: We exploit the US Survey of Consumer Finances from 1998 to 2010 to study households’ portfolio risk. We compare alternative measures of ex-ante risk, based on a financial portfolio including deposits, bonds, and stocks, or a broader portfolio also including real estate, business wealth, and related debt. The measures provide different rankings of portfolio risk, but they all show a skewed distribution with many households bearing limited risk. Large wealth holdings lead to more aggressive risk positions. Moreover, risk falls at the beginning of the sample period and rises at the end, together with the business cycle.

Title: Casting Doubt on the Predictability of Stock Returns in Real Time: Bayesian Model Averaging using Realistic Priors
Abstract: Previous studies have identified several variables that would have predicted future stock returns, though other studies suggest these results may be due to data snooping. To guard against data snooping, researchers have suggested use of Bayesian model averaging (BMA) to account for the uncertainty about prediction models. In common with other researchers, I find evidence of predictability during time periods when a hypothetical investor uses BMA with no restrictions on what variables may be included in the model. However, when the hypothetical investor is limited to using only variables whose predictive ability would have been known at the time of the forecast, predictability disappears. Moreover, predictability also disappears when data are updated through 2010, even without constraints on variable use. The results cast doubt on whether stock returns were ever predictable in real time and also suggest that returns may no longer be predictable even if real-time constraints are removed.

Title: Taxation, Transfer Income and Stock Market Participation
Abstract: This article studies the impact of a redistributive tax system on consumption, portfolio decisions, and asset prices in a dynamic general equilibrium model. Poorer agents, which receive more in transfers than they pay in taxes, optimally reduce their exposure to equity, because the transfer income they receive is subject to stock market risk. This article thus provides a novel explanation for the low stock market participation rates of poorer investors.

Title: Stealth Trading and Trade Reporting by Corporate Insiders
Abstract: Regulations in the pre-Sarbanes–Oxley era allowed corporate insiders considerable flexibility in timing their trades and engaging in stealth trading, for example, by executing several trades and reporting them jointly after the last trade. We document that even these lax reporting requirements were frequently violated and stealth trading was common. Event study abnormal returns are larger after reports of stealth trades than after reports of otherwise similar non-stealth trades. Our results imply that delayed reporting impedes the adjustment of prices to the information revealed by insider trades. They lend strong support to the more stringent reporting requirements established by the Sarbanes–Oxley Act.

Title: Variance Reduction for Asian Options under a General Model Framework
Abstract: We present a new variance reduction method for Asian options under a general model framework. The three special cases we consider are Lévy processes, Heston stochastic volatility, and regime switching models. The proposed method combines a very effective control variate with conditional Monte Carlo. While the control variate can be used for any model allowing the numerical computation of the multivariate characteristic function of the log-return vector, conditional Monte Carlo is based on the unified representation of the three models. Computational results confirm that the new method performs better than available control variate methods.

Title: Funding Versus Real Economy Shock: The Impact of the 2007–09 Crisis on Small Firms’ Credit Availability
Abstract: We analyze how banks adjust their lending to small firms after distinct shocks from the cross-border transmission of the 2007–09 crisis by using unique loan application and contract data from AccessBank Azerbaijan. These data allow us to disentangle the effects of a funding shock from the effects of a real shock. Contrary to conventional assumptions, we find that the funding shock works through reduced prospecting—as opposed to tightened lending standards—and leads to fewer loan applications among new applicants in particular, which improves the borrower pool. The real economy shock instead works through loan approval and affects small and medium enterprise rather than micro borrowers.

Title: Modeling the Dynamics of Correlations among Implied Volatilities
Abstract: Implied volatility (IV) reflects both expected empirical volatility and also risk premia. Stochastic variation in either creates unhedged risk in a delta hedged options position. We develop EGARCH/DCC models for the dynamics of volatilities and correlations among daily IVs from options on twenty-eight large cap stocks. The data strongly support a general correlation structure and also a one-factor model with the VIX index as the common factor. Using IVs from stocks that are either highly correlated with the target stock’s IV or in the same industry together with the VIX can significantly improve hedging of individual IV changes.

Title: Improving Investment Decisions with Simulated Experience Abstract: We apply a new and innovative approach to communicating risks associated with financial products that should support investors in making better investment decisions. In our experiments, participants are able to gain "simulated experience" by random sampling of a previously described return distribution. We find that simulated experience considerably improves participants’ understanding of the underlying risk–return profile and prompts them to reconsider their investment decisions and to choose riskier financial products without regretting their higher risk-taking behavior afterwards. This method of experienced-based learning has high potential for being integrated into real-world applications and services.

Title: Learning about Rare Disasters: Implications For Consumption and Asset Prices
Abstract: Rietz (1988) and Barro (2006) subject consumption and dividends to rare disasters in the growth rate. We extend their framework and subject consumption and dividends to rare disasters in the growth persistence. We model growth persistence by means of two hidden types of economic slowdowns: recessions and lost decades. We estimate the model based on the postwar US data using maximum likelihood and find that it can simultaneously match a wide array of dynamic pricing phenomena in the equity and bond markets. The key intuition for our results stems from the inability to discriminate between the short and the long recessions ex ante.

Title: Informed Headquarters and Socialistic Internal Capital Markets
Abstract: This article develops a theory of resource allocation in internal capital markets that is consistent with the empirical finding that multidivision firms bias their investment levels in favor of divisions with weaker investment prospects. Headquarters has private information about the capital productivities of its divisions; therefore, capital allocations in the present serve as a signal to divisional managers about future allocations. To facilitate effort provision, headquarters biases capital allocation so as to not disclose productivity differences across divisions or to credibly signal their absence. The capital allocation bias is time-varying and the relationship between the bias and the difference in average division productivities is inversely U-shaped.

Title: The Impact of Weather on German Retail Investors
Abstract: We explore the impact of weather on trading by individual investors. Over a time span of 94 months, we analyze daily trading records of individual investors. Controlling for various investor- and market-specific factors, we find a two-fold effect of weather. We first observe that investor sentiment, as measured by purchases relative to sales, is significantly higher on days with good weather. In addition, we find that retail investors generally trade more on bad weather days. This result is consistent with the notion that retail investors incur an opportunity cost for spending time trading on days with good weather.

Title: Bank Risk and Competition: Evidence from Regional Banking Markets
Abstract: We investigate the bank competition-stability nexus based on a unique regulatory dataset. First, we use outright bank defaults, and control for a wide array of different time-varying bank characteristics which are likely to influence the nexus. Second, we simultaneously include measures of competition and market power corresponding to the bank, county, and federal state level. Third, we investigate the role of bank competition in the transmission of monetary policy to bank risk. From a policy perspective, our findings indicate that competition-reducing regulation does not necessarily enhance either the stability of individual banks or their resilience to monetary policy shocks.

Title: Jump-Diffusion Long-Run Risks Models, Variance Risk Premium, and Volatility Dynamics
Abstract: This article calibrates a class of jump-diffusion long-run risks models and quantifies how well they can account for both equity and variance risk premiums while generating realistic volatility dynamics. I find that jumps in the level and the volatility of long-run consumption growth rates perform equally well in explaining the variance risk premium. Moreover, compared to jump-in-growth models, jump-in-volatility models generate more realistic volatility dynamics and stronger predictability of returns by the variance risk premium. Finally, both jump-in-volatility and jump-in-growth models suggest that a nontrivial portion of the equity risk premium is due to compensation for jump risks.

Title: Credit Markets with Ethical Banks and Motivated Borrowers
Abstract: We investigate the corporate social responsibility of banks. Lenders offer loans to standard and motivated borrowers who undertake either standard or ethical projects. Standard banks have no restriction on the types of projects for which they can provide a loan. Ethical banks, instead, commit to financing only ethical projects, which have social profitability but lower expected revenues. Motivated borrowers are keen to invest in ethical projects and to deal with ethical banks. When they are active, ethical banks increase social welfare because the matching of ethical lenders with motivated borrowers reduces the frictions caused by the agency issue.

Title: Stakeholder Governance, Competition, and Firm Value
Abstract: We analyze the strengths and weaknesses of stakeholder and shareholder firms in a model of imperfect competition. Stakeholder firms are more concerned with avoiding bankruptcy to protect their employees and suppliers. In equilibrium, they are more valuable than shareholder firms when marginal cost uncertainty exceeds demand uncertainty. With globalization shareholder firms and stakeholder firms often compete. We identify the circumstances where stakeholder firms are more valuable than shareholder firms and compare these mixed equilibria with the pure equilibria with stakeholder and shareholder firms only. Finally, we analyze firm financial constraints and derive implications for the capital structure of stakeholder firms.

Title: How Much Can Financial Literacy Help?
Abstract: We use a dataset of individual investors containing test-based measures of financial literacy and administrative records on their assets holding and trades before and during the financial crisis of September 2008. We design three tests of the benefits of financial literacy during the Global Financial Crisis, by comparing the decisions actually taken by individuals with a dominated alternative, i.e., one giving lower utility according to simple normative models of financial decision-making. We find that high-literacy investors are better at timing the market. High-literacy investors are also more likely to trade according to the prescriptions of normative models and to detect intermediaries’ potential conflicts of interest. However, though statistically significant, these effects are economically small.

Title: Performance Pay, CEO Dismissal, and the Dual Role of Takeovers
Abstract: We propose that an active takeover market provides incentives by offering acquisition opportunities to successful managers. This allows firms to reduce performance-based compensation and can rationalize loss-making acquisitions. When choosing its acquisition policy and the quality of its board, each firm ignores the adverse effect on other firms’ acquisition opportunities and takeover threat. As a result, the takeover market is not sufficiently liquid and too few takeovers occur. Furthermore, liquidity in the takeover and managerial labor markets are inversely related. When poaching managers becomes more profitable, firms invest more in board quality which in turn reduces the incidence of takeovers.

Title: The Profits–Leverage Puzzle Revisited
Abstract: The inverse relation between leverage and profitability is widely regarded as a serious defect of the trade-off theory. We show that the defect is not with the theory but with the use of a leverage ratio in which profitability affects both the numerator and the denominator. Profitability directly increases the value of equity. Firms do take the predicted offsetting actions. They issue debt and repurchase equity when profitability rises, and retire debt and issue equity when profitability falls. Consistent with variable transactions costs, the adjustment is not generally sufficient to fully undo the profitability shocks. Accordingly, on average the leverage ratio falls as profitability rises.

Title: The Effect of Earned Versus House Money on Price Bubble Formation in Experimental Asset Markets
Abstract: Does house money exacerbate price bubbles? We compare house money asset market experiments with an earned money treatment where initial portfolios are constructed from a real effort task. Bubbles occur; however, trading volumes and earnings dispersion are significantly higher with house money. We investigate the role of cognitive ability in accounting for the differences in earnings distribution across treatments by using the cognitive reflection test (CRT). Low CRT subjects earned less than high CRT subjects. Low CRT subjects were net purchasers (sellers) of shares when the price was above (below) fundamental value. The opposite was true for high CRT subjects.

Title: Acquiring Acquirers
Abstract: Target acquisitiveness stands out as one of the primary drivers of all the key aspects of the market for corporate takeovers: acquisition announcement returns, probability of deal success, propensity to acquire and be acquired. Acquisitive targets, though a small proportion of the sample, are responsible for half of the overall negative acquisition announcement returns. Our large body of empirical evidence consistently supports the view that the motivation behind acquisitions of acquisitive targets is defensive: acquirers "eat in order not to be eaten".

Title: Emerging Equity Market Comovements: Trends and Macroeconomic Fundamentals
Abstract: Emerging equity markets have become increasingly interrelated over the past two decades. For a sample of thirty-two emerging markets from four different regions, we find significant positive time trends in cross-country correlations within regions, correlations across regions, and in comovements with the rest of the world. Furthermore, we examine the economic mechanisms that drive these trends. We find that official market liberalization, a continuous measure of equity market openness, equity market development, and to some extent, trade openness all play a role. However, we show important heterogeneity across regions, both in the speed at which comovements increase over time and in the underlying macroeconomic channels.

Title: The Impact of Dark Trading and Visible Fragmentation on Market Quality
Abstract: Two important characteristics of current equity markets are the large number of competing trading venues with publicly displayed order books and the substantial fraction of dark trading, which takes place outside such visible order books. This article evaluates the impact on liquidity of dark trading and fragmentation in visible order books. Dark trading has a detrimental effect on liquidity. Visible fragmentation improves liquidity aggregated over all visible trading venues but lowers liquidity at the traditional market, meaning that the benefits of fragmentation are not enjoyed by investors who choose to send orders only to the traditional market.

Title: Improved Portfolio Choice Using Second-Order Stochastic Dominance
Abstract: Constructing portfolios based on second-order stochastic dominance (SSD) is theoretically attractive since all risk-averse investors would prefer a dominating portfolio. However, choosing among SSD efficient portfolios is a challenge without an obvious ranking metric. We explore particular choices based on Kuosmanen (2004) plus Kopa and Post (2011), comparing their performance to other SSD-related strategies and to standard portfolio choice approaches. These SSD-related choices outperform portfolios chosen based on their Sharpe ratio, information ratio, or using equal weights. Portfolios based on minimum variance that also match the benchmark’s mean return perform on a par with the SSD-related choices.

Title: Short-Term Trading and Stock Return Anomalies: Momentum, Reversal, and Share Issuance
Abstract: This article examines how the extent of short-term trading relates to the efficiency of stock prices. We employ a new duration measure based on quarterly institutional investors’ portfolio holdings, next to existing proxies such as trading volume, the percentage of transient institutions, and fund turnover. Momentum returns and subsequent returns reversal are generally much stronger for stocks held primarily by short-term investors, especially if these investors recently had superior recent performance which could make them overconfident. Our results point toward the behavioral theory in Daniel, Hirshleifer and Subrahmanyam (1998) and seem inconsistent with short-term institutions improving efficiency.

Title: Herding Behavior and Rating Convergence among Credit Rating Agencies: Evidence from the Subprime Crisis
Abstract: This article examines how credit rating agencies (CRAs) react to rating decisions on mortgage-backed securities by rival agencies in the aftermath of the subprime crisis. While Fitch is on average the first mover, Moody’s and S&amp;P perform more timely downgrades given a downgrade or a more severe evaluation by a CRA other than Fitch, and they also influence Fitch more than they are influenced by it. Rating convergence is more likely when Fitch rather than the rival has to adjust its evaluation downwards. Our results support theoretical predictions on the role of reputation in explaining herding behavior among CRAs.

Title: Convective Risk Flows in Commodity Futures Markets
Abstract: We study the joint responses of commodity future prices and positions of various trader groups to changes of the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) before and after the recent financial crisis. Financial traders reduced their net long positions during the crisis in response to market distress, whereas hedgers facilitated this by reducing their net short positions as prices fell. This "convective risk flow" induced by the greater distress of financial institutions led to a change in the allocation of risk with hedgers holding more risk than they did previously. The presence of such a risk flow confirms the market impact of financial traders conditional on trades they initiate.

Title: Private Equity Fund Returns and Performance Persistence
Abstract: Successful private equity managers have funds that are often oversubscribed and provide persistent abnormal returns. Why do not successful managers increase fund size or fees? We argue that managers want to attract high-quality entrepreneurs, while entrepreneurs want to match with high-ability managers. However, observing fund performance does not allow entrepreneurs to distinguish a manager’s ability from the quality of firms in the fund’s portfolio. As a consequence, a fund manager may devote unobserved effort to select firms, and keep fund size small to limit the cost of effort, hoping to manipulate entrepreneurs’ beliefs about his ability.

Title: Exporting Sovereign Stress: Evidence from Syndicated Bank Lending during the Euro Area Sovereign Debt Crisis
Abstract: We show that after the start of the euro area sovereign debt crisis, lending by non-GIIPS European banks with sizeable holdings of GIIPS sovereign bonds declined relative to nonexposed banks. This effect is not driven by changes in borrower demand or by other shocks to banks’ balance sheets. We also find that affected banks withdrew from all foreign markets with the exception of the USA, suggesting an increase in home bias. The slowdown in lending continued after ECB’s LTRO in December 2011, but it was lower for banks that increased their risky exposures in the early stages of the crisis.

Title: Trade Credit, Relationship-specific Investment, and Product Market Power
Abstract: We rely on a model with incomplete contracts and bargaining power to argue that trade credit (TC) can serve as a commitment device for making relationship-specific investments (RSIs). Unlike existing theories, we explain within a single theoretical framework why TC is affected by firms’ bargaining power and by the specialized nature of transacted goods. Using a large panel of publicly listed firms and innovation-based proxies for RSI, we find strong support for the model’s predictions: TC increases in upstream firm’s RSI and downstream firm’s market power. Endogeneity concerns are addressed by using the passage of innovation-increasing state laws to instrument for RSI and import penetration to instrument for bargaining power.

Title: Stock Market Literacy, Trust, and Participation
Abstract: This article studies the importance of stock market literacy and trust for stock ownership decisions. We find that these two distinct channels simultaneously explain not only the probability of participation, but, conditional on participation, also explain the share of investment in stocks. Once we account for stock market literacy, sociability is no longer significant for participation; what matters is literacy rather than sociability. Further, we observe that economic shocks and future expectations are key behavioral characteristics that explain a household’s decision to invest in stocks. However, upon participation, a larger set of behavioral characteristics explains the level of stock investment.

Title: Market Size Structure and Small Business Lending: Are Crisis Times Different from Normal Times?
Abstract: Conventional wisdom holds that small banks have comparative advantages vis-à-vis large banks in serving small firms, while recent literature suggests this may not be the case. Using a panel of recent US start-ups, we investigate how small bank presence affects these firms in normal times (2004–06) and in the recent financial crisis (2007–09). We find that greater small bank presence yields significantly more lending to and slightly lower failure rates of these firms during normal times. However, these benefits disappear during the financial crisis, possibly because small banks are less diversified and benefit less from government guarantees than large banks.

Title: The Conditional Effects of Market Power on Bank Risk—Cross-Country Evidence
Abstract: We investigate the relationship between market power and risk for a large panel of banks worldwide. Loan and deposit market power are measured separately at bank-year level, and the risk effect of market power is conditioned on several factors predicted by theory. Both loan and deposit market power have a stable, monotonically negative effect on risk, irrespective of risk measure. The effect is larger for asset risk, and is independent of charter value and capital ratios. The effect on default risk tends to decrease in the quality of banking regulation, whereas the conditioning effects of deposit insurance protection are mixed.

Title: Stock Market Integration and the Global Financial Crisis
Abstract: We study the dynamics of stock market integration and its consequences during the recent financial crisis for twenty-three developed and sixty emerging markets. We find that integration increased slightly for emerging markets but decreased for developed countries during the crisis. Moreover, we argue that the high degree of integration propagated the crisis across the global financial markets at the beginning of the crisis, but it had little effect during the crisis. We also find that integration is mostly affected by financial openness, the institutional environment, and global financial uncertainty but that these determinants vary slightly between emerging and developed markets.

Title: Financial Relationships and the Limits to Arbitrage
Abstract: We propose a model of limited arbitrage based on financial relationships. Financially constrained arbitrageurs may choose to seek additional financing from banks that have the technology to profit from the strategies themselves. A holdup problem arises because banks cannot commit to providing capital. To minimize competition, arbitrageurs will choose to stay constrained and underinvest in the arbitrage unless banks have sufficient reputational capital. This problem arises when mispricing is largest. More competition among financiers, higher arbitrageur wealth, and allowing for explicit contracts can worsen the holdup problem. When arbitrage is risky, financial relationships are more valuable, mitigating the problem.

Title: Executive Compensation and Risk Taking
Abstract: This article studies the connection between risk taking and executive compensation in financial institutions. A model of shareholders, debtholders, depositors, and an executive demonstrates that (i) excess risk taking can be addressed by basing compensation on both stock price and the credit default swaps (CDS) spread, (ii) shareholders may not be able to commit to design such contracts, and (iii) they may not want to due to distortions from deposit insurance or unobservable tail risk. The advantage of using the CDS spread rather than deferred compensation or debt is due to the fact that it is a market price and reduces agency costs.

Title: Implied Risk Exposures
Abstract: We show how to reverse-engineer banks’ risk disclosures, such as value-at-risk, to obtain an implied measure of their exposures to equity, interest rate, foreign exchange, and commodity risks. Factor implied risk exposures are obtained by breaking down a change in risk disclosure into a market volatility component and a bank-specific risk exposure component. In a study of large US and international banks, we show that (i) changes in risk exposures are negatively correlated with market volatility and (ii) changes in risk exposures are positively correlated across banks, which is consistent with banks exhibiting commonality in trading.

Title: Institutions, Bailout Policies, and Bank Loan Contracting: Evidence from Korean Chaebols
Abstract: In emerging economies, institutional and regulatory constraints can distort loan contracting and, hence, the incentives of lenders and borrowers. Studying the South Korean syndicated loan market, we find that during the 90s the safety net protecting business groups (chaebols)—especially the government’s bailout policy—affected the structure and pricing of loans to chaebol firms. However, after the chaebol reform of the late 90s dismantled the chaebol safety net, the differences in loan contracts between chaebol and non-chaebol firms narrowed or disappeared. The results suggest that the reform restored lenders’ incentives to monitor chaebol firms and properly assess their risk.

Title: Corporate Aging and Takeover Risk
Abstract: Although growth opportunities fade and profitability declines as firms mature, older firms are no more likely to be acquired than young firms are. This article documents and explains that phenomenon. We argue that, because mature organizations are rationally less flexible, they are more costly to integrate and therefore comparatively unattractive acquisition candidates. The evidence supports this explanation of the negative age dependence of takeover hazard. The evidence also shows that negative exogenous shocks to merger benefits further reduce the takeover hazard of mature firms. We test many alternative explanations and find no evidence that they can explain the hazard decline.

Title: Tug-of-War: Time-Varying Predictability of Stock Returns and Dividend Growth
Abstract: We propose a regime-switching present-value model with latent variables to jointly investigate the predictability of stock returns and dividend growth. We find that both return predictability and dividend growth predictability are time-varying. Interestingly, the predictability of stock returns and dividend growth is a tug-of-war contest: when dividend growth is highly predictable in the high-volatility regime, stock returns are largely unpredictable; in contrast, when dividend growth is less predictable in the low-volatility regime, stock returns are significantly predictable. We also investigate macroeconomic determinants of regime switches and find that two regimes are intimately related to macroeconomic risk and economic activity.

Title: An Out-of-Sample Evaluation of Dynamic Portfolio Strategies
Abstract: This article evaluates out-of-sample portfolio performance for a real-time investor who can exploit time variation in the conditional mean and volatility of stock returns in optimizing a multiperiod portfolio choice problem. With the presence of parameter uncertainty, our out-of-sample analysis shows that ignoring time variation in the first two return moments leads to significant utility costs of at least 1.97% of annualized certainty equivalent return. Accounting for the time-varying risk premium plays a more important role than considering time-varying volatility in improving portfolio performance. Interestingly, behaving myopically or ignoring the hedge against changes in future investment opportunities can lead to small out-of-sample utility losses or even utility gains.
