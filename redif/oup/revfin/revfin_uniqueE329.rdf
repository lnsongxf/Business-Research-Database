Title: Integration of Trans-Atlantic Capital Markets, 1790-1845 
Abstract:
		       During the 1790s, European investors began to
 purchase substantial quantities of US government and corporate securities.
 A number of these securities were traded in markets on both sides of the
 Atlantic. Based on market price quotations we compiled for the same
 securities in London and New York markets, we ask if these early
 trans-Atlantic securities markets were integrated, and, if so, when they
 became integrated. We find little evidence of market integration before
 1816, and substantial evidence of it thereafter. Financial globalization -
 the convergence of financial asset prices in markets on different
 continents - began earlier than most have suspected.			 Copyright Oxford University Press Science+Business Media, LLC 2006

Title: Euro-Zone Equity Returns: Country versus Industry Effects 
Abstract:
 This paper uses style analysis to investigate whether Euro-zone equity
 returns are driven by country or industry effects over the 1990--2008
 period. We find that before the introduction of the Euro, country effects
 dominate, while industry effects prevail after 1999. This reversal is
 driven mainly by the countries that were least integrated in the Economic
 and Monetary Union (EMU) and world markets in the early 1990s and for
 which the EMU convergence process led to rapid strengthening of linkages
 with the core Euro-zone. For markets with stronger economic linkages,
 industry effects dominate both before and after the introduction of the
 Euro. Copyright 2011, Oxford University Press.

Title: Do Shareholders Vote Strategically? Voting Behavior, Proposal Screening, and Majority Rules 
Abstract:
 We analyze how shareholders screen management proposals at annual general
 meetings. First, we use a simple model of strategic voting to develop a
 theoretical benchmark of effective information aggregation through voting.
 Then, we derive testable implications and provide structural estimates of
 the model parameters. The main conclusions are that shareholders vote
 strategically and that proposal screening increases value. Shareholders
 largely neutralize the lock-in effect of supermajority rules, thereby
 preventing the incorrect rejection of proposals. Copyright 2009, Oxford University Press.

Title: Short-Run Pain, Long-Run Gain: Financial Liberalization and Stock Market Cycles 
Abstract:
 The views on financial liberalization are quite conflictive. Many argue
 that it triggers financial bubbles and crises. Others claim that financial
 liberalization allows markets to function properly and capital to move to
 its most profitable destination. The empirical evidence on these effects
 is not robust. This paper constructs a new comprehensive chronology of
 financial liberalization and shows that a key reason for the inconclusive
 evidence is that the effects of liberalization are time-varying. Financial
 liberalization is followed by large booms and busts only in the short run.
 In the long run institutions improve and financial markets tend to
 stabilize. Copyright 2008, Oxford University Press.

Title: Helping Hand or Grabbing Hand? Central vs. Local Government Shareholders in Chinese Listed Firms 
Abstract:
 We analyze related party transactions between Chinese publicly listed
 firms and their state-owned shareholders to examine whether companies
 benefit or lose from the presence of government shareholders and
 politically connected directors. Minority shareholders seem to be
 expropriated in firms controlled by local governments, firms with a large
 proportion of local government directors on their board, firms without
 central government directors, and firms in provinces where local
 government bureaucrats are less likely to be prosecuted for corruption. In
 contrast, firms controlled by the central government (or having central
 government affiliated directors), benefit in related party transactions
 with their government parents. Copyright 2010, Oxford University Press.

Title: The Real Effects of the Euro: Evidence from Corporate Investments 
Abstract:
 We study how the adoption of the euro as the common currency in Europe has
 affected firms' investment rates. Using corporate data from the eleven
 countries that adopted the euro in January 1999, as well as from a control
 sample of five other European countries, our paper shows that: (i) the
 euro has increased investments for firms from countries that previously
 had weak currencies, (ii) the euro has had a positive impact on
 financially constrained firms' investments, and (iii) the euro has
 decreased investments for financially unconstrained firms from countries
 that previously had strong currencies. Copyright 2006, Oxford University Press.

Title: Tying in Universal Banks 
Abstract:
 This paper examines the tying of lending to investment banking business by
 universal banks. Tying may alleviate credit rationing by assuring the
 lender of an adequate share of the social surplus that its lending
 generates; however, tying raises the profitability of loans to troubled
 entrepreneurs, softening entrepreneurial budget constraints and reducing
 effort levels. When investment banking is uncompetitive, the former effect
 dominates, and there is too little tying; when investment banking is
 competitive, there is too much tying. We relate our results to the
 authority structure of the universal bank, which we argue is the
 appropriate focus for regulation. Copyright 2012, Oxford University Press.

Title: Chinese Walls in German Banks 
Abstract:
 Analysts in a bank's research department cover firms that have no
 relationship with the bank as well as companies in which the bank has a
 strategic interest. Officially, banks must establish Chinese Walls around
 their research departments to allow the analysts to work independently and
 to avoid the flow of insider information. We examine analyst behavior
 under long-term bank-firm relationships using ownership data and analysts'
 earnings per share forecasts for German companies from 1994 to 2001. We
 find evidence that is consistent with analysts reconciling their
 employers' interests with their own career concerns. They seem to use
 their information advantage strategically by releasing favorable and
 thereby more precise reports when the market underestimates earnings. In
 order not to jeopardize the bank-client relationship, they suppress
 negative information when the market is too optimistic. Combining
 situations where the market over- and underestimates earnings, we can
 replicate the unconditional positive bias in analyst forecasts found in
 the previous literature. Despite the bias in affiliated analysts'
 forecasts, they nonetheless selectively communicate valuable information
 to investors. Copyright 2006, Oxford University Press.

Title: Gender and Banking: Are Women Better Loan Officers? 
Abstract:
 Using a unique data set for a commercial bank in Albania, we analyze
 gender differences in loan officers' performance. Loans screened and
 monitored by female loan officers have a lower likelihood to turn
 problematic than loans handled by male loan officers. This effect cannot
 be explained by borrower or loan officer selection or differences in
 screening, work load, and experience. However, while the performance gap
 always exists for female borrowers, female loan officers only gain a
 performance advantage with male borrowers with experience and do not have
 an advantage with borrowers that are legal entities. We therefore
 interpret this as suggestive evidence for female loan officers' better
 capacity to build trust relationships with borrowers. Copyright 2013, Oxford University Press.

Title: Convertibles in Sequential Financing 
Abstract:
 Sequential financing is a popular strategy in corporate finance. However,
 depending on the type of financial instrument used to carry out the
 strategy, sequential financing can have many potential problems. This
 paper shows that certain types of convertibles can be deployed to resolve
 the problems completely. This may explain why convertibles are widely
 adopted to implement sequential financing in reality, especially among
 companies with many real options. We find that the call feature and some
 popular call restrictions are necessary for an efficient convertible.
 Indeed, almost all real-world convertibles have a call feature and call
 restrictions. Copyright 2009, Oxford University Press.

Title: The Fundamentals of Commodity Futures Returns 
Abstract:
 Commodity futures risk premiums vary across commodities and over time
 depending on the level of physical inventories. The convenience yield is a
 decreasing, nonlinear function of inventories. Price measures, such as the
 futures basis, prior futures returns, prior spot returns, and spot price
 volatilities reflect the state of inventories and are informative about
 commodity futures risk premiums. We verify these theoretical predictions
 using a comprehensive data set on 31 commodity futures and physical
 inventories between 1971 and 2010. We find no evidence that the positions
 of participants in futures markets predict risk premiums on commodity
 futures. Copyright 2013, Oxford University Press.

Title: Is College a Focal Point of Investor Life? 
Abstract:
 We study the link between college interaction and portfolio choice. We
 consider both the general imprinting of values shared by all the students
 attending the same school--values-based interaction--and the ensuing
 interaction with the classmates--bonding-based interaction. We show that
 even after controlling for the standard motivations of portfolio theory,
 college-based interaction affects the choice of styles--growth/value
 investing as well as stock picking. Both dimensions of
 interaction--values-based and bonding-based interactions--contribute to
 shape the investor choice. Overall, college interaction significantly
 affects portfolio choice. Investors invest in the same stocks in which
 their former classmates do. Each individual college leaves a specific and
 distinct trace on his students. Copyright 2011, Oxford University Press.

Title: Economic News and International Stock Market Co-movement 
Abstract:
 We analyze the effects that real-time domestic and foreign news about
 fundamentals have on the co-movement between stock returns of a small,
 open economy, Portugal, and a large economy, the United States. Consistent
 with our theoretical model, we find that US macroeconomic news and
 Portuguese earnings news do not affect stock market co-movement, whereas
 Portuguese macroeconomic news lowers stock market co-movement. We find
 that US news affects Portuguese stock market returns, though less so when
 US stock market returns are included in the regression. We provide
 evidence, contrary to common wisdom, that this last result does not derive
 from contagion. Copyright 2009, Oxford University Press.

Title: Decomposing European CDS Returns 
Abstract:
 Nearly half of the variation in European CDS returns is captured by a
 novel factor that mimics economic catastrophe risk. During the financial
 crisis of 2007--8, this factor became more important relative to other
 sources of risk, leading to a shift in the correlation structure of CDS
 returns. Using equivalent CDS and equity portfolios, we show that while
 crucial for explaining temporal and cross-sectional variation in CDS
 returns, the factor plays a lesser role for equity. This is likely due to
 the limited sensitivity of the equity value at default to whether the
 event is of systemic or idiosyncratic nature. Copyright 2010, Oxford University Press.

Title: A Theory of Net Debt and Transferable Human Capital 
Abstract:
 Traditional theories of capital structure do not explain the puzzling
 phenomena of zero-leverage firms and negative net debt ratios. We develop
 a theory where firms adopt a net debt target that acts as a balancing
 variable between equityholders and managers. Negative (positive) net debt
 occurs in human (physical) capital intensive industries. Negative net debt
 arises because tradeable claims cannot be issued against transferable
 human capital. Heterogeneity in capital structure occurs when firms have
 debt that is not fully collateralized. Physical capital intensive firms
 take on high leverage but may underlever to avoid bankruptcy costs. This
 creates excess rents for managers (even if the supply of human capital is
 competitive) because wealth constraints prevent managers from coinvesting. Copyright 2013, Oxford University Press.

Title: When Less (Potential Demand) Is More (Revenue): Asymmetric Bidding Capacities in Divisible Good Auctions 
Abstract:
		       We show that asymmetry in bidders’ capacity
 constraints plays an important role in inhibiting collusion and promoting
 competitive outcomes in multi-unit auctions in which the final value of
 the good is common knowledge. This effect appears to be related to the
 increased difficulty of coordination when there are significant
 differences between bidders. Due to its impact on collusive outcomes,
 asymmetry in bidding capacities has a more powerful impact on the seller’s
 revenue than does the auction type. Consistent with the finding in Sade et
 al. (2006) that the discriminatory auction is more susceptible to
 collusion than the uniform-price auction, asymmetry in capacity
 constraints has a greater impact in discriminatory auctions.		     Copyright Oxford University Press 2006

Title: Do Investors Suffer from Money Illusion? A Direct Test of the Modigliani--Cohn Hypothesis 
Abstract:
 We propose a direct test of the explanation by Modigliani and Cohn (MC)
 for the positive correlation between inflation and equity values--that it
 results from investors' money illusion. This explanation, unlike its main
 rivals, suggests that because in inflationary periods dividends will, on
 average, be higher than expected, dividend announcements will trigger
 positive abnormal returns. These will be higher the higher the inflation,
 and the more levered the firm. The behavior of abnormal returns of US
 stocks on dividend-announcement days from 1955 to 2007 supports these
 predictions. We investigate alternative explanations of our results. None
 dominates MC's. Copyright 2013, Oxford University Press.

Title: Equity Issues and Return Volatility 
Abstract:
 We show that the repurchaser--issuer return spread is stronger among
 stocks with high return volatility. Rational and behavioral theories
 predict that this finding is the product of risk volatility and sentiment
 volatility, respectively. However, our results are inconsistent with these
 theories as they currently stand. Loadings on standard risk factors do not
 follow the dynamics that would explain the return predictability related
 to issuance decisions. If we sort on a stock's beta with respect to the
 aggregate sentiment index of Baker and Wurgler (2006, J. Finance, 61,
 1645--1680), which proxies for sentiment volatility, the results are
 weaker--economically and statistically--than when sorting on return
 volatility. Copyright 2013, Oxford University Press.

Title: Institutional Investors as Minority Shareholders 
Abstract:
 We examine the link between minority shareholders' rights and corporate
 governance by studying institutional investors' voting patterns in a
 concentrated ownership environment. Institutions rarely vote against
 insider-sponsored proposals even when the law empowers the minority.
 Institutions vote against compensation-related proposals more often than
 against related party transactions even when minority shareholders cannot
 influence outcomes. Potentially conflicted institutions are more likely to
 vote for insiders' proposals than stand-alone investors, regardless of
 their effect on outcomes. A plausible conclusion is that empowering
 minority shareholders affects the selection of proposals but not actual
 voting; another is that empowering minority shareholders is ineffective
 without addressing conflicts of interest. Copyright 2013, Oxford University Press.

Title: A Welfare Analysis of Regulation in Relationship Banking Markets 
Abstract:
 The increasing dependence of individuals on debt financing raises several
 welfare considerations that we analyze in this paper. We develop a
 dynamic, competitive model of relationship banking to determine how
 regulation influences borrowing and lending behavior, and analyze how it
 affects welfare in the market. We characterize the lending regimes that
 arise based on public policy, and evaluate the optimal choice by the
 government to induce particular lending practices to arise. Finally, we
 consider the effect that a credit reporting agency has on the market. In
 the paper, we highlight the new empirical implications that the model
 generates. Copyright 2009, Oxford University Press.

Title: The Determinants of Mutual Fund Performance: A Cross-Country Study 
Abstract:
 We use a new data set to study the determinants of the performance of
 open--end actively managed equity mutual funds in 27 countries. We find
 that mutual funds underperform the market overall. The results show
 important differences in the determinants of fund performance in the USA
 and elsewhere in the world. The US evidence of diminishing returns to
 scale is not a universal truth as the performance of funds located outside
 the USA and funds that invest overseas is not negatively affected by
 scale. Our findings suggest that the adverse scale effects in the USA are
 related to liquidity constraints faced by funds that, by virtue of their
 style, have to invest in small and domestic stocks. Country
 characteristics also explain fund performance. Funds located in countries
 with liquid stock markets and strong legal institutions display better
 performance. Copyright 2013, Oxford University Press.

Title: Optimal Value and Growth Tilts in Long-Horizon Portfolios 
Abstract:
 We develop an analytical solution to the dynamic portfolio choice problem
 of an investor with power utility defined over wealth at a finite horizon,
 who faces a time-varying investment opportunity set, parameterized using a
 flexible vector autoregression. We apply this framework to study the
 horizon effects in the allocations of equity-only investors, who hold a
 mix of value and growth indices, and a more general investor, who also has
 access to Treasury bills and bonds. We find that the mean allocation of
 equity-only investors is heavily tilted towards value stocks at
 short-horizons, but the magnitude of this tilt declines dramatically with
 the investment horizon, implying that growth is less risky than value at
 long horizons. Investors with access to bills and bonds exhibit similar
 behavior, when value and growth tilts are computed relative to the total
 equity allocation of the portfolio. However, after accounting for the
 propensity of these investors to increase their total equity allocation as
 the horizon increases, the mean value tilt of the optimal allocation is
 shown to be positive and stable across time. Copyright 2011, Oxford University Press.

Title: The Positive Effects of Biased Self-Perceptions in Firms 
Abstract:
 We study a firm in which the marginal productivity of agents' effort
 increases with the effort of others. We show that the presence of an agent
 who overestimates his marginal productivity may make all agents better
 off, including the biased agent himself. This Pareto improvement is
 obtained even when compensation contracts are set endogenously to maximize
 firm value. We show that the presence of a leader improves coordination,
 but self-perception biases can never be Pareto-improving when they affect
 the leader. Self-perception biases are also shown to affect job
 assignments within firms and the likelihood and value of mergers. Copyright 2007, Oxford University Press.

Title: What Drives Market Share in the Mutual Fund Industry? 
Abstract:
 This article examines competition and investor behavior in the mutual fund
 industry for the universe of US mutual funds during 1976--2009. Over this
 period, industry assets increased by a factor of 200, the number of active
 fund families quadrupled, and the average market share of a family
 declined by four-fifths. We find that price competition and product
 differentiation are both effective strategies in obtaining market share.
 Families that pass along economies of scale to investors and those that
 charge lower fees than the competition gain market share, but only if
 these fees are above average to begin with. Loads and 12b-1 fees, however,
 have a positive effect on market share, consistent with the use of these
 types of fees for marketing and distribution. Families that perform
 better, offer a wider range of products, and start more funds relative to
 the competition (a measure of innovation) also have a higher market share.
 Innovation is rewarded more if the new fund is more differentiated from
 existing offerings. Overall, our evidence suggests that mutual fund
 families compete effectively along both price and non-price dimensions. Copyright 2011, Oxford University Press.

Title: The Real Option Value of Cash 
Abstract:
 This article focuses on the idea that cash has a real option value and it
 presents an explicit valuation framework of cash holdings in the context
 of a capacity expansion option. The model characterizes the optimal
 dynamic cash retention policy, the value of internal funds, and it
 provides a model implied regression specification based on simulated data.
 Results imply that high cash flow volatility decreases the value of cash
 and that optimal cash retention can actually delay investment relative to
 the case of full outside financing. Both novel implications are confirmed
 by subsequent empirical tests. Copyright 2013, Oxford University Press.

Title: The Risk Sensitivity of Capital Requirements: Evidence from an International Sample of Large Banks* 
Abstract:
 Using an international sample of large banks between 2000 and 2010, we
 evaluate the risk sensitivity of minimum capital requirements. Our results
 show that risk-weighted assets (the regulatory measure of portfolio risk,
 which determines minimum capital requirements) are ill-calibrated to a
 market measure of bank portfolio risk. We show that this low-risk
 sensitivity of capital requirements permits banks to build up capital
 buffers by underreporting their portfolio risk and undermines banks'
 ability to withstand adverse shocks. While the risk sensitivity of capital
 requirements is higher for banks that have adopted Basel II, it remains
 low across banks and countries. Copyright 2013, Oxford University Press.

Title: Survivorship Bias and Mutual Fund Performance: Relevance, Significance, and Methodical Differences 
Abstract:
 This is the first paper systematically calculating, testing and explaining
 different definitions of the survivorship bias in fund performance. We
 document that the survival-performance-relation is stronger for small
 funds and we find significant under-performance of non-survivors but no
 significant out-performance of new funds. Survivorship bias is still a
 problem as well in other fields of research, e.g., in countries where
 survivorship bias-free data is not available and because certain methods
 require truncated data. This paper provides guidance on how to deal with
 and reduce survivorship bias in empirical studies. Copyright 2010, Oxford University Press.

Title: Financial Markets Equilibrium with Heterogeneous Agents 
Abstract:
 This paper presents an equilibrium model in a pure exchange economy when
 investors have three possible sources of heterogeneity. Investors may
 differ in their beliefs, in their level of risk aversion, and in their
 time preference rate. The authors study the impact of investors'
 heterogeneity on equilibrium properties and, in particular, on the
 consumption shares, the market price of risk, the risk-free rate, the bond
 prices at different maturities, the stock price and volatility as well as
 on the stock's cumulative returns, and optimal portfolio strategies. The
 authors relate the heterogeneous economy with the family of associated
 homogeneous economies with only one class of investors. Cross-sectional as
 well as long-run properties are analyzed. Copyright 2011, Oxford University Press.

Title: Insuring Consumption Using Income-Linked Assets 
Abstract:
 We evaluate financial assets with payoffs linked to individual labor
 income, as conceived by Shiller (2003) and others. Using a realistically
 calibrated life-cycle model, we find that such assets can generate
 nontrivial welfare benefits, depending on the precise structure of the
 instrument. However, the assets we consider can only eliminate a
 relatively small fraction of the welfare costs of labor income risk over
 the life cycle. We highlight the fact that although the purpose of such
 assets is to smooth consumption across states of nature, one must also
 consider the assets' effects on households' ability to smooth consumption
 over time. Copyright 2011, Oxford University Press.

Title: Noise Trading and Illusory Correlations in US Equity Markets 
Abstract:
 This paper provides evidence that "illusory correlations"--a
 well-documented source of cognitive bias--lead some agents to be
 imperfectly rational noise traders. We focus on the head-and-shoulders
 chart pattern, considered by technical analysts to provide one of the most
 reliable trading signals. Our findings indicate that the pattern is
 associated with a substantial rise in trading volume even though it does
 not profitably predict directional movements. We further substantiate the
 connection between head-and-shoulders trading and imperfectly rational
 noise trading by showing that the pattern is associated with lower bid-ask
 spreads. Copyright 2013, Oxford University Press.

Title: Nonlinearity in Deviations from Uncovered Interest Parity: An Explanation of the Forward Bias Puzzle 
Abstract:
		       We provide empirical evidence that deviations from
 the uncovered interest rate parity (UIP) condition display significant
 nonlinearities, consistent with theories based on transactions costs or
 limits to speculation. This evidence suggests that the forward bias
 documented in the literature may be less indicative of major market
 inefficiencies than previously thought. Monte Carlo experiments allow us
 to reconcile these results with the large empirical literature on the
 forward bias puzzle since we show that, if the true process of UIP
 deviations were of the nonlinear form we consider, estimation of
 conventional spot-forward regressions would generate the anomalies
 documented in previous research.		     Copyright Oxford University Press Science+Business Media, Inc. 2006

Title: Comovement of Newly Added Stocks with National Market Indices: Evidence from Around the World 
Abstract:
 We document increased stock price comovement for companies added to major
 indices around the world. Using data on forty developed and emerging
 markets for 10 years, we find that in most markets, when added to a major
 index, firms experience an increase in their beta (especially if their
 pre-inclusion beta is low) and in the extent to which market returns
 explain firm stock returns (R-super-2). Stock turnover and analyst
 coverage also typically increase upon inclusion. Various empirical tests
 suggest that the category/habitat views of Barberis, Shleifer and Wurgler
 explain most of these results, although information-related factors also
 account for some findings. Copyright 2013, Oxford University Press.

Title: Suppressed Negative Information and Future Underperformance 
Abstract:
 I present evidence of inefficient information processing in equity markets
 by documenting that negative information withheld by securities analysts
 is incorporated in stock prices with a significant delay. I estimate the
 extent of the withheld negative information based on the proportion of
 analysts who stop revising their annual earnings forecasts. This measure
 predicts negative earnings surprises and negative price reaction around
 earnings announcements. It could also be used to generate profitable
 trading strategies. I show that institutions tend to sell their stock
 holdings as my measure of unreported negative news increases, thus
 ameliorating the mispricing. Copyright 2008, Oxford University Press.

Title: Resolving Macroeconomic Uncertainty in Stock and Bond Markets 
Abstract:
 We establish an empirical link between the ex-ante uncertainty about
 macroeconomic fundamentals and the ex-post resolution of this uncertainty
 in financial markets. We measure macroeconomic uncertainty using prices of
 economic derivatives and relate this measure to changes in implied
 volatilities of stock and bond options when the economic data is released.
 Higher macroeconomic uncertainty is associated with greater reduction in
 implied volatilities following the news release. It is also associated
 with increased volume and decreased open interest in option markets after
 the release, consistent with market participants using financial options
 to hedge or speculate on macroeconomic news. Copyright 2009, Oxford University Press.

Title: Risk in Islamic Banking 
Abstract:
 This article investigates risk and stability features of Islamic banking
 using a sample of 553 banks from 24 countries between 1999 and 2009. Small
 Islamic banks that are leveraged or based in countries with predominantly
 Muslim populations have lower credit risk than conventional banks. In
 terms of insolvency risk, small Islamic banks also appear more stable.
 Moreover, we find little evidence that Islamic banks charge rents to their
 customers for offering Shariá-compliant financial products. Our results
 also show that loan quality of Islamic banks is less responsive to
 domestic interest rates compared to conventional banks. Copyright 2013, Oxford University Press.

Title: An Examination of Mutual Fund Timing Ability Using Monthly Holdings Data 
Abstract:
 In this paper, the authors use monthly holdings to study timing ability.
 These data differ from holdings data used in previous studies in that the
 authors' data have a higher frequency and include a full range of
 securities, not just traded equities. Using a one-index model, the authors
 find, as do two recent studies, that management appears to have positive
 and statistically significant timing ability. When a multiindex model is
 used, the authors show that timing decisions do not result in an increase
 in performance, whether timing is measured using conditional or
 unconditional sensitivities. The authors show that sector rotation
 decisions with respect to high-tech stocks are a major contribution to
 negative timing. Copyright 2011, Oxford University Press.

Title: Approximate Equilibrium Asset Prices 
Abstract:
 Arguing that total consumer wealth is unobservable, we invert the
 (approximate) consumption function to reconstruct, in a world with
 Kreps-Porteus generalized isoelastic preferences, (i) the wealth that
 supports the agents' observed consumption as an optimal outcome and (ii)
 the rate of return on the consumers' wealth portfolio. This allows us to
 (approximately) price assets solely as a function of their payoffs and of
 consumption--in both homoskedastic or heteroskedastic environments. We
 compare implied equilibrium returns on the wealth portfolio to observed
 stock market returns and gauge whether the stock market is a good proxy
 for unobserved aggregate wealth. Copyright 2011, Oxford University Press.

Title: Cross-listing and Firm Growth 
Abstract:
 Extant research posits that cross-listing improves firms' access to lower
 cost external financing. But so far, there is scarce evidence that
 improved access to external funds through cross-listing contributes to
 higher firm growth. Documenting the relation between firm growth and
 cross-listing is critical because the presumption in prior research is
 that funds raised via cross-listing will be channeled towards potentially
 profitable projects. Using a sample of firms from thirty-seven countries
 that are cross-listed in the USA, we find a positive association between
 cross-listing and subsequent externally financed firm growth rates.
 However, we do not find that increases in externally financed firm growth
 after cross-listing vary systematically as a function of the home-country
 attributes of the cross-listed firms. Overall, our results provide new and
 direct evidence on the impact of cross-listing on the firm growth rates. Copyright 2008, Oxford University Press.

Title: Evolutionary Beliefs and Financial Markets 
Abstract:
 Why do investors keep different opinions even though they learn from their
 own failures and successes? Why do investors keep different opinions even
 though they observe each other and learn from their relative failures and
 successes? We analyze beliefs dynamics when beliefs result from a very
 general learning process that favors beliefs leading to higher absolute or
 relative utility levels. We show that such a process converges to the Nash
 equilibrium in a game of strategic belief choices. The asymptotic beliefs
 are subjective and heterogeneous across the agents. Optimism (respectively
 overconfidence) as well as pessimism (respectively doubt) emerge from the
 learning process. Furthermore, we obtain a positive correlation between
 pessimism (respectively doubt) and risk tolerance. Under reasonable
 assumptions, beliefs exhibit a pessimistic bias and, as a consequence, the
 risk premium is higher than in a standard setting. Copyright 2013, Oxford University Press.

Title: Informed Traders as Liquidity Providers: Anonymity, Liquidity and Price Formation 
Abstract:
 The tendency to introduce anonymity into financial markets apparently runs
 counter to the theory supporting transparency. This paper studies the
 impact of pre-trade transparency on liquidity in a market where
 risk-averse traders accommodate the liquidity demand of noise traders.
 When some risk-averse investors become informed, an adverse selection
 problem ensues for the others, making them reluctant to supply liquidity.
 Hence the disclosure of traders' identities improves liquidity by
 mitigating adverse selection. However, informed investors are effective
 liquidity suppliers, as their adverse selection and inventory costs are
 minimized. With endogenous information acquisition, transparency reduces
 the number of informed investors, thus decreasing liquidity. The type of
 information that traders hold and the effectiveness of insider trading
 regulation are crucial to distinguish between equilibria. Copyright 2008, Oxford University Press.

Title: An Examination of Heterogeneous Beliefs with a Short-Sale Constraint in a Dynamic Economy 
Abstract:
 We study the effects of a market-wide short-sale constraint in a dynamic
 economy with heterogeneous beliefs. Imposing the constraint reduces the
 stock price if the optimistic investors' intertemporal elasticity of
 substitution (IES) is less than one and increases the stock price if the
 optimist's IES is greater than one. In calibrated examples, the optimist's
 market price of risk falls and the interest rate rises when the constraint
 binds. Imposing the constraint leads to a higher stock volatility if the
 optimist's IES is less than one and a lower stock volatility if the IES is
 greater than one. Copyright 2008, Oxford University Press.

Title: Optimal Portfolio Choice over the Life Cycle with Flexible Work, Endogenous Retirement, and Lifetime Payouts 
Abstract:
 This paper derives optimal lifecycle asset allocations for consumers who
 select work hours and retirement ages given uncertain labor income and
 investment returns. These shocks shape retirement and asset allocation
 patterns in complex ways: negative labor market shocks and high stock
 returns influence the young to work less and buy more annuities, and
 later, to retire early. This flexibility enhances welfare; our model also
 fits several important empirical stylized facts including the two peaks in
 retirement rates, the hump-shaped pattern of work hours, the sizeable
 discontinuity in consumption at retirement, and low annuity take-ups of
 older households. Copyright 2011, Oxford University Press.

Title: Which Investors Leave Money on the Table? Evidence from Rights Issues 
Abstract:
 This study documents patterns of investor behavior around Finnish rights
 issues. We find that shareholders of issuing companies lost at least
 &euro;9.9 million in aggregate from 1995 to 2002 by exercising rights too
 early, selling rights in the open market below their intrinsic value, or
 leaving rights unexercised. At the investor level, the losses are modest.
 For example, the median household investor suffered a loss of &euro;135
 from not exercising or selling the rights. Investors with small
 portfolios, inactive trading history, those who know neither of the
 official languages in Finland, or who are living abroad leave money on the
 table the most. Copyright 2008, Oxford University Press.

Title: Portfolio Choice and Mental Health 
Abstract:
 Close to 30% of the US population experiences at least one mental or
 substance abuse disorder each year. Given the prevalence of mental health
 issues, this paper analyzes the role of mental health and cognitive
 functioning in household portfolio choice decisions. Generally, we find
 that households affected by mental health issues decrease investments in
 risky instruments. Various mental health issues can reduce the probability
 of holding risky assets by up to 19%. Moreover, single women diagnosed
 with psychological disorders increase investments in safe assets. We also
 find that cognitive functioning issues are associated with an increase in
 financial assets devoted to retirement accounts. Copyright 2013, Oxford University Press.

Title: Should Insider Trading be Prohibited when Share Repurchases are Allowed? 
Abstract:
 This paper considers share repurchases as the way long-term shareholders
 preserve their ability to use corporate information for speculative
 purposes when insider trading regulation is enforced. This use of
 corporate information increases the adverse selection losses of short-term
 shareholders. Thus, buy-back programs reduce their incentive to invest in
 stocks that back the most productive technology, leading to a socially
 inefficient equilibrium. It follows that insider trading should not be
 banned when share repurchases are allowed. More generally, the paper
 argues that the regulation of insider trading and repurchases can not be
 considered in isolation, and analyzes their interplay. Copyright 2008, Oxford University Press.

Title: The Effect of Financing Constraints on Risk 
Abstract:
 We provide evidence on the causal link between financing constraints and
 the risk of corporate cash flows and returns. For identification, we
 compare public US firms in the same industry, location, and size quintile,
 but whose access to bank credit was differentially affected by WorldCom's
 demise in 2002. A credit shortage induces a permanent increase in the
 volatility and skewness of operating cash flows and an increase in the
 correlation between firm stock and market returns. We document how firms'
 cash, payout, and investment policies respond endogenously to mitigate the
 impact of constraints on risk. Copyright 2013, Oxford University Press.

Title: A Long-Run Risks Model of Asset Pricing with Fat Tails 
Abstract:
 We explore the effects of fat tails on the equilibrium implications of the
 long-run risks model of asset pricing by introducing innovations with
 dampened power law to consumption and dividends growth processes. We
 estimate the model structural parameters by maximum likelihood. We find
 that the stochastic volatility model with fat tails can generate implied
 risk premium, expected risk free rate and their volatilities comparable to
 the magnitudes observed in data. The model with fat tails leads to a
 significant increase in implied risk premia over the benchmark Gaussian
 model, but similar values for other equilibrium quantities of interest. Copyright 2010, Oxford University Press.

Title: When Do Managers Seek Private Equity Backing in Public-to-Private Transactions? 
Abstract:
 Managers have the choice to take the firm private themselves in a
 management buyout or to seek private equity backing. We argue that
 managers seek private equity backing in case they are more constrained to
 finance the deal themselves. We confirm the hypothesis using a sample of
 UK public-to-private transactions over the period 1997--2003. A post going
 private performance analysis reveals that both management buyouts and
 private equity backed deals outperform their industry peers. However,
 private equity backed deals outperform their peers already before the deal
 takes place whereas management buyouts improve performance afterwards.
 This suggests a passive role for private equity firms in going private
 transactions. Copyright 2013, Oxford University Press.

Title: The External Financing of Emerging Markets--Evidence from Two Waves of Financial&nbsp;Globalization 
Abstract:
 What determines the yields at which international investors are willing to
 lend to emerging market countries, and the amounts of such lending? We
 analyze the motivation underlying investors' choices in allocating their
 holdings across countries, through regressions for both prices (bond
 yields) and quantities (bond market capitalization or stocks of external
 liabilities) estimated during two waves of financial globalization
 (1870--1913 and today). The results suggest that, throughout the past one
 and a half centuries, a combination of human capital (including informal
 human capital) and institutional quality has been a key determinant of
 emerging market countries' ability to attract international investors. Copyright 2011, Oxford University Press.

Title: The Origins of the German Corporation - Finance, Ownership and Control 
Abstract:
		       The ownership of German corporations is quite
 different today from that of Anglo-American firms. How did this come
 about? To what extent is it attributable to regulation? A specially
 constructed data set on financing and ownership of German corporations
 from the end of the 19th century to the middle of the 20th century reveals
 that, as in the UK, there was a high degree of activity on German stock
 markets with firms issuing equity in preference to borrowing from banks,
 and insider and family ownership declining rapidly. However, unlike in the
 UK, other companies and banks emerged as the main holders of equity, with
 banks holding shares primarily as custodians of other investors rather
 than on their own account. The changing pattern of ownership concentration
 was therefore very different from that of the UK with regulation
 reinforcing the control that banks exercised on behalf of other investors.  Copyright Oxford University Press Science+Business Media, LLC 2006

Title: Hide-and-Seek in the Market: Placing and Detecting Hidden Orders 
Abstract:
 This paper investigates why traders hide their orders and how other
 traders respond to hidden depth. Using a logit model, we provide empirical
 findings suggesting that traders use hidden orders to manage both exposure
 risk and picking off risk. Using probit models, we show that hidden depth
 increases order aggressiveness. Our interpretation of this empirical
 evidence is threefold. First, hidden depth detection is possible and
 frequent. Second, when traders detecthidden volume at the best opposite
 uote, they strategically adjust their order submission to seize the
 opportunity for depth improvement. Third, traders' response when hidden
 depth is detected suggests either that they do not associate hidden orders
 with informed trading or that the risk of trading with an informed trader
 is widely offset by the opportunity for depth improvement. Copyright 2007, Oxford University Press.

Title: Irrationality or Efficiency of Macroeconomic Survey Forecasts? Implications from the Anchoring Bias Test 
Abstract:
 Recent findings indicate that macroeconomic survey forecasts are anchoring
 biased and therefore are inefficient. However, despite highly significant
 test coefficients, a bias adjustment does not improve forecasts' quality.
 We find that the cognitive bias is a statistical artifact because the
 anchoring test is biased itself. In particular, it produces misleading
 results if macroeconomic analysts use more comprehensive information than
 assumed by the test. Our results have important implications for a wide
 range of empirical research relying on survey data to capture market
 participants' expectations, for example, studies analyzing the impact of
 macroeconomic conditions on asset prices, equity risk premiums, or market
 liquidity. Copyright 2013, Oxford University Press.

Title: Financial Integration and Firm Performance: Evidence from Foreign Bank Entry in Emerging Markets 
Abstract:
 While the positive growth effects of financial integration are extensively
 documented, little is known of its impact on small and young firms. This
 paper aims to fill this void relying on a panel of 60,000 firm-year
 observations on listed and unlisted companies in Eastern European
 economies to assess the differential impact of foreign bank lending on
 firm growth and financing. Foreign lending stimulates growth in firm
 sales, assets, and use of financial debt even though the effect is
 dampened for small firms. More strikingly, young firms benefit most from
 foreign bank presence, while businesses connected to domestic banks or to
 the government suffer. Overall, our findings suggest that foreign banks
 can help to mitigate connected-lending problems and to improve capital
 allocation. Copyright 2009, Oxford University Press.

Title: Informational Barriers to Entry into Credit Markets 
Abstract:
 Economic theory suggests that asymmetric information between incumbents
 and entrants can generate barriers to entry into credit markets.
 Incumbents have superior information about their own customers and the
 overall economic conditions of the local credit market. This implies that
 entrants are likely to experience higher loan default rates than the
 incumbents. We test these theoretical predictions using a unique database
 of 7,275 observations on 729 individual banks' lending in 95 Italian local
 markets. We find that informational asymmetries play a significant role in
 explaining entrants' loan default rates. The default rate is significantly
 higher for those banks that entered local markets without opening a
 branch, suggesting that having a branch on site may help to reduce the
 informational disadvantage. We also uncover a positive correlation between
 banks' loan default rates in individual local markets and the number of
 banks lending in that market. We argue that these informational barriers
 can help to explain why entry into many local credit markets by domestic
 and foreign banks was slow, even after substantial deregulation. Copyright 2006, Oxford University Press.

Title: Product Market Linkages, Manager Quality, and Mutual Fund Performance 
Abstract:
 Mutual funds typically invest a disproportionately large portion of their
 portfolio in one industry (main industry). We present a simple theoretical
 model to demonstrate that better mutual fund managers make larger
 investments in the important supplier/customer industries related to the
 main industry. Consistent with our theory, empirical tests on a large
 sample of mutual funds show that investment in related industries is
 positively associated with fund performance and plays a more significant
 role in explaining fund performance than investment in the main industry.
 Furthermore, the positive relation between main investment and fund
 performance obtains only when related investment is high. Copyright 2013, Oxford University Press.

Title: Investor Sentiment and Return Comovements: Evidence from Stock Splits and Headquarters Changes 
Abstract:
 We examine whether the trading activities of retail and institutional
 investors cause comovements in stock returns. Around stock splits, retail
 trading correlations (RTCs) decrease with stocks in the presplit price
 range and increase with stocks in the post-split price range. These shifts
 in RTCs induce changes in return comovements. In the cross section, return
 comovements among low-priced stocks are amplified when retail trades are
 more correlated and when aggregate uncertainty amplifies behavioral
 biases. We find similar patterns among local stocks and when firms change
 their corporate headquarters. In contrast to retail trading, institutional
 trading attenuates return comovements. Copyright 2013, Oxford University Press.

Title: Market Selection and Welfare in a Multi-asset Economy 
Abstract:
 We analyze the performance of irrational investors, who mistake expected
 returns of assets in a multi-asset economy. Mistakes by probabilistically
 unsophisticated investors that a priori seem small lead to severe
 underperformance compared with rational investors, under general
 conditions. Our results contrast with previous studies of single-asset
 economies, which find modest underperformance by irrational investors. In
 a calibration, an irrational investor who mistakes expected returns by 20%
 loses almost 95% of his consumption and wealth in about 25 years. The
 welfare cost of this underperformance is significant, about 40% of the
 total wealth in the economy. Copyright 2013, Oxford University Press.

Title: The Trading Volume Impact of Local Bias: Evidence from a Natural Experiment 
Abstract:
 Exploiting regional holidays in Germany as a source of exogenous
 cross-sectional variation in investor attention, we provide evidence that
 the well-known local bias at the individual level materially affects stock
 turnover at the firm level. Stocks of firms located in holiday regions are
 temporarily strikingly less traded than otherwise very similar stocks in
 non-holiday regions. This negative turnover shock survives comprehensive
 tests for differences in information release. It appears particularly
 pronounced in stocks less visible to nonlocal investors and for smaller
 stocks disproportionately driven by retail investors. Our findings
 contribute to research on local bias, trading activity, and investor
 distraction. Copyright 2012, Oxford University Press.

Title: Structuring the Initial Offering: Who to Sell To and How to Do It 
Abstract:
		       We develop a unified model of the issuer’s decisions
 that takes into account both mechanism design and adverse selection risk.
 The model enables us to determine the optimal amount of information
 gathering prior to setting the offer price, and to understand what does
 and does not cause underpricing. The flexibility to allocate securities
 between a pool of investors who provide pricingrelevant information and
 investors who do not provide information is key to controlling
 underpricing. Policies that guarantee a minimum allocation to investors in
 the pool result in underpricing; policies that cap the allocations to such
 investors do not. The optimal number of investors in the pool, and thus
 the amount of information acquired, generally increases with the riskiness
 of the issue. However, this relation breaks down if pool members are
 guaranteed minimum allocations.		    Copyright Oxford University Press 2006

Title: Priming the Risk Attitudes of Professionals in Financial Decision Making 
Abstract:
 We explore the influence of priming on financial decisions by reinforcing
 subjects' risk-seeking behavior under uncertainty and comparing it to
 behavior in control groups. We focused on professionals: commercial banks'
 investment advisors and accountants in CPA firms. Results indicate that
 priming affects subjects' risk attitudes and investment decisions.
 Professionals' decisions were affected more than undergraduates',
 suggesting they employ a more intuitive and less analytic approach in
 making their decisions. Our work is related to field-data research
 documenting correlations between returns (investors' decisions) and
 situational factors, (i.e., weather) by suggesting controlled tests of
 professionals' behavior vis-a-vis the complexity inherent in field data. Copyright 2008, Oxford University Press.

Title: Executive pay and shareholder litigation 
Abstract:
 The paper examines the impact of executive compensation on private
 securities litigation. We find that incentive pay in the form of options
 increases the probability of securities class action litigation, holding
 constant a wide range of firm characteristics. We further document that
 there is abnormal upward earnings manipulation during litigation class
 periods and that insiders exercise more options and sell more shares
 during class periods, but that this activity is largely driven by
 pre-existing option holdings of the managers. Our results suggest that
 option-based compensation may have the unintended side effect of giving
 executives an incentive to focus excessively on the short term share
 price. Copyright 2008, Oxford University Press.

Title: Market Anticipation of Fed Policy Changes and the Term Structure of Interest Rates 
Abstract:
 The Federal Reserve adjusts the federal funds target rate discretely,
 causing discontinuity in short-term interest rates. Unlike Poisson jumps,
 these adjustments are well anticipated by the market. We propose a term
 structure model that incorporates an anticipated jump component with known
 arrival times but random jump size. We find that doing so improves the
 model performance in capturing the term structure behavior. The mean jump
 sizes extracted from the term structure match the realized target rate
 changes well. Specification analysis indicates that the jump sizes show
 strong serial dependence and dependence on the interest-rate factors. Copyright 2010, Oxford University Press.

Title: Secret Reservation Prices in Bookbuilding 
Abstract:
 Why is the issuer's reservation price not disclosed in bookbuilding? We
 analyze the differential effect of reservation price disclosure on the
 underpricing required to elicit truthful indications of interest from
 investors. We find that a policy of disclosure would increase proceeds for
 firms with a reservation price sufficiently high relative to possible
 investor valuations of the shares, but would decrease proceeds for issuers
 with lower reservation prices. The former group is likely to be absent
 from the IPO market, explaining why secrecy in reservation prices is the
 norm. Copyright 2007, Oxford University Press.

Title: IPO Information Aggregation and Underwriter Quality 
Abstract:
 A key distinction between some models of IPO pricing (e.g., auctions and
 bookbuilding) and others (e.g., fixed-priced models) is whether price
 discovery occurs in the primary or secondary market. Higher investment
 bank reputation is associated with 1) more active filing price revisions
 and 2) reduced secondary market volatility, indicating greater resolution
 of uncertainty before trading begins. Revisions of nonreputable banks
 cluster on exactly zero dollars. Finally, the "partial adjustment"
 phenomenon -- often attributed to information aggregation -- is primarily
 due to the behavior of reputable underwriters. We conclude that
 theoretical models of primary market information aggregation are better
 suited for reputable underwriters. Copyright 2009, Oxford University Press.

Title: Debt and Capacity Commitments 
Abstract:
 In capital-intensive industries, firms face complicated multi-staged
 financing, investment, and production decisions under the watchful eye of
 existing and potential industry rivals. In various representations of this
 environment, we show that a first-mover advantage in debt weakly dominates
 a first-mover advantage in capacity. Without a first-mover advantage in
 debt, the incumbent may suffer a dead-weight loss. When both the entrant
 and incumbent deploy debt prior to capacity, a first-mover in capacity
 benefits from softer competition. With a long-purse debt cost, leading in
 debt still remains advantageous. Copyright 2013, Oxford University Press.

Title: Who Disciplines Bank Managers? 
Abstract:
 We exploit a unique data set of executive turnovers in community banks to
 test the micro-mechanisms of discipline by examining the monitoring and
 influencing role of different stakeholders. We find executives are more
 likely to be dismissed in risky institutions. Examining the roles of
 shareholders, debtholders, and regulators as monitors, we obtain evidence
 for shareholder discipline. However, there is no evidence that risk
 affects dismissals more if debtholders have a larger stake in the bank or
 when regulators are aware of distress. Examining the roles of
 shareholders, debtholders, and regulators as monitors, we obtain evidence
 for shareholder discipline. However, there is no evidence that risk
 affects dismissals more if debtholders have a larger stake in the bank or
 when regulators are aware of distress. When we analyze risk, losses, and
 profitability following turnovers, we obtain no evidence that replacing
 executives improves performance. Copyright 2011, Oxford University Press.

Title: Myopic Investment Management 
Abstract:
 Myopic loss aversion (MLA) has been proposed as an explanation for the
 equity premium puzzle, and experiments indicate that investors exhibit
 behavior consistent with MLA. But a caveat is that a large bulk of
 financial assets is managed by investment managers whose objectives may
 differ substantially from those of private investors. Most importantly
 they manage their clients' money, not their own. In this paper we test
 experimentally how individuals take risk with other people's ("clients")
 money. We find that subjects behave consistently with MLA over their
 clients' money and take less risk with their clients' money than with
 their own. Copyright 2010, Oxford University Press.

Title: Three Solutions to the Pricing Kernel Puzzle 
Abstract:
 The pricing kernel is an important link between economics and finance. In
 standard models of financial economics, it is proportional to the
 aggregate marginal utility in the economy. We first show that none of the
 three standard assumptions (completeness, risk aversion, and correct
 beliefs) is needed for the pricing kernel to be generally decreasing. If
 at least one of the three assumptions is violated, the pricing kernel can
 have increasing parts. We explain the economic principles that lead to an
 increasing part in the pricing kernel and compare the resulting pricing
 kernels with the empirical pricing kernel estimated in Jackwerth (2000,
 Rev. Financ. Stud., 13, 433--451). Copyright 2013, Oxford University Press.

Title: Performance Evaluation and Financial Market Runs 
Abstract:
 This paper develops a model in which performance evaluation causes runs by
 fund managers and results in asset fire sales. Performance evaluation
 nonetheless is efficient as it disciplines managers. Optimal performance
 evaluation combines absolute and relative components in order to make runs
 less likely. When runs induce large price discounts, this requires a high
 degree of absolute performance evaluation and a low degree of relative
 performance evaluation. The overall costs of using performance evaluation
 are shown to be decreasing in asset liquidity, implying that more
 developed financial markets should have more delegation. However, such
 markets are not less prone to runs. Copyright 2013, Oxford University Press.

Title: Bounded Rationality and Asset Pricing with Intermediate Consumption 
Abstract:
 We consider a pure exchange economy with incomplete information. Some
 agents display learning bias and over- or under-react to the arrival of
 new information. We show under which conditions biased agents survive over
 a finite horizon. We also study the distribution of irrational agents
 consumption shares. Irrational agents have a signi&THORN;cant consumption
 share in the economy when (i) shocks are less persistent (ii) risk
 aversion is high (iii) volatility of aggregate consumption is high. We
 also show that agents impact on prices is increasing in their consumption
 share and conclude that biased agents can signi&THORN;cantly influence
 equilibrium quantities. Copyright 2009, Oxford University Press.

Title: Default Risk of Advanced Economies: An Empirical Analysis of Credit Default Swaps during the Financial Crisis 
Abstract:
 Prices observed in the European sovereign credit default swap (CDS) market
 have severely increased since the beginning of the financial crisis. We
 document that the state of a country's financial system and, since the
 beginning of the crisis, also the state of the world financial system have
 strong explanatory power for the behavior of CDS spreads, and the
 magnitude of this impact depends on the importance of a country's
 financial system pre-crisis. Furthermore, Economic and Monetary Union
 member countries exhibit higher sensitivities to the health of the
 financial system. Our results suggest the presence of a private-to-public
 risk transfer through which market participants incorporate their
 expectations about financial industry bailouts. Copyright 2012, Oxford University Press.

Title: Equity Portfolio Diversification 
Abstract:
 This study shows that U.S. individual investors hold under-diversified
 portfolios, where the level of under-diversification is greater among
 younger, low-income, less-educated, and less-sophisticated investors. The
 level of under-diversification is also correlated with investment choices
 that are consistent with over-confidence, trend-following behavior, and
 local bias. Furthermore, investors who over-weight stocks with higher
 volatility and higher skewness are less diversified. In contrast, there is
 little evidence that portfolio size or transaction costs constrains
 diversification. Under-diversification is costly to most investors, but a
 small subset of investors under-diversify because of superior information. Copyright 2008, Oxford University Press.

Title: A Theory of Strategic Mergers 
Abstract:
 We examine firms' strategic incentives to engage in horizontal mergers. In
 a real options framework, we show that strategic considerations may
 explain abnormally high takeover activity during periods of positive and
 negative demand shocks. Importantly, this pattern emerges solely as a
 result of firms' strategic interaction in output markets. We show that the
 U-shaped relation between the state of demand and the propensity of firms
 to merge, documented in past studies, is driven by horizontal mergers in
 industries that are: (1) relatively more concentrated, (2) characterized
 by relatively strong competitive interaction among firms, and (3)
 characterized by relatively low merger-related operating synergies and
 restructuring costs. The empirical evidence, based on parametric and
 semi-parametric regression analyses, is consistent with these predictions. Copyright 2011, Oxford University Press.

Title: Operating Leverage 
Abstract:
 I derive and test implications of the operating leverage hypothesis for
 the cross-section of expected returns. Using a novel measure of operating
 leverage, I document that operating leverage predicts returns in the
 cross-section, and that strategies formed by sorting on operating leverage
 earn significant excess returns. Operating leverage also explains why the
 value premium is weak and non-monotonic across industries, but strong and
 monotonic within industries. Intra-industry differences in book-to-market
 are driven by differences in operating leverage, giving rise to expected
 return differences. Industry differences in book-to-market are driven by
 differences in the capital intensity of production unrelated to returns. Copyright 2011, Oxford University Press.

Title: Who takes Risks When and Why: Determinants of Changes in Investor Risk Taking* 
Abstract:
 Between September 08 and June 09, a period with significant market events,
 we surveyed UK online-brokerage customers at 3-month intervals for their
 willingness to take risk, 3-month expectations of returns and risks for
 the market and their own portfolio, and self-reported risk attitude. This
 unique dataset allowed us to analyze how these variables changed over
 time, and whether changes in risk taking were related to changes in
 expectations and/or risk attitudes. Risk taking changed substantially
 during the period, as did return and risk expectations. Numeric
 assessments of return and risk expectations were only weakly correlated
 with corresponding subjective judgments. Consistent with the
 risk-as-feelings hypothesis, changes in risk taking were associated with
 changes in subjective expectations of market portfolio risk and returns,
 but less with changes in numeric expectations. Copyright 2013, Oxford University Press.

Title: Internationalization and Stock Market Liquidity 
Abstract:
 What is the impact of internationalization (firms raising capital and
 trading in international markets) on the liquidity of the remaining firms
 in domestic markets&#x003F; To address this question, we assemble a panel
 database of nearly 2,900 firms from 45 emerging economies over the period
 1989-2000, constructed from annual and daily data. First, we find evidence
 of migration. The domestic trading of firms that cross-list or issue
 depositary receipts in foreign public exchanges tends to decrease, while a
 significant proportion of their trading activity concentrates in
 international markets. Second, this migration is negatively related to the
 liquidity of the remaining firms in their home market through two separate
 channels. There are liquidity spillovers within markets: Aggregate
 domestic trading activity is positively associated with the liquidity of
 individual firms in the same market. Moreover, the proportion of trading
 abroad is negatively related to the liquidity of firms in the domestic
 market. Copyright 2006, Oxford University Press.

Title: Hedging Surprises, Jumps, and Model Misspecification: A Risk Management Perspective on Hedging S&P 500 Options* 
Abstract:
 This article provides comprehensive tests of alternative jump-diffusion
 models for the purpose of hedging S&P 500 options. We explicitly take into
 account the risk arising from price and variance jumps and assess the
 hedging performance by focusing on the ability of competing specifications
 to forecast hedging errors. To this end, we devise density prediction
 tests and find evidence that jumps are important features of S&P 500 index
 dynamics. All jump-diffusion models tested in this article show signs of
 misspecification, but the inclusion of jumps can improve the hedging
 performance and risk assessment, especially in two-instrument hedges. Copyright 2013, Oxford University Press.

Title: Say on Pay Votes and CEO Compensation: Evidence from the UK 
Abstract:
 We examine the effect of say on pay regulation in the UK. Consistent with
 the view that shareholders regard say on pay as a value-creating
 mechanism, the regulation's announcement triggered a positive stock price
 reaction at firms with weak penalties for poor performance. UK firms
 responded to negative say on pay voting outcomes by removing controversial
 CEO pay practices criticized as rewards for failure (e.g., generous
 severance contracts) and increasing the sensitivity of pay to poor
 realizations of performance. Copyright 2013, Oxford University Press.

Title: A Dynamic Model of Optimal Capital Structure 
Abstract:
 This paper presents a continuous time model of a firm that can dynamically
 adjust both its capital structure and its investment choices. In the model
 we endogenize the investment choice as well as firm value, which are both
 determined by an exogenous price process that describes the firm's product
 market. Within the context of this model we explore cross-sectional as
 well as time-series variation in debt ratios. We pay particular attention
 to interactions between financial distress costs and
 debtholder/equityholder agency problems and examine how the ability to
 dynamically adjust the debt ratio affects the deviation of actual debt
 ratios from their targets. Regressions estimated on simulated data
 generated by our model are roughly consistent with actual regressions
 estimated in the empirical literature. Copyright 2007, Oxford University Press.

Title: Securities Auctions under Moral Hazard: An Experimental Study 
Abstract:
 In many settings, including venture capital financing, mergers and
 acquisitions, and lease competition, the structure of the contracts over
 which firms compete differs. Furthermore, the structure of the contract
 affects the future incentives of the firm to engage in value-creating
 activities by potentially diluting effort or investment incentives. We
 study, both theoretically and in the lab, the performance of debt and
 equity auctions in the presence of both private information and hidden
 effort. We show that the revenues to sellers in debt and equity auctions
 differ systematically depending on the returns to entrepreneurial effort.
 Using a controlled laboratory experiments we test the model's predictions
 and find strong support for the theory. Copyright 2010, Oxford University Press.

Title: The Financial Accelerator: Evidence from International Housing Markets 
Abstract:
		       This paper shows novel evidence on the mechanism
 through which financial constraints amplify fluctuations in asset prices
 and credit demand. It does so using contractual features of housing
 finance. Among agents whose housing demand is constrained by the
 availability of collateral, those who can borrow against a larger fraction
 of their housing value (achieve a higher loan-tovalue, or LTV, ratio) have
 more procyclical debt capacity. This procyclicality underlies the
 financial accelerator mechanism. Our study uses international variation in
 LTV ratios over three decades to test whether (a) housing prices and (b)
 demand for new mortgage borrowings are more sensitive to income shocks in
 countries where households can achieve higher LTV ratios. The results we
 obtain are consistent with the dynamics of a collateral-based financial
 accelerator in international housing markets.			  Copyright Oxford University Press 2006

Title: The Basel Accord and the Value of Bank Differentiation 
Abstract:
 The authors investigate optimal capital requirements in a model in which
 banks decide on their investment in credit scoring systems. The main
 result is that regulators should encourage sophisticated banks to keep
 their asset portfolios safe, while assets with high systematic risk should
 be concentrated in smaller banks. The proposed regulatory differentiation
 follows the Basel Accord's distinction between internal ratings-based
 approach and standard approach. Sophisticated banks should increase their
 equity capital relative to other banks, leading to further size
 differentiation. The moral hazard problem of banks misrepresenting their
 loan portfolio risk is analyzed, with the result that it induces stricter
 capital requirements. Copyright 2012, Oxford University Press.

Title: The Role of Venture Capital Syndication in Value Creation for Entrepreneurial Firms 
Abstract:
 This paper provides evidence that venture capital (VC) syndication creates
 value for entrepreneurial firms in two dimensions. First, VC syndication
 creates product market value for their portfolio firms. Specifically, VC
 syndicates invest significant amounts in younger firms, in earlier
 financing rounds, and in early stage firms. Further, VC syndicates nurture
 innovation of their portfolio firms and help them achieve better
 post-initial public offering operating performance. Second, VC syndication
 creates financial market value for their portfolio firms. Specifically, VC
 syndicate-backed firms are more likely to have a successful exit, enjoy a
 lower initial public offering (IPO) underpricing, and receive a higher IPO
 market valuation. The findings are robust to a variety of alternative
 syndication measures, subsamples, econometric models, and controlling for
 endogeneity in VC syndication. Copyright 2011, Oxford University Press.

Title: Trust and the Choice Between Housing and Financial Assets: Evidence from Spanish Households 
Abstract:
 Trusting behavior has been shown to affect households' portfolio choice
 between risky and risk-free financial assets. We extend the analysis to
 include the dominant component of households' portfolios, real estate.
 Using data from the European Social Survey, we estimate individual-level
 trust by applying a hierarchical item response model. Combining these
 estimates with data on Spanish households' financial decisions from the
 Survey of Household Finances, we show that households with less trust
 invest more in housing and less in financial assets, in particular risky
 ones. Trust thus may drive not only (limited) stock market participation
 but also financial development more generally. Copyright 2011, Oxford University Press.

Title: Optimal Annuity Risk Management 
Abstract:
 This paper studies the life-cycle consumption and portfolio choice problem
 taking account of annuity risk at retirement. The study allows for
 government-provided annuity income. Optimally, households allocate
 retirement wealth to nominal, inflation-linked and variable annuities, and
 condition this choice on the state of the economy. The case in which there
 are limitations in the types of annuities that are available is also
 considered and the costs of annuity market incompleteness are quantified.
 Subsequently, the paper determines how investors optimally anticipate
 annuitization before retirement. The conclusion is that ignoring annuity
 risk before and at retirement can be economically costly. Copyright 2011, Oxford University Press.

Title: When No Law is Better Than a Good Law 
Abstract:
 This paper argues, both theoretically and empirically, that sometimes no
 securities law may be better than a good securities law that is not
 enforced. The first part of the paper formalizes the sufficient conditions
 under which this happens for any law. The second part of the paper shows
 that a specific securities law -- the law prohibiting insider trading --
 may satisfy these conditions. The third part of the paper takes this
 prediction to the data. We find that the cost of equity actually rises
 when some countries enact an insider trading law, but do not enforce it. Copyright 2009, Oxford University Press.

Title: Sources of Momentum Profits: Evidence on the Irrelevance of Characteristics 
Abstract:
 Several recent studies document that sorting stocks first on certain
 stock-level characteristics and then on past returns results in elevated
 momentum profits. We show that such strategies enhance momentum profits
 simply by trading in stocks with more extreme past returns. Adjusted for
 this effect, elevated momentum profits resulting from characteristics
 (size, R-super-2, turnover, age, analyst coverage, analyst forecast
 dispersion, market-to-book, price, illiquidity, credit rating) disappear
 almost entirely. Interaction patterns have been used to support behavioral
 and limits-to-arbitrage explanations of momentum; our findings imply that
 explanations of momentum should instead focus on the link between momentum
 profits and extreme past returns. Copyright 2013, Oxford University Press.

Title: Do Public Equity Markets Matter in Emerging Economies? Evidence from India 
Abstract:
 Do public equity markets serve an unique role that is not easily served by
 other forms of financing in emerging economies? We analyze this question
 using the collapse of India's equity market in 1997, which provides an
 exogenous shock to firms' ability to issue equity. We find that both
 public and private firms exhibit higher bankruptcy rates and lower growth
 after 1997. The decline in growth is greater among firms with more
 external finance needs and fewer tangible assets. Overall, the evidence
 suggests that public equity markets are an important, not easily replaced,
 source of finance in emerging economies. Copyright 2013, Oxford University Press.

Title: Institutional Investors and Private Equity 
Abstract:
 Entrepreneurial finance literature has highlighted that institutional
 investors are the main contributors to private equity funds. This paper
 complements these findings by documenting that institutional investors
 also invest directly in private equity. A major concern for such
 investments is the higher agency costs associated with private equity. We
 show that institutions invest in private firms with governance mechanisms
 that tend to reduce the expected agency costs and risk of minority
 expropriation. Good governance mechanisms further allow institutional
 investors to enjoy the benefits of syndication and thereby reduce
 idiosyncratic risk. In addition, we show that institutional investments
 tend to be followed by further improvements in corporate governance and
 tend to occur in high-growth firms within research and development
 intensive industries. Copyright 2008, Oxford University Press.

Title: Bank Market Power and SME Financing Constraints 
Abstract:
 Some studies find that market power is associated with credit availability
 (information hypothesis); others find that less competitive banking
 markets lead to more credit rationing (market power hypothesis). Empirical
 research has relied solely on concentration as a measure of market power.
 The industrial organization literature, however, argues that a structural
 competition indicator such as the Lerner index is a superior measure. We
 test the information hypothesis and the market power hypothesis using
 these two alternative measures of market power and find that they
 generally give conflicting results. However, we also offer evidence
 suggesting that both views can be reconciled. Copyright 2009, Oxford University Press.

Title: How the 52-Week High and Low Affect Option-Implied Volatilities and Stock Return Moments 
Abstract:
 We provide a new perspective on option and stock price behavior around
 52-week highs and lows. We analyze whether option-implied volatilities
 (IVs) change when stock prices approach or break through their 52-week
 high or low. We also study the effects of highs and lows on a stock's beta
 and return volatility. We find that IVs and stock betas decrease when
 approaching a high or low, and that volatilities increase after
 breakthroughs. The effects are economically large and significant. The
 approach results can be explained by the anchoring theory. The
 breakthrough results are consistent with anchoring and the investor
 attention hypothesis. Copyright 2013, Oxford University Press.

Title: A Convergence Model of the Term Structure of Interest Rates 
Abstract:
 This paper develops a convergence model of the term structure of interest
 rates in context of entering the European Monetary Union (EMU). Compared
 to other models developed so far in this field, our model specification
 ensures convergence of the domestic short-term interest rates to the euro
 area ones. We achieve this convergence by stating that the spread between
 domestic and euro short-term interest rate follows the Brownian bridge
 process. We also develop an econometric counterpart of the theoretical
 model. To tackle the problem of nonstationarity and nonlinearity of the
 model, we apply the extended Kalman filter for coefficient estimation. Copyright 2010, Oxford University Press.

Title: A Dynamic Analysis of Growth via Acquisition 
Abstract:
 Firms can grow through internal investment or through acquisition. While
 internal growth takes time, an acquisition provides cash flows
 immediately. The opportunity to grow internally affects the price of an
 acquisition as it is a fall-back option for the acquirer should
 negotiations break down. Assuming investors do not have full information
 about the time a firm requires to grow internally, acquirers earn positive
 returns before the announcement of an acquisition, and there are negative
 stock price reactions to acquisition announcements. This research provides
 predictions about how pre-announcement price run-up and negative
 announcement returns relate to integration costs and synergies from
 acquisition. Copyright 2008, Oxford University Press.

Title: Large Investors, Price Manipulation, and Limits to Arbitrage: An Anatomy of Market Corners 
Abstract:
		       Corners were prevalent in the nineteenth and early
 twentieth century. We first develop a rational expectations model of
 corners and show that they can arise as the result of rational behavior.
 Then, using a novel hand-collected data set, we investigate price and
 trading behavior around several well-known stock market and commodity
 corners which occurred between 1863 and 1980. We find strong evidence that
 large investors and corporate insiders possess market power that allows
 them to manipulate prices. Manipulation leading to a market corner tends
 to increase market volatility and has an adverse price impact on other
 assets. We also find that the presence of large investors makes it risky
 for would-be short sellers to trade against the mispricing. Therefore,
 regulators and exchanges need to be concerned about ensuring that corners
 do not take place since they are accompanied by severe price distortions.   Copyright Oxford University Press Science+Business Media, LLC 2006

Title: An Empirical Portfolio Perspective on Option Pricing Anomalies 
Abstract:
 We empirically study the economic benefits of giving investors access to
 index options in the standard portfolio problem, analyzing both
 expected-utility and nonexpected-utility investors in order to understand
 who optimally buys and sells options. Using data on S&P 500 index options,
 CRRA investors find it always optimal to short out-of-the-money puts and
 at-the-money straddles. The option positions are economically and
 statistically significant and robust to corrections for transaction costs,
 margin requirements, and Peso problems. Loss-averse and
 disappointment-averse investors also optimally hold short option
 positions. Only with highly distorted probability assessments can we
 obtain positive portfolio weights for puts (cumulative prospect theory and
 anticipated utility) and straddles (anticipated utility). Copyright 2007, Oxford University Press.

Title: Understanding the Real Rate Conundrum: An Application of No-Arbitrage Models to the UK Real Yield Curve 
Abstract:
 During 2004 and 2005, long-horizon interest rates fell sharply in major
 international government bond markets (Greenspan's "conundrum"). This
 common fall mainly reflected lower long real rates. To investigate
 possible causes, the authors apply a no-arbitrage affine modeling
 framework to understanding the UK real term structure. The authors find
 that time-varying term premia are important in explaining movements in
 long real forward rates. And, although there is evidence that long-horizon
 expected short real rates declined over the conundrum period, the authors'
 results suggest that lower term premia played the dominant role. This
 could be consistent with the so-called "search for yield" and excess
 liquidity explanations for the conundrum. Copyright 2011, Oxford University Press.

Title: Supervisory Effectiveness and Bank Risk 
Abstract:
 This paper investigates the role of banking supervision in controlling
 bank risk. Banking supervision is measured in terms of enforcement outputs
 (i.e., on-site audits and sanctions). Our results show an inverted
 U-shaped relationship between on-site audits and bank risk, while the
 relationship between sanctions and risk appears to be linear and negative.
 We also consider the combined effect of effective supervision and banking
 regulation (in the form of capital and market discipline requirements) on
 bank risk. We find that effective supervision and market discipline
 requirements are important and complementary mechanisms in reducing bank
 fragility. This is in contrast to capital requirements, which prove to be
 rather futile in controlling bank risk, even when supplemented with a
 higher volume of on-site audits and sanctions. Copyright 2011, Oxford University Press.

Title: Credit Card Debt Puzzles and Debt Revolvers for Self Control 
Abstract:
 Most US credit card holders revolve high-interest debt, often with
 substantial liquid and retirement assets. We model separation of
 accounting from shopping allowed by credit cards, in a rational, dynamic
 game. When the shopper is more impatient than the accountant, selling
 assets to repay debt is not necessarily optimal, as the shopper can
 restore debt. Modest relative impatience generates asset-debt co-existence
 and target utilization rates, matching incidence and median assets of debt
 revolvers with substantial assets. Empirical evidence is consistent with a
 role for spending control considerations, after allowing for standard
 determinants of credit card debt. Copyright 2009, Oxford University Press.

Title: Inducing Agents to Report Hidden Trades: A Theory of an Intermediary 
Abstract:
 When contracts are unobserved (and nonexclusive), agents can promise the
 same asset to multiple counterparties and subsequently default. I show
 that a central mechanism can extract all relevant information about
 contracts that agents enter by inducing them to report one another. The
 mechanism sets position limits and reveals the names of agents who hit the
 limits according to (voluntary) reports from their counterparties. This
 holds even if sending reports is costly and even if agents can collude. In
 some cases, an agent's position limit must be nonbinding in equilibrium.
 The mechanism has some features of a clearinghouse. Copyright 2012, Oxford University Press.

Title: Banks, Distances and Firms' Financing Constraints 
Abstract:
 Bank deregulation and progress in information technology altered the
 geographical diffusion of banking structures and instruments, and reduced
 operational distance between banks and local economies. Although, the
 consolidation of the banking industry promoted the geographical
 concentration of banking decision-making centres and increased functional
 distance between local banking systems and local borrowers. This paper
 focuses on the impact that these spatial diffusion-concentration phenomena
 had on the financing constraints of Italian firms over the period
 1996--2003. Our findings show that greater functional distance stiffened
 financing constraints, especially for small firms, while smaller
 operational distance did not always enhance credit availability. Copyright 2009, Oxford University Press.

Title: One Share - One Vote: the Theory 
Abstract:
 The theoretical literature on security-voting structure can be organized
 around three questions: What impact do nonvoting shares have on takeover
 outcomes? How does disproportional voting power affect the incentives of
 blockholders? What are the repercussions of mandating one share - one vote
 for firms' financing and ownership choices? Overall, the costs and
 benefits of separating cash flow and votes reflect the fundamental
 governance trade off between disempowering blockholders and empowering
 managers. It is therefore an open question whether mandating one share -
 one vote would improve the quality of corporate governance, notably in
 systems that so far relied on active owners. Copyright 2008, Oxford University Press.

Title: What Does Stock Ownership Breadth Measure? 
Abstract:
 Using holdings data on a representative sample of all Shanghai Stock
 Exchange investors, we show that increases in ownership breadth (the
 fraction of market participants who own a stock) predict low returns:
 highest change quintile stocks underperform lowest quintile stocks by 23%
 per year. Small retail investors drive this result. Retail ownership
 breadth increases appear to be correlated with overpricing. Among
 institutional investors, however, the opposite holds: stocks in the top
 decile of wealth-weighted institutional breadth change outperform the
 bottom decile by 8% per year, consistent with prior work that interprets
 breadth as a measure of short-sales constraints. Copyright 2013, Oxford University Press.

Title: Competition in Lending: Theory and Experiments 
Abstract:
 A variation of the Rothschild-Stiglitz' equilibrium is examined in the
 context of competitive lending under adverse selection. The predictions of
 the model are tested in an experimental market setting. If equilibrium
 exists, the loan contracts offered and taken should separate projects by
 quality. When equilibrium exists, the experiments confirm the theory. The
 entrepreneurs with high-risk projects take bigger loans and pay higher
 credit spreads than those with low-risk projects. When equilibrium does
 not exist, which happens exactly when the candidate equilibrium does not
 provide a Pareto-optimal allocation, in half of the sessions loan trading
 stabilizes around the candidate equilibrium pair. In the other half,
 however, markets never settle down. This finding has important
 implications. When lenders can offer menus of contracts, as is usually the
 case in reality, the outcome may not be the zero-profit separating
 contracts of the standard model. Worse, fitting the standard model to
 field data may lead to serious biases in estimated parameters while
 falsely accepting the model's main restriction (separation). Copyright 2006, Oxford University Press.

Title: Corporate Governance Externalities 
Abstract:
 When firms compete in the managerial labor market, the choice of corporate
 governance by a firm affects, and is affected by, the choice of governance
 by other firms. Firms with weaker governance offer managers more generous
 incentive compensation, which induces firms with good governance to also
 overpay their management. Due to this externality, overall level of
 governance in the economy can be inefficiently low. Poor governance can in
 fact be employed by incumbent firms to deter entry by new firms. Such
 corporate governance externalities have important implications for
 regulatory standards, ownership structure of firms, and the market for
 corporate control. Copyright 2010, Oxford University Press.

Title: Bottom-Up Corporate Governance 
Abstract:
 This article empirically relates the internal organization of a firm with
 decision making quality and corporate performance. We call "independent
 from the CEO" a top executive who joined the firm before the current CEO
 was appointed. In a very robust way, firms with a smaller fraction of
 independent executives exhibit (1) a lower level of profitability and (2)
 lower shareholder returns following large acquisitions. These results are
 unaffected when we control for traditional governance measures such as
 board independence or other well-studied shareholder friendly provisions.
 One interpretation is that "independently minded" top ranking executives
 act as a counter-power imposing strong discipline on their CEO, even
 though they are formally under his authority. Copyright 2013, Oxford University Press.

Title: Target-firm information asymmetry and acquirer&nbsp;returns 
Abstract:
 We show that acquirer returns are significantly higher in stock-swap
 acquisitions of difficult-to-value targets, as measured by R&D intensity
 and idiosyncratic return volatility. This finding contributes to an
 explanation of the determinants of, and value gains from, using stock as a
 method of payment. The effects of target-valuation uncertainty on both the
 method of payment and the market reaction to acquisitions are more likely
 to be apparent in samples of private acquisitions, as these effects can be
 masked in samples of acquisitions of publicly held targets. Nevertheless,
 our results hold for publicly traded targets in multivariate analysis. Copyright 2009, Oxford University Press.

Title: Why Do Firms Pay Dividends?: Evidence from an Early and Unregulated Capital Market 
Abstract:
 Why do firms pay dividends? To answer this question, we use a
 hand-collected data set of companies traded on the London stock market
 between 1825 and 1870. As tax rates were effectively zero, the capital
 market was unregulated, and there were no institutional stockholders, we
 can rule out these potential determinants ex ante. We find that, even
 though they were legal, share repurchases were not used by firms to return
 cash to shareholders. Instead, our evidence provides support for the
 information--communication explanation for dividends, while providing
 little support for agency, illiquidity, catering, or behavioral
 explanations. Copyright 2013, Oxford University Press.

Title: Modeling Market Downside Volatility 
Abstract:
 We propose a new methodology for modeling and estimating time-varying
 downside risk and upside uncertainty in equity returns and for assessment
 of risk--return trade-off in financial markets. Using the salient features
 of the binormal distribution, we explicitly relate downside risk and
 upside uncertainty to conditional heteroskedasticity and asymmetry through
 binormal GARCH (BiN-GARCH) model. Based on S&P 500 and international index
 returns, we find strong empirical support for existence of significant
 relative downside risk, and robust positive relationship between relative
 downside risk and conditional mode. Copyright 2013, Oxford University Press.

Title: Franchising Microfinance 
Abstract:
 Financial intermediaries worldwide are seeking mechanisms for
 participating in micro lending. Using informed "local capitalists" as
 bank's on-lenders fails due to borrowers' incentive to default with
 multiple credit sources. A coalition of local capitalists may not resolve
 the problem in the presence of a monopoly moneylender with superior skills
 in lending and enforcement. A credible competitive threat to the
 moneylender can only arise if the local capitalist coalition also provides
 information sharing benefits that lower their cost of lending vis-à-vis
 the moneylender. Franchising allows local capitalists to form such a
 coalition. We analyze conditions under which welfare-enhancing franchising
 would obtain. Copyright 2010, Oxford University Press.

Title: Bankers on the Boards of German Firms: What They Do, What They Are Worth, and Why They Are (Still) There 
Abstract:
 We analyze the role of bankers on the boards of German non-financial
 companies for the period from 1994 to 2005. We find that banks that are
 represented on a firm's board promote their own business as lenders and as
 M&A advisors. They also seem to act as financial experts who help firms to
 obtain funding, especially in difficult times. We find little evidence
 that bankers monitor management and suggest that bankers on the board
 cause a decline in the valuations of non-financial firms. Banks' equity
 ownership declined sharply during our sample period and the German
 financial system lost some of its formerly distinctive features. Copyright 2010, Oxford University Press.

Title: How Duration Between Trades of Underlying Securities Affects Option Prices 
Abstract:
 We propose a model for stock price dynamics that explicitly incorporates
 random waiting times between trades, also known as duration, and show how
 option prices can be calculated using this model. We use
 ultra-high-frequency data for blue-chip companies to motivate a particular
 choice of waiting-time distribution and then calibrate risk-neutral
 parameters from options data. We also show that the convexity commonly
 observed in implied volatilities may be explained by the presence of
 duration between trades. Furthermore, we find that, ceteris paribus,
 implied volatility decreases in the presence of longer durations, a result
 consistent with the findings of Engle (2000) and Dufour and Engle (2000)
 which demonstrates the relationship between levels of activity and
 volatility for stock prices. Finally, by directly employing information
 given by time-stamps of trades, our approach provides a direct link
 between the literature on stochastic time changes and business time (see
 Clark (1973)) and, at the same time, highlights the link between number
 and time of arrival of transactions with implied volatility and stochastic
 volatility models. Copyright 2010, Oxford University Press.

Title: Managerial Incentives and Corporate Fraud: The Sources of Incentives&nbsp;Matter 
Abstract:
 Operating performance and stock return results imply that managers who
 commit fraud anticipate large stock price declines if they were to report
 truthfully, which would cause greater losses for managerial stockholdings
 than for options because of differences in convexity. Fraud firms have
 significantly greater incentives from unrestricted stockholdings than
 control firms do, and unrestricted stockholdings are their largest
 incentive source. Our results emphasize the importance of the shape and
 vesting status of incentive payoffs in providing incentives to commit
 fraud. Fraud firms also have characteristics that suggest a lower
 likelihood of fraud detection, which implies lower expected costs of
 fraud. Copyright 2009, Oxford University Press.

Title: Information Asymmetry, Information Precision, and the Cost of Capital 
Abstract:
 This paper examines the relation between information differences across
 investors (i.e., information asymmetry) and the cost of capital and
 establishes that with perfect competition information asymmetry makes no
 difference. Instead, a firm's cost of capital is governed solely by the
 average precision of investors' information. With imperfect competition,
 however, information asymmetry affects the cost of capital even after
 controlling for investors' average precision. In other words, the capital
 market's degree of competition plays a critical role for the relation
 between information asymmetry and the cost of capital. This point is
 important to empirical research in finance and accounting. Copyright 2011, Oxford University Press.

Title: Option-Implied Measures of Equity Risk 
Abstract:
 Equity risk measured by beta is of great interest to both academics and
 practitioners. Existing estimates of beta use historical returns. Many
 studies have found option-implied volatility to be a strong predictor of
 future realized volatility. We find that option-implied volatility and
 skewness are also good predictors of future realized beta. Motivated by
 this finding, we establish a set of assumptions needed to construct a beta
 estimate from option-implied return moments using equity and index
 options. This beta can be computed using only option data on a single day.
 It is therefore potentially able to reflect sudden changes in the
 structure of the underlying company. Copyright 2011, Oxford University Press.

Title: Venture Capital and Corporate Governance in the Newly Public Firm 
Abstract:
 I examine the effects of venture capital backing on the corporate
 governance of the entrepreneurial firm at the time of transition from
 private to public ownership. Using a selection model framework that
 instruments for venture backing with variations in the supply of venture
 capital, I conduct three sets of tests comparing corporate governance in
 venture- and non--venture-backed initial public offering (IPO) firms.
 Venture-backed firms have lower levels of earnings management, more
 positive reactions to the adoption of shareholder rights agreements, and
 more independent board structures than similar non--venture-backed firms,
 consistent with better governance. These effects are not common to all
 pre-IPO large shareholders. Copyright 2011, Oxford University Press.

Title: Do Firms Believe in Interest Rate Parity? 
Abstract:
 Using a broad sample of international corporate bond offerings, we provide
 evidence that corporate borrowers make opportunistic currency choices, in
 that they denominate the currency of their bonds in a manner that is
 inconsistent with a belief in either covered or uncovered interest rate
 parity. Using firm-level tests, we identify a number of characteristics of
 firms that engage in opportunistic behavior. We observe that large issuers
 located in developed markets with investment-grade ratings and low cash
 flow characterize those firms that are responsive to covered borrowing
 rate differences across currencies. Corporate responsiveness to uncovered
 borrowing rate differences appears more general. We observe that although
 the gains firms achieve through opportunistic currency denomination are
 economically significant, the yield differential tends to systematically
 decline after issuance. This finding suggests that opportunistic issuance
 by corporations may be a primary mechanism for driving covered interest
 yields toward parity. Copyright 2010, Oxford University Press.

Title: Trading Costs in Early Securities Markets: The Case of the Berlin Stock Exchange 1880–1910 
Abstract:
		       Based on daily prices (amtliche Kurse) we estimate
 effective spreads of securities traded at the Berlin Stock Exchange in
 1880, 1890, 1900 and 1910. Several extensions of the Roll measure are
 applied. We find surprisingly tight effective spreads for the historical
 data, comparable with similar measures of the MDAX and DAX at the end of
 the 20th century.		      Copyright Oxford University Press Science+Business Media, LLC 2006

Title: Trading and Under-Diversification 
Abstract:
 This article documents a link between trading and diversification by using
 detailed trading records from a Swedish discount broker matched with
 individual tax records. Diversification is measured by the investors'
 stake size, defined as the fraction of their risky financial wealth
 invested in individual stocks through the broker under study. High-stake
 investors have concentrated portfolios, trade more, and achieve lower
 trading performance. They share several features with those who trade
 excessively, namely lower income, wealth, age, and education, suggesting
 that they lack investment expertise. The results directly imply that
 trading losses in the cross-section are mainly borne by those who can
 least afford them. Copyright 2013, Oxford University Press.

Title: What Caused the Bank Capital Build-up of the 1990s? 
Abstract:
 Large U.S. banks dramatically increased their capitalization during the
 1990s, to the highest levels in more than 50 years. We document this
 buildup of capital and evaluate several potential motivations. Our results
 support the hypothesis that regulatory innovations in the early 1990s
 weakened conjectural government guarantees and enhanced bank
 counterparties' incentives to monitor and price default risk. We find no
 evidence that a bank holding company's (BHC's) market capitalization
 increases with its asset volatility prior to 1994. Thereafter, the data
 display a strong cross-sectional relation between capitalization and asset
 risk. Copyright 2008, Oxford University Press.

Title: Cash Savings and Stock Price Informativeness 
Abstract:
 This paper shows that managers use the information they learn from the
 stock market when they decide on corporate cash savings. In particular,
 corporate savings are much more sensitive to stock price when the price
 contains more information that is new to managers. Moreover, the
 significant effect of stock price informativeness on the savings-to-price
 sensitivity is not due to market mispricings and remains even after
 controlling for various sources of public and managerial private
 information. Overall, the results highlight a new channel through which
 the stock market affects corporate decisions, which suggests that the
 stock market is not a sideshow. Copyright 2012, Oxford University Press.

Title: The Risk and Return of Arbitrage in Dual-Listed Companies 
Abstract:
 This paper evaluates investment strategies that exploit the deviations
 from theoretical price parity in a sample of 12 dual-listed companies
 (DLCs) in the period 1980--2002. We show that simple trading rules produce
 abnormal returns of up to almost 10% per annum adjusted for systematic
 risk, transaction costs, and margin requirements. However, arbitrageurs
 face uncertainty about the horizon at which prices will converge and
 deviations from parity are very volatile. As a result, DLC arbitrage is
 characterized by substantial idiosyncratic return volatility and a high
 incidence of large negative returns, which are likely to impede arbitrage. Copyright 2009, Oxford University Press.

Title: Payout Policy Choices and Shareholder Investment Horizons 
Abstract:
 This paper examines how shareholder investment horizons influence payout
 policy choices. The authors infer institutional shareholders' investment
 horizons using the churn rate of their overall stock portfolios prior to
 the payout decision. The authors find that the frequency and amount of
 repurchases increases with ownership by short-term investors to the
 detriment of dividends. They also find that the market reacts less
 positively to repurchase announcements made by firms held by short-term
 institutions. These findings are consistent with a model in which
 undervalued firms signal their value through repurchases, but firms held
 by short-term investors make repurchases more often because those
 investors care mostly about the short-term price reaction. Hence, the
 market rationally discounts the signal provided by such repurchases. Our
 findings suggest that shorter shareholder investment horizons might be one
 contributing factor to the increasing popularity of buybacks. Copyright 2013, Oxford University Press.

Title: Corporate Investments and Learning 
Abstract:
 Using age as a proxy for learning within a firm, we show that the
 investments of firms with younger projects react more to profit
 realizations. With time, firms learn about their long-term quality, and
 their investment decisions become less influenced by the random shocks
 they receive. We also show that the learning process depends on the
 volatility of the economic environment. In more volatile industries, firms
 observe more noise and less signal from profit realizations. Their
 investments are therefore less influenced by profits. These new empirical
 results are consistent with a Tobin's q framework augmented with Bayesian
 learning. Copyright 2013, Oxford University Press.

Title: Is the Partial Adjustment Model a Useful Tool for Capital Structure Research? 
Abstract:
 Recent research has focused on the estimates of the speed of adjustment to
 target leverage as the indicators of the importance of dynamic trade-off
 behavior. We show that the observed corporate financing behavior and the
 resulting dynamics of corporate debt ratios are such that the speed of
 adjustment is not an economically meaningful measure of the importance of
 target debt ratios. We conclude that partial adjustment regressions that
 rely on the existence of a well-defined target debt ratio are ill-suited
 for quantifying the importance of dynamic trade-off behavior vis-a-vis
 alternative theories. Copyright 2010, Oxford University Press.

Title: Access to Liquidity and Corporate Investment in Europe during the Financial Crisis 
Abstract:
 We use a unique data set to show how firms in Europe used credit lines
 during the financial crisis. We find that firms with restricted access to
 credit (small, private, non-investment-grade, and unprofitable) draw more
 funds from their credit lines during the crisis than their large, public,
 investment-grade, profitable counterparts. Interest spreads increased
 (especially in "market-based economies"), but commitment fees remained
 unchanged. Our findings suggest that credit lines did not dry up during
 the crisis and provided the liquidity that firms used to cope with this
 exceptional contraction. In particular, credit lines provided the
 liquidity companies needed to invest during the crisis. Copyright 2011, Oxford University Press.

Title: Trust, Sociability, and Stock Market Participation 
Abstract:
 This article investigates the importance of both trust and sociability for
 stock market participation and for differences in stockholding across
 Europe. We estimate significant effects for the two, and find that
 sociability can partly balance the discouragement effect on stockholding
 induced by low regional prevailing trust. We test for exogeneity of trust
 and sociability indicators using variation in history of political
 institutions and in frequency of contacts with grandchildren,
 respectively. Moreover, the effect of trust is stronger in countries with
 limited participation and low average trust, offering an explanation for
 the remarkably low stockholding rates of the wealthy living therein. Copyright 2011, Oxford University Press.

Title: Gambling Preference and the New Year Effect of Assets with Lottery Features 
Abstract:
 This paper shows that a New Year's gambling preference of individual
 investors impacts prices and returns of assets with lottery features.
 January call options, especially the out-of-the-money calls, have higher
 retail demand and are the most expensive and actively traded. Lottery-type
 stocks outperform their counterparts in January but tend to underperform
 in other months. Retail sentiment is more bullish in lottery-type stocks
 in January than in other months. Furthermore, lottery-type Chinese stocks
 outperform in the Chinese New Year's Month but not in January. This New
 Year effect provides new insights into the broad phenomena related to the
 January effect. Copyright 2011, Oxford University Press.

Title: Structure and Determinants of Financial Covenants in Leveraged Buyouts 
Abstract:
 The authors use proprietary loan contracts and financial information
 negotiated between banks and private equity sponsors to explore the
 financial covenant structure and the determinants of covenant
 restrictiveness in a large set of leveraged buyouts. With respect to the
 covenant structure, we analyze the utilized types of financial covenants
 in sponsored loans and in comparable nonsponsored loans, such as highly
 levered term loans or loans used toward M&A. The authors find that
 sponsored loans show less variation in the included types and combinations
 of covenants and include more financial covenants than the comparable
 nonsponsored loans. With respect to covenant restrictiveness, the authors
 measure precisely the distance between threshold and financial forecast.
 They show that two competing mechanisms, reduced information asymmetry
 costs and increased financial risk, affect the restrictiveness in
 sponsored loans. Copyright 2011, Oxford University Press.

Title: Inside Debt 
Abstract:
 Existing theories advocate the exclusive use of equity-like instruments in
 executive compensation. However, recent empirical studies document the
 prevalence of debt-like instruments such as pensions. This paper justifies
 the use of debt as efficient compensation. Inside debt is a superior
 solution to the agency costs of debt than the solvency-contingent bonuses
 and salaries proposed by prior literature, since its payoff depends not
 only on the incidence of bankruptcy but also firm value in bankruptcy.
 Contrary to intuition, granting the manager equal proportions of debt and
 equity is typically inefficient. In most cases, an equity bias is desired
 to induce effort. However, if effort is productive in increasing
 liquidation value, or if bankruptcy is likely, a debt bias can improve
 effort as well as alleviate the agency costs of debt. The model generates
 a number of empirical predictions consistent with recent evidence. Copyright 2011, Oxford University Press.

Title: The Impact of Organizational Structure and Lending Technology on Banking Competition 
Abstract:
 We investigate how bank organization shapes banking competition. We show
 that a bank's geographical lending reach and loan pricing strategy is
 determined by its own and its rivals' organizational structure. We
 estimate the impact of organization on the geographical reach and loan
 pricing of a large bank. We find that the reach of the bank is smaller
 when rival banks are large and hierarchically organized, have superior
 communication technology, have a narrower span of organization, and are
 closer to a decision unit with lending authority. Rival banks' size and
 the number of layers to a decision unit soften spatial pricing. Copyright 2009, Oxford University Press.

Title: Are Economists More Likely to Hold Stocks? 
Abstract:
 Using a large panel data set containing detailed information on
 educational attainments as well as financial and socioeconomic variables
 for individual investors, we show that economists are more likely to hold
 stocks than otherwise identical investors. First, we consider the change
 in stockholdings associated with (i) completing an economics education and
 (ii) an economist moving into the household. Second, we model stock market
 participation using a probit model with unobserved individual
 heterogeneity. Third, instrumental variables estimation allows us to
 identify the causal effect of an economics education on stock market
 participation. Throughout, we focus explicitly on the effect of a change
 in educational status on the likelihood of holding stocks. Copyright 2008, Oxford University Press.

Title: Inflation Targeting and Exchange Rate Regimes: Evidence from the Financial Markets 
Abstract:
 Inflation targeting is gaining popularity as a framework for conducting
 monetary policy. At the same time many countries employ some sort of
 foreign exchange intervention policy assuming that these two policies can
 coexist. This paper attempts to show that both policies are not
 sustainable. Israel is a classic test case. We test our hypothesis using
 information from the financial markets. The results support the hypothesis
 that both policies cannot be sustained in the long run. The conclusion is
 that a credible monetary policy aimed at inflation targets should be
 conducted in a free floating exchange rate regime. Copyright 2010, Oxford University Press.

Title: The Ambiguity Premium vs. the Risk Premium under Limited Market Participation 
Abstract:
 This paper considers a stock market with ambiguity-averse informed
 investors under the CARA-normal setting, and studies the relationship
 between limited market participation and the equity premium which is
 decomposed into the risk premium and the ambiguity premium. In a rational
 expectations equilibrium, limited market participation arises if the
 largest deviation of investors' ambiguity increases sufficiently or if the
 variance of the stock return decreases sufficiently. In each case, a
 change in the risk premium and a change in the ambiguity premium may have
 opposite signs. This paper identifies conditions under which a change with
 the plus sign dominates and thus the equity premium increases when fewer
 investors participate in the stock market. Copyright 2010, Oxford University Press.

Title: Government Debt, Reputation and Creditors’ Protections: The Tale of San Giorgio 
Abstract:
		       San Giorgio (1407–1805) was a formal association
 aimed at protecting creditors’ rights and reducing the risk of debt
 repudiation by the Republic of Genoa. The behavior of this institution is
 broadly consistent with debt models that predict lending if lenders can
 impose big penalties on debtors, and models in which lenders can
 differentiate between excusable and inexcusable defaults. San Giorgio
 shareholders enjoyed low credit risk but also lower returns on capital
 than those prevailing on comparable foreign assets for which creditors’
 protection mechanisms were lacking. The Republic’s quid pro quo was a low
 cost of financing. Differences in credit risk were an important
 explanation of differences in long-term interest rates across countries in
 16th and 17th century Europe, a point not sufficiently emphasized by the
 literature.		        Copyright Oxford University Press Science+Business Media, LLC 2006

Title: Private Equity Fund Size, Investment Size, and Value Creation 
Abstract:
 This paper examines why large private equity (PE) funds earn lower
 returns. The article argues that large PE funds are suited to making large
 investments and small PE funds are suited to nurturing start-ups. Thus,
 the suboptimal investment in small companies is one driver of the size
 effect in PE. A theoretical model and empirical results from a sample of
 1,222 funds in the USA support this prediction. The largest 25% of PE
 funds earn internal rates of return of 5.17% when they invest in the
 largest 25% of companies but only  - 2.98% when they invest in the
 smallest 25%. This suggests that investment size is a driver of the size
 effect in PE. Copyright 2011, Oxford University Press.

Title: Corporate Financing Activities and Contrarian Investment 
Abstract:
 This paper investigates the risk versus mispricing explanation of superior
 returns to contrarian strategies using the interactions between
 value-to-market indicators and corporate financing transactions that
 increase or decrease a firm's outstanding equity. Portfolio-level analyses
 and firm-level cross-sectional regressions indicate that the
 well-documented contrarian profits soar when value stocks which repurchase
 shares (value repurchasers) and growth stocks which issue shares (growth
 issuers) are considered. Various risk measures indicate that value
 repurchasers are not riskier than growth issuers. Furthermore, time-series
 of realized growth rates, analysts' long-term growth estimates, and
 sensitivity of portfolio returns to investor sentiment support the
 misvaluation explanation. Copyright 2010, Oxford University Press.

Title: Cash Breeds Success: The Role of Financing Constraints in Patent Races 
Abstract:
 This paper studies the impact of financing constraints in patent races. We
 develop a model of optimal contracting where firms finance their R&D
 expenditures with an investor who cannot verify their effort. In
 equilibrium, firms are more likely to win the more cash and assets they
 hold prior to the race, and the less cash and assets their rivals hold
 prior to the race. Evidence from US pharmaceutical patents awarded between
 1975 and 1999 supports our theoretical predictions. Copyright 2010, Oxford University Press.

Title: When It Cannot Get Better or Worse: The Asymmetric Impact of Good and Bad News on&nbsp;Bond&nbsp;Returns in Expansions and Recessions 
Abstract:
 We examine empirically the response of bond returns and their volatility
 to good and bad macroeconomic news during expansions and recessions. We
 find that macroeconomic announcements are most important when they contain
 bad news for bond returns in expansions and, to a lesser extent, good news
 in contractions. In expansions, the bond market responds most strongly to
 bad news in non-farm payrolls, while in recessions good news about
 inflation is relatively more important. We also document that
 macroeconomic news impacts the volatility of bond returns at all
 maturities by increasing jump intensities and altering the jump size
 distribution. Copyright 2010, Oxford University Press.

Title: Is a Team Different from the Sum of its Parts? Evidence from Mutual Fund Managers 
Abstract:
 This paper provides the first empirical test of the diversification of
 opinions theory and the group shift theory using real business data. Our
 data set covers management teams and single managers of US equity mutual
 funds. Our results reject the group shift theory and support the
 diversification of opinions theory: teams follow less extreme investment
 styles, their portfolios are less industry concentrated, and they are
 eventually less likely to achieve extreme performance outcomes. These
 results hold after taking into account the impact of fund and family
 characteristics as well as manager characteristics. Copyright 2010, Oxford University Press.

Title: Securitization and Compensation in Financial Institutions 
Abstract:
 We analyze the interaction between financial institutions' internal
 compensation policy, the quality of loans, and their securitization
 decision. We show when mandatory deferred bonus pay makes incentives more
 commensurate with the longer term risk of their transactions and hence
 improves the quality of loans. We also show when it has the opposite
 effect. We further analyze when mandatory deferred compensation can
 complement a policy that requires financial institutions to retain a
 minimum exposure to their originated loans, and we discuss the impact of a
 tax on short-term bonus pay. Generally, our framework allows us to study
 the interaction of financial institutions' internal agency problems with
 the external agency problem that arises from securitization. Copyright 2013, Oxford University Press.

Title: Precautionary Hoarding of Liquidity and Interbank Markets: Evidence from the Subprime Crisis 
Abstract:
 We study the liquidity demand of large settlement banks in the UK and its
 effect on the money markets before and during the subprime crisis of
 2007--08. We find that the liquidity demand of large settlement banks
 experienced a 30% increase in the period immediately following August 9
 2007, the day when money markets froze, igniting the crisis. Following
 this shift, liquidity demand had a precautionary nature in that it rose on
 days of high payment activity and for banks with greater credit risk. This
 caused overnight interbank rates to rise, an effect virtually absent in
 the precrisis period. Copyright 2013, Oxford University Press.

Title: Proximity Always Matters: Local Bias When the Set of Local Companies Changes 
Abstract:
 I analyze the portfolios of individual investors who have changed their
 place of residence. As distance from a company they invest in changes,
 investors adjust their portfolio composition. The farther investors move
 away from the closest establishment of a company in their portfolio, the
 more of its shares they sell compared to investors who do not move. Among
 the companies that investors held before the move, after moving, investors
 abnormally increase their ownership in companies closer to their new
 location; these companies provide them with higher risk-adjusted returns
 than companies in which they kept holdings unchanged or abnormally reduced
 holdings. Copyright 2009, Oxford University Press.

Title: Asymmetric Momentum Effects Under Uncertainty 
Abstract:
 This paper studies asymmetric profitability of the momentum trading
 strategy. When investors face Knightian uncertainty, they react
 differently to past winners and losers, which creates asymmetric patterns
 in price continuations. This asymmetry increases with the level of market
 and idiosyncratic uncertainty relating to the fundamental value of stocks.
 We provide a model explaining this phenomenon and empirical evidence
 supporting the hypothesis. Our results also imply that momentum is more
 likely to continue for downward trends in a highly uncertain market. Copyright 2010, Oxford University Press.

Title: Board Structures Around the World: an Experimental Investigation 
Abstract:
 We model and experimentally examine the board structure-performance
 relationship. We examine single-tiered boards, two-tiered boards,
 insider-controlled boards, and outsider-controlled boards. We find that
 even insider-controlled boards frequently adopt institutionally preferred
 rather than self-interested policies. Two-tiered boards adopt
 institutionally preferred policies more frequently but tend to destroy
 value by being too conservative, frequently rejecting good projects.
 Outsider-controlled single-tiered boards, both when they have multiple
 insiders and only a single insider, adopt institutionally preferred
 policies most frequently. In those board designs where the efficient Nash
 equilibrium produces strictly higher payoffs to all agents than the
 coalition-proof equilibria, agents tend to select the efficient Nash
 equilibria. Copyright 2008, Oxford University Press.

Title: Competition, Bonuses, and Risk-taking in the Banking Industry 
Abstract:
 Remuneration systems in the banking industry, in particular bonus
 payments, have frequently been blamed for contributing to the buildup of
 risks leading to the recent financial crisis. In our model, banks compete
 for managerial talent that is private information. Competition for talent
 sets incentives to offer bonuses inducing risk-taking that is excessive
 not only from society's perspective but also from the viewpoint of the
 banks themselves. In fact, bonus payments and excessive risk-taking are
 increasing with competition. Thus, our model offers a rationale why
 bonuses are paid even when reducing the expected profits of banks. Copyright 2013, Oxford University Press.

Title: Option Compensation and Industry Competition 
Abstract:
 Compensation policy has become one of the most important ingredients of
 corporate governance. In this paper we take a new look at the issue, by
 contrasting the use of options with that of stock. We do this by
 integrating the repricing or resetting aspect of options with that of
 industrial structure. We show that industry competition may play an
 important role in dictating which form of compensation is optimal. When
 aggressive competition for key professional staff is an issue, the
 flexibility of options may actually become a disadvantage and therefore
 pure stock compensation may survive as an equilibrium. Thus compensation
 trends may be partly explained by trends in the nature of the competitive
 environment. Copyright 2009, Oxford University Press.

Title: An Experimental Test of the Impact of Overconfidence and Gender on Trading Activity 
Abstract:
 We perform an asset market experiment in order to investigate whether
 overconfidence induces trading. We investigate three manifestations of
 overconfidence: calibration-based overconfidence, the better-than-average
 effect and illusion of control. Novelly, the measure employed for
 calibration-based overconfidence is task-specific in that it is designed
 to influence behavior. We find that calibration-based overconfidence does
 engender additional trade, though the better-than-average also appears to
 play a role. This is true both at the level of the individual and also at
 the level of the market. There is little evidence that gender influences
 trading activity. Copyright 2009, Oxford University Press.

Title: The Value of Analysts' Recommendations and the Organization of Financial Research 
Abstract:
 Brokerage houses usually organize their research activities by country or
 economic sector. We evaluate which research structure provides most value
 to investors. To do so, we study the relative information content of
 recommendations issued by country-specialized analysts and
 sector-specialized analysts. Our findings show that the former issue more
 valuable recommendations. The strength of country-specific commonalities
 and institutional factors explain at least part of the better performance
 of country-specialized financial analysts. Although analysts' geographic
 location has been shown in the literature to be a significant determinant
 of earnings forecast accuracy, its relevance is more subtle when it comes
 to stock recommendations. Copyright 2010, Oxford University Press.

Title: Volatility in Equilibrium: Asymmetries and Dynamic Dependencies 
Abstract:
 Stock market volatility clusters in time, appears fractionally integrated,
 carries a risk premium, and exhibits asymmetric leverage effects. At the
 same time, the volatility risk premium, defined by the difference between
 the risk-neutral and objective expectations of the volatility, features
 short memory. This paper develops the first internally consistent
 equilibrium-based explanation for all these empirical facts. Using newly
 available high-frequency intraday data for the S&P 500 and the VIX
 volatility index, the authors show that the qualitative implications from
 the new theoretical continuous-time model match remarkably well with the
 distinct shapes and patterns in the sample autocorrelations and dynamic
 cross-correlations actually observed in the data. Copyright 2011, Oxford University Press.

Title: The "Fed Model" and the Predictability of Stock Returns 
Abstract:
 The focus of this article is on the predictive role of the stock-bond
 yield gap--the difference between the stock market earnings (dividend)
 yield and the 10-year Treasury bond yield--also known as the "Fed model".
 The results show that the yield gap forecasts positive excess market
 returns, both at short and long forecasting horizons, and for both value-
 and equal-weighted stock indexes, and it also outperforms competing
 predictors commonly used in the literature. These findings go in line with
 the predictions from a present-value decomposition. The absence of
 predictive power for dividend growth, dividend payout ratios, earnings
 growth, and future one-period interest rates, actually strengthens the
 return predictability associated with the yield gap at very long horizons.
 By performing an out-of-sample analysis, the results show that the yield
 gap has reasonable out-of-sample predictability for the equity premium
 when the comparison is made against a simple historical average,
 especially when one imposes a restriction of positive equity premia.
 Furthermore, the yield gap proxies generally show greater out-of-sample
 forecasting power than the alternative state variables. An investment
 strategy based on the forecasting ability of the yield gap produces
 significant gains in Sharpe ratios. Copyright 2013, Oxford University Press.

Title: Takeover Timing, Implementation Uncertainty, and Embedded Divestment Options 
Abstract:
		       We design a compound real options model, which
 determines the timing of takeovers and characterizes the distribution of
 the associated surplus. We delineate a relation between the bargaining
 power of the acquiring firm and the takeover incentives. The takeover
 threshold is decreasing as a function of the expected primary takeover
 gain and the embedded divestment gain. Decreased implementation
 uncertainty stimulates takeover activity. This uncertainty concerns the
 delay until either primary takeover synergies or subsequent divestment
 gains are realized. We demonstrate how the relation between volatility and
 takeover timing depends on the functional form of the profit flow with
 implementation uncertainty.		        Copyright Oxford University Press 2006

Title: Hedge Funds and Equity Prices 
Abstract:
 This article analyzes hedge funds' expansion during 2000--09 and its
 implications for stock returns. Hedge funds more than doubled their equity
 ownership prior to the 2007--09 financial crisis. In this expansion
 period, their trading predicts increasing one-quarter-ahead stock returns
 and return reversals in the 2nd year. These reversals stem from the
 expansion of mature funds, while young funds' trading predicts
 one-quarter-ahead returns without future reversals. The above price
 pressures disappear when hedge funds shift to contractions in the
 financial crisis. These findings are consistent with mature funds'
 expansions exerting pressures on equities and young funds possessing stock
 picking skills. Copyright 2013, Oxford University Press.

Title: Is There a Relationship Benefit in Credit Ratings? 
Abstract:
 This paper shows that firms with longer rating agency relationships have
 better credit ratings, conditional on observables. The paper also finds
 that (1) controlling for observables, firms with longer relationships,
 while having higher average ratings, do not have lower default rates, (2)
 relationship benefits are larger among firms with a greater incentive to
 game their information supplied to agencies or to pressure agencies into
 giving higher ratings, and (3) investors demand a (price) discount on
 bonds sold by relationship firms and the correlation between bond yield
 spreads and ratings is decreasing with relationship length. In sum, the
 evidence is inconsistent with first-order credit quality explanations but
 rather supports a "learning-to-gaming" and an "adverse incentives" story. Copyright 2011, Oxford University Press.

Title: Learning, Cascades, and Transaction Costs 
Abstract:
 The paper analyzes the effect of transaction costs on social learning in
 an asset market with asymmetric information, sequential trading, and a
 competitive price mechanism. Both fixed and proportional transaction costs
 reduce the information content of trading orders and lead to informational
 cascades. If transaction costs are very high, an informational cascade may
 occur not only when beliefs converge on a specific asset value but also
 when there is extreme uncertainty about the asset's fundamental value.
 Finally, if the value in the bad state is sufficiently low, proportional
 transaction costs lead to an informational cascade only when prices are
 very high. Copyright 2007, Oxford University Press.

Title: British Investment Overseas 1870-1913: A Modern Portfolio Theory Approach 
Abstract:
 We use a mean-variance approach to address the classic puzzle of British
 capital export in the 19th century. Our analysis shows that foreign
 securities listed in London offered significant diversification benefits
 to British investors. In simple terms, international diversification
 reduced risk. Conservative estimates of the optimal investment portfolio
 for a domestic investor suggest that the balance between foreign and
 domestic security offerings on the London Exchange was close to what
 classic equilibrium models of asset prices would suggest. Copyright 2006, Oxford University Press.

Title: The World of Cross-Listings and Cross-Listings of the World: Challenging Conventional Wisdom 
Abstract:
 There has long prevailed a conventional wisdom rationalizing why firms
 pursue overseas listings. It argues that firms seek such opportunities to
 benefit from a lower cost of capital that arises because their shares
 become more accessible to global investors. Much recent evidence
 challenges this conventional wisdom. In fact, several new research
 initiatives have been proposed that factor into the overseas listing
 decision many more complex risks that globalization can create at the firm
 level, such as agency conflicts, transparency and disclosure concerns, and
 other corporate governance problems. The goal of this article is to
 survey, synthesize and critically review this new literature and to
 identify yet unresolved questions to answer. Copyright 2006, Oxford University Press.

Title: The Limits of the Limits of Arbitrage 
Abstract:
 We test the limits of arbitrage argument for the survival of
 irrationality-induced financial anomalies by sorting securities on their
 individual residual variability as a proxy for idiosyncratic risk -- a
 commonly asserted limit to arbitrage -- and comparing the strength of
 anomalous returns in low versus high residual variability portfolios. We
 find no support for the limits of arbitrage argument to explain
 undervaluation anomalies (small value stocks, value stocks generally,
 recent winners, and positive earnings surprises) but strong support for
 the limits of arbitrage argument to explain overvaluation anomalies (small
 growth stocks, growth stocks generally, recent losers, and negative
 earnings surprises). Other tests also fail to support the limits of
 arbitrage argument for the survival of overvaluation anomalies and suggest
 that at least some of the factor premiums for size, book-to-market, and
 momentum are unrelated to irrationality protected by limits to arbitrage. Copyright 2010, Oxford University Press.

Title: Finance and Efficiency: Do Bank Branching Regulations Matter? 
Abstract:
 We document that the deregulation of bank branching restrictions in the
 United States triggered a reallocation across sectors, with end effects on
 state-level volatility. The change cannot be explained simply by shifts in
 sector-level returns and volatility. A reallocation effect is at play,
 which we study in the context of mean-variance portfolio theory applied to
 sectoral returns. We find the reallocation is particularly strong in
 sectors characterized by young, small and external finance dependent
 firms, and for states that have a larger share of such sectors. The
 findings suggest that improving bank access to branching affects the
 sectoral specialization of output, in a manner that depends on the
 variance-covariance properties of sectoral returns, rather than on their
 average only. Copyright 2011, Oxford University Press.

Title: Security Design in Initial Public Offerings 
Abstract:
 We investigate an IPO security design problem when information asymmetries
 across investors lead to a winner's curse. Firms that are riskier in down
 markets can lower the cost of going public by using unit IPOs, in which
 equity and warrants are combined into a non-divisible package.
 Furthermore, firms that have a sizeable growth potential even in bad
 states of the world can fully eliminate the winner's curse problem by
 making the warrants callable. Our theory is consistent with the prominent
 use of unit IPOs and produces empirical implications that differentiate it
 from existing theories. Copyright 2010, Oxford University Press.

Title: Anything is Possible: On the Existence and Uniqueness of Equilibria in the Shleifer-Vishny Model of Limits of Arbitrage 
Abstract:
 This paper characterizes equilibria in the Shleifer-Vishny model of limits
 of arbitrage. To prove existence, one has to consider types of equilibria
 ignored by Shleifer and Vishny, even if one adopts their parameter
 restrictions. For example, the only equilibrium may be one in which
 maximization of expected wealth requires an "all-or-nothing" investment
 strategy, with intermediate investment levels being strictly unprofitable.
 If one goes beyond Shleifer and Vishny's parameter restrictions, multiple
 equilibria may arise, and equilibrium selection may be governed by
 sunspots. Moreover, there may exist an equilibrium in which the asset
 price returns to fundamentals despite worsening noise trader sentiment. Copyright 2009, Oxford University Press.

Title: The Determinants of Bank Capital Structure 
Abstract:
 The paper shows that mispriced deposit insurance and capital regulation
 were of second-order importance in determining the capital structure of
 large U.S. and European banks during 1991 to 2004. Instead, standard
 cross-sectional determinants of non-financial firms' leverage carry over
 to banks, except for banks whose capital ratio is close to the regulatory
 minimum. Consistent with a reduced role of deposit insurance, we document
 a shift in banks' liability structure away from deposits towards
 non-deposit liabilities. We find that unobserved time-invariant bank
 fixed-effects are ultimately the most important determinant of banks'
 capital structures and that banks' leverage converges to bank specific,
 time-invariant targets. Copyright 2010, Oxford University Press.

Title: Returns to Private Equity - Idiosyncratic Risk Does Matter! 
Abstract:
 Owners of private companies often invest a substantial share of their net
 worth in one company, which exposes them to idiosyncratic risk. We
 investigate whether owners of US companies require compensation for lack
 of diversification in the form of higher returns on equity. Exposure to
 idiosyncratic risk is measured as the share of the owner's net worth
 invested in the company. Equity returns are measured as the earnings rate
 and as capital gains. For both returns measures we find a positive and
 significant influence of exposure to idiosyncratic risk. This paper
 improves our understanding of returns on private equity. Copyright 2010, Oxford University Press.

Title: Are Monthly Seasonals Real? A Three Century Perspective 
Abstract:
 Over 300 years of UK stock returns reveal that well-known monthly
 seasonals are sample specific. For instance, the January effect only
 emerges around 1830. Most months have had their 50 years of fame, showing
 the importance of long time series to safeguard against sample selection
 bias, noise, and data snooping. The overall conclusion is that monthly
 seasonals might simply be in the eye of the beholder. Copyright 2013, Oxford University Press.

Title: The World Business Cycle and Expected Returns 
Abstract:
 We study the predictability of stock returns using a pure macroeconomic
 measure of the world business cycle, namely the world's capital to output
 ratio. This variable tracks variation in expected stock returns in a group
 of the major industrial economies in the presence of world financial
 market--based predictor variables. The world's capital to output ratio
 exhibits strong out-of-sample predictive power in almost all countries
 studied. This is in contrast to financial market--based variables that
 almost never have out-of-sample forecasting power. Using the stock return
 predictability that we uncover, we find that international versions of
 conditional asset pricing models perform well. The world capital to output
 ratio also predicts bond returns, interest rate changes, and credit
 spreads. The results highlight the importance of world business conditions
 for financial markets. Copyright 2013, Oxford University Press.

Title: Portfolio Pumping, Trading Activity and Fund Performance 
Abstract:
 We develop a model of trading by an informed fund manager compensated on
 the basis of her fund's Net Asset Value (NAV). We show that she has an
 incentive to pump her portfolio by buying securities she already holds.
 Pumping leads to excessive trading and hurts long-term fund performance.
 It also biases upward measured NAVs and contributes to closed-end fund
 discounts. Despite such costs, it may still be optimal to base her
 compensation on NAV. Copyright 2013, Oxford University Press.

Title: Improved Forecasting of Mutual Fund Alphas and Betas 
Abstract:
 This paper proposes a simple back testing procedure that is shown to
 dramatically improve a panel data model's ability to produce out of sample
 forecasts. Here the procedure is used to forecast mutual fund alphas.
 Using monthly data with an OLS model it has been difficult to consistently
 predict which portfolio managers will produce above market returns for
 their investors. This paper provides empirical evidence that sorting on
 the estimated alphas populates the top and bottom deciles not with the
 best and worst funds, but with those having the greatest estimation error.
 This problem can be attenuated by back testing the statistical model fund
 by fund. The back test used here requires a statistical model to exhibit
 some past predictive success for a particular fund before it is allowed to
 make predictions about that fund in the current period. Another estimation
 problem concerns the use of a single statistical model for all available
 mutual funds. Since no one statistical model is likely to fit every fund,
 the result is a great deal of misspecification error. This paper shows
 that the combined use of an OLS and Kalman filter model increases the
 number of funds with predictable out of sample alphas by about 60%.
 Overall, a strategy that uses very modest ex-ante filters to eliminate
 funds whose parameters likely derive primarily from estimation error
 produces an out of sample risk-adjusted return of over 4% per annum. Copyright 2007, Oxford University Press.

Title: Fund Liquidation, Self-selection, and Look-ahead Bias in the Hedge Fund Industry 
Abstract:
 A wide range of empirical biases hampers hedge fund databases. In this
 paper we focus upon survival-related biases and disentangle look-ahead
 biases due to self-selection of funds and due to fund termination.
 Self-selection arises because funds voluntarily report their information
 to data vendors and may decide to stop doing so. By extending existing
 methodology, we analyze persistence in hedge fund performance over the
 period 1994-2000, taking into account the above biases. The results show
 that look-ahead biases due to liquidation and self-selection enforce each
 other and may lead to overestimating expected returns by as much as 8% per
 year. Overall, the results are consistent with positive persistence in
 hedge fund returns at horizons of two and four quarters. Copyright 2007, Oxford University Press.

Title: Robust Portfolio Optimisation with Multiple Experts 
Abstract:
 We consider mean-variance portfolio choice of a robust investor. The
 investor receives advice from J experts, each with a different prior for
 expected returns and risk, and follows a min-max portfolio strategy. The
 robust investor endogenously combines the experts' estimates. When experts
 agree on the main return generating factors, the investor relies on the
 advice of the expert with the strongest prior. Dispersed advice leads to
 averaging of the alternative estimates. The robust investor is likely to
 outperform alternative strategies. The theoretical analysis is supported
 by numerical simulations for the 25 Fama-French portfolios and for 81
 European country and value portfolios. Copyright 2010, Oxford University Press.

Title: Risk Attitudes Toward Small and Large Bets in the Presence of Background Risk 
Abstract:
 If an individual with expected utility and a reasonable level of wealth
 rejects a small actuarially favorable gamble, it implies a very high
 degree of risk aversion. It also predicts (counterfactually) the rejection
 of more sizable and very attractive bets. If additional background
 uncertainty affects wealth, this result also applies to non-expected
 utilities. The authors describe a set of reasonable conditions under which
 an individual may reject the small bet but accept the large bet, even in
 the presence of background uncertainty. The two critical assumptions that
 the authors use are rank-dependent utility and a discrete distribution for
 background risk. Plausible calibrations can reconcile large/small bet risk
 attitudes and the empirical evidence on limited stock market participation
 in the presence of labor income risk. Copyright 2011, Oxford University Press.

Title: Out-of-Court Restructuring versus Formal Bankruptcy in a Non-Interventionist Bankruptcy Setting 
Abstract:
 We investigate debt restructurings in Germany for a sample of 116
 financially distressed companies. About half of the firms succeed in
 restructuring their debt in a workout while the others file for
 bankruptcy. Our evidence suggests that firms which have higher leverage,
 owe more debt to banks, and exhibit higher going concern values are more
 likely to conduct a workout. Bankruptcy is more likely for firms with
 deficient lender coordination and a high fraction of collateralized debt.
 An analysis of stock returns suggests that the market uses similar
 information to predict workouts. 84% of the bankrupt firms were ultimately
 liquidated. Copyright 2010, Oxford University Press.

Title: Working Capital Management and Shareholders' Wealth 
Abstract:
 We provide the first empirical study of the relationship between corporate
 working capital management and shareholders' wealth. Examining US
 corporations from 1990 through 2006, we find evidence that: the
 incremental dollar invested in net operating working capital is worth less
 than the incremental dollar held in cash for the average firm; the
 valuation of the incremental dollar invested in net operating working
 capital is significantly influenced by a firm's future sales expectations,
 its debt load, its financial constraints, and its bankruptcy risk; and the
 value of the incremental dollar extended in credit to one's customers has
 a greater effect on shareholders' wealth than the incremental dollar
 invested in inventories for the average firm. Copyright 2013, Oxford University Press.

Title: Dynamic Interactions Between Interest-Rate and Credit Risk: Theory and Evidence on the Credit Default Swap Term Structure-super-* 
Abstract:
 This paper examines the interaction between default risk and interest-rate
 risk in determining the term structure of credit default swap spreads at
 different industry sectors and credit-rating classes. The paper starts
 with a parsimonious three-factor interest-rate dynamic term structure and
 projects the credit spread at each industry sector and rating class to
 these interest-rate factors while also allowing the projection residual
 dynamics to depend on the level of the interest-rate factors. Estimation
 shows that credit risk exhibits intricate dynamic interactions with the
 interest-rate factors. Copyright 2013, Oxford University Press.

Title: The Optimality of Uniform Pricing in IPOs: An Optimal Auction Approach 
Abstract:
 This paper uses an optimal auction approach to investigate the conditions
 under which uniform pricing in IPOs is optimal. We show that the
 optimality of a uniform price in IPOs depends crucially on whether the
 (optimal) allocation rule is restricted. These restrictions may stem from
 the retail investors' budget constraint and/or from the institutional
 investors' preferences. We show that the main determinant of the
 optimality of a uniform pricing rule is the existence and the shape of the
 retail investors' budget constraint. In contrast, institutional investors'
 preferences are shown to mainly affect the optimal allocation rule. Copyright 2008, Oxford University Press.

Title: Explaining Corporate Capital Structure: Product Markets, Leases, and Asset Similarity 
Abstract:
 Better measurement of the output produced and capital employed by firms
 substantially improves the ability to explain capital structure variation
 in the cross section. For every firm, we construct the set of other firms
 producing the same output using the set of product market competitors
 listed in the firm's public Securities and Exchange Commission filings. In
 addition, we improve measurement of capital structure by explicitly
 accounting for leased capital. These two steps increase the explanatory
 power of the average capital structure of other firms producing similar
 output on a firm's capital structure by 50% compared to using only the
 average unadjusted debt ratio of other firms in the same three-digit
 Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) code. We provide evidence that
 the large explanatory power of the capital structure of other firms
 producing similar output is related to the assets used in the production
 process. Our findings suggest that what a firm produces and the assets
 used in production are the most important determinants of capital
 structure in the cross section. Copyright 2011, Oxford University Press.

Title: Safe Haven Currencies 
Abstract:
 We study high-frequency exchange rates over the period 1993--2008. Based
 on the recent literature on volatility and liquidity risk premia, we use a
 factor model to capture linear and non-linear linkages between currencies,
 stock and bond markets as well as proxies for market volatility and
 liquidity. We document that the Swiss franc and Japanese yen appreciate
 against the US dollar when US stock prices decrease and US bond prices and
 FX volatility increase. These safe haven properties materialise over
 different time granularities (from a few hours to several days) and
 non-linearly with the volatility factor and during crises. The latter
 effects were particularly discernible for the yen during the recent
 financial crisis. Copyright 2010, Oxford University Press.

Title: Hope Springs Eternal – French Bondholders and the Soviet Repudiation (1915–1919) 
Abstract:
		       Repudiations rarely occur due to their extreme
 nature. This paper provides an empirical study based on an original
 database: prices of a Tsarist bond traded in Paris before and after its
 repudiation by the Soviets. A structural VAR is used to disentangle French
 market shocks from repudiation specific ones. After the repudiation, we
 identify shocks that are related with bailouts, hopes of partial bailouts,
 negotiations with the Soviets and the Russian civil war. We argue that
 bond prices essentially reflected expected extreme events that never took
 place and were thus subject to a “Peso problem”.		     Copyright Oxford University Press Science+Business Media, LLC 2006

Title: Do Banks Benefit from Internationalization? Revisiting the Market Power--Risk Nexus 
Abstract:
 We analyze the impact of bank internationalization on domestic market
 power (Lerner index) and risk for German banks. Risk is measured by the
 official declaration of regulatory authorities that a bank is distressed.
 We distinguish the volume of foreign assets, the number of foreign
 countries, and different modes of foreign entry. Our analysis has three
 main results. First, higher market power is associated with lower risk.
 Second, holding assets in many countries reduce market power at home, but
 banks with a higher share of foreign assets exhibit higher market power.
 Third, bank internationalization is only weakly related to bank risk. Copyright 2013, Oxford University Press.

Title: The Effect of Issuer Conservatism on IPO Pricing and Performance* 
Abstract:
 Based on a textual analysis of initial public offering (IPO) prospectuses,
 we obtain a number of important findings regarding the relation between
 the conservatism in prospectuses, IPO pricing, and subsequent operating
 and stock return performance. First, prospectus conservatism is positively
 related to underpricing, with the relation more pronounced for technology
 than nontechnology firms. Second, for nontechnology IPOs, prospectus
 conservatism is able to predict the firm's post-IPO operating performance.
 Specifically, we find that conservatism is inversely related to the firm's
 operating performance for the 3 years following the IPO. However, this
 predictability is limited to nontechnology IPOs. Finally, we find some
 evidence that for nontechnology IPOs conservatism is inversely related to
 the firm's post-IPO abnormal stock return. We conclude that the
 conservatism contained in an IPO's prospectus contains useful information
 about pricing and subsequent operating and stock return performance.
 Moreover, prospectus conservatism for nontechnology IPOs deserves more
 attention from investors. Copyright 2013, Oxford University Press.

Title: The Dynamics of Going Public 
Abstract:
 This paper develops a real options model in which firms may use the timing
 of their initial public offerings (IPOs) to signal the quality of their
 investment prospects to outside investors. When adverse selection is more
 relevant (cold markets), firms with better investment prospects accelerate
 their IPO relative to their perfect information benchmark to reveal their
 type to outside investors. When adverse selection is less relevant (hot
 markets), all firms issue simultaneously, issuers are younger on average,
 and IPO timing is uninformative. An extension with multiple signals and
 the empirical evidence show that better ranked firms are younger, issue a
 lower fraction of shares, and underprice more during cold markets, and
 that issuers are younger on average during hot markets. Copyright 2011, Oxford University Press.

Title: Understanding Common Factors in Domestic and International Bond Spreads 
Abstract:
 I study the determinants of changes in credit spreads for U.S. dollar
 denominated domestic and foreign sovereign bonds using fundamentals
 specified by structural models to separate spreads into their credit and
 non-credit components. I find that the non-default portions of spreads
 have a component that is common for each type of debt. Further, using a
 vector autoregressive model, I find that domestic spreads are related to
 the lagged component of sovereign spreads. I also find that some proxies
 for liquidity are related to the common components, suggesting a
 liquidity-based explanation for the common component not identified by
 previous research. Copyright 2008, Oxford University Press.

Title: Firm-Level Evidence on International Stock Market Comovement 
Abstract:
 We explore the link between international stock market comovement and the
 extent to which firms operate globally. Using stock returns and balance
 sheet data for companies in 20 countries, we estimate a factor model that
 decomposes stock returns into global, country- and industry-specific
 shocks. We find a large and statistically significant link for global
 shocks. A firm raising its international sales by 10 percent raises the
 exposure of its stock return to global shocks by two percent. This link
 has grown stronger over time since the mid-1980s. We find no similarly
 robust link between international sales and exposure to country-specific
 shocks. Copyright 2006, Oxford University Press.

Title: Towards a General Theory of Good-Deal Bounds 
Abstract:
 We consider an incomplete market in the form of a multidimensional
 Markovian factor model, driven by a general marked point process
 (representing discrete jump events), as well as by a standard
 multidimensional Wiener process. Within this framework, we study
 arbitrage-free gooddeal pricing bounds for derivative assets, thereby
 extending the results by Cochrane and Saá Requejo (2000) to the
 point process case, while, at the same time, obtaining a radical
 simplification of the theory. To illustrate, we present numerical results
 for the classic Merton jump-diffusion model. As a by-product of the
 general theory, we derive extended Hansen-Jagannathan bounds for the
 Sharpe Ratio process in the point process setting. Copyright 2006, Oxford University Press.

Title: Fear of the Unknown: Familiarity and Economic Decisions 
Abstract:
 Evidence indicates that people fear change and the unknown. We model this
 behavior as familiarity bias in which individuals focus on adverse
 scenarios in evaluating defections from the status quo. The model explains
 portfolio underdiversification, home and local biases. More importantly,
 equilibrium stock prices reflect an unfamiliarity premium. In an
 international setting, our model predicts that while the standard CAPM
 fails to hold with respect to the world market portfolio, a modified CAPM
 holds wherein the market portfolio is replaced with a portfolio of the
 stock holdings of investors not subject to familiarity bias. Copyright 2011, Oxford University Press.

Title: Shareholder Rights, Boards, and CEO Compensation 
Abstract:
 I analyze the role of executive compensation in corporate governance. As
 proxies for corporate governance, I use board size, board independence,
 CEO-chair duality, institutional ownership concentration, CEO tenure, and
 an index of shareholder rights. The results from a broad cross-section of
 large U.S. public firms are inconsistent with recent claims that
 entrenched managers design their own compensation contracts. The
 interactions of the corporate governance mechanisms with total
 pay-for-performance and excess compensation can be explained by governance
 substitution. If a firm has generally weaker governance, the compensation
 contract helps better align the interests of shareholders and the CEO. Copyright 2009, Oxford University Press.

Title: One Share-One Vote: The Empirical Evidence 
Abstract:
 We survey the empirical literature on disproportional ownership, i.e. the
 use of mechanisms that separate voting rights from cash flow rights in
 corporations. Our focus is mostly on explicit mechanisms that allow some
 shareholders to acquire control with less than proportional economic
 interest in the firm (dual-class equity structures, stock pyramids,
 cross-ownership, etc.), but we also briefly discuss other mechanisms, such
 as takeover defenses and fiduciary voting. We provide a broad overview of
 different areas in this literature and highlight problems of
 interpretation that may arise because of empirical difficulties. We
 outline potentially promising areas for future research. Copyright 2008, Oxford University Press.

Title: Czech Mate: Expropriation and Investor Protection in a Converging World 
Abstract:
 This paper examines the expropriation of a foreign investor by a local
 partner and the subsequent resolution of the case through international
 arbitration in favor of the investor. Despite the investor's 99% interest
 in the joint venture, the local partner managed to divert the entire value
 of the underlying entity for his personal benefit. This clinical
 examination of an expropriation and its aftermath illustrates the
 interaction of property and contract rights in a global setting, how
 corporate control is shaped by geography, and how multinational firms may
 be advantaged by availing themselves of stronger investor protections than
 local firms. Copyright 2008, Oxford University Press.

Title: Do Nonfinancial Stakeholders Affect the Pricing of Risky Debt? Evidence from Unionized Workers 
Abstract:
 The authors study the impact of a powerful nonfinancial
 stakeholder--unionized workers--on the pricing of corporate debt. Firms in
 more unionized industries have lower bond yields. This relation is
 stronger in firms with weaker financial conditions and cannot be explained
 by the correlation of unionization with industry characteristics,
 governance mechanisms, or financial leverage. Firms in unionized
 industries implement less risky investment policies and are less likely
 targets of acquisitions. Unionization reduces yields by more when firms'
 takeover barriers are lower. Hence, unions are viewed favorably in the
 bond market because, through their influence on corporate affairs, they
 protect bondholders' wealth. Copyright 2011, Oxford University Press.

Title: Determinants of Sovereign Risk: Macroeconomic Fundamentals and the Pricing of Sovereign Debt 
Abstract:
 This paper investigates the effects of macroeconomic fundamentals on
 emerging market sovereign credit spreads. We find that the volatility of
 terms of trade in particular has a statistically and economically
 significant effect on spreads. This is robust to instrumenting terms of
 trade with a country-specific commodity price index. Our measures of
 country fundamentals have substantial explanatory power, even controlling
 for global factors and credit ratings. We also estimate default
 probabilities in a hazard model and find that model implied spreads
 capture a significant part of the variation in observed spreads
 out-of-sample. The fit is better for lower credit quality borrowers. Copyright 2010, Oxford University Press.

Title: Shareholder-Manager Disagreement and Corporate Investment 
Abstract:
 We develop a simple theoretical argument that generates testable
 predictions about how disagreement affects corporate investment and find
 strong empirical support for these predictions. Investment is negatively
 related to a proxy for disagreement, after controlling for Tobin's q, and
 after dealing with the fact that Tobin's q and our disagreement proxy
 contain measurement error. This proxy is unrelated to traditional
 indicators of asymmetric information. We also find that variation in
 disagreement is an important component of the portion of the variation in
 Tobin's q that matters for investment, and that disagreement affects
 investment and Tobin's q more if the firm has greater financial
 flexibility. Copyright 2010, Oxford University Press.

Title: Payment Defaults and Interfirm Liquidity Provision* 
Abstract:
 Using a unique data set on French firms, we show that credit constrained
 firms that face liquidity shocks are more likely to default on their
 payments to suppliers. Credit constrained firms pass on a sizeable
 fraction of such shocks to their suppliers. This is consistent with the
 idea that firms provide liquidity insurance to each other and that this
 mechanism is able to alleviate credit constraints. We show that the chain
 of defaults stops when it reaches unconstrained firms. Liquidity appears
 to be allocated from firms with access to outside finance to credit
 constrained firms along supply chains. Copyright 2013, Oxford University Press.

Title: Politically Connected Boards of Directors and The Allocation of Procurement Contracts 
Abstract:
 This article analyzes whether political connections of the board of
 directors of publicly traded companies in the USA affect the allocation of
 government procurement contracts. It focuses on the change in control of
 both House and Senate following the 1994 election and finds that companies
 with boards connected to the winning (losing) party experience a
 significant and large increase (decrease) in procurement contracts after
 the election. The results remain significant after controlling for
 industry classifications as well as for several other company
 characteristics. The findings highlight one of the main avenues through
 which corporate political connections add value to US companies. Copyright 2013, Oxford University Press.

Title: Liquidity and Arbitrage in Options Markets: A Survival Analysis Approach 
Abstract:
 This paper examines the determinants of the time it takes for an index
 options market to return to no arbitrage values after put-call parity
 deviations, using intraday transactions data from the French index options
 market. We employ survival analysis to characterize how limits to
 arbitrage influence the expected duration of arbitrage deviations. After
 controlling for conventional limits to arbitrage, we show that
 liquidity-linked variables are associated with a faster reversion of
 arbitrage profits. The introduction of an Exchange Traded Fund also
 affects the survival rates of deviations, but this impact essentially
 stems from the reduction in the level of potential arbitrage profits. Copyright 2007, Oxford University Press.

Title: Governance and Equity Prices: Does Transparency Matter?* 
Abstract:
 This article examines how accounting transparency and corporate governance
 interact. Firms with better governance are associated with higher abnormal
 returns, but even more so if they also have higher transparency. The
 effect is largely monotonic--it is small and insignificant for opaque
 firms and large and significant for transparent firms--and survives
 numerous robustness tests. We find supportive evidence for firm value and
 operating performance. Hence, governance and transparency are complements.
 This complementarity effect is consistent with the view that more
 transparent firms are more likely takeover targets, because acquirers can
 bid more effectively and identify synergies more precisely. Copyright 2013, Oxford University Press.

Title: Mortgage Market Design* 
Abstract:
 This article explores the causes and consequences of cross-country
 variation in mortgage market structure. It draws on insights from several
 fields: urban economics, asset pricing, behavioral finance, financial
 intermediation, and macroeconomics. It discusses lessons from the credit
 boom, the challenges of mortgage modification in the aftermath of the
 boom, consumer financial protection, and alternative mortgage forms and
 funding models. The article argues that the USA has much to learn from
 mortgage finance in other countries, and specifically from the Danish
 implementation of the European covered bonds system. Copyright 2013, Oxford University Press.

Title: The Dynamics of Venture Capital Contracts 
Abstract:
 Using a detailed German data set on venture capital contracts, the authors
 document that contracts between venture capitalists (VC) and their
 portfolio firms specify more complete conditions for future financing for
 firms that do have no suitable outside financing option and therefore
 lower ex post bargaining power. The authors' result is consistent with
 theories of holdup, where complete contracts protect the entrepreneur from
 expropriation by the financier. Moreover, there is evidence of learning by
 VCs. Other possible explanations for observed contracts, such as
 multitasking or coordination costs, instead have little explanation power. Copyright 2011, Oxford University Press.

Title: Informed Finance and Technological Conservatism 
Abstract:
 This paper studies an economy in which firms can operate either a mature
 or a new technology and lenders acquire information on the productive
 assets of the borrowing firms that are eligible as collateral. We
 demonstrate that when contracts are imperfectly enforceable informed
 lenders offer inexpensive funding for the mature technology but may choose
 not to finance the new one, seeking to preserve the value of their
 information on the mature assets. Using firm-level data from Italy, we
 find that banks that establish long-term relationships with firms promote
 technological progress on average. However, we find that relationship
 banks inhibit innovations that entail a large depreciation of existing
 technology-specific information such as radical innovations. Copyright 2010, Oxford University Press.

Title: Time Variation in Mutual Fund Style Exposures 
Abstract:
 Despite the wide acceptance of return-based style analysis, the method has
 several limitations. One important drawback is the assumption that style
 exposures are time-invariant. We apply results on break tests developed in
 Bai and Perron (1998, 2003) to test for style breaks. We find strong
 evidence against the hypothesis of constant time exposures in daily return
 data for European equity funds. All funds exhibit at least one break, and
 60% exhibit more than one break. We show that the main reason for style
 breaks is the mutual funds' reliance on conditional investment strategies
 based on public information and volatility estimates. Copyright 2007, Oxford University Press.

Title: Equilibrium Implications of Delegated Asset Management under Benchmarking 
Abstract:
 Despite the enormous growth of the asset management industry during the
 past decades, little is known about the asset pricing implications of
 investment intermediaries. Standard models of investment theory neither
 address the distinction between individual and institutional investors nor
 the potential implications of direct investing and delegated investing. In
 a model with endogenous delegation, the authors find that delegation leads
 to a more informative price system and lower equity premia. In the
 presence of relative return objectives, stocks exhibiting high
 correlations with the benchmark have significantly lower returns than
 stocks with low correlations. The authors' empirical results support the
 model's predictions. Copyright 2012, Oxford University Press.

Title: Unbiased Disagreement in Financial Markets, Waves of Pessimism and the Risk-Return Trade-off 
Abstract:
 Can investors with irrational beliefs be neglected as long as they are
 rational on average? Do their trades cancel out with no consequences on
 prices, as implicitly assumed by traditional models? We consider a model
 with irrational investors, who are rational on average. We obtain waves of
 pessimism and optimism that lead to countercyclical market prices of risk
 and procyclical risk-free rates. The variance of the state price density
 is greatly increased. The long run risk-return relation is modified; in
 particular, the long run market price of risk might be higher than both
 the instantaneous and the rational ones. Copyright 2010, Oxford University Press.

Title: Cross-Selling Lending and Underwriting: Scope Economies and Incentives 
Abstract:
 We highlight the implications of combining underwriting services and
 lending for the choice of underwriters and for competition in the
 underwriting business. We show that cross-selling can increase
 underwriters' incentives, and we explain three phenomena: first, that
 cross-selling is important for universal banks to enter the investment
 banking business; second, that cross-selling is particularly attractive
 for highly leveraged borrowers; third, that less-than-market rates are no
 prerequisite for cross-selling to benefit a bank's clients. In our model,
 cross-selling reduces rents in the underwriting business. Copyright 2009, Oxford University Press.

Title: Estimating the Costs of International Equity Investments 
Abstract:
 Generalizing Cooper-Kaplanis (1994), we estimate implied costs that
 reconcile international portfolios with InCAPM predictions. Costs depend
 on home- and host-country characteristics and on interactions; we estimate
 risk tolerance rather than pre-specifying it; and we control for currency
 risk, inflation hedging, fixed-interest investments, round-tripping and
 omitted countries. Estimates for developed markets are lower than reported
 before, but those for new markets are quite high: 2001-2004 inward shadow
 costs range from 0.01 %p.a. (US) to 37 (Indonesia). We find that equity
 home bias is related to a mixture of risks and frictions, such as
 information asymmetries, institutional factors and explicit costs. Copyright 2008, Oxford University Press.

Title: Rating opaque borrowers: why are unsolicited ratings lower? 
Abstract:
 This paper examines why unsolicited ratings tend to be lower than
 solicited ratings. Both self-selection among issuers and strategic
 conservatism of rating agencies may be reasonable explanations. Analyses
 of default incidences of non-U.S. borrowers between January 1996 and
 December 2006 show that rating conservatism may play a role for industrial
 firms, but self-selection cannot be fully rejected. Neither can it for
 insurance companies, though data restrictions impede further conclusions.
 For unsolicited bank ratings, however, we find strong evidence that rating
 conservatism is an important cause. The downward bias also appears to
 increase along with banks' opaqueness. Copyright 2010, Oxford University Press.
