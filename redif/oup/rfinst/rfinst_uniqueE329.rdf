Title: Do Hedge Funds Manage Their Reported Returns? 
Abstract:
 For funds with high incentives and more opportunities to inflate returns,
 we find that (i) returns during December are significantly higher than
 returns during the rest of the year, even after controlling for risk in
 both the time series and the cross-section; and (ii) this December spike
 is greater than for funds with lower incentives and fewer opportunities to
 inflate returns. These results suggest that hedge funds manage their
 returns upward in an opportunistic fashion in order to earn higher fees.
 Finally, we find strong evidence that funds inflate December returns by
 underreporting returns earlier in the year but only weak evidence that
 funds borrow from January returns in the following year.  The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title:   Asymmetric Information and Options.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 435-72
Issue: 3
Volume: 6
Year: 1993
Abstract:
  In an extension of the Kyle (1985) model of continuous insider trading,
 it is shown that asymmetric information can make it impossible to price
 options by arbitrage. Even when an option would appear to be redundant,
 its introduction into the market can cause the volatility of the
 underlying asset to become stochastic. This eliminates the potential for
 dynamically replicating the option. The change in the price process of the
 asset reflects a change in the information transmitted by volume and
 prices when the option is traded.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Raids, Rewards, and Reputations in the Market for Managerial Talent 
Abstract:
  We find that executives who jump to chief executive officer (CEO)
 positions at new employers come from firms that exhibit aboveaverage stock
 price performance. This relationship is more pronounced for more senior
 executives. No such relationship exists for jumps to non-CEO positions.
 Stock options and restricted stock do not appear to significantly affect
 the likelihood of jumping ship, but the existence of an "heir apparent" on
 the management team increases the likelihood that executives will leave
 for non-CEO positions elsewhere. Hiring grants used to attract managers
 are correlated with the equity position forfeited at the prior employer
 and with the prior employer's performance.   Copyright 2003, Oxford University Press.

Title:   Price Impact Asymmetry of Block Trades: An Institutional Trading Explanation.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 1153-81
Issue: 4
Volume: 14
Year: 2001
Abstract:
  This article develops a theoretical model to explain the permanent price
 impact asymmetry between buyer- and seller-initiated block trades (the
 permanent price impact of buys is larger than that of sells). The model
 shows how the trading strategy of institutional portfolio managers creates
 a difference between the information content of buys and sells. The main
 implication of the model is that the history of price performance
 influences the asymmetry: the longer the run-up in a stock's price, the
 less the asymmetry. The intensity of institutional trading and the
 frequency of information events affect the asymmetry differently depending
 on recent price performance.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Structuring International Cooperative Ventures 
Abstract:
  We examine the effect of bargaining power and informational asymmetry on
 the design of international cooperative ventures in the presence of
 restrictions on equity participation and investment. When the bargaining
 advantage rests with the multinational, equity participation restrictions
 can increase the profits to domestic firms and encourage suboptimal
 investment policies. Overinvestment occurs when the multinational's
 bargaining advantage is reinforced by an informational advantage, while
 underinvestment occurs when the domestic firm possesses the informational
 advantage. In contrast, when the bargaining advantage rests with the
 domestic firm, equity participation restrictions do not affect investment
 levels.   Copyright 2002, Oxford University Press.

Title:   Market Making with Discrete Prices.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 81-109
Issue: 1
Volume: 11
Year: 1998
Abstract:
  Exchange-mandated discrete pricing restrictions create a wedge between
 the underlying equilibrium price and the observed price. This wedge
 permits a competitive market maker to realize economic profits that could
 help recoup fixed costs. The optimal tick size that maximizes the expected
 profits of the market maker can be equal to $1/8 for reasonable parameter
 values. The optimal tick size is decreasing in the degree of adverse
 selection. Discreteness per se can cause time-varying bid-ask spreads,
 asymmetric commissions, and market breakdowns. Discreteness, which imposes
 additional transaction costs, reduces the value of private information.
 Liquidity traders can benefit under certain conditions.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title:   Using Proxies for the Short Rate: When Are Three Months Like an Instant?
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 763-806
Issue: 4
Volume: 12
Year: 1999
Abstract:
  The dynamics of the unobservable short rate are frequently estimated
 directly using a proxy. We examine the biases resulting from this practice
 (the 'proxy problem'). Analytic results show that the proxy problem is not
 economically significant for single-factor affine models. In the
 two-factor affine model of Longstaff and Schwartz (1992), the proxy
 problem is only economically significant for pricing discount bonds with
 maturities of more than five years. We also describe two different
 numerical procedures for assessing the magnitude of the proxy problem in a
 general interest rate model. When applied to a nonlinear single-factor
 model, they suggest that the proxy problem can be economically
 significant.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: When Do Banks Listen to Their Analysts? Evidence from Mergers and Acquisitions 
Abstract:
 We examine the conflicts of interest and the flow of information between
 divisions of financial institutions. Using data on analyst recommendations
 and stockholdings of investment banks advising acquirers in mergers, we
 find evidence that information from investment banking flows to other
 divisions of the bank. Specifically, following a merger announcement,
 changes in a bank's stockholdings of the acquirer are positively
 associated with changes in recommendations by its analyst. This
 relationship, however, does not exist before the merger announcement.
 Additional tests show that the relationship between stockholdings and
 recommendations following a merger announcement is strongest when
 conflicts of interest for analysts are likely the smallest.  The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title: Testing Asymmetric-Information Asset Pricing Models 
Abstract:
 We provide evidence for the importance of information asymmetry in asset
 pricing by using three natural experiments. Consistent with rational
 expectations models with multiple assets and multiple signals, we find
 that prices and uninformed demand fall as asymmetry increases. These falls
 are larger when more investors are uninformed, turnover is larger and more
 variable, payoffs are more uncertain, and the lost signal is more precise.
 Prices fall partly because expected returns become more sensitive to
 liquidity risk. Our results confirm that information asymmetry is priced
 and imply that a primary channel that links asymmetry to prices is
 liquidity.  The Author 2012. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title:   International Competition and Exchange Rate Shocks: A Cross-Country Industry Analysis of Stock Returns.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 215-41
Issue: 1
Volume: 14
Year: 2001
Abstract:
  This article systematically examines the importance of exchange rate
 movements and industry competition for stock returns. Common shocks to
 industries across countries are more important than competitive shocks due
 to changes in exchange rates. Weekly exchange rate shocks explain almost
 nothing of the relative performance of industries. Using returns measured
 over longer horizons, the importance of exchange rate shocks increases
 slightly and the importance of industry common shocks increases more
 substantially. Both industry and exchange rate shocks are more important
 for industries that produce internationally traded goods, but the
 importance of these shocks is economically small for these industries as
 well.	 Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Demand-Based Option Pricing 
Abstract:
 We model demand-pressure effects on option prices. The model shows that
 demand pressure in one option contract increases its price by an amount
 proportional to the variance of the unhedgeable part of the option.
 Similarly, the demand pressure increases the price of any other option by
 an amount proportional to the covariance of the unhedgeable parts of the
 two options. Empirically, we identify aggregate positions of dealers and
 end-users using a unique dataset, and show that demand-pressure effects
 make a contribution to well-known option-pricing puzzles. Indeed,
 time-series tests show that demand helps explain the overall expensiveness
 and skew patterns of index options, and cross-sectional tests show that
 demand impacts the expensiveness of single-stock options as well.  The Author 2009. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org, Oxford University Press.

Title: Multinationals as Arbitrageurs: The Effect of Stock Market Valuations on Foreign Direct Investment 
Abstract:
 Empirical evidence of imperfect integration across world capital markets
 suggests a role for cross-border arbitrage by multinationals. Consistent
 with multinational arbitrage as a determinant of foreign direct investment
 (FDI) patterns, we find that FDI flows increase sharply with
 source-country stock market valuations--particularly the component of
 valuations that is predicted to revert the next year, and particularly in
 the presence of capital account restrictions that limit other mechanisms
 of cross-country arbitrage. The results suggest the existence of a cheap
 financial capital channel in which FDI flows reflect, in part, the use of
 relatively low-cost capital available to overvalued parents in the source
 country.  The Author 2008. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org, Oxford University Press.

Title: The Costs of Being Private: Evidence from the Loan Market 
Abstract:
 Using a new dataset of UK-syndicated loans, we document a significant loan
 cost disadvantage incurred by privately held firms. For identification, we
 use the distance of a firm's headquarters to London's capital markets as a
 plausibly exogenous variation in corporate structure (i.e.,
 public/private) choice. We analyze the channels of the loan cost
 disadvantage of being private by documenting the importance of: the higher
 costs of information production, the lower bargaining power, the
 differences in ownership structure, and the differences in secondary
 market trading. Interestingly, we find no evidence that lenders price
 expected future performance into the loan spread differential.  The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: Are there permanent valuation gains to overseas listing? 
Abstract:
 This paper tests whether foreign equity listings are associated with
 permanent valuation gains and examines how market and firm characteristics
 influence any valuation effects. Using a global sample of 1,676 listings
 placed in 25 countries, we find that much of the valuation gains to
 overseas listings are not permanent. The transitory nature of valuation
 gains holds for both average US listings and average first-time firm
 listings. We find little evidence of a permanent effect on returns for
 firms that list abroad, even for firms' listings in markets that are more
 liquid, provide better legal protection, or have a larger shareholder
 base.  The Author 2008. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org, Oxford University Press.

Title: Capital Structure, Compensation and Incentives 
Abstract:
  This article illustrates an incentive-aligning role of debt in the
 presence of optimal compensation contracts. Owing to information
 asymmetry, value-maximizing compensation contracts allow managerial rents
 following high investment outcomes. The manager has an incentive to
 increase these rents by choosing investments that generate greater
 information asymmetry. An aptly chosen debt level mitigates this
 incentive, because investments that generate greater information asymmetry
 have more volatile outcomes. The greater volatility would make the debt
 risky, causing the shareholders to focus on high outcomes and therefore
 compensation contracts that reduce managerial rents. At the optimum, the
 manager avoids opportunistic investments, and the shareholders offer
 value-maximizing compensation contracts. Empirically, the analysis
 predicts a negative relationship between leverage and market-to-book that
 is reversed at extreme market-to-book ratios, a negative relationship
 between leverage and profitability, a negative relationship between
 leverage and pay-for-performance, and a positive relationship between
 pay-for-performance and investment opportunities.   Copyright 2006, Oxford University Press.

Abstract:
  A model of the nominal term structure of interest rates is developed that

 closed-form expressions for the prices of discount bonds and European
 options on bonds. Unlike the one-state-variable version of the Cox,
 Ingersoll, and Ross (1985) model, this model--even in its
 one-state-variable version--allows the term premium to change sign as a
 function of the state and the term to maturity, and also allows for shapes
 of the yield curve that are observed in the U.S. data but that are
 disallowed in the Cox, Ingersoll, and Ross model.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Volume: 4
Year: 1991
Abstract:
  An economy is analyzed in which agents first choose whether to acquire
 costly information about the return to a risky asset, and then choose
 demand functions that determine the allocation of assets. It is a
 well-known paradox that if agents are price-takers and prices are fully
 revealing, then an equilibrium with costly information acquisition does
 not exist. It is shown that if the price formation process is modeled
 explicitly and agnets are not price-takers, then it is possible to have an
 equilibrium with fully revealing prices and costly information
 acquisition.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Exchange Rates, Equity Prices, and Capital Flows 
Abstract:
  We develop an equilibrium model in which exchange rates, stock prices,
 and capital flows are jointly determined under incomplete foreign exchange
 (forex) risk trading. Incomplete hedging of forex risk, documented for
 U.S. global mutual funds, induces the following price and capital flow
 dynamics: Higher returns in the home equity market relative to the foreign
 equity market are associated with a home currency depreciation. Net equity
 flows into the foreign market are positively correlated with a foreign
 currency appreciation. The model predictions are strongly supported at
 daily, monthly, and quarterly frequencies for 17 OECD countries vis-à-vis
 the United States. Correlations are strongest after 1990 and for countries
 with higher equity market capitalization relative to GDP, suggesting that
 the observed exchange rate dynamics is indeed related to equity market
 development.   Copyright 2006, Oxford University Press.

Volume: 13
Year: 2000
Abstract:
  Empirical evidence that expected stock returns are weakly related to
 volatility at the market level appears to contradict the intuition that
 risk and return are positively related. We investigate this issue in a
 general equilibrium exchange economy characterized by a regime-switching
 consumption process with time-varying transition probabilities between
 regimes. When estimated using consumption data, the model generates a
 complex, non-linear and time-varying relation between expected returns and
 volatility, duplicating the salient features of the risk/return trade-off
 in the data. The results emphasize the importance of time-varying
 investment opportunities and highlight the perils of relying on intuition
 from static models.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Abstract:
  We investigate the informational efficiency of mutual fund performance
 for the period 1965-84. Results are shown to be sensitive to the
 measurement of performance chosen. We find that returns on S&P stocks,
 returns on non-S&P stocks, and returns on bonds are significant factors in
 performance assessment. Once we correct for the impact of non-S&P assets
 on mutual fund returns, we find that mutual funds do not earn returns that
 justify their information acquisition costs. This is consistent with
 results for prior periods. Coauthors are Martin J. Gruber, Sanjiv Das, and

Volume: 5
Year: 1992
Abstract:
  The author reports a bound on the variance of price-dividend ratios and a
 decomposition of their variance into terms that reflect changes in
 dividend growth and discount rates. The specification is not restrictive.
 The test statistics do not require construction of ex post present values;
 instead, they are restrictions on means, variances, and covariances of
 price-dividend ratios, dividend growth, and discount rates. He considers
 implications for the mean price-dividend ratio, and he evaluates whether a
 low mean discount rate can rationalize the mean and variance of
 price-dividend ratios. The results do not indicate any striking rejections
 of present-value models. However, the bulk of the variance of
 price-dividend ratios must be accounted for by changing forecasts of
 discount rates, and discount rates must possess some unusual
 characteristics.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Short-Sale Strategies and Return Predictability 
Abstract:
 We examine short selling in US stocks based on new SEC-mandated data for
 2005. There is a tremendous amount of short selling in our sample: short
 sales represent 24% of NYSE and 31% of Nasdaq share volume. Short sellers
 increase their trading following positive returns and they correctly
 predict future negative abnormal returns. These patterns are robust to
 controlling for voluntary liquidity provision and for opportunistic
 risk-bearing by short sellers. The results are consistent with short

Title: Can the Trade-off Theory Explain Debt Structure? 
Abstract:
 We examine the optimal mixture and priority structure of bank and market
 debt using a trade-off model in which banks have the unique ability to
 renegotiate outside formal bankruptcy. Flexible bank debt offers a
 superior trade-off between tax shields and bankruptcy costs. Ease of
 renegotiation limits bank debt capacity, however. Optimal debt structure
 hinges upon which party has bargaining power in private workouts. Weak
 firms have high bank debt capacity and utilize bank debt exclusively.
 Strong firms lever up to their (lower) bank debt capacity, augment with
 market debt, and place the bank senior. Therefore, the trade-off theory
 offers an explanation for: (i) why young/small firms use bank debt
 exclusively; (ii) why large/mature firms employ mixed debt financing; and
 (iii) why bank debt is senior. The trade-off theory also generates
 predictions consistent with international evidence. In countries in which
 the bankruptcy regime entails soft (tough) enforcement of contractual
 priority, bank debt capacity is low (high), implying greater (less)
 reliance on market debt.  , Oxford University Press.

Title:   Capital Structure and Dividend Irrelevance with Asymmetric Information.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 201-19
Issue: 1
Volume: 4
Year: 1991
Abstract:
  The Modigliani and Miller propositions on the irrelevancy of capital
 structure and dividends are shown to be valid in a large class of models
 with asymmetric information. The main assumption is that managerial
 compensation is chosen optimally. This differs from most of the recent
 articles on this topic, which impose by fiat a suboptimal contract. Even
 when imperfections internal to the firm preclude optimal investment, there
 is a separation between incentives and financing. We conclude that
 corporations should move toward contracts with better incentives, and that
 new models should be built that recognize the limitations to optimal
 contracting.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Wrongful Discharge Laws and Innovation 
Abstract:
 We show that wrongful discharge laws--laws that protect employees against
 unjust dismissal--spur innovation and new firm creation. Wrongful
 discharge laws, particularly those that prohibit employers from acting in
 bad faith ex post, limit employers' ability to hold up innovating
 employees after the innovation is successful. By reducing the possibility
 of holdup, these laws enhance employees'innovative efforts and encourage
 firms to invest in risky but potentially mould-breaking projects. We
 develop a model and provide supporting empirical evidence of this effect
 using the staggered adoption of wrongful discharge laws across U.S.
 states.  The Author 2013. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: Short-Term Persistence in Mutual Fund Performance 
Abstract:
  We estimate parameters of standard stock selection and market timing
 models using daily mutual fund returns and quarterly measurement periods.
 We then rank funds quarterly by abnormal return and measure the
 performance of each decile the following quarter. The average abnormal
 return of the top decile in the post-ranking quarter is 39 basis points.
 The post-ranking abnormal return disappears when funds are evaluated over
 longer periods. These results suggest that superior performance is a
 short-lived phenomenon that is observable only when funds are evaluated
 several times a year.   Copyright 2005, Oxford University Press.

Title: Mutual Funds and Bubbles: The Surprising Role of Contractual Incentives 
Abstract:
 This article studies one of the potential causes of the financial market
 bubble of the late 1990s: the herding behavior of mutual funds. We show
 that the incentives contained in the mutual funds' advisory contracts
 induce managers to overcome their tendency to herd. We argue that
 investing in bubble stocks amounts to herding and contracts with high
 incentives induce managers to diverge from the herd, thus reducing their
 holding of bubble stocks. The differential exposure to bubble stocks
 significantly impacted the funds' performance both in the period prior to
 March 2000, as well as afterwards.  The Author 2007. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies., Oxford University Press.

Title: All That Glitters: The Effect of Attention and News on the Buying Behavior of Individual and Institutional Investors 
Abstract:
 We test and confirm the hypothesis that individual investors are net
 buyers of attention-grabbing stocks, e.g., stocks in the news, stocks
 experiencing high abnormal trading volume, and stocks with extreme one-day
 returns. Attention-driven buying results from the difficulty that
 investors have searching the thousands of stocks they can potentially buy.
 Individual investors do not face the same search problem when selling
 because they tend to sell only stocks they already own. We hypothesize
 that many investors consider purchasing only stocks that have first caught
 their attention. Thus, preferences determine choices after attention has
 determined the choice set.  , Oxford University Press.

Title:   Time-Series Implications of Aggregate Dividend Behavior.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 589-618
Issue: 2
Volume: 9
Year: 1996
Abstract:
  This article investigates the hypothesis that dividend changes are
 determined by changes in some measure of permanent earnings. The analysis
 employs two measures of permanent earnings and takes into account the
 nonstationarity of dividend and earnings series. This study finds that
 dynamic dividend behavior is accounted for primarily by changes in
 permanent earnings. Dividends respond strongly to permanent changes
 earnings without any significant overreaction, whereas they respond
 little, if at all, to transitory changes in earnings. The findings also
 suggest that the partial adjustment hypothesis, which assumes managers
 partially adjust dividends to a target dividend, performs better when the
 target dividend level is proportional to permanent earnings than when it
 is proportional to current earnings.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title:   Information Revelation through Option Exercise.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 95-129
Issue: 1
Volume: 12
Year: 1999
Abstract:
  In many real-world situations, agents must formulate option exercise
 strategies with imperfect information. In such a setting, agents may infer
 the private signals of other agents through their observed exercise
 strategies. The building of an office building, the drilling of an
 exploratory oil well, and the commitment of a pharmaceutical company
 toward the research of a new drug all convey private information to other
 market participants. This article develops an equilibrium framework for
 option exercise games with asymmetric private information. Many
 interesting aspects of the patterns of equilibrium exercise are analyzed.
 In particular, informational cascades, where agents ignore their private
 information and jump on the exercise bandwagon, may arise endogenously.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: The Long-Term Effects of Cross-Listing, Investor Recognition, and Ownership Structure on Valuation 
Abstract:
 We show that investor recognition and bonding associated with a U.S.
 cross-listing are distinct effects using a sample of Canadian firms. In
 contrast to the post-listing decline documented in the literature, we find
 that cross-listed firms with a single class of shares enjoy a permanent
 increase in valuation if they attract and maintain investor recognition
 over time. Valuations of firms that fail to widen their U.S. shareholder
 base return to pre-listing levels within two years. Cross-listed firms
 with dual-class shares exhibit a permanent increase in valuation
 regardless of the level of U.S. investor holdings, consistent with
 firm-level bonding.  The Author 2008. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title:   Spreads, Depths, and the Impact of Earnings Information: An Intraday Analysis.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 345-74
Issue: 2
Volume: 6
Year: 1993
Abstract:
  For a sample of NYSE firms, we show that wide spreads are accompanied by
 low depths, and that spreads widen and depths fall in response to higher
 volume. Spreads widen and depths fall in anticipation of earnings
 announcements; these effects are more pronounced for announcements with
 larger subsequent price changes. Spreads are also wider following earnings
 announcements, but this effect dissipates quickly after controlling for
 volume. Collectively, our results suggest liquidity providers are
 sensitive to changes in information asymmetry risk and use both spreads
 and depths to actively manage this risk.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Why New Issues and High-Accrual Firms Underperform: The Role of Analysts' Credulity 
Abstract:
  We find that analysts' forecast errors are predicted by past accounting
 accruals (adjustments to cash flows to obtain reported earnings) among
 both equity issuers and nonissuers. Analysts are more optimistic for the
 subsequent four years for issuers reporting higher issue-year accruals.
 The predictive power is greater for discretionary accruals than
 nondiscretionary accruals and is independent of the presence of an
 underwriting affiliation. Predicted forecast errors from accruals
 significantly explain the long-term underperformance of new issuers. The
 predictability of forecast errors among nonissuers suggests that analysts'
 credulity about accruals management more generally contributes to market
 inefficiency.   Copyright 2002, Oxford University Press.

Title: Agency Problems and Endogenous Investment Fluctuations 
Abstract:
 This article proposes a theory of investment fluctuations in which the
 source of the oscillating dynamics is an agency problem between financiers
 and entrepreneurs. In the model, investment decisions depend on
 entrepreneurs' initiative to select investment projects ex ante, and
 financiers' incentive to control entrepreneurs ex post. Too much control
 discourages entrepreneurial incentive to initiate new investment, whereas
 too little control jeopardizes its productivity. This initiative-control
 trade-off is capable of generating endogenous reversal of investment
 booms, induced by an ongoing deterioration of project profitability.
 Investment fluctuations may arise even though no external shocks hit the
 economy and agents are perfectly rational.  The Author 2012. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title:   A Parametric Nonlinear Model of Term Structure Dynamics.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 721-62
Issue: 4
Volume: 12
Year: 1999
Abstract:
  Recent nonparametric estimation studies pioneered by Ait-Sahalia document
 that the diffusion of the short rate is similar to the parametric
 function, r[superscript 1.5], estimated by Chan et al., whereas the drift
 is substantially nonlinear in the short rate. These empirical properties
 call into question the efficacy of the existing affine term structure
 models and beg for alternative models which admit the observed behavior.
 This article presents such a model. Our model delivers closed-form
 solutions for bond prices and a concave relationship between the interest
 rate and the yields. We show that in empirical analyses, our model
 outperforms the one-factor affine models in both time-series as well as
 cross-sectional tests.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Investor Reactions to CEOs' Inside Debt Incentives 
Abstract:
 Pensions and deferred compensation represent substantial components of CEO
 incentives. We study stockholder and bondholder reactions to companies'
 initial reports of CEOs' inside debt positions following a 2007 SEC
 disclosure reform. We find that bond prices rise, equity prices fall, and
 the volatility of both securities drops for firms whose CEOs have sizeable
 defined benefit pensions or deferred compensation. Similar changes occur
 for credit default swap spreads and exchange-traded options. The results
 indicate a reduction in firm risk, a transfer of value from equity toward
 debt, and an overall destruction of enterprise value when CEOs' inside
 debt holdings are large.  The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: Optimal Executive Compensation when Firm Size Follows Geometric Brownian Motion 
Abstract:
 This paper studies a continuous-time agency model in which the agent
 controls the drift of the geometric Brownian motion firm size. The
 changing firm size generates partial incentives, analogous to awarding the
 agent equity shares according to her continuation payoff. When the agent
 is as patient as investors, performance-based stock grants implement the
 optimal contract. Our model generates a leverage effect on the equity
 returns, and implies that the agency problem is more severe for smaller
 firms. That the empirical evidence shows that grants compensation are
 largely based on the CEO's historical performance--rather than current
 performance--lends support to our model.  The Author 2008. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Journal: Review of Financial Studies

Volume: 12
Year: 1999
Abstract:
  When a market order arrives, the NYSE specialist can offer a price one
 tick better than the limit orders on the book and trade for his own
 account. Alternatively, the specialist can "stop" the market order, which
 means he guarantees execution at the current quote but provides the
 possibility of price improvement. My model shows that specialists can use
 stops to sample the future order flow before making a commitment to trade.
 I present empirical evidence that both stops and immediate price
 improvement impose adverse selection costs on limit order traders.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Building Relationships Early: Banks in Venture Capital 
Abstract:
 This paper examines bank behavior in venture capital. It considers the
 relation between a bank's venture capital investments and its subsequent
 lending, which can be thought of as intertemporal cross-selling. Theory
 suggests that unlike independent venture capital firms, banks may be
 strategic investors who seek complementarities between venture capital and
 lending activities. We find evidence that banks use venture capital
 investments to build lending relationships. Having a prior relationship
 with a company in the venture capital market increases a bank's chance of
 subsequently granting a loan to that company. Companies can benefit from
 these relationships through more favorable loan pricing.  The Author 2007. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title: Are Investors Really Reluctant to Realize Their Losses? Trading Responses to Past Returns and the Disposition Effect 
Abstract:
 We examine how investor preferences and beliefs affect trading in relation
 to past gains and losses. The probability of selling as a function of
 profit is V-shaped; at short holding periods, investors are more likely to
 sell big losers than small ones. There is little evidence of an upward
 jump in selling at zero profits. These findings provide no clear
 indication that realization preference explains trading. Furthermore, the
 disposition effect is not driven by a simple direct preference for selling
 a stock by virtue of having a gain versus a loss. Trading based on belief
 revisions can potentially explain these findings.  The Author 2012. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: Realized Skewness 
Abstract:
 The third moment of returns is important for asset pricing, but it is hard
 to measure precisely, particularly at long horizons. This paper proposes a
 definition of the realized third moment that is computed from
 high-frequency returns. It provides an unbiased estimate of the true third
 moment of long-horizon returns, doing for the third moment what realized
 variance does for the second moment. The methodology is used to
 demonstrate that the skewness of equity index returns, far from
 diminishing with horizon, actually increases with horizons up to a year,
 and its magnitude is economically important.  The Author 2012. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please <email>e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com.</email>, Oxford University Press.

Title: How Are U.S. Family Firms Controlled? 
Abstract:
 In large U.S. corporations, founding families are the only blockholders
 whose control rights on average exceed their cash-flow rights. We analyze
 how they achieve this wedge, and at what cost. Indirect ownership through
 trusts, foundations, limited partnerships, and other corporations is
 prevalent but rarely creates a wedge (a pyramid). The primary sources of
 the wedge are dual-class stock, disproportionate board representation, and
 voting agreements. Each control-enhancing mechanism has a different impact
 on value. Our findings suggest that the potential agency conflict between
 large shareholders and public shareholders in the United States is as
 relevant as elsewhere in the world.  The Author 2008. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title: Distance Still Matters: Evidence from Municipal Bond Underwriting 
Abstract:
 Using a sample of municipal bond offerings, I find that "local" investment
 banks have substantial comparative and absolute advantages over nonlocal
 counterparts---locals charge lower fees and sell bonds at lower yields.
 Local investment banks' strongest comparative advantage is at underwriting
 bonds with higher credit risk and bonds not rated by rating agencies.
 These findings suggest that high-risk bonds and nonrated bonds are more
 difficult to evaluate and market, and that investment banks with a local
 presence are better able to assess "soft" information and place difficult
 bond issues.  The Author 2008. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org, Oxford University Press.

Abstract:
  Cross-holding occurs when listed corporations own securities issued by
 other corporations. We analyze the effect of cross-holdings on market
 capitalization and return measures as well as implications for econometric
 testing of asset pricing theories. We show that cross-holdings generally
 distort standard market return and risk measures The magnitudes of such
 distortions are calculated for simulated economies by using a variety of
 crossholding patterns. In addition, cross-holdings are shown to induce
 nonstationarity in the covariance matrix of security returns. We examine
 the effect of this nonstationarity for estimating efficient frontiers and
 factor structures. We also discuss the implications for risk-return
 estimates in equilibrium asset pricing models.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Acquisition Values and Optimal Financial (In)Flexibility 
Abstract:
 This article analyzes optimal financial contracts for an incumbent and
 potential entrant accounting for prospective asset mergers. Exercising a
 first-mover advantage, the incumbent increases his share of surplus by
 issuing public debt that appreciates in the event of merger. Incumbent
 debt reduces the equilibrium value of entrant assets and thus reduces the
 return to (likelihood of) entry through two channels: venture capitalists
 recover less in default and ownership rights provide weaker managerial
 incentives. High incumbent leverage has a countervailing cost, since the
 resulting debt overhang prevents ex post efficient mergers if merger
 surplus is low. Event risk covenants limiting counterparty debt are
 optimal for the incumbent, further limiting the entrant's share of merger
 surplus. A poison-put covenant is also optimal for the incumbent, allowing
 him to extract the same surplus with lower debt face value.  The Author 2010. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title: The Idiosyncratic Volatility Puzzle: Time Trend or Speculative Episodes? 
Abstract:
 Campbell, Lettau, Malkiel, and Xu (2001) document a positive trend in
 idiosyncratic volatility during the 1962--1997 period. We show that by
 2003 volatility falls back to pre-1990s levels. Furthermore, we show that
 the increase and subsequent reversal is concentrated among firms with low
 stock prices and high retail ownership. This evidence suggests that the
 increase in idiosyncratic volatility through the 1990s was not a time
 trend but, rather, an episodic phenomenon, at least partially associated
 with retail investors. Results from cross-sectional regressions,
 conditional trend estimation, stock-split events, and "attention-grabbing"
 events are consistent with a retail trading effect.  The Author 2009. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org, Oxford University Press.

Title:   Time-Varying Expected Small Firm Returns and Closed-End Fund Discounts.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 845-87
Issue: 3
Volume: 9
Year: 1996
Abstract:
  This article describes the relation between closed-end fund discounts and
 time-varying expected excess returns on small firms. The results indicate
 that closed-end fund discounts forecast future excess returns on small
 firms. The information in discounts is independent of that in other
 commonly used forecasting variables such as the dividend yield on the
 market, the default spread, and the term spread. Furthermore, the
 closed-end fund discount forecasts only the small firm factor return and
 is the only variable that forecasts the small firm factor return.
 Additional tests indicate that the information in discounts is related to
 expectations of future earnings growth and expectations of future
 inflation. These results provide significant support for a rational
 explanation of the time-series relationship between discounts and expected
 returns on small firms.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title:   Competitive Entry and Endogenous Risk in the Foreign Exchange Market.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 757-87
Issue: 4
Volume: 11
Year: 1998
Abstract:
  Recent evidence shows that higher trader participation increases exchange
 rate volatility. To explore this linkage, we develop a dynamic model of
 endogenous entry of traders subject to heterogenous expectational errors.
 Entry of a marginal trader into the market has two effects: it increases
 the capacity of the market to absorb exogenous supply risk, and at the
 same time it adds noise and endogenous trading risk. The competitive entry
 equilibrium is characterized by excessive market entry and excessively
 volatile prices. A positive tax on entrants can decrease trader
 participation and volatility while increasing market efficiency.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: The Returns on Human Capital: Good News on Wall Street is Bad News on Main Street 
Abstract:
 We use a standard single-agent model to conduct a simple consumption
 growth accounting exercise. Consumption growth is driven by news about
 current and expected future returns on the market portfolio. We impute the
 residual of consumption growth innovations that cannot be attributed to
 either news about financial asset returns or future labor income growth to
 news about expected future returns on human wealth, and we back out the
 implied human wealth and market return process. Innovations in current and
 future human wealth returns are negatively correlated with innovations in
 current and future financial asset returns, regardless of the elasticity
 of intertemporal substitution.  The Author 2006. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org, Oxford University Press.

Title:   Default Risk Cannot Explain the Muni Puzzle: Evidence from Municipal Bonds That Are Secured by U.S. Treasury Obligations.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 281-308
Issue: 2
Volume: 11
Year: 1998
Abstract:
  Fama (1977) and Miller (1977) predict that one minus the corporate tax
 rate will equate after-tax yields from comparable taxable and tax-exempt
 bonds. Empirical evidence shows that long-term tax-exempt yields are
 higher than theory predicts. Two popular explanations for this empirical
 puzzle are that, relative to taxable bonds, municipal bonds bear more
 default risk and include costly call options. I study U.S. government
 secured municipal bond yields which are effectively default-free and
 nonmalleable. These municipal yields display the same tendency to be too
 high. I conclude that differential default risk and call options do not
 explain the municipal bond puzzle.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title:   Valuation of Bankrupt Firms.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 43-74
Issue: 1
Volume: 13
Year: 2000
Abstract:
  This study compares the market value of firms that reorganize in
 bankruptcy with estimates of value based on management's published cash
 flow projections. We estimate firm values using models that have been
 shown in other contexts to generate relatively precise estimates of value.
 We find that these methods generally yield unbiased estimates of value,
 but the dispersion of valuation errors is very wide--the sample ratio of
 estimated value to market value varies from less than 20% to greater than
 250%. Cross-sectional analysis indicates that the variation in these
 errors is related to empirical proxies for claimholders' incentives to
 overstate or understate the firm's value.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Stock Market Liquidity and the Long-run Stock Performance of Debt Issuers 
Abstract:
 Previous studies document that the stock returns of bond-issuing firms
 significantly underperform matched peers over the three to five years
 following issuance. We revisit this phenomenon and show that the
 underperformance is the result of an omitted return factor (a "bad model
 problem"). Debt issuers have significantly higher stock market liquidity
 than size and book-to-market matched counterparts, and differences in
 liquidity are largest for the worst-performing groups of issuers. When we
 additionally match on liquidity or when we include a liquidity factor in
 the model for expected returns, the evidence of underperformance
 disappears.  The Author 2010. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title: The Causal Effect of Mortgage Refinancing on Interest Rate Volatility: Empirical Evidence and Theoretical Implications 
Abstract:
 This article investigates the effects of mortgage-backed security (MBS)
 hedging activity on interest rate volatility and proposes a model that
 takes these effects into account. An empirical examination suggests that
 the inclusion of information about MBSs considerably improves model
 performance in pricing interest rate options and in forecasting future
 interest rate volatility. The empirical results are consistent with the
 hypothesis that MBS hedging affects the interest rate volatility implied
 by both options and the actual interest rate volatility. The results also
 indicate that the inclusion of information about the MBS universe may
 result in models that better describe the price of fixed-income
 securities.  The Author 2007. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org, Oxford University Press.

Title: Inflation Uncertainty, Asset Valuations, and the Credit Spreads Puzzle 
Abstract:
 Investors' learning of the state of future real fundamentals from current
 inflation leads to macroeconomic state dependence of asset valuations and
 solvency ratios of firms within given rating categories. Since credit
 spreads are convex functions of solvency ratios, average spreads are
 higher than spreads at average solvency ratios. Macroeconomic shocks carry
 risk premiums so that expected default losses are more sensitive to
 changes in the price of risk than are credit spreads. By incorporating
 state dependence and increasing the price of risk, the econometrician
 obtains high credit spreads while maintaining average default losses at
 historical levels&#x2014;the credit spreads puzzle.  The Author 2007. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title: Stock Return Characteristics, Skew Laws, and the Differential Pricing of Individual Equity Options 
Abstract:
  This article provides several new insights into the economic sources of
 skewness. First, we document the differential pricing of individual equity
 options versus the market index and relate it to variations in return
 skewness. Second, we show how risk aversion introduces skewness in the
 risk-neutral density. Third, we derive laws that decompose individual
 return skewness into a systematic component and an idiosyncratic
 component. Empirical analysis of OEX options and 30 stocks demonstrates
 that individual risk-neutral distributions differ from that of the market
 index by being far less negatively skewed. This article explains the
 presence and evolution of risk-neutral skewness over time and in the cross
 section of individual stocks.   Copyright 2003, Oxford University Press.

Title: Impatient Trading, Liquidity Provision, and Stock Selection by Mutual Funds 
Abstract:
 We show that a mutual fund's stock selection skill can be decomposed into
 additional components that include liquidity-absorbing impatient trading
 and liquidity provision. We find that past performance predicts future
 performance better among funds trading in stocks affected more by
 information events: Past winners earn a risk-adjusted after-fee excess
 return of 35 basis points per month in the future. Most of that superior
 performance comes from impatient trading. We also find that impatient
 trading is more important for growth-oriented funds, and liquidity
 provision is more important for younger income funds.  The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title: Determinants of Dividend Smoothing: Empirical Evidence 
Abstract:
 We document the cross-sectional properties of corporate dividend-smoothing
 policies and relate them to extant theories. We find that younger, smaller
 firms, firms with low dividend yields and more volatile earnings and
 returns, and firms with fewer and more disperse analyst forecasts smooth
 less. Firms that are cash cows, with low growth prospects, weaker
 governance, and greater institutional holdings, smooth more. We also
 document that dividend smoothing has steadily increased over the past 80
 years, even before firms began using share repurchases in the mid-1980s.
 Taken together, our results suggest that dividend smoothing is most common
 among firms that are not financially constrained, face low levels of
 asymmetric information, and are most susceptible to agency conflicts.
 These findings provide challenges and guidance for the developing
 theoretical literature.  The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: The Bear's Lair: Index Credit Default Swaps and the Subprime Mortgage Crisis 
Abstract:
 During the recent financial crisis, ABX.HE index credit default swaps
 (CDS) on baskets of mortgage-backed securities were a benchmark widely
 used by financial institutions to mark their subprime mortgage portfolios
 to market. However, we find that prices for the AAA ABX.HE index CDS
 during the crisis were inconsistent with any reasonable assumption for
 mortgage default rates, and that these price changes are only weakly
 correlated with observed changes in the credit performance of the
 underlying loans in the index, casting serious doubt on the suitability of
 these CDS as valuation benchmarks. We also find that the AAA ABX.HE index
 CDS price changes are related to short-sale activity for publicly traded
 investment banks with significant mortgage market exposure. This suggests
 that capital constraints, limiting the supply of mortgage-bond insurance,
 may be playing a role here similar to that identified by Froot (2001) in
 the market for catastrophe insurance.  The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: All the News That's Fit to Reprint: Do Investors React to Stale Information? 
Abstract:
 This article tests whether stock market investors appropriately
 distinguish between new and old information about firms. I define the
 staleness of a news story as its textual similarity to the previous ten
 stories about the same firm. I find that firms' stock returns respond less
 to stale news. Even so, a firm's return on the day of stale news
 negatively predicts its return in the following week. Individual investors
 trade more aggressively on news when news is stale. The subsequent return
 reversal is significantly larger in stocks with above-average individual
 investor trading activity. These results are consistent with the idea that
 individual investors overreact to stale information, leading to temporary
 movements in firms' stock prices.  The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: The Asymmetric Relation Between Initial Margin Requirements and Stock Market Volatility Across Bull and Bear Markets 
Abstract:
  Higher initial margin requirements are associated with lower subsequent
 stock market volatility during normal and bull periods, but show no
 relationship during bear periods. Higher margins are also negatively
 related to the conditional mean of stock returns, apparently because they
 reduce systemic risk. We conclude that a prudential rule for setting
 margins (or other regulatory restrictions) is to lower them in sharply
 declining markets in order to enhance liquidity and avoid a depyramiding
 effect in stock prices, but subsequently raise them and keep them at the
 higher level in order to prevent a future pyramiding effect.   Copyright 2002, Oxford University Press.

Title:   Credit Market Equilibrium with Bank Monitoring and Moral Hazard.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies

Issue: 1
Volume: 6
Year: 1993
Abstract:
  We characterize a credit market equilibrium in which banks coexist with
 capital markets and firms obtain funding from both sources. An incentive
 problem exists between the firm's insiders and outside providers of
 capital. Banks can provide not only credit but also monitoring services.
 We show that when banks cannot precommit to a particular level of
 monitoring, there is a unique credit market equilibrium with firms being
 financed with a combination of bank credit and external capital. In this
 equilibrium, a marginal substitution of bank credit for capital market
 financing would raise the firm's stock price.	 Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Employee Reload Options: Pricing, Hedging, and Optimal Exercise 
Abstract:
  Reload options, call options granting new options on exercise, are
 popularly used in compensation. Although the compound option feature may
 seem complicated, there is a distribution-free dominant policy of
 exercising reload options whenever they are in the money. The optimal
 policy implies general formulas for numerical valuation. Simpler formulas
 for valuation and hedging follow from Black--Scholes assumptions with or
 without continuous dividends. Time vesting affects the optimal policy, but
 numerical results indicate that it is nearly optimal to exercise in the
 money whenever feasible. The results suggest that reload options produce
 similar incentives as employee stock options and share grants.   Copyright 2003, Oxford University Press.

Title: A New Perspective on Gaussian Dynamic Term Structure Models 
Abstract:
 In any canonical Gaussian dynamic term structure model (GDTSM), the
 conditional forecasts of the pricing factors are invariant to the
 imposition of no-arbitrage restrictions. This invariance is maintained
 even in the presence of a variety of restrictions on the factor structure
 of bond yields. To establish these results, we develop a novel canonical
 GDTSM in which the pricing factors are observable portfolios of yields.
 For our normalization, standard maximum likelihood algorithms converge to
 the global optimum almost instantaneously. We present empirical estimates
 and out-of-sample forecasts for several GDTSMs using data on U.S. Treasury
 bond yields.  The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: Asset Pricing and the Credit Market 
Abstract:
 This article studies the central role of the credit market. We show that
 the credit market facilitates optimal risk sharing by allowing less
 risk-averse investors to take on levered positions and consume more risk.
 The equilibrium amount behaves procyclically when aggregate consumption is
 low but countercyclically when it is high. The varying size of the credit
 market modifies the amount of risk sharing, which in turn influences asset
 prices such as expected stock returns, stock return volatility, and the
 term structure of interest rates. Our article provides a frictionless
 benchmark for the role and the behavior of the credit market.  The Author 2012. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: Competition and Cooperation in Divisible Good Auctions: An Experimental Examination 
Abstract:
  An experimental approach is used to examine the performance of three
 different multiunit auction designs: discriminatory, uniform-price with
 fixed supply, and uniform-price with endogenous supply. We find the actual
 strategies to be inconsistent with theoretically identified equilibrium
 strategies. The discriminatory auction is found to be more susceptible to
 collusion than either uniform-price auction and so, contrary to
 theoretical predictions and previous experimental results, it generates
 the lowest average revenue. Consistent with theoretical predictions, the
 actual bid schedules are more elastic with reducible supply or
 discriminatory pricing than in the uniform-price auction with fixed
 supply.   Copyright 2006, Oxford University Press.

Title:   Takeover Bidding with Toeholds: The Case of the Owner's Curse.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 679-704
Issue: 4
Volume: 11
Year: 1998
Abstract:
  This article demonstrates that a potential acquirer with a toehold bids
 aggressively and possibly overpays in equilibrium. The aggressiveness of a
 bidder with a toehold increases further if he is able to renege on his
 winning bid. A bidder without a toehold, however, responds by shading his
 bids. The target firm can increase competition and the expected sale price
 if it only entertains nonretractable bids. This article provides testable
 implications on the probability of bidder success, stock price reactions
 on bid revisions and on resolution of the contest, and expected gains to
 bidders and the target firm.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: The Economics of Fraudulent Accounting 
Abstract:
 We argue that earnings management and fraudulent accounting have important
 economic consequences. In a model where the costs of earnings management
 are endogenous, we show that in equilibrium, low-productivity firms hire
 and invest too much in order to pool with high productivity firms. This
 behavior distorts the allocation of economic resources in the economy. We
 test the predictions of the model using firm-level data. We show that
 during periods of suspicious accounting, firms hire and invest
 excessively, while managers exercise options. When the misreporting is
 detected, firms shed labor and capital and productivity improves. Our
 firm-level results hold both before and after the market crash of 2000. In
 the aggregate, our model provides a novel explanation for periods of
 jobless and investment-less growth.  The Author 2007. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title:   A Further Analysis of the Lead-Lag Relationship between the Cash Market and Stock Index Futures Market.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 123-52
Issue: 1
Volume: 5
Year: 1992
Abstract:
  The intraday lead-lag relation between returns of the Major Market cash
 index and returns of the Major Market Index futures and S&P 500 futures is
 investigated. Empirical results show strong evidence that the futures
 leads the cash index and weak evidence that the cash index leads the
 futures. The asymmetric lead-lag relation holds between the futures and
 all component stocks, including those that trade in almost every
 five-minute interval. Evidence indicates that when more stocks move
 together (market-wide information) the futures leads the cash index to a
 greater degree. This suggests that the futures market is the main source
 of market-wide information.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title:   Bayesian Inference and Portfolio Efficiency.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 1-53
Issue: 1
Volume: 8
Year: 1995
Abstract:
  A Bayesian approach is used to investigate a sample's information about a
 portfolio's degree of inefficiency. With standard diffuse priors,
 posterior distributions for measures of portfolio inefficiency can
 concentrate well away from values consistent with efficiency, even when
 the portfolio is exactly efficient in the sample. The data indicate that
 the NYSE - AMEX market portfolio is rather inefficient in the presence of
 a riskless asset, although this conclusion is justified only after an
 analysis using informative priors. Including a riskless asset
 significantly reduces any sample's ability to produce posterior
 distributions supporting small degrees of inefficiency.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title:   Dynamic Equilibrium and the Real Exchange Rate in a Spatially Separated World.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 153-80
Issue: 2
Volume: 5
Year: 1992
Abstract:
  Two homogeneous stocks of physical capital are located in two different
 countries, separated by an "ocean." They are consumed by local residents,
 invested in a random production process yielding real returns, or
 transferred abroad. Under proportional transfer costs, trade, consumption,
 and capital imbalances are shown to be persistent. The heteroskedastic
 process for the relative price of capital in the two countries has a
 nonlinear, mean-reverting drift. Nevertheless, the conditional probability
 of the price moving from the parity value of unity is greater than the
 probability of it moving toward parity. The real interest-rate
 differential incorporates a simple risk premium.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title:   Design and Valuation of Debt Contracts.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 37-68
Issue: 1
Volume: 9
Year: 1996
Abstract:
  This article studies the design and valuation of debt contracts in a
 general dynamic setting under uncertainty. We incorporate some insights of
 the recent corporate finance literature into a valuation framework. The
 basic framework is an extensive form game determined by the terms of a
 debt contract and applicable bankruptcy laws. Debtholders and
 equityholders behave noncooperatively. The firm's reorganization boundary
 is determined endogenously. Strategic debt service results in
 significantly higher default premia at even small liquidation costs.
 Deviations from absolute priority and forced liquidations occur along the
 equilibrium path. The design tends to stress higher coupons and sinking
 funds when firms have a higher cash payout ratio.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Corporate Finance and the Monetary Transmission Mechanism 
Abstract:
  We analyze the transmission effects of monetary policy in a general
 equilibrium model of the financial sector, with bank lending and
 securities markets. Bank lending is constrained by capital adequacy
 requirements, and asymmetric information adds a cost to outside bank
 equity capital. In our model, monetary policy does not affect bank lending
 through changes in bank liquidity; rather, it operates through changes in
 the spread of bank loans over corporate bonds, which induce changes in the
 aggregate composition of financing by firms, and in banks' equity-capital
 base. The model produces multiple equilibria, one of which displays all
 the features of a "credit crunch."   Copyright 2006, Oxford University Press.

Title: Convertible Bond Arbitrageurs as Suppliers of Capital 
Abstract:
 This article examines the potential impact of capital supply on security
 issuance. We focus on the role of convertible bond arbitrageurs as
 suppliers of capital to convertible bond issuers. We estimate a
 simultaneous equations model of demand and supply of convertible bond
 capital, linking the time series of aggregate convertible bond issuance to
 measures of capital supply: convertible bond arbitrage hedge fund flows,
 returns, and a proxy for arbitrageurs' use of leverage. We find that
 issuance is positively and significantly related to increases in all three
 supply measures. To provide further interpretation, we use the
 September/October 2008 short-selling ban as a natural experiment to
 examine the impact of an exogenous shock to the supply of capital from
 arbitrageurs. Results from both empirical approaches provide evidence that
 the supply of capital from convertible bond arbitrageurs impacts issuance.  The Author 2010. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title: Money Illusion and Housing Frenzies 
Abstract:
 A reduction in inflation can fuel run-ups in housing prices if people
 suffer from money illusion. For example, investors who decide whether to
 rent or buy a house by simply comparing monthly rent and mortgage payments
 do not take into account the fact that inflation lowers future real
 mortgage costs. We decompose the price-rent ratio into a rational
 component&#x2014;meant to capture the 'proxy effect' and risk
 premia&#x2014;and an implied mispricing. We find that inflation and
 nominalinterest rates explain a large share of the time series variation
 of the mispricing, and that the tilt effect is very unlikely to
 rationalize this finding.  The Author 2007. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org, Oxford University Press.

Title:   Simple Binomial Processes as Diffusion Approximations in Financial Models.

Pages: 393-430
Issue: 3
Volume: 3
Year: 1990
Abstract:
  A binomial approximation to a diffusion is defined as " computationally
 simple" if the number of nodes grows at most linearly in the number of
 time intervals. It is shown how to construct computationally simple
 binomial processes that converge weakly to commonly employed diffusions in
 financial models. The convergence of the sequence of bond and European
 option prices from these processes to the corresponding values in the
 diffusion limit is also demonstrated. Numerical examples from the constant
 elasticity of variance stock price and the Cox, Ingersoll, and Ross (1985)
 discount bond price are provided.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Does Government Ownership Affect the Cost of Debt? Evidence from Privatization 
Abstract:
 We explore whether government ownership affects the cost of debt using a
 sample of fully and partially privatized companies. On average across
 firms, a one-percentage-point decrease in government ownership is
 associated with an increase in the credit spread, used as a proxy for the
 cost of debt, by three-quarters of a basis point. However, fully
 privatized companies exhibit lower credit spreads than partially
 privatized firms, indicating the cost of a lengthy privatization process.
 Empirical evidence suggests that these findings result from decreasing
 government guarantees, firm performance improvements, ownership
 uncertainty, and bondholder-shareholder conflicts.  The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: Stock and Option Grants with Performance-based Vesting Provisions 
Abstract:
 We assemble a sample of 983 equity-based awards that include either an
 accelerated- or a contingent-vesting provision tied to firm performance
 and explore the frequency, contractual nature, usage, and implications of
 such awards. We find that performance-vesting (p-v) provisions specify
 meaningful performance hurdles and provide significant incentives for
 executives. The propensity to use p-v provisions is positively related to
 the arrival of a new CEO and the proportion of outsiders on the board of
 directors and negatively related to prior stock performance.
 Performance-vesting firms have significantly better subsequent operating
 performance than control firms. Abnormal accounting performance does not
 arise from earnings management or discernible differences in financial or
 investment policy.  The Author 2010. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title: Information Linkages and Correlated Trading 
Abstract:
 In a market with informationally connected traders, the dynamics of
 volume, price informativeness, price volatility, and liquidity are
 severely affected by the information linkages every trader experiences
 with his peers. We show that in the presence of information linkages among
 traders, volume and price informativeness increase. Moreover, we find that
 information linkages improve or damage market depth, and lower or boost
 the Traders' profits, according to whether these linkages convey
 positively or negatively correlated signals. Finally, our model predicts
 patterns of trade correlation consistent with those identified in the
 empirical literature: trades generated by "neighbor" traders are
 positively correlated and trades generated by "distant" traders are
 negatively correlated.  The Author 2009. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title: Big Business Owners in Politics 
Abstract:
 This paper investigates a little studied but common mechanism that firms
 use to obtain state favors: business owners themselves seeking election to
 top office. Using Thailand as a research setting, we find that the more
 business owners rely on government concessions or the wealthier they are,
 the more likely they are to run for top office. Once in power, the market
 valuation of their firms increases dramatically. Surprisingly, the
 political power does not influence the financing strategies of their
 firms. Instead, business owners in top offices use their policy-decision
 powers to implement regulations and public policies favorable to their
 firms. Such policies hinder not only domestic competitors but also foreign
 investors. As a result, these politically connected firms are able to
 capture more market share.  The Author 2008. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title: Corporate Liquidity and Capital Structure 
Abstract:
 We solve for a firm's optimal cash holding policy within a continuous
 time, contingent claims framework using dividends, short-term borrowing,
 and equity issues as controls assuming mean reversion of earnings. Optimal
 cash is non-monotone in business conditions and increasing in the level of
 long-term debt. The model matches closely a wide range of empirical
 benchmarks and predicts cash and leverage dynamics in line with the
 empirical literature. Firm value is quite insensitive to changes in the
 level of long-term debt. The model has interesting implications for asset
 substitution, hedging, and pecking order. Growth opportunities do not
 greatly affect cash holding policy.  The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: The Dating Game: Do Managers Designate Option Grant Dates to Increase their Compensation? 
Abstract:
 We provide evidence of two variants of a dating game that entails picking
 a grant date ex post, that is, after the board's compensation decision is
 made: back-dating (picking a date before the board decision date), and
 forward-dating (waiting after the board decision date to observe the stock
 price behavior). Consistent with back-dating, we find stock return
 behavior around the grant date to be positively related to reporting lag.
 In the promptly reported sample, we find stock return behavior and the
 pattern of reporting lags consistent with forward-dating. Our calculations
 show that managers can obtain economically significant benefits by playing
 the dating game.  , Oxford University Press.

Abstract:
  This article provides an exact Bayesian framework for analyzing the

 obtain the exact posterior distributions for functions of interest in the
 factor model. In particular, we propose a measure of the APT pricing
 deviations and obtain its exact posterior distribution. Using monthly
 portfolio returns grouped by industry and market capitalization, we find
 that there is little improvement in reducing the pricing errors by
 including more factors beyond the first one.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title:   The Effect of Information Releases on the Pricing and Timing of Equity Issues.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 685-708
Issue: 4
Volume: 4
Year: 1991
Abstract:
  With time-varying adverse selection in the market for new equity issues,
 firms will prefer to issue equity when the market is most informed about
 the quality of the firm. This implies that equity issues tend to follow
 credible information releases. In addition, if the asymmetry in
 information increases over time between information releases, the price
 drop at the announcement of an equity issue should increase in the time
 since the last information relese. Using earnings releases as a proxy for
 informative events, we find evidence supporting these propositions.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Year: 1997
Abstract:
  This article synthesizes some recent progress in the theories of
 corporate control and political lobbying to model the proxy campaign as a
 political campaign. The model yields a number of testable implications,
 only some of which have been examined in the literature. For example, if
 the loss from voting for a "bad" dissident exceeds the gain from voting
 for a "good" dissident, the model predicts that as communication costs
 fall, the number of proxy fights increases, announcement day returns
 decrease, and the fraction of dissident wins first increases and then
 decreases.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Why the NPV Criterion does not Maximize NPV 
Abstract:
  This article presents a theory of capital allocation that shows how the
 use of net present value (NPV) as an investment criterion leads to
 inefficient capital budgeting outcomes and how this criterion may be
 dominated by other capital budgeting criteria, like the internal rate of
 return and the profitability index. The essence of our theory is rooted in
 the mainstream paradigm of corporate finance: while firms use NPV to
 measure the addition to firm value from prospective projects, "classical"
 informational and agency considerations prevent it from implementing the
 optimal capital budgeting outcome. Our theory also identifies conditions
 when alternative criteria should be used. Finally, we characterize when
 direct monitoring through capital budgeting dominates compensation
 contracts in alleviating the agency problem.   Copyright 2004, Oxford University Press.

Title:   Testing for Deliberate Underpricing in the IPO Premarket: A Stochastic Frontier Approach.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 1251-69
Issue: 4
Volume: 9
Year: 1996
Abstract:
  We re-evaluate the IPO underpricing phenomenon using the stochastic
 frontier methodology. The advantage of the stochastic frontier is that it
 can be used to measure the level of deliberate underpricing in the
 premarket without using after-market information. This is accomplished
 through the estimation of a systematic one-sided error term that measures
 "inefficiency" or the difference between the maximum predicted offer price
 and the actual offer price. Data for the analysis are comprised of 1,035
 IPOs of common stock issued by firm commitment between 1975 and 1984. IPOs
 appear to be deliberately underpriced in the premarket in both hot-market
 and nonhot-market periods. Moreover, the determinants of the maximum IPO
 price have different effects in the two time periods.	 Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Optimal Contracts in a Continuous-Time Delegated Portfolio Management Problem 
Abstract:
  This article studies the contracting problem between an individual
 investor and a professional portfolio manager in a continuous-time
 principal-agent framework. Optimal contracts are obtained in closed form.
 These contracts are of a symmetric form and suggest that a portfolio
 manager should receive a fixed fee, a fraction of the total assets under
 management, plus a bonus or a penalty depending upon the portfolio's
 excess return relative to a benchmark portfolio. The appropriate benchmark
 portfolio is an active index that contains risky assets where the number
 of shares invested in each asset can vary over time, rather than a passive
 index in which the number of shares invested in each asset remains
 constant over time.   Copyright 2003, Oxford University Press.

Title:   Foreign Equity Investment Restrictions, Capital Flight, and Shareholder Wealth Maximization: Theory and Evidence.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 1019-57
Issue: 4
Volume: 8
Year: 1995
Abstract:
  This article provides a theory of foreign equity investment restrictions.
 We consider a model where the demand function for domestic shares differs
 between domestic and foreign investors because of deadweight costs in
 holding domestic and foreign securities that depend on the country of
 residence of investors. We show that domestic entrepreneurs maximize firm
 value by discriminating between domestic and foreign investors. The model
 implies that countries benefitting from capital flight have binding
 ownership restrictions such that foreign investors pay a higher price for
 shares than domestic investors. The empirical implications of this theory
 are supported by evidence from Switzerland.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title:   Bank Power and Cash Holdings: Evidence from Japan.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 1059-82
Issue: 4
Volume: 14
Year: 2001
Abstract:
  Using industrial firms from the United States, German, and Japan, we
 examine the effect of bank power on cash holdings. We show that Japanese
 firms hold more cash than U.S. or German firms. We also document that
 Japanese cash balances are affected by the monopoly power of banks. During
 periods with powerful banks, firms' high cash holdings are consistent with
 banks extracting rents. When banks weakened, Japanese cash levels became
 more like U.S. firms. We conclude that strong Japanese banks persuade
 firms to hold large cash balances. This is contrary to widely held beliefs
 about the Japanese governance system.	 Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Pricing Interest Rate Derivatives: A General Approach 
Abstract:
  The relationship between affine stochastic processes and bond pricing
 equations in exponential term structure models has been well established.
 We connect this result to the pricing of interest rate derivatives. If the
 term structure model is exponential affine, then there is a linkage
 between the bond pricing solution and the prices of many widely traded
 interest rate derivative securities. Our results apply to m-factor
 processes with n diffusions and l jump processes. The pricing solutions
 require at most a single numerical integral, making the model easy to
 implement. We discuss many options that yield solutions using the methods
 of the article.   Copyright 2002, Oxford University Press.

Title: What Motivates Minority Acquisitions? The Trade-Offs between a Partial Equity Stake and Complete Integration 
Abstract:
 Minority acquisitions, involving less than 50% of the target, represent a
 distinct organizational choice. Minority acquisition can mitigate some of
 the incentive problems that arise in contractual relationships. Less is
 known, however, about the trade-off between minority acquisitions and
 complete integration. We find that minority acquisitions are more common
 when keeping target managerial incentives intact is important and when the
 target is financially constrained or can benefit from certification.
 Minority acquisitions are also more likely when the target's valuation is
 especially uncertain; integrating internal capital markets will be costly;
 and consolidating earning will lower earnings per share (EPS).  The Author 2012. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: Bond Liquidity Premia 
Abstract:
 Theory predicts that funding conditions faced by financial intermediaries
 are an important limit to arbitrage. We identify and measure the value of
 funding liquidity from the cross-section of Treasury securities. To
 validate our interpretation, we establish linkages with funding conditions
 in the repo market, the shadow banking sector, and the overall economy.
 Looking at asset pricing implications, we find that increases in funding
 liquidity predict lower risk premia for all Treasury securities but higher
 risk premia on LIBOR loans, swap contracts, and corporate bonds. The
 impact of funding conditions on interest rates is large and pervasive
 throughout crises and normal times.  The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title:   Financial and Industrial Structure with Agency.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 431-74
Issue: 2
Volume: 8
Year: 1995
Abstract:
  A sub game perfect Nash equilibrium is characterized for an industry with
 dissipative costs of agency. In sequence, firms can enter the industry,
 raise capital with external debt and/or equity, invest in a
 capital-intensive technology or dissipate capital in perquisites, and
 finally produce output. For plausible values of two critical parameters,
 some, firms forego in equilibrium investments with positive net present
 values. Although more managers would like their firms to invest in the
 capital-intensive technology, they cannot raise the required cash in the
 capital market. In equilibrium, the industry can have both a profitable
 core of large, secure, capital intensive firms, with some debt but no
 unique optimal capital structure, and a competitive fringe of small,
 risky, labor-intensive firms. Even as the cost of entry converges to zero,
 capital-intensive firms can earn extraordinary profits, while all
 labor-intensive firms fail. With costly agency, access to capital can
 become a barrier to entry.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Volume: 12
Year: 1999
Abstract:
  This study examines the impact of competition on bid-ask spreads in the
 spot foreign exchange market. We measure competition primarily by the
 number of dealers active in the market and find that bid-ask spreads
 decrease with an increase in competition, even after controlling for the
 effects of volatility. The expected level of competition is time varying,
 highly predictable, and displays a strong seasonal component that in part
 is induced by geographic concentration of business activity over the
 24-hour trading day. Our estimates show that the expected addition of one
 more competing dealer lowers the average quoted spread by 1.7%.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Year: 1999
Abstract:
  In dealership markets disclosure of size and price of details of public
 trades is typically incomplete. We examine whether full and prompt
 disclosure of public-trade details improves the welfare of a risk-averse
 investor. We analyze a model of dealership market where a market maker
 first executes a public trade and then offsets her position by trading
 with other market makers. We distinguish between quantity risk and price
 revision risk. We show that if the market maker learns some information
 about the motive behind public trade, neither regime is unambiguously
 welfare superior. This is because greater transparency improves quantity
 risk sharing but worsens price revision risk sharing.	 Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Insider Trades and Demand by Institutional and Individual Investors 
Abstract:
 There is a strong inverse relation between insider trading and
 institutional demand the same quarter and over the previous year. Our
 analysis suggests a combination of factors contribute to this relation.
 First, institutional investors are more likely to provide the liquidity
 necessary for insiders to trade. Second, insiders are more likely to buy
 low valuation and low lag return stocks while institutions are attracted
 to the opposite security characteristics. Last, the results are consistent
 with the hypothesis that insiders are more likely to view their securities
 as overvalued (undervalued) following a period when institutions were net
 buyers (sellers).  The Author 2010. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title:   Modeling Asymmetric Comovements of Asset Returns.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 817-44
Issue: 4
Volume: 11
Year: 1998
Abstract:
  Existing time-varying covariance models usually impose strong
 restrictions on how past shocks affect the forecasted covariance matrix.
 In this article we compare the restrictions imposed by the four most
 popular multivariate GARCH models, and introduce a set of robust
 conditional moment tests to detect misspecification. We demonstrate that
 the choice of a multivariate volatility model can lead to substantially
 different conclusions in any application that involves forecasting dynamic
 covariance matrices (like estimating the optimal hedge ratio or deriving
 the risk minimizing portfolio). We therefore introduce a general model
 which nests these four models and their natural 'asymmetric' extensions.
 The new model is applied to study the dynamic relation between large and
 small firm returns.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Governance Through Trading and Intervention: A Theory of Multiple Blockholders 
Abstract:
 Traditional theories argue that governance is strongest under a single
 large blockholder, as she has high incentives to undertake value-enhancing
 interventions. However, most firms are held by multiple small
 blockholders. This article shows that, while such a structure generates
 free-rider problems that hinder intervention, the same coordination
 difficulties strengthen a second governance mechanism: disciplining the
 manager through trading. Since multiple blockholders cannot coordinate to
 limit their orders and maximize combined trading profits, they trade
 competitively, impounding more information into prices. This strengthens
 the threat of disciplinary trading, inducing higher managerial effort. The
 optimal blockholder structure depends on the relative effectiveness of
 manager and blockholder effort, the complementarities in their outputs,
 information asymmetry, liquidity, monitoring costs, and the manager's
 contract.  The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Year: 2001
Abstract:
  Volatility in equity markets is asymmetric: contemporaneous return and
 conditional return volatility are negatively correlated. In this article I
 develop an asymmetric volatility model where dividend growth and dividend
 volatility are the two state variables of the economy. The model allows
 both the leverage effect and the volatility feedback effect, the two
 popular explanations of asymmetry. The model is estimated by the simulated
 method of moments. I find that both the leverage effect and volatility
 feedback are important determinants of asymmetric volatility, and
 volatility feedback is significant both statistically and economically.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Financial Constraints, Investment, and the Value of Cash Holdings 
Abstract:
 Previous studies report that cash holdings are more valuable for
 financially constrained firms than for unconstrained firms. We examine (i)
 why this is so and (ii) why some constrained firms appear to hold too
 little cash. Our results indicate that greater cash holdings are
 associated with higher levels of investment for constrained firms with
 high hedging needs and that the association between investment and value
 is stronger for constrained firms than for unconstrained firms. These
 findings imply that higher cash holdings allow constrained firms to
 undertake value-increasing projects that might otherwise be bypassed. We
 further find that some constrained firms exhibit low cash holdings because
 of persistently low cash flows. Overall, our findings support the view
 that greater cash holdings of constrained firms are a value-increasing
 response to costly external financing.  The Author 2009. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title: Systematic Risk and the Price Structure of Individual Equity Options 
Abstract:
 This study demonstrates the impact of systematic risk on the prices of
 individual equity options. The option prices are characterized by the
 level and slope of implied volatility curves, and the systematic risk is
 measured as the proportion of systematic variance in the total variance.
 Using daily option quotes on the S, and P 100 index and its 30 largest
 component stocks, we show that after controlling for the underlying
 asset's total risk, a higher amount of systematic risk leads to a higher
 level of implied volatility and a steeper slope of the implied volatility
 curve. Thus, systematic risk proportion can help differentiate the price
 structure across individual equity options.  The Author 2008. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org, Oxford University Press.

Title: Empirical Analysis of Corporate Credit Lines 
Abstract:
 Since bank credit lines are a major source of corporate funding, we
 examine the determinants of their usage with a comprehensive database of
 Spanish corporate credit lines. A line's default status is a key factor
 driving its usage, which increases as firm financial conditions worsen.
 Firms with prior defaults access their credit lines less, suggesting that
 bank monitoring influences firms' usage decisions. Line usage has an aging
 effect that causes it to decrease by roughly 10% per year of its life.
 Lender characteristics, such as the length of a firm's banking
 relationships, as well as macroeconomic conditions, affect usage
 decisions.  The Author 2009. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title: Time-Varying Risk Premiums and the Output Gap 
Abstract:
 The output gap, a production-based macroeconomic variable, is a strong
 predictor of U.S. stock returns. It is a prime business cycle indicator
 that does not include the level of market prices, thus removing any
 suspicion that returns are forecastable due to a "fad" in prices being
 washed away. The output gap forecasts returns both in-sample and
 out-of-sample, and it is robust to a host of checks. We show that the
 output gap also has predictive power for excess stock returns in other G7
 countries and U.S. excess bond returns.  The Author 2008. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org, Oxford University Press.

Title: What You Sell Is What You Lend? Explaining Trade Credit Contracts 
Abstract:
 We relate trade credit to product characteristics and aspects of
 bank--firm relationships and document three main empirical regularities.
 First, the use of trade credit is associated with the nature of the
 transacted good. In particular, suppliers of differentiated products and
 services have larger accounts receivable than suppliers of standardized
 goods and firms buying more services receive cheaper trade credit for
 longer periods. Second, firms receiving trade credit secure financing from
 relatively uninformed banks. Third, a majority of the firms in our sample
 appear to receive trade credit at low cost. Additionally, firms that are
 more creditworthy and have some buyer market power receive larger early
 payment discounts.  The Author 2008. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title: Are U.S. CEOs Paid More? New International Evidence 
Abstract:
 This paper challenges the widely accepted stylized fact that chief
 executive officers (CEOs) in the United States are paid significantly more
 than their foreign counterparts. Using CEO pay data across fourteen
 countries with mandated pay disclosures, we show that the U.S. pay premium
 is economically modest and primarily reflects the performance-based pay
 demanded by institutional shareholders and independent boards. Indeed, we
 find no significant difference in either level of CEO pay or the use of
 equity-based pay between U.S. and non-U.S. firms exposed to international
 and U.S. capital, product, and labor markets. We also show that U.S. and
 non-U.S. CEO pay has largely converged in the 2000s.  The Author 2012. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: Precarious Politics and Return Volatility 
Abstract:
 We examine how local and global political risks affect industry return
 volatility. Our central premise is that some industries are more sensitive
 to political events than others. We find that industries that are more
 dependent on trade, contract enforcement, and labor exhibit greater return
 volatility when local political risks are higher. Political uncertainty in
 countries of trading partners of trade-dependent industries similarly
 results in greater volatility. Volatility decomposition results indicate
 that while systematic volatility is associated with domestic political
 uncertainty, global political risks translate into larger idiosyncratic
 volatility.  The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: Nonparametric Specification Testing for Continuous-Time Models with Applications to Term Structure of Interest Rates 
Abstract:
  We develop a nonparametric specification test for continuous-time models
 using the transition density. Using a data transform and correcting for
 the boundary bias of kernel estimators, our test is robust to serial
 dependence in data and provides excellent finite sample performance.
 Besides univariate diffusion models, our test is applicable to a wide
 variety of continuous-time and discrete-time dynamic models, including
 time-inhomogeneous diffusion, GARCH, stochastic volatility,
 regime-switching, jump-diffusion, and multivariate diffusion models. A
 class of separate inference procedures is also proposed to help gauge
 possible sources of model misspecification. We strongly reject a variety
 of univariate diffusion models for daily Eurodollar spot rates and some
 popular multivariate affine term structure models for monthly U.S.
 Treasury yields.   Copyright 2005, Oxford University Press.

Title: An Equilibrium Model of Rare-Event Premia and Its Implication for Option Smirks 
Abstract:
  This article studies the asset pricing implication of imprecise knowledge
 about rare events. Modeling rare events as jumps in the aggregate
 endowment, we explicitly solve the equilibrium asset prices in a
 pure-exchange economy with a representative agent who is averse not only
 to risk but also to model uncertainty with respect to rare events. The
 equilibrium equity premium has three components: the diffusive- and
 jump-risk premiums, both driven by risk aversion; and the "rare-event
 premium," driven exclusively by uncertainty aversion. To disentangle the
 rare-event premiums from the standard risk-based premiums, we examine the
 equilibrium prices of options across moneyness or, equivalently, across
 varying sensitivities to rare events. We find that uncertainty aversion
 toward rare events plays an important role in explaining the pricing
 differentials among options across moneyness, particularly the prevalent
 "smirk" patterns documented in the index options market.   Copyright 2005, Oxford University Press.

Title: Short Selling Around Seasoned Equity Offerings 
Abstract:
 We use daily short-selling data to examine whether short selling around
 seasoned equity offerings (SEOs) reflects informed or manipulative
 trading. Around SEO announcements, we find no evidence of informed short
 selling. Around issue dates, higher levels of pre-issue short selling are
 significantly related to larger issue discounts for non-shelf-registered
 offerings. This evidence is consistent with manipulative trading. We show
 that SEC Rule 105 constrains some but not all manipulative trading. Our
 results reverse previous research that uses monthly short-interest data,
 because daily data allow more powerful tests. Our evidence helps explain
 the increased popularity of shelf registrations. Although short selling
 usually enhances price efficiency, we document a situation where short
 selling reduces price efficiency.  The Author 2010. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title:   Control Rights, Debt Structure, and the Loss of Private Benefits: The Case of the U.K. Insolvency Code.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 1165-1210
Issue: 4
Volume: 9
Year: 1996
Abstract:
  We show how the efficiency of reorganization is affected by the
 distribution of control rights under the U.K. insolvency code. Control
 rights raise particular problems when creditors have different incentives
 to keep the firm as a going concern. Such differences may arise from the
 possession of private benefits by particular creditors which are lost if
 the debtor firm is liquidated. The incidence of inefficient liquidations
 is influenced by the size and seniority of creditors' claims. The current
 U.K. code is widely thought to give rise to inefficient liquidations. We
 show, however, that inefficiency depends upon the debt structure and
 whether the controlling creditor in formal bankruptcy has private
 benefits.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Forecasting Default with the Merton Distance to Default Model 
Abstract:
 We examine the accuracy and contribution of the Merton distance to default
 (DD) model, which is based on Merton's (1974) bond pricing model. We
 compare the model to a "naïve" alternative, which uses the functional form
 suggested by the Merton model but does not solve the model for an implied
 probability of default. We find that the naïve predictor performs slightly
 better in hazard models and in out-of-sample forecasts than both the
 Merton DD model and a reduced-form model that uses the same inputs.
 Several other forecasting variables are also important predictors, and
 fitted values from an expanded hazard model outperform Merton DD default
 probabilities out of sample. Implied default probabilities from credit
 default swaps and corporate bond yield spreads are only weakly correlated
 with Merton DD probabilities after adjusting for agency ratings and bond
 characteristics. We conclude that while the Merton DD model does not
 produce a sufficient statistic for the probability of default, its
 functional form is useful for forecasting defaults.  The Author 2008. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org, Oxford University Press.

Title: The Private Equity Advantage: Leveraged Buyout Firms and Relationship Banking 
Abstract:
 This article examines the impact of leveraged buyout firms' bank
 relationships on the terms of their syndicated loans. We examine a sample
 of 1,590 loans financing private equity sponsored leveraged buyouts
 between 1993 and 2005, and find that private equity firms' bank
 relationships are an important factor in cross-sectional variation in the
 loan interest rate and covenant structure. Our results indicate that bank
 relationships formed through repeated interactions reduce inefficiencies
 from information asymmetry and allow leveraged buyouts sponsored by
 private equity firms to occur on favorable loan terms. A
 one-standard-deviation increase in bank relationship strength is
 associated with an 8-basis-point (3%) decrease in the spread and a
 0.21-basis-point (4%) increase in the maximum debt to EBITDA covenant. We
 also find evidence that banks price loans to cross-sell other fee
 business. A one-standard-deviation increase in both bank relationship
 strength and cross-selling potential translates into as much as a
 4-percentage-point increase in equity return to the leveraged buyout firm.  The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: Size and Focus of a Venture Capitalist's Portfolio 
Abstract:
 We take a portfolio approach to analyze the investment strategy of a
 venture capitalist (VC) and show that portfolio size and scope affect both
 the entrepreneurs' and the VC's incentives to exert effort. A small
 portfolio improves entrepreneurial incentives because it allows the VC to
 concentrate the limited human capital on a smaller number of startups,
 adding more value. A large and focused portfolio is beneficial because it
 allows the VC to reallocate the limited resources and human capital in the
 case of startup failure and allows the VC to extract greater rents from
 the entrepreneurs. We show that the VC finds it optimal to limit portfolio
 size when startups have higher payoff potential--that is, when providing
 strong entrepreneurial incentives is most valuable. The VC expands
 portfolio size only when startup fundamentals are more moderate and when
 he can form a sufficiently focused portfolio. Finally, we show that the VC
 may find it optimal to engage in portfolio management by divesting some of
 the startups early since this strategy allows him to extract a greater
 surplus.  The Author 2009. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title:   Option Pricing with Differential Interest Rates.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 475-500
Issue: 2
Volume: 8
Year: 1995
Abstract:
  The classic option pricing model is generalized to a more realistic,
 imperfect, dynamically incomplete capital market with different interest
 rates for borrowing and for lending and a return differential between long
 and short positions in stock. It is found that, in the absence of
 arbitrage opportunities, the equilibrium price of any contingent claim
 must lie within an arbitrage-band. The boundaries of an arbitrage-band are
 computed as solutions to a quasi-linear partial differential equation,
 and, in generals each end-point of such a band depends on both interest
 rates for borrowing and for lending. This, in turn, implies that the
 vector of concurrent equilibrium prices of different contingent claims -
 even claims that are written on different underlying assets - must lie
 within a computable arbitrage-oval in the price space.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Year: 1998
Abstract:
  While American calls on non-dividend-paying stocks may be valued as
 European, there is no completely explicit exact solution for the values of
 American puts. We use a technique called randomization to value American
 puts and calls on dividend-paying stocks. This technique yields a new
 semi-explicit approximation for American option values in the
 Black-Scholes model. Numerical results indicate that the approximation is
 both accurate and computationally efficient.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Government Control of Privatized Firms 
Abstract:
 We study the change in government control of privatized firms in OECD
 (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) countries. At the
 end of 2000, after the largest privatization wave in history, governments
 retained control of 62.4% of privatized firms. In civil law countries,
 governments tend to retain large ownership positions, whereas in common
 law countries they typically use golden shares. When we combine these two
 mechanisms, we find no association between a country's legal tradition and
 the extent of government control. Rather, we document more prevalent
 government influence over privatized firms in countries with proportional
 electoral rules and with a centralized system of political authority.  The Author 2008. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title: International Capital Markets and Foreign Exchange Risk 
Abstract:
  Relations between foreign exchange risk premia, exchange rate volatility,
 and the volatilities of the pricing kernels for the underlying currencies,
 are derived under the assumption of integrated capital markets. As
 predicted, the volatility of exchange rates is significantly associated
 with the estimated volatility of the relevant pricing kernels, and foreign
 exchange risk premia are significantly related to both the estimated
 volatility of the pricing kernels and the volatility of exchange rates.
 The estimated foreign exchange risk premia mostly satisfy Fama's (1984)
 necessary conditions for explaining the forward premium puzzle, but the
 puzzle remains in several cases even after taking account of the pricing
 kernel volatilities.   Copyright 2006, Oxford University Press.

Title: The Influence of the Home Owners' Loan Corporation on Housing Markets During the 1930s 
Abstract:
 Problems with mortgage financing are widely considered to be a major cause
 of the recent financial meltdown. Several modern programs have been
 designed to mimic the Home Owners' Loan Corporation (HOLC) of the 1930s.
 We analyze the impact of the HOLC on the nonfarm rental and owned home
 markets for over 2,800 counties in the United States in the 1930s. In
 sparsely populated counties, where financial markets were not as well
 developed as in larger cities, the HOLC stimulated demand for owned
 housing more than it influenced supply. In rental markets the HOLC appears
 to have contributed to an increase in supply.  The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: Pension Reform, Ownership Structure, and Corporate Governance: Evidence from a Natural Experiment 
Abstract:
 Sweden offers a unique natural experiment to analyze the effects of
 institutionalized saving on the ownership structure, corporate governance,
 and firm performance. The Swedish pension reform increased the stock
 market participation of pension funds, causing a significant reshuffling
 in the ownership of pension funds. We show that the effects of
 institutional investment on firm performance depend on the industry
 structure of pension funds. Firm valuation improves if public pension
 funds and large independent private pension funds increase their
 shareholdings. Additionally, controlling shareholders appear reluctant to
 relinquish control and the control premium increases if public pension
 funds acquire shares.  The Author 2008. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title:   Stock Price Clustering and Discreteness.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 389-415
Issue: 3
Volume: 4
Year: 1991
Abstract:
  Stock prices cluster on round fractions. Clustering increases with price
 level and volatility, and decreases with capitalization and transaction
 frequency. Clustering is pervasive. Price clustering will occur if traders
 use discrete price sets to simplify their negotiations. Exchange
 regulations require that most stocks be traded on eighths. Clustering on
 larger fractions will occur if traders choose to use discrete price sets
 based on quarters, halves, or whole numbers. An econometric model of
 clustering is derived and estimated. Projections from the results suggest
 that traders would frequently use odd sixteenths when trading low-price
 stocks, if exchange regulations permitted trading on sixteenths.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title:   Mean Reversion and Consumption Smoothing.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies

Volume: 3
Year: 1990
Abstract:
  Most models of the evolution of wealth and consumption assume that wealth
 volatility and risk premium are constant. But in fact, volatility
 declines, and risk premium seems to decline, as wealth rises. A model that
 allows mean reversion in the sense that the risk premium declines as
 wealth rises can help explain both the "consumption smoothing puzzle" and
 the "equity premium puzzle." In an example of such a model that gives us
 an analytic solution, direct and derived risk aversion are both constant,
 but differ.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: A Simulation Approach to Dynamic Portfolio Choice with an Application to Learning About Return Predictability 
Abstract:
  We present a simulation-based method for solving discrete-time portfolio
 choice problems involving non-standard preferences, a large number of
 assets with arbitrary return distribution, and, most importantly, a large
 number of state variables with potentially path-dependent or
 non-stationary dynamics. The method is flexible enough to accommodate
 intermediate consumption, portfolio constraints, parameter and model
 uncertainty, and learning. We first establish the properties of the method
 for the portfolio choice between a stock index and cash when the stock
 returns are either iid or predictable by the dividend yield. We then
 explore the problem of an investor who takes into account the
 predictability of returns but is uncertain about the parameters of the
 data generating process. The investor chooses the portfolio anticipating
 that future data realizations will contain useful information to learn
 about the true parameter values.   Copyright 2005, Oxford University Press.

Volume: 4
Year: 1991
Abstract:
  In the context of an equilibrium asset-pricing model, the dynamics of the
 instantaneous real interest rate and the instantaneous rate of expected
 inflation are estimated. Unlike previous models, we allow real interest
 rates and inflation to be mutually dependent processes. The model is
 estimated as a state-space system that includes observations on various
 maturity Treasury bills and NBER-ASA survey forecasts of inflation. Over
 the period 1968-88, we find evidence that instantaneous real interest
 rates and expected inflation are significantly negatively correlated. Real
 interest rates also display greater volatility and weaker mean reversion
 than expected inflation.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title:   Measurement of Market Integration and Arbitrage.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 287-325
Issue: 2
Volume: 8
Year: 1995
Abstract:
  We develop a measurement theory of market integration, based on two
 notions of "integrated markets. " First, two markets cannot be perfectly
 integrated in any sense if one can construct two portfolios, one from each
 market, that have identical payoffs but different prices. In that case,
 the law of one price is violated across the markets. Second, they cannot
 be integrated in a stronger sense if there are cross-market arbitrage
 opportunities. Two measures of market integration are developed,
 respectively reflecting these notions. The smaller the measures, the more
 closely integrated (in the respective senses) the markets. Among other
 things, they are interpreted as measuring pricing discrepancy between
 markets.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Liquidity-Based Competition for Order Flow 
Abstract:
  We present a microstructure model of competition for order flow between
 exchanges based on liquidity provision. We find that neither a pure limit
 order market (PLM) nor a hybrid specialist-limit order market (HM)
 structure is competition-proof. A PLM can always be supported in
 equilibrium as the dominant market (i.e., where the hybrid limit book is
 empty), but an HM can also be supported, for some market
 parameterizations, as the dominant market. We also show the possible
 coexistence of competing markets. Order preferencing--that is, decisions
 about where orders are routed when investors are indifferent--is a key
 determinant of market viability. Welfare comparisons show that competition
 between exchanges can increase as well as reduce the cost of liquidity.   Copyright 2003, Oxford University Press.

Title: Equilibrium Underdiversification and the Preference for Skewness 
Abstract:
 We develop a one-period model of investor asset holdings where investors
 have heterogeneous preference for skewness. Introducing heterogeneous
 preference for skewness allows the model's investors, in equilibrium, to
 underdiversify. We find support for our model's three key implications
 using a dataset of 60,000 individual investor accounts. First, we document
 that the portfolio returns of underdiversified investors are substantially
 more positively skewed than those of diversified investors. Second, we
 show that the apparent mean-variance inefficiency of underdiversified
 investors can be largely explained by the fact that investors sacrifice
 mean-variance efficiency for higher skewness exposure. Furthermore, we
 show that idiosyncratic skewness, and not just coskewness, can impact
 equilibrium prices. Third, the underdiversification of investors does not
 appear to be coincidentally related to skewness. Stocks most often
 selected by underdiversified investors have substantially higher average
 skewness--especially idiosyncratic skewness--than stocks most
 often selected by diversified investors.  , Oxford University Press.

Title: Estimation Risk, Information, and the Conditional CAPM: Theory and Evidence 
Abstract:
 We theoretically and empirically investigate the role of information on
 the cross section of stock returns and firms' cost of capital when
 investors face estimation risk and learn from noisy signals of uncertain
 quality. The resultant equilibrium is an information-dependent conditional
 CAPM. We find strong empirical support for the model. Innovations in
 market volatility, oil prices, exchange rates, and dispersion of analysts'
 forecasts not only help explain the cross section of stock returns, but
 their influence depends on the stock's systematic estimation risk.
 Moreover, dividend and share repurchase initiations have significant
 downward announcement effects on estimated betas and their standard
 errors.  The Author 2008. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org, Oxford University Press.

Title: Optimal Contracts Under Adverse Selection and Moral Hazard: A Continuous-Time Approach 
Abstract:
  This article presents a continuous-time agency model in the presence of
 adverse selection and moral hazard with a risk-averse agent and a
 risk-neutral principal. Under the model setup, we show that the optimal
 controls are constant over time, and thus the optimal menu consists of
 contracts that are linear in the final outcome. We also show that when a
 moral hazard problem adds to an adverse selection problem, the
 monotonicity condition well known in the pure adverse selection literature
 needs to be modified to ensure the incentive compatibility for information
 revelation. The model is applied to a few managerial compensation problems
 involving managerial project selection and capital budgeting decisions. We
 argue that in the third-best world, the relationship between the
 volatility of the outcome and the sensitivity of the contract depends on
 interactions between the managerial cost and the firm's production
 functions. Contrary to conventional wisdom, sometimes the higher the
 volatility, the higher the sensitivity of the contract. The firm receiving
 good news sometimes chooses safer projects or invests less than it does
 with bad news. We also examine the effects of the observability of the
 volatility on corporate investment decisions.   Copyright 2005, Oxford University Press.

Title:   Pricing an American Option by Approximating Its Early Exercise Boundary as a Multipiece Exponential Function.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 627-46
Issue: 3
Volume: 11
Year: 1998
Abstract:
  This article proposes to price an American option by approximating its
 early exercise boundary as a multipiece exponential function. Closed form
 formulas are obtained in terms of the bases and exponents of the
 multipiece exponential function. It is demonstrated that a three-point
 extrapolation scheme has the accuracy of an 800-time-step binomial tree,
 but is about 130 times faster. An intuitive argument is given to indicate
 why this seemingly crude approximation works so well. Our method is very
 simple and easy to implement. Comparisons with other leading competing
 methods are also included.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Dynamic Compensation Contracts with Private Savings 
Abstract:
 This article studies a dynamic agency problem in which a risk-averse agent
 can save privately. In the optimal contract, (i) cash compensations
 exhibit downward rigidity to failures; (ii) permanent pay raises occur
 when the agent's historical performance is sufficiently good; (iii) and
 when the agent is dismissed due to poor performance, he walks away with
 severance pay to support his post-firing consumption at the current
 compensation level. Thus, the theory can simultaneously explain the
 popularity of options-like compensation contracts and the increasing
 incidence of forced turnovers with sizeable severance pay.  The Author 2012. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: Financial Innovation and Information: The Role of Derivatives When a Market for Information Exists 
Abstract:
  We study the effects of financial innovation in a model of endogenous
 information acquisition. We determine the conditions under which the
 introduction of a derivative written on an existing stock increases or
 decreases the incentive to purchase information. We show that financial
 innovation produces some effects which hold across informational
 structures and others which differ. The former coincide with the few
 empirical results that are robust in the literature (effects on prices,
 risk premia, and volatility), while the latter coincide with the ones that
 differ experiment by experiment (effects on volume, correlation between
 volume and volatility, and market informational efficiency).   Copyright 2002, Oxford University Press.

Volume: 11
Year: 1998
Abstract:
  In this article, we consider the relative merits of net versus gross
 settlement of interbank payments. Net settlement economizes on the costs
 of holding non-interest-bearing reserves, but increases moral hazard
 problems. The 'put option' value of default under net settlement can also
 distort banks' investment incentives. Absent these distortions, net
 settlement dominates gross, although the optimal net settlement scheme may
 involve a positive probability of default.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Identifying Expectation Errors in Value/Glamour Strategies: A Fundamental Analysis Approach 
Abstract:
 It is well established that value stocks outperform glamour stocks, yet
 considerable debate exists about whether the return differential reflects
 compensation for risk or mispricing. Under mispricing explanations, prices
 of glamour (value) firms reflect systematically optimistic (pessimistic)
 expectations; thus, the value/glamour effect should be concentrated
 (absent) among firms with (without) ex ante identifiable expectation
 errors. Classifying firms based upon whether expectations implied by
 current pricing multiples are congruent with the strength of their
 fundamentals, we document that value/glamour returns and ex post revisions
 to market expectations are predictably concentrated (absent) among firms
 with ex ante biased (unbiased) market expectations.  The Author 2012. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Volume: 5
Year: 1992
Abstract:
  Weekly data for foreign currency futures prices are examined for evidence
 of risk premiums. Covariance risks are measured with respect to the excess
 returns from benchmark portfolios for consumption and wealth. When the
 parameters representing the prices of the covariance risks are held
 constant, no risk premiums are detected. However, when these prices are
 allowed to vary with the conditional expected returns and variances of the
 benchmark portfolios, possibly reflecting changing investment
 opportunities, strong evidence of risk premiums is obtained.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Credit Ratings as Coordination Mechanisms 
Abstract:
  In this article, we provide a novel rationale for credit ratings. The
 rationale that we propose is that credit ratings serve as a coordinating
 mechanism in situations where multiple equilibria can obtain. We show that
 credit ratings provide a "focal point" for firms and their investors, and
 explore the vital, but previously overlooked implicit contractual
 relationship between a credit rating agency (CRA) and a firm through its
 credit watch procedures. Credit ratings can help fix the desired
 equilibrium and as such play an economically meaningful role. Our model
 provides several empirical predictions and insights regarding the expected
 price impact of rating changes.   Copyright 2006, Oxford University Press.

Title: The Value of Investor Protection: Firm Evidence from Cross-Border Mergers 
Abstract:
 International law prescribes that in a cross-border acquisition of 100% of
 the target shares, the target firm becomes a national of the country of
 the acquiror, and consequently subject to its corporate governance system.
 Therefore, cross-border mergers provide a natural experiment to analyze
 the effects of changes in corporate governance on firm value. We construct
 measures of the change in investor protection in a sample of 506
 acquisitions from 39 countries. We find that the better the shareholder
 protection and accounting standards in the acquiror's country, the higher
 the merger premium in cross-border mergers relative to matching domestic
 acquisitions.  2008 London Mathematical Society, Oxford University Press.

Title: How Smart Are the Smart Guys? A Unique View from Hedge Fund Stock Holdings 
Abstract:
 Compared to mutual funds, hedge funds prefer smaller, opaque value
 securities, and have higher turnover and more active share bets.
 Decomposing returns into three components, we find that hedge funds are
 better than mutual funds at stock picking by only 1.32% per year on a
 value-weighted basis, and this result is insignificant on an
 equal-weighted basis or with price-to-sales benchmarks. Hedge funds
 exhibit no ability to time sectors or pick better stock styles.
 Surprisingly, we find only weak evidence of differential ability between
 hedge funds. Overall, our study raises serious questions about the
 perceived superior skill of hedge fund managers.  The Author 2009. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org, Oxford University Press.

Title: Determinants of Trader Profits in Commodity Futures Markets 
Abstract:
 Using proprietary energy futures position data, we provide evidence that
 mean hedger profits are negative whereas speculator (especially hedge
 fund) profits are positive, that traders (whether speculators or hedgers)
 who hold net positions opposite in sign to likely hedgers in aggregate
 have higher profits than traders whose net positions align with likely
 hedgers, and that profits on long positions vary inversely with
 inventories and directly with price volatility. These findings are
 consistent with the risk premium, hedging pressure, and modern theory of
 storage hypotheses, respectively. Further, our findings suggest that
 commodity futures momentum may be due largely to hedging pressure.  The Author 2013. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: Does Systemic Risk in the Financial Sector Predict Future Economic Downturns? 
Abstract:
 We derive a measure of aggregate systemic risk, designated CATFIN, that
 complements bank-specific systemic risk measures by forecasting
 macroeconomic downturns six months into the future using out-of-sample
 tests conducted with U.S., European, and Asian bank data. Consistent with
 bank "specialness," the CATFIN of both large and small banks forecasts
 macroeconomic declines, whereas a similarly defined measure for both
 nonfinancial firms and simulated "fake banks" has no marginal predictive
 ability. High levels of systemic risk in the banking sector impact the
 macroeconomy through aggregate lending activity. A conditional asset
 pricing model shows that CATFIN is priced for financial and nonfinancial
 firms.  The Author 2012. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: Benchmarking Money Manager Performance: Issues and Evidence 
Abstract:
 Academic and practitioner research evaluates portfolio performance using
 size and value/growth attributes or factors. We assess the merits of
 popular evaluation procedures based on matched-characteristic benchmark
 portfolios or time-series return regressions by applying them to a sample
 of active money managers and passive indexes. Estimated abnormal returns
 display large variation across approaches. The benchmarks typically used
 in academic research--attribute-matched portfolios from independent sorts,
 the three-factor time-series model, and cross-sectional regressions of
 returns on stock characteristics--track returns poorly. Some simple
 alterations improve the performance of these methods.  The Author 2009. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title: Lending Relationships and Loan Contract Terms 
Abstract:
 We find that repeated borrowing from the same lender translates into a
 10--17 bps lowering of loan spreads and that relationships are especially
 valuable when borrower transparency is low. These results hold using
 multiple approaches (propensity score matching, instrumental variables,
 and treatment effects model) that control for the endogeneity of
 relationships. We also provide a demarcation line between relationship and
 transactional lending. Spreads charged for relationship loans and
 nonrelationship loans are statistically identical if the borrower is in
 the largest 30% by asset size; has public rated debt; or is part of the
 S&P 500 index. Past relationships reduce collateral requirements and are
 also associated with obtaining larger loans. Our results imply that, even
 for firms that have multiple sources of outside financing, borrowing from
 a prior lender obtains better loan terms.  The Author 2009. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org, Oxford University Press.

Title: Managing Bank Liquidity Risk: How Deposit-Loan Synergies Vary with Market Conditions 
Abstract:
 Liquidity risk in banking has been attributed to transactions deposits and
 their potential to spark runs or panics. We show instead that transactions
 deposits help banks hedge liquidity risk from unused loan commitments.
 Bank stock-return volatility increases with unused commitments, but only
 for banks with low levels of transactions deposits. This deposit-lending
 hedge becomes more powerful during periods of tight liquidity, when
 nervous investors move funds into their banks. Our results reverse the
 standard notion of liquidity risk at banks, where runs from depositors had
 been seen as the cause of trouble.  The Author 2007. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org, Oxford University Press.

Title:   Home Bias in Equity Portfolios, Inflation Hedging, and International Capital Market Equilibrium.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 45-60
Issue: 1
Volume: 7
Year: 1994
Abstract:
  We test whether the home bias in equity portfolios is caused by investors
 trying to hedge inflation risk. The empirical evidence is consistent with
 this motive only if investors have very high levels of risk tolerance and
 equity returns are negatively correlated with domestic inflation. We then
 develop a model of international portfolio choice and equity market
 equilibrium that integrates inflation risk and deadweight costs. Using
 this model we estimate the levels of costs required to generate the
 observed home bias in portfolios consistent with different levels of risk
 aversion. For a level of risk aversion consistent with standard estimates
 of the domestic equity market risk premium, these costs are about a few
 percent per annum, greater than observable costs such as withholding
 taxes. Thus, the home bias cannot be explained by either inflation hedging
 or direct observable costs of international investment unless investors
 have very low levels of risk aversion.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Abstract:
  This article examines how to properly specify and test for factors that
 affect exchange-rate exposure. Starting from theoretical underpinnings and
 a sample of U.S. manufacturing industries between 1979 and 1995, we find
 that 4 of 18 industry groups are significantly exposed to exchange-rate
 movements through the effect of industry competitive structure, export
 share, and imported input share. On average, a 1% appreciation of the
 dollar decreases the return of the average industry by 0.13%. Consistent
 with our model's predictions, as an industry's markups fall (rise), its
 exchange-rate exposure increases (decreases).	 Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Anticipated and Repeated Shocks in Liquid Markets 
Abstract:
 We show that Treasury security prices in the secondary market decrease
 significantly in the few days before Treasury auctions and recover shortly
 thereafter, even though the time and amount of each auction are announced
 in advance. These results are linked to dealers' limited risk-bearing
 capacity and end-investors' imperfect capital mobility, highlighting the
 important role of frictions even in very liquid financial markets. Our
 results imply a hidden issuance cost to the U.S. Department of the
 Treasury, estimated to be 9 to 18 bps of the auction size, or over half a
 billion dollars for the issuance size in 2007.  The Author 2013. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: Can Growth Options Explain the Trend in Idiosyncratic Risk? 
Abstract:
 While recent studies document increasing idiosyncratic volatility over the
 past four decades, an explanation for this trend remains elusive. We
 establish a theoretical link between growth options available to managers
 and the idiosyncratic risk of equity. Empirically both the level and
 variance of corporate growth options are significantly related to
 idiosyncratic volatility. Accounting for growth options eliminates or
 reverses the trend in aggregate firm-specific risk. These results are
 robust for different measures of idiosyncratic volatility, different
 growth option proxies, across exchanges, and through time. Finally, our
 results suggest that growth options explain the trend in idiosyncratic
 volatility beyond alternative explanations.  The Author 2007. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title: Optimal Equity Stakes and Corporate Control 
Abstract:
 I show that firms may optimally sell blocks of their own equity to other
 firms in anticipation of future corporate control activity. In the model,
 a target and one potential acquirer, who may also be an alliance partner,
 can negotiate before synergy values are learned. I find that equity
 implements an optimal mechanism, allowing the partners to extract surplus
 from outside bidders who may arrive later. The stake is limited by the
 outsiders' willingness to investigate. The results imply that corporate
 control may motivate an equity sale even when no takeover activity is
 apparent at the time or occurs ex post.  , Oxford University Press.

Title:   Price Experimentation and Security Market Structure.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 375-404
Issue: 2
Volume: 6
Year: 1993
Abstract:
  We examine the role of market makers in facilitating price discovery. We
 show that a specialist may experiment with prices to induce more
 informative order flow, thereby expediting price discovery. Market makers
 in a multiple-dealer system, unlike a specialist system, do not have the
 incentives to perform such costly experiments because of free-rider
 problems. Consequently, the specialist system may provide open markets
 where bid-ask spreads. We analyze the effect of experimentation on the
 bid-ask spread and provide an exploratory analysis of intraday specialist
 data that is consistent with our price experimentation hypothesis.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: The Sale of Multiple Assets with Private Information 
Abstract:
 By generalizing the Leland and Pyle (1977) model to the case of multiple
 correlated assets, this paper studies the signaling and hedging behavior
 of an intermediary who sells multiple assets in financial markets. Based
 on information asymmetry, this paper demonstrates the intrinsic
 interdependence of risk management and asset selling for intermediaries,
 and obtains several testable empirical implications. For instance, an
 intermediary with a more diversified underlying portfolio will face
 greater liquidity (a smaller price impact) when selling assets to the
 market. Several applications are discussed, including bank loan sales and
 selling mechanisms.  The Author 2009. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title: Maximum Likelihood Estimation of Latent Affine Processes 
Abstract:
  This article develops a direct filtration-based maximum likelihood
 methodology for estimating the parameters and realizations of latent
 affine processes. Filtration is conducted in the transform space of
 characteristic functions, using a version of Bayes' rule for recursively
 updating the joint characteristic function of latent variables and the
 data conditional upon past data. An application to daily stock market
 returns over 1953--1996 reveals substantial divergences from estimates
 based on the Efficient Methods of Moments (EMM) methodology; in
 particular, more substantial and time-varying jump risk. The implications
 for pricing stock index options are examined.   Copyright 2006, Oxford University Press.

Title: Is Disclosure an Effective Cleansing Mechanism? The Dynamics of Compensation Peer Benchmarking 
Abstract:
 Firms routinely justify CEO compensation by benchmarking against companies
 with highly paid CEOs. We examine whether the 2006 regulatory requirement
 of disclosing compensation peers mitigated firms' opportunistic peer
 selection activities. We find that strategic peer benchmarking did not
 disappear after enhanced disclosure. In fact, it intensified at firms with
 low institutional ownership, low director ownership, low CEO ownership,
 busy boards, large boards, and non-intensive monitoring boards, and at
 firms with shareholders complaining about compensation practices. The
 effect is also stronger at firms with new CEOs. These findings call into
 question whether disclosure regulation can remedy potential problems in
 compensation practices.  The Author 2012. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: Is the Potential for International Diversification Disappearing? A Dynamic Copula Approach 
Abstract:
 International equity markets are characterized by nonlinear dependence and
 asymmetries. We propose a new dynamic asymmetric copula model to capture
 long-run and short-run dependence, multivariate nonnormality, and
 asymmetries in large cross-sections. We find that correlations have
 increased markedly in both developed markets (DMs) and emerging markets
 (EMs), but they are much lower in EMs than in DMs. Tail dependence has
 also increased, but its level is still relatively low in EMs. We propose
 new measures of dynamic diversification benefits that take into account
 higher-order moments and nonlinear dependence. The benefits from
 international diversification have reduced over time, drastically so for
 DMs. EMs still offer significant diversification benefits, especially
 during large market downturns.  The Author 2012. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: Performance of Institutional Trading Desks: An Analysis of Persistence in Trading Costs 
Abstract:
 Using a proprietary dataset of institutional investors' equity
 transactions, we document that institutional trading desks can sustain
 relative performance over adjacent periods. We find that trading-desk
 skill is positively correlated with the performance of the institution's
 traded portfolio, suggesting that institutions that invest resources in
 developing execution abilities also invest in generating superior
 investment ideas. Although some brokers can deliver better executions
 consistently over time, our analysis suggests that trading-desk skill is
 not limited to a selection of better brokers. We conclude that the trade
 implementation process is economically important and can contribute to
 relative portfolio performance.  The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: Is the Market for Mortgage-Backed Securities a Market for Lemons? 
Abstract:
 This paper models and provides empirical evidence for the quality of
 assets that are securitized through bankruptcy remote special purpose
 vehicles (SPVs). The model predicts that assets sold to SPVs will be of
 lower quality ("lemons") compared to assets that are not sold to SPVs. We
 find strong empirical support for this prediction using a comprehensive
 data set of sales of mortgage-backed securities (Freddie Mac Participation
 Certificates, or PCs) to SPVs over the period 1991 through 2002. Valuation
 estimates based on a structural two-factor model indicate that PCs sold to
 SPVs are on average valued $0.39 lower per $100 of face value relative to
 PCs not so sold. For the four largest coupon groups in our full sample of
 Freddie Mac PCs, we find a "lemons spread" of 4--6 basis points in terms
 of yield-to-maturity, and this spread accounts for 13--45% of the overall
 prepayment spread of these securities.  The Author 2008. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org, Oxford University Press.

Title: Judicial Discretion in Corporate Bankruptcy 
Abstract:
 We study a demand-and-supply model of judicial discretion in corporate
 bankruptcy. On the supply side, we assume that bankruptcy courts may be
 biased for debtors or creditors, and subject to career concerns. On the
 demand side, we assume that debtors (and creditors) can engage in forum
 shopping at some cost. A key finding is that stronger creditor protection
 in reorganization improves judicial incentives to resolve financial
 distress efficiently, preventing a "race to the bottom" toward inefficient
 uses of judicial discretion. The comparative statics of our model shed
 light on a lot of evidence on U.S. bankruptcy and yield novel predictions
 on how bankruptcy codes should affect firm-level outcomes.  The Author 2010. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title: Default Risk, Shareholder Advantage, and Stock Returns 
Abstract:
 This paper examines the relationship between default probability and stock
 returns. Using the Expected Default Frequency (EDF) of Moody's KMV, we
 document that higher default probabilities are not associated with higher
 expected stock returns. Within a model of bargaining between equity
 holders and debt holders in default, we show that the relationship between
 default probability and equity return is (i) upward sloping for firms
 where shareholders can extract little benefit from renegotiation (low
 "shareholder advantage") and (ii) humped and downward sloping for firms
 with high shareholder advantage. This dichotomy implies that distressed
 firms with stronger shareholder advantage should exhibit lower expected
 returns in the cross section. Our empirical evidence, based on several
 proxies for shareholder advantage, is consistent with the model's
 predictions.  The Author 2007. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title:   The Effect of Tax Heterogeneity on Prices and Volume around the Ex-dividend Day: Evidence from the Milan Stock Exchange.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 369-99
Issue: 2
Volume: 8
Year: 1995
Abstract:
  To investigate the effect of taxation on stock price and trading volume
 around the ex-dividend day, we use the Italian stock market, where
 dividends on two classes of stock are taxed differently. We find that the
 weighted average of investors' tax rates is reflected in the ex-day prices
 and the variance of the relative tax rate across investors is reflected in
 the volume of trades. We also show that higher transaction costs result in
 higher ex-dividend day excess returns and lower abnormal volume. This
 finding is consistent with "profit elimination" activity by institutions
 and corporations.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Do Shareholder Rights Affect the Cost of Bank Loans? 
Abstract:
 Using a large sample of bank loans issued to U.S. firms between 1990 and
 2004, we find that lower takeover defenses (as proxied by the lower
 G-index of Gompers, Ishii, and Metrick 2003) significantly increase the
 cost of loans for a firm. Firms with lowest takeover defense (democracy)
 pay a 25% higher spread on their bank loans as compared with firms with
 the highest takeover defense (dictatorship), after controlling for various
 firm and loan characteristics. Further investigations indicate that banks
 charge a higher loan spread to firms with higher takeover vulnerability
 mainly because of their concern about a substantial increase in financial
 risk after the takeover. Our results have important implications for
 understanding the link between a firm's governance structure and its cost
 of capital. Our study suggests that firms that rely too much on corporate
 control market as a governance device are punished by costlier bank loans.  The Author 2008. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org, Oxford University Press.

Title: An Empirical Analysis of Personal Bankruptcy and Delinquency 
Abstract:
  This article uses a new dataset of credit card accounts to analyze credit
 card delinquency, personal bankruptcy, and the stability of credit risk
 models. We estimate duration models for default and assess the relative
 importance of different variables in predicting default. We investigate
 how the propensity to default has changed over time, disentangling the two
 leading explanations for the recent increase in default rates--a
 deterioration in the risk composition of borrowers versus an increase in
 borrowers' willingness to default due to declines in default costs. Even
 after controlling for risk composition and economic fundamentals, the
 propensity to default significantly increased between 1995 and 1997.
 Standard default models missed an important time-varying default factor,
 consistent with a decline in default costs.   Copyright 2002, Oxford University Press.

Title: Local Overweighting and Underperformance: Evidence from Limited Partner Private Equity Investments 
Abstract:
 Institutional investors exhibit substantial home-state bias in private
 equity. This effect is particularly pronounced for public pension funds,
 where overweighting amounts to 9.8% of aggregate private-equity
 investments and 16.5% for the average limited partner. Public pension
 funds' in-state investments achieve performance that is lower by two to
 four percentage points than both their own similar out-of-state
 investments and similar investments in their state by out-of-state
 investors. Overweighting in home-state investments by public pension funds
 is greater in venture capital and real estate than in buyout funds. States
 with political climates characterized by more self-dealing invest a larger
 share of their portfolio in local investments, although a given local
 investment performs only as poorly in these states as in other states.
 Relative to the performance of the rest of the private equity universe,
 overweighting and underperformance in local investments reduce public
 pension fund resources by $1.2 billion per year.  The Author 2012. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: The Market Price of Aggregate Risk and the Wealth Distribution 
Abstract:
 We introduce limited liability in a model with a continuum of ex ante
 identical agents who face aggregate and idiosyncratic income risk. These
 agents can trade a complete menu of contingent claims, but they cannot
 commit to honor their promises, and their shares in a Lucas tree serve as
 collateral to back up their state-contingent promises. The
 limited-liability option gives rise to a second risk factor, in addition
 to aggregate consumption growth risk. This liquidity risk is created by
 binding solvency constraints, and it is measured by the growth rate of one
 moment of the wealth distribution. The economy is said to experience a
 negative liquidity shock when this growth rate is high and a large
 fraction of agents faces severely binding solvency constraints. The
 adjustment to the Breeden-Lucas stochastic discount factor induces
 substantial time variation in equity risk-premims that is consistent with
 the data at business cycle frequencies.  The Author 2009. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org, Oxford University Press.

Title: The Academic Analysis of the 2008 Financial Crisis: Round 1 
Abstract:
 Academics responded to the challenges posed by the 2008 financial crisis
 with a flurry of studies. This collection of articles is just the academic
 community's first look into it. The articles begin with an examination at
 the last national housing price crash: the great depression of the 1930s.
 This is followed by articles looking at the current mortgage market and
 how it behaved. Did modern innovations reflect or add to the downturn? The
 next set of papers examines how non-financial firms were impacted by the
 crash. To what degree did credit worthy firms nevertheless find themselves
 without access to capital? The papers then end with a look into how the
 banking sector itself fared throughout this period.  The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 205-36
Issue: 1
Volume: 10
Year: 1997
Abstract:
  If banks have an informational monopoly about their clients, borrowers
 may curtail their effort level for fear of being exploited via high
 interest rates in the future. Banks can correct this incentive problem by
 committing to share private information with other lenders. The fiercer
 competition triggered by information sharing lowers future interest rates
 and future profits of banks. But, provided banks retain an initial
 informational advantage, their current profits are raised by the
 borrowers' higher effort. This trade-off determines the banks' willingness
 to share information. Their decision affects credit market competition,
 interest rates, volume of lending, and social welfare.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Financial Constraints, R&D Investment, and Stock Returns 
Abstract:
 Through the interaction between financial constraints and R&D, I study two
 asset-pricing puzzles: mixed evidence on the financial constraints--return
 relation and the positive R&D-return relation. Unlike capital investment,
 R&D is more inflexible. A financially constrained R&D-intensive firm is
 more likely to suspend/discontinue R&D projects. Therefore, R&D-intensive
 firms' risk increases with their financial constraints. Conversely,
 constrained firms' risk increases with their R&D intensity. I find a
 robust empirical relation between financial constraints and stock returns,
 primarily among R&D-intensive firms. Moreover, R&D predicts returns only
 among financially constrained firms. This evidence suggests that financial
 constraints potentially drive the positive R&D-return relation.  The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: Analyst Behavior Following IPOs: The 'Bubble Period' Evidence 
Abstract:
 We examine over 7400 analyst recommendations made in the year after going
 public for IPOs from 1999 to 2000. Initiations of coverage at the end of
 the quiet period come almost exclusively from affiliated analysts, whereas
 initiations afterward are predominantly from unaffiliated analysts.
 Contrary to previous findings, we find no evidence that the market
 discounts recommendations from affiliated analysts once we control for
 recommendation characteristics and timing. Moreover, analyst coverage in
 the first year is not affected by underpricing, and after the flurry of
 initiations at the end of the quiet period, the number of analysts
 covering a firm during the following 11 months is unrelated to the number
 of managing underwriters. (JEL G12, G14, G24)  The Author 2006. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org, Oxford University Press.

  We analyze the role of knowhow acquisition in the formation and duration
 of joint ventures. Two parties become partners in a joint venture to
 benefit from each other's knowhow. Joint operations provide each party
 with the opportunity to acquire part of its partner's knowhow. A party's
 increased knowhow provides the impetus for the dissolution of the joint
 venture. We characterize the conditions under which dissolution takes
 place, identify the party that buys out its partner, determine the time to
 dissolution, establish its comparative statics, and examine the
 implications of knowledge acquisition for the desirability of joint
 venture formation. (JEL code: G34)   Copyright 2007, Oxford University Press.

Title: Booms, Busts, and Fraud 
Abstract:
 Firms sometimes commit fraud by altering publicly reported information to
 be more favorable, and investors can monitor firms to obtain more accurate
 information. We study equilibrium fraud and monitoring decisions. Fraud is
 most likely to occur in relatively good times, and the link between fraud
 and good times becomes stronger as monitoring costs decrease.
 Nevertheless, improving business conditions may sometimes diminish fraud.
 We provide an explanation for why fraud peaks towards the end of a boom
 and is then revealed in the ensuing bust. We also show that fraud can
 increase if firms make more information available to the public.  , Oxford University Press.

Title:   Forecasting Stock-Return Variance: Toward an Understanding of Stochastic Implied Volatilities.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 293-326
Issue: 2
Volume: 6
Year: 1993
Abstract:
  We examine the behavior of measured variances from the options market and
 the underlying stock market. Under the joint hypotheses that markets are
 informationally efficient and that option prices are explained by a
 particular asset pricing model, forecasts from time-series models of the
 stock-return process should not have predictive content given the market
 forecast as embodied in option prices. Both in-sample and out-of-sample
 tests suggest that this hypothesis can be rejected. Using simulations, we
 show that biases inherent in the procedure we use to imply variances
 cannot explain this result. Thus, we provide evidence inconsistent with
 the orthogonality restrictions of option pricing models that assume that
 variance risk is unpriced. These results also have implications for
 optimal variance forecast rules.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Returns to Shareholder Activism: Evidence from a Clinical Study of the Hermes UK Focus Fund 
Abstract:
 This article reports a unique analysis of private engagements by an
 activist fund. It is based on data made available to us by Hermes, the
 fund manager owned by the British Telecom Pension Scheme, on engagements
 with management in companies targeted by its UK Focus Fund. In contrast
 with most previous studies of activism, we report that the fund executes
 shareholder activism predominantly through private interventions that
 would be unobservable in studies purely relying on public information. The
 fund substantially outperforms benchmarks and we estimate that abnormal
 returns are largely associated with engagements rather than stock picking.  The Author 2008. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Pages: 419-49
Issue: 2
Volume: 7
Year: 1994
Abstract:
  In a model with asymmetric information and external equity financing, it
 is impossible to achieve socially optimal investment because of
 renegotiation possibilities. The contractual solution suggested by Dybvig
 and Zender (1991) is not dynamically consistent--the manager's contract
 would be renegotiated, resulting in inefficient investment. Moreover, no
 other compensation contract that would induce the manager to invest
 efficiently survives renegotiation. Contracts that pay the manager based
 on the stock price, while producing suboptimal investment as in Myers and
 Majluf (1984), are robust to renegotiation.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Macroeconomic Factors Do Influence Aggregate Stock Returns 
Abstract:
  Stock market returns are significantly correlated with inflation and
 money growth. The impact of real macroeconomic variables on aggregate
 equity returns has been difficult to establish, perhaps because their
 effects are neither linear nor time invariant. We estimate a GARCH model
 of daily equity returns, where realized returns and their conditional
 volatility depend on 17 macro series' announcements. We find six
 candidates for priced factors: three nominal (CPI, PPI, and a Monetary
 Aggregate) and three real (Balance of Trade, Employment Report, and
 Housing Starts). Popular measures of overall economic activity, such as
 Industrial Production or GNP are not represented.   Copyright 2002, Oxford University Press.

Title: The New Issues Puzzle: Testing the Investment-Based Explanation 
Abstract:
 An investment factor, long in low-investment stocks and short in
 high-investment stocks, helps explain the new issues puzzle. Adding the
 investment factor into standard factor regressions reduces the SEO
 underperformance by about 75%, the IPO underperformance by 80%, the
 underperformance following convertible debt offerings by 50%, and Daniel
 and Titman's (2006) composite issuance effect by 40%. The reason is that
 issuers invest more than nonissuers, and the investment factor earns a
 significantly positive average return of 0.57% per month.  The Author 2007. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title:   Tests of a Signaling Hypothesis: The Choice between Fixed- and Adjustable-Rate Debt.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 605-36
Issue: 3
Volume: 8
Year: 1995
Abstract:
  We develop a model wherein the choice between adjustable- and fixed-rate
 debt can serve as a signal of firm quality. The nature of the signal
 depends on expected inflation volatility relative to other risk
 parameters. Evidence from a matched sample of debt announcements over the
 period 1978 to 1986 shows a difference of [minus]2.05 percent between
 stock price reactions to adjustable rate and fixed rate announcements when
 expected inflation volatility is above an estimated threshold. Below this
 threshold, the difference is [plus]0.98 percent. The evidence supports the
 hypothesis that the riskier debt choice serves as a favorable signal of
 firm quality.	 Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Abstract:
  Shareholders of a Regional Bell Operating Company (RBOC) tend to live in
 the area which it serves, and an RBOC's customers tend to hold its shares
 rather than other RBOCs' equity. The geographic bias of the RBOC investors
 is closely related to the general tendency of households' portfolios to be
 concentrated, of employees' tendency to own their employers' stocks in
 their retirement accounts, and to the home country bias in the
 international arena. Together, these phenomena provide compelling evidence
 that people invest in the familiar while often ignoring the principles of
 portfolio theory.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: A Dynamic Model of the Limit Order Book 
Abstract:
 This paper presents a model of an order-driven market where fully
 strategic, symmetrically informed liquidity traders dynamically choose
 between limit and market orders, trading off execution price and waiting
 costs. In equilibrium, the bid and ask prices depend only on the numbers
 of buy and sell orders in the book. The model has a number of empirical
 predictions: (i) higher trading activity and higher trading competition
 cause smaller spreads and lower price impact; (ii) market orders lead to a
 temporary price impact larger than the permanent price impact, therefore
 to price overshooting; (iii) buy and sell orders can cluster away from the
 bid-ask spread, generating a hump-shaped order book; (iv) bid and ask
 prices display a comovement effect: after, e.g., a sell market order moves
 the bid price down, the ask price also falls, by a smaller amount, so the
 bid-ask spread widens; (v) when the order book is full, traders may submit
 quick, or fleeting, limit orders.  The Author 2009. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title: Competition, Risk-shifting, and Public Bail-out Policies 
Abstract:
 This article empirically investigates the competitive effects of
 government bail-out policies. We construct a measure of bail-out
 perceptions by using rating information. From there, we construct the
 market shares of insured competitor banks for any given bank, and analyze
 the impact of this variable on banks' risk-taking behavior, using a large
 sample of banks from OECD countries. Our results suggest that government
 guarantees strongly increase the risk-taking of competitor banks. In
 contrast, there is no evidence that public guarantees increase the
 protected banks' risk-taking, except for banks that have outright public
 ownership. These results have important implications for the effects of
 the recent wave of bank bail-outs on banks' risk-taking behavior.  The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: Examining the Dark Side of Financial Markets: Do Institutions Trade on Information from Investment Bank Connections? 
Abstract:
 Institutions often have access to corporate inside information through
 their connections, but relatively little is known about the extent to
 which they exploit their informational advantage through short-term
 trading. We employ broker-level trading data to systematically examine
 possible cases of connected trading. Despite examining the issue from
 multiple angles, we are unable to find much evidence to support that
 investment bank clients take advantage of connections through takeover
 advising, IPO and SEO underwriting, or lending relationships. In contrast
 to recent academic literature and popular press, our findings suggest that
 institutional investors are reluctant to use inside information in
 traceable manners.  The Author 2012. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: Institutional Investors and Equity Returns: Are Short-term Institutions Better Informed? 
Abstract:
 We show that the positive relation between institutional ownership and
 future stock returns documented in Gompers and Metrick (2001) is driven by
 short-term institutions. Furthermore, short-term institutions' trading
 forecasts future stock returns. This predictability does not reverse in
 the long run and is stronger for small and growth stocks. Short-term
 institutions' trading is also positively related to future earnings
 surprises. By contrast, long-term institutions' trading does not forecast
 future returns, nor is it related to future earnings news. Our results are
 consistent with the view that short-term institutions are better informed
 and they trade actively to exploit their informational advantage.  The Author 2007. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title: Incentives, Targeting, and Firm Performance: An Analysis of Non-executive Stock Options 
Abstract:
 We examine whether options granted to non-executive employees affect firm
 performance. Using new data on option programs, we explore the link
 between broad-based option programs, option portfolio implied incentives,
 and firm operating performance, utilizing an instrumental variables
 approach to identify causal effects. Firms whose employee option
 portfolios have higher implied incentives exhibit higher subsequent
 operating performance. Intuitively, the implied incentive-performance
 relation is concentrated in firms with fewer employees and in firms with
 higher growth opportunities. Additionally, the effect is concentrated in
 firms that grant options broadly to non-executive employees, consistent
 with theories of cooperation and mutual monitoring among co-workers.  The Author 2010. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title: Tractability in Incentive Contracting 
Abstract:
 This article develops a framework that delivers tractable (i.e.,
 closed-form) optimal contracts, with few restrictions on the utility
 function, cost of effort, or noise distribution. By modeling the noise
 before the action in each period, we force the contract to provide correct
 incentives state-by-state, rather than merely on average. This tightly
 constrains the set of admissible contracts and allows for a simple
 solution to the contracting problem. Our results continue to hold in
 continuous time, where noise and actions are simultaneous. We illustrate
 the potential usefulness of our setup by a series of examples related to
 CEO incentives. In particular, the model derives predictions for the
 optimal measure of incentives and whether the contract should be convex,
 concave, or linear.  The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: A Simple Robust Link Between American Puts and Credit Protection 
Abstract:
 We develop a simple robust link between deep out-of-the-money American put
 options on a company's stock and a credit insurance contract on the
 company's bond. We assume that the stock price stays above a barrier B
 before default but drops below a lower barrier A after default, thus
 generating a default corridor [A,B] that the stock price can never enter.
 Given the presence of this default corridor, a spread between two
 co-terminal American put options struck within the corridor replicates a
 pure credit contract, paying off when and only when default occurs prior
 to the option expiry.  The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: The Impact of Trades on Daily Volatility 
Abstract:
  This article proposes a trading-based explanation for the asymmetric
 effect in daily volatility of individual stock returns. Previous studies
 propose two major hypotheses for this phenomenon: leverage effect and
 time-varying expected returns. However, leverage has no impact on
 asymmetric volatility at the daily frequency and, moreover, we observe
 asymmetric volatility for stocks with no leverage. Also, expected returns
 may vary with the business cycle, that is, at a lower than daily
 frequency. Trading activity of contrarian and herding investors has a
 robust effect on the relationship between daily volatility and lagged
 return. Consistent with the predictions of the rational expectation
 models, the non-informational liquidity-driven (herding) trades increase
 volatility following stock price declines, and the informed (contrarian)
 trades reduce volatility following stock price increases. The results are
 robust to different measures of volatility and trading activity. (JEL C30,

Journal: Review of Financial Studies

Volume: 10
Year: 1997
Abstract:
  We provide a framework in which we link the valuation and asset
 allocation policies of defined benefits plans with the lifetime marginal
 productivity schedule of the worker and the pension plan formula. In turn,
 we examine the retirement policies that are implied by the primitives of
 the model and the value of pension obligations. Our model provides an
 explicit valuation formula for a stylized defined benefits plan. The
 optimal asset allocation policies consist of the replicating portfolio of
 the pension liabilities and the growth optimum portfolio independent of
 the pension liabilities. We show that the worker will retire when the
 ratio of pension benefits to current wages reaches a critical value which
 depends on the parameters of the pension plan and the discount rate. Using
 numerical techniques we analyze the feedback effect of retirement policies
 on the valuation of plans and on the asset allocation decisions.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Incentive-Compatible Contracts for the Sale of Information 
Abstract:
  An informed financial institution can trade on private information and
 also sell it to clients through a managed fund. To provide an incentive
 for the informed agent to trade in the interest of her client, the optimal
 contract requires that she be compensated as an increasing function of the
 profits of the fund. The optimal contract is also designed to limit the
 aggressiveness of the sum of the fund's trade and the proprietary trade.
 This reduces information revelation and thus leads to greater overall
 trading profits than if the informed agent only conducted proprietary
 trades.   Copyright 2002, Oxford University Press.

Title: How Noise Trading Affects Markets: An Experimental Analysis 
Abstract:
 We use a laboratory market to investigate the behavior of traders who lack
 informational advantages and have no exogenous reason to trade. We find
 that these uninformed traders behave largely as irrational contrarian
 "noise traders," trading against recent price movements to their own
 detriment. The uninformed traders provide some benefits to the market:
 increasing market volume and depth, while reducing bid-ask spreads and the
 temporary price impact of trades. However, their noise trading also
 diminishes the ability of market prices to adjust to new information. A
 securities transaction tax reduces uninformed trader activity, but it
 reduces informed trader activity by approximately the same amount; as a
 result, the tax does not alter the impact of noise trading on the
 informational efficiency of the market.  The Author 2009. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title: Robust Stochastic Discount Factors 
Abstract:
 When the market is incomplete, a new non-redundant derivative security
 cannot be priced by no-arbitrage arguments alone. Moreover, there will be
 a multiplicity of stochastic discount factors and each of them may give a
 different price for the new derivative security. This paper develops an
 approach to the selection of a stochastic discount factor for pricing a
 new derivative security. The approach is based on the idea that the price
 of a derivative security should not vary too much when the payoff of the
 primitive security is slightly perturbed, i.e., the price of the
 derivative should be robust to model misspecification. The paper develops
 two metrics of robustness. The first is based on robustness in
 expectation. The second is based on robustness in probability and draws on
 tools from the theory of large deviations. We show that in a stochastic
 volatility model, the two metrics yield analytically tractable bounds for
 the derivative price, as the underlying stochastic volatility model is
 perturbed. The bounds can be readily used for numerical examination of the
 sensitivity of the price of the derivative to model misspecification.  The Author 2007. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org, Oxford University Press.

Title:   Discrete-Time Valuation of American Options with Stochastic Interest Rates.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 193-234
Issue: 1
Volume: 8
Year: 1995
Abstract:
  We develop an arbitrage-free discrete time model to price American-style
 claims for which domestic term structure risk, foreign term structure
 risk, and currency risk are important. This model combines a discrete
 version of the Heath, Jarrow, and Morton (1992) term structure model with
 the binomial model of Cox, Ross, and Rubinstein (1979). It converges
 (weakly) to the continuous time models in Amin and Jarrow (1991, 1992).
 The general model is "path dependent" and can be implemented with
 arbitrary volatility functions to value claims with maturity up to five
 years. The model is illustrated with applications to long-dated American
 currency warrants and a cross-rate swap from the quanto class.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Can Rare Events Explain the Equity Premium Puzzle? 
Abstract:
 Probably not. First, allowing the probabilities of the states of the
 economy to differ from their sample frequencies, the consumption-CAPM is
 still rejected in both U.S. and international data. Second, the recorded
 world disasters are too small to rationalize the puzzle, unless one
 assumes that disasters occur every 6--10 years. Third, if the data were
 generated by the rare events distribution needed to rationalize the equity
 premium puzzle, the puzzle itself would be unlikely to arise. Fourth, the
 rare events hypothesis, by reducing the cross-sectional dispersion of
 consumption risk, worsens the ability of the consumption-CAPM to explain
 the cross-section of returns.  The Author 2012. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: The Stock Market and Corporate Investment: A Test of Catering Theory 
Abstract:
 We test a catering theory describing how stock market mispricing might
 influence individual firms' investment decisions. We use discretionary
 accruals as our proxy for mispricing. We find a positive relation between
 abnormal investment and discretionary accruals; that abnormal investment
 is more sensitive to discretionary accruals for firms with higher R&D
 intensity (opaque firms) or share turnover (firms with shorter shareholder
 horizons); that firms with high abnormal investment subsequently have low
 stock returns; and that the larger the relative price premium, the
 stronger the abnormal return predictability. We show that patterns in
 abnormal returns are stronger for firms with higher R&D intensity or share
 turnover.  The Author 2008. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org, Oxford University Press.

Title: Interbank Liquidity Crunch and the Firm Credit Crunch: Evidence from the 2007--2009 Crisis 
Abstract:
 We study the credit supply effects of the unexpected freeze of the
 European interbank market, using exhaustive Portuguese loan-level data. We
 find that banks that rely more on interbank borrowing before the crisis
 decrease their credit supply more during the crisis. The credit supply
 reduction is stronger for firms that are smaller, with weaker banking
 relationships. Small firms cannot compensate the credit crunch with other
 sources of debt. Furthermore, the impact of illiquidity on the credit
 crunch is stronger for less solvent banks. Finally, we find no overall
 positive effects of central bank liquidity but instead higher hoarding of
 liquidity.  The Author 2013. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Year: 2001
Abstract:
  We test whether the impact of financial constraints on firm value is
 observable in stock returns. We form portfolios of firms based on
 observable characteristics related to financial constraints and test for
 common variation in stock returns. Financially constrained firms' stock
 returns move together over time, suggesting that constrained firms are
 subject to common shocks. Constrained firms have low average stock returns
 in our 1968-97 sample of growing manufacturing firms. We find no evidence
 that the relative performance of constrained firms reflects monetary
 policy, credit conditions, or business cycles.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: When Can Life Cycle Investors Benefit from Time-Varying Bond Risk Premia? 
Abstract:
 We study the importance of time-varying bond risk premia in a consumption
 and portfolio-choice problem for a life-cycle investor facing short-sales
 and borrowing constraints. Tilts in the optimal asset allocation in
 response to changes in bond risk premia exhibit pronounced life-cycle
 patterns. We find that the investor is willing to pay an annual fee up to
 1% to implement a strategy that optimally conditions on prevailing bond
 risk premia in addition to her age and wealth. To solve our model, we
 extend recently developed simulation-based techniques to life-cycle
 problems featuring multiple state variables and multiple risky assets.  The Author 2009. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org, Oxford University Press.

Title: Order Preferencing and Market Quality on U.S. Equity Exchanges 
Abstract:
  We present a detailed view of market quality in the presence of
 preferencing arrangements. A unique dataset provides the opportunity to
 measure trading costs of marketable orders and fill rates and ex post
 costs of limit orders across trading venues. For market orders, we find
 the primary exchange provides the lowest execution costs. However, the
 preferencing exchanges are no worse than, and in most cases better than,
 the nonpreferencing regional exchanges. For limit orders, the regionals
 execute limit orders more frequently than the primary market and with an
 ex post execution cost that is not very different from the primary market.   Copyright 2003, Oxford University Press.

Title: Idiosyncratic Return Volatility, Cash Flows, and Product Market Competition 
Abstract:
 Over the past 40 years, the volatility of the average stock return has
 drastically outpaced total market volatility. Thus, idiosyncratic return
 volatility has dramatically increased. We estimate this increase to be 6%
 per year. Consistent with an efficient market, this result is mirrored by
 an increase in the idiosyncratic volatility of fundamental cash flows. We
 argue that these findings are attributable to the more intense
 economy-wide competition. Various cross-sectional and time-series tests
 support this idea. Economic competitiveness facilitates reinterpretation
 of the results from the cross-country R-super-2 literature, as well as the
 US idiosyncratic risk literature.  The Author 2008. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org, Oxford University Press.

Title: Effects of Central Bank Intervention on the Interbank Market During the Subprime Crisis 
Abstract:
 We explore whether central bank intervention improves liquidity in the
 interbank market during the current subprime crisis with unique trade and
 quote data from the e-MID, the only regulated electronic interbank market
 in the world. Central bank intervention consistently creates greater
 uncertainty in the interbank market. Prior to the crisis, the cover-to-bid
 ratio effectively conveys good and bad news from the central bank, but
 this link is broken during the crisis, suggesting that standard (and
 special) interventions that do not specifically target interbank
 asymmetric information fail to improve market liquidity. Our results
 suggest that the central bank should release stress tests for individual
 banks, provide interbank loan guarantees, or engage in direct asset
 purchases rather than simply providing more capital when counterparty risk
 poses systemic risk to the interbank market.  The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Abstract:
  I study the finite sample distribution of one of Ait-Sahalia's (1996c)
 nonparametric tests of continuous-time models of the short-term riskless
 rate. The test rejects true models too often because interest rate data
 are highly persistent but the asymptotic distribution of the test (and of
 the kernel density estimator on which the test is based) treats the data
 as if it were independently and identically distributed. To attain the
 accuracy of the kernel density estimator implied by its asymptotic
 distribution with 22 years of data generated from the Vasicek model in
 fact requires 2755 years of data.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: The Going-Public Decision and the Product Market 
Abstract:
 At what point in a firm's life should it go public? How do a firm's ex
 ante product market characteristics relate to its going-public decision?
 Further, what are the implications of a firm going public on its post-IPO
 operating and product market performance? In this article, we answer the
 above questions by conducting the first large sample study of the
 going-public decisions of U.S. firms in the literature. We use the
 Longitudinal Research Database (LRD) of the U.S. Census Bureau, which
 covers the entire universe of private and public U.S. manufacturing firms.
 Our findings can be summarized as follows. First, a private firm's product
 market characteristics (total factor productivity [TFP], size, sales
 growth, market share, industry competitiveness, capital intensity, and
 cash flow riskiness) significantly affect its likelihood of going public
 after controlling for its access to private financing (venture capital or
 bank loans). Second, private firms facing less information asymmetry and
 those with projects that are cheaper for outsiders to evaluate are more
 likely to go public. Third, as more firms in an industry go public, the
 concentration of that industry increases in subsequent years. The above
 results are robust to controlling for the interactions between various
 product market and firm-specific variables. Fourth, IPOs of firms occur at
 the peak of their productivity cycle: the dynamics of TFP and sales growth
 exhibit an inverted U-shaped pattern, both in our univariate analysis and
 in our multivariate analysis using firms that remained private throughout
 as a benchmark. Finally, sales, capital expenditures, and other
 performance variables exhibit a consistently increasing pattern over the
 years before and after the IPO. The last two findings are consistent with
 the view that the widely documented post-IPO operating underperformance of
 firms is due to the real investment effects of going public rather than
 being due to earnings management immediately prior to the IPO.  The Author 2009. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title: The Mispricing Return Premium 
Abstract:
 We show that, when stock prices are subject to stochastic mispricing
 errors, expected rates of return may depend not only on the fundamental
 risk that is captured by a standard asset pricing model, but also on the
 type and degree of asset mispricing, even when the mispricing is zero on
 average. Empirically, the mispricing induced return premium, either
 estimated using a Kalman filter or proxied by the volatility and variance
 ratio of residual returns, is shown to be significantly associated with
 realized risk-adjusted returns.  The Author 2010. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title: The Effect of Introducing a Non-Redundant Derivative on the Volatility of Stock-Market Returns When Agents Differ in Risk Aversion 
Abstract:
 We study the effect of introducing a nonredundant derivative on the
 volatilities of the stock market return and the locally risk-free interest
 rate. Our analysis uses a standard, frictionless, full-information,
 dynamic, continuous-time, general-equilibrium, Lucas endowment economy in
 which there are two classes of agents who have time-additive power utility
 functions and differ only in their risk aversion. Our main result is to
 show analytically that if the intensity of the precautionary demand for
 savings is not too high, then the introduction of a nonredundant
 derivative increases the volatility of stock market returns. Furthermore,
 in the economy with the derivative, the volatility of stock market returns
 can be substantially greater than that of aggregate dividend growth
 (fundamental volatility). We also show that the volatility of the locally
 risk-free interest rate increases with the introduction of the derivative.  The Author 2007. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Abstract:
  We study the asset pricing implications of an economy where solvency

 efficient allocations and for the corresponding asset prices, portfolio
 holdings, and solvency constraints for a simple example. Then we calibrate
 a more general model to U.S. aggregate as well as idiosyncratic income
 processes. We find equity premia, risk premia for long-term bonds, and
 Sharpe ratios of magnitudes similar to the U.S. data for low risk aversion
 and a low time-discount factor.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

 This article investigates the out-of-sample predictability of bond excess
 returns. We assess the economic value of the forecasting ability of
 empirical models based on long-term forward interest rates in a dynamic

 Indeed, these models do not outperform the no-predictability benchmark.
 Furthermore, their relative performance deteriorates over time.  The Author 2012. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: Dynamic Equilibrium with Two Stocks, Heterogeneous Investors, and Portfolio Constraints 
Abstract:
 We study dynamic equilibrium in a Lucas economy with two stocks, two
 heterogeneous constant relative risk aversion investors, and portfolio
 constraints. We focus on margin and leverage constraints, which restrict
 access to credit. We find a positive relationship between the amount of
 leverage in the economy and magnitudes of stock return correlations and
 volatilities. Tighter constraints generate rich patterns in correlations
 and volatilities, make them less countercyclical, increase risk premia
 proportionally to assets' margins, and increase prices of low-margin
 assets more than prices of high-margin assets. We derive closed-form
 solutions for the unconstrained case and the case of leverage constraints.  The Author 2013. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: How Do Pensions Affect Corporate Capital Structure Decisions? 
Abstract:
 This article examines the capital structure implications of defined
 benefit corporate pension plans. The magnitude of the liabilities arising
 from these pension plans is substantial. We show that leverage ratios for
 firms with pension plans are about 35% higher when pension assets and
 liabilities are incorporated into the capital structure. We estimate that
 the tax shields from pension contributions are about a third of those from
 interest payments. Pension contributions have a modest effect in lowering
 firms' marginal corporate tax rates. Once pensions are considered, firms
 are less conservative in their choice of leverage than has been previously
 thought. We show that firms incorporate the magnitude of their pension
 assets and liabilities into their capital structure decisions.  The Author 2009. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Abstract:
  I present evidence of predictability in a sample constructed to minimize

 I use filter rules on lagged return and lagged volume information to
 uncover weekly over-reaction profits on large-capitalization NYSE and AMEX
 securities. I find that decreasing-volume stocks experience greater
 reversals. Increasing-volume stocks exhibit weaker reversals and positive
 autocorrelation. A real-time simulation of the filter strategies suggests
 that an investor who pursues the filter strategy with relatively low
 transaction costs will strongly outperform an investor who follows a
 buy-and-hold strategy.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Market Frictions, Price Delay, and the Cross-Section of Expected Returns 
Abstract:
  We parsimoniously characterize the severity of market frictions affecting
 a stock using the delay with which its price responds to information. The
 most delayed firms command a large return premium not explained by size,
 liquidity, or microstructure effects. Moreover, delay captures part of the
 size effect, idiosyncratic risk is priced only among the most delayed
 firms, and earnings drift is monotonically increasing in delay. Frictions
 associated with investor recognition appear most responsible for the delay
 effect. The very small segment of delayed firms, comprising only 0.02% of
 the market, generates substantial variation in average returns,
 highlighting the importance of frictions.   Copyright 2005, Oxford University Press.

Title: Strategic Trading, Liquidity, and Information Acquisition 
Abstract:
  We study endogenous liquidity trading in a market with long-lived
 asymmetric information. We distinguish between public information,
 tractable information that can be acquired, and intractable information
 that cannot be acquired. Besides information asymmetry and noise, the
 adverse-selection spread depends on the diffusion of intractable
 information and on the interest rate. With endogenous liquidity trading,

Title: Why Does Book Building Drive Out Auction Methods of IPO Issuance? Evidence from Japan 
Abstract:
  We examine Japan's 1997 introduction of book building as an alternative
 to a previously required hybrid auction method. Despite higher cost for
 some issuers, all issuers in Japan now select book building. Book building
 enables more accurate valuation of firms, but gains from accurate
 valuation are partly redistributive. Thus book building can drive
 auction-method offerings from the market even if it yields no aggregate
 benefit. Compared to the auction regime, book building reduces issue costs
 for large issuers. Auctioning is less costly for small issuers, but
 appears to foreclose some small firms from issuing. The aggregate costs of
 book building and auctioning are similar.   Copyright 2004, Oxford University Press.

Title: The Information Content of Bank Loan Covenants 
Abstract:
 This article examines the determinants of financial covenant thresholds in
 bank loan agreements and information conveyed through the selection of
 tight financial covenants. We find that riskier firms and firms with fewer
 investment opportunities select tighter financial covenants. We also find
 that selection of tight covenants is associated with improvements in the
 covenant variable and declines in investment spending and net debt
 issuance. We observe these changes also for borrowers that do not breach
 their covenants, suggesting that they are not simply the result of
 creditor influence conditional on a technical default. Furthermore, we
 find that violations of tightly set covenants have significantly less of
 an impact on the borrower's investment spending and net debt issuance than
 violations of loosely set covenants. Overall, our results suggest that the
 selection of tight covenants conveys information concerning future changes
 in covenant variables, investment and financial policies, and the outcome
 of covenant violations.  The Author 2010. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title: Bank Corporate Loan Pricing Following the Subprime Crisis 
Abstract:
 The massive losses that banks incurred with the meltdown of the subprime
 mortgage market have raised concerns about their ability to continue
 lending to corporations. We investigate these concerns. We find that firms
 paid higher loan spreads during the subprime crisis. Importantly, the
 increase in loan spreads was higher for firms that borrowed from banks
 that incurred larger losses. These results hold after we control for
 firm-, bank-, and loan-specific factors, and account for endogeneity of
 bank losses. These findings, together with our evidence that borrowers
 took out smaller loans during the crisis when they borrowed from banks
 that incurred larger losses, lend support to the concerns about bank
 lending following their subprime losses.  The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: Brokerage Commissions and Institutional Trading Patterns 
Abstract:
 The institutional brokerage industry faces an ever-increasing pressure to
 lower trading costs, which has already driven down average commissions and
 shifted volume toward low-cost execution venues. However, traditional
 full-service brokers that bundle execution with services remain a force
 and their commissions are still considerably higher than the marginal cost
 of trade execution. We hypothesize that commissions constitute a
 convenient way of charging a prearranged fixed fee for long-term access to
 a broker's premium services. We derive testable predictions based on this
 hypothesis and test them on a large sample of institutional trades from
 1999 to 2003. We find that institutions negotiate commissions
 infrequently, and thus commissions vary little with trade characteristics.
 Institutions also concentrate their order flow with a relatively small set
 of brokers, with smaller institutions concentrating their trading more
 than large institutions and paying higher per-share commissions. These
 results are stable over time, are consistent with our predictions, and
 cannot be explained by cost-minimization alone. Finally, we discuss the
 evolution of the institutional brokerage market within the proposed
 framework and make informal predictions about future developments in the
 industry.  The Author 2009. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org, Oxford University Press.

Title: Financial Capacity and Discontinuous Investment: Evidence from Emerging Market Multibusiness Firms 
Abstract:
 I provide a new characterization of internal capital markets in an
 emerging economy using daily divisional data on all Peruvian
 fish-processing firms. A regression discontinuity model exploiting
 government production bans on regulated divisions ("fishmeal") shows that
 the increased investment in the nonfishmeal divisions due to the bans is
 substantial (over 30% of the mean value), after controlling for
 productivity. The redeployment of financial capacity into nonfishmeal
 investments is particularly sharper when external financing is more costly
 and when firms are more closely monitored by creditors. The value-creating
 nature of this redeployment is supported by its positive effects on
 nonfishmeal exports.  The Author 2013. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: Issuer Quality and Corporate Bond Returns 
Abstract:
 We show that the credit quality of corporate debt issuers deteriorates
 during credit booms and that this deterioration forecasts low excess
 returns to corporate bondholders. The key insight is that changes in the
 pricing of credit risk disproportionately affect the financing costs faced
 by low-quality firms, so debt issuance of low-quality firms is
 particularly useful for forecasting bond returns. We show that a
 significant decline in issuer quality is a more reliable signal of credit
 market overheating than rapid aggregate credit growth. We use these
 findings to investigate the forces driving time variation in expected
 corporate bond returns.  The Author 2013. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: Executive Compensation and the Role for Corporate Governance Regulation 
Abstract:
 This article establishes a role for corporate governance regulation. An
 externality operating through executive compensation motivates regulation.
 Governance lowers agency costs, allowing firms to grant less incentive
 pay. When a firm increases governance and lowers incentive pay, other
 firms can also lower executive compensation. Because firms do not
 internalize the full benefit of governance, regulation can improve
 investor welfare. When regulation is enforced, large firms increase in
 value, small firms decrease in value, and all firms lower incentive pay.
 Distinct cross-sectional and cross-country predictions for the number of
 voluntary governance firms are provided.  The Author 2012. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title:   The Restrictions on Predictability Implied by Rational Asset Pricing Models.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 343-82
Issue: 2
Volume: 11
Year: 1998
Abstract:
  This article shows how rational asset pricing models restrict the
 regression-based criteria commonly used to measure return predictability.
 Specifically, it invokes no-arbitrage arguments to show that the
 intercept, slope coefficients, and R[superscript 2] in predictive
 regressions must take specific values. These restrictions provide a way to
 directly assess whether the predictability uncovered using regression
 analysis is consistent with rational pricing. Empirical tests reveal that
 the returns on the CRSP size deciles are too predictable to be compatible
 with a number of well-known pricing models. However, the overall pattern
 of predictability across these portfolios is reasonably consistent with
 what we would expect under circumstances where predictability is rational.

Title: Coordination of Expectations in Asset Pricing Experiments 
Abstract:
  We investigate expectation formation in a controlled experimental
 environment. Subjects are asked to predict the price in a standard asset
 pricing model. They do not have knowledge of the underlying market
 equilibrium equations, but they know all past realized prices and their
 own predictions. Aggregate demand for the risky asset depends upon the
 forecasts of the participants. The realized price is then obtained from
 market equilibrium with feedback from six individual expectations.
 Realized prices differ significantly from fundamental values and typically
 exhibit oscillations around, or slow convergence to, this fundamental. In
 all groups participants coordinate on a common prediction strategy.   Copyright 2005, Oxford University Press.

Title: A Multiplicative Model of Optimal CEO Incentives in Market Equilibrium 
Abstract:
 This paper presents a unified theory of both the level and sensitivity of
 pay in competitive market equilibrium, by embedding a moral hazard problem
 into a talent assignment model. By considering multiplicative
 specifications for the CEO's utility and production functions, we generate
 a number of different results from traditional additive models. First,
 both the CEO's low fractional ownership (the Jensen--Murphy incentives
 measure) and its negative relationship with firm size can be
 quantitatively reconciled with optimal contracting, and thus need not
 reflect rent extraction. Second, the dollar change in wealth for a
 percentage change in firm value, divided by annual pay, is independent of
 firm size, and therefore a desirable empirical measure of incentives.
 Third, incentive pay is effective at solving agency problems with
 multiplicative impacts on firm value, such as strategy choice. However,
 additive issues such as perk consumption are best addressed through direct
 monitoring.  The Author 2008. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title: Credit Default Swaps and the Empty Creditor Problem 
Abstract:
 The empty creditor problem arises when a debtholder has obtained insurance
 against default but otherwise retains control rights in and outside
 bankruptcy. We analyze this problem from an ex ante and ex post
 perspective in a formal model of debt with limited commitment, by
 comparing contracting outcomes with and without insurance through credit
 default swaps (CDS). We show that CDS, and the empty creditors they give
 rise to, have important ex ante commitment benefits: By strengthening
 creditors' bargaining power, they raise the debtor's pledgeable income and
 help reduce the incidence of strategic default. However, we also show that
 lenders will over-insure in equilibrium, giving rise to an inefficiently
 high incidence of costly bankruptcy. We discuss a number of remedies that
 have been proposed to overcome the inefficiency resulting from excess
 insurance.  The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Year: 1999
Abstract:
  A firm's instantaneous probability of default is modeled as a translated
 square-root diffusion process modified to allow the process to be
 correlated with default-free interest rates. The parameters of the process
 are estimated for 161 firms. An extended Kalman filter approach is used
 that incorporates both the time-series and cross-sectional (term
 structure) properties of the individual firms' bond prices. The model is
 reasonably successful at fitting corporate bond yields, while key features
 of the term structures of yield spreads are captured in the signs and
 magnitudes of the resulting parameter estimates.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title:   Do Call Prices and the Underlying Stock Always Move in the Same Direction?

Volume: 13
Year: 2000
Abstract:
  This article empirically analyzes some properties shared by all
 one-dimensional diffusion option models. Using S&P 500 options, we find
 that sampled intraday (or interday) call (put) prices often go down (up)
 even as the underlying price goes up, and call and put prices often
 increase, or decrease, together. Our results are valid after controlling
 for time decay and market microstructure effects. Therefore
 one-dimensional diffusion option models cannot be completely consistent
 with observed option price dynamics; options are not redundant securities,
 nor ideal hedging instruments--puts and the underlying asset prices may go
 down together.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: The Price of Diversifiable Risk in Venture Capital and Private Equity 
Abstract:
 This paper demonstrates how the principal-agent problem between venture
 capitalists and their investors (limited partners) causes limited partner
 returns to depend on diversifiable risk. Our theory shows why the need for
 investors to motivate VCs alters the negotiations between VCs and
 entrepreneurs and changes how new firms are priced. The three-way
 interaction rationalizes the use of high discount rates by VCs and
 predicts a correlation between total risk and net of fee investor returns.
 We take our theory to a unique data set and find empirical support for the
 effect of the principal-agent problem on equilibrium private equity asset
 prices.  The Author 2013. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: Investment under Uncertainty, Heterogeneous Beliefs, and Agency Conflicts 
Abstract:
 We develop a structural model to investigate the effects of asymmetric
 beliefs and agency conflicts on dynamic principal--agent relationships.
 Optimism has a first-order effect on incentives, investments, and output,
 which could reconcile the private equity puzzle. Asymmetric beliefs cause
 optimal contracts to have features consistent with observed venture
 capital and research and development (R&D) contracts. We derive testable
 implications for the effects of project characteristics on contractual
 features. We calibrate our model to data on pharmaceutical R&D projects
 and show that optimism indeed significantly influences project values.

Title: Estimating the Effect of Hierarchies on Information Use 
Abstract:
 Theory suggests that greater hierarchical distance between a subordinate
 and his boss makes it more difficult to share abstract and subjective
 information in decision making. A novel dataset put together from credit
 dossiers of large corporate loan applicants enables us to observe the
 information collected by loan officers, and how it is used by the ultimate
 loan approving officer. We find that greater hierarchical/geographical
 distance between the information collecting agent and the loan approving
 officer leads to less reliance on subjective information and more on
 objective information. By exploiting nonlinearities in the "assignment
 rules" that determine an applicant's hierarchical distance, and using
 information collecting agent fixed effects, we show that our result cannot
 be driven by endogenous assignment of applicants. We also find that higher
 frequency of interactions between the information collecting agent and
 loan approving officer, both over time and through geographical proximity,
 helps mitigate the effects of hierarchical distance on information use.
 Our results show that hierarchical distance influences information use,
 and highlights the importance of "human touch" in communication.  The Author 2009. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org, Oxford University Press.

Title: Statistical Arbitrage and Securities Prices 
Abstract:
  This article introduces the concept of a statistical arbitrage
 opportunity (SAO). In a finite-horizon economy, a SAO is a zero-cost
 trading strategy for which (i) the expected payoff is positive, and (ii)
 the conditional expected payoff in each final state of the economy is
 nonnegative. Unlike a pure arbitrage opportunity, a SAO can have negative
 payoffs provided that the average payoff in each final state is
 nonnegative. If the pricing kernel in the economy is path independent,
 then no SAOs can exist. Furthermore, ruling out SAOs imposes a novel
 martingale-type restriction on the dynamics of securities prices. The
 important properties of the restriction are that it (1) is model-free, in
 the sense that it requires no parametric assumptions about the true
 equilibrium model, (2) can be tested in samples affected by selection
 biases, such as the peso problem, and (3) continues to hold when
 investors' beliefs are mistaken. The article argues that one can use the
 new restriction to empirically resolve the joint hypothesis problem
 present in the traditional tests of the efficient market hypothesis.   Copyright 2003, Oxford University Press.

Title: Asset Return Dynamics and Learning 
Abstract:
 This article advocates a theory of expectation formation that incorporates
 many of the central motivations of behavioral finance theory while
 retaining much of the discipline of the rational expectations approach. We
 provide a framework in which agents, in an asset pricing model,
 underparameterize their forecasting model in a spirit similar to Hong,
 Stein, and Yu (2007) and Barberis, Shleifer, and Vishny (1998), except
 that the parameters of the forecasting model and the choice of predictor
 are determined jointly in equilibrium. We show that multiple equilibria
 can exist even if agents choose only models that maximize (risk-adjusted)
 expected profits. A real-time learning formulation yields endogenous
 switching between equilibria. We demonstrate that a real-time learning
 version of the model, calibrated to U.S. stock data, is capable of
 reproducing regime-switching returns and volatilities, as recently
 identified by Guidolin and Timmermann (2007).  The Author 2010. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

 capacity to repatriate foreign earnings under the AJCA, we find that a
 majority of the funds repatriated by capital-constrained firms were
 allocated to approved domestic investment. Although unconstrained firms
 account for a majority of repatriated funds, no increase in investment
 resulted. Contrary to other examinations of the AJCA, we find little
 change in leverage and equity payouts.  The Author 2012. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: Decomposition of Optimal Portfolio Weight in a Jump-Diffusion Model and Its Applications 
Abstract:
 This article solves the portfolio choice problem in a multi-asset
 jump-diffusion model. We decompose the optimal portfolio weight into
 components that correspond to a collection of fictitious economies, one of
 which is a standard diffusion economy, and the others of which are
 pure-jump economies. We derive a semi-closed-form solution for the optimal
 portfolio weight, and investigate its properties with or without ambiguity
 aversion. We find that an investor may not reduce her investment in risky
 assets when facing more frequent jumps, as suggested by a single-asset
 jump-diffusion model. Moreover, an investor who is extremely cautious
 about her estimates of higher moments of asset returns may still hold
 risky assets, contrary to the prediction of a pure-diffusion model with
 ambiguity aversion to the first moment.  The Author 2012. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: Short Arbitrage, Return Asymmetry, and the Accrual Anomaly 
Abstract:
 We find a positive association between short selling and accruals during
 1988--2009, and that asymmetry between the up- and downsides of the
 accrual anomaly is stronger when constraints on short arbitrage are more
 severe (low availability of loanable shares as proxied by institutional
 holdings). Short arbitrage occurs primarily among firms in the top accrual
 decile. Asymmetry is present only on NASDAQ. Thus, there is short
 arbitrage of the accrual anomaly, but short-sale constraints limit its
 effectiveness.  The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: Mutual Fund Tournaments: The Sorting Bias and New Evidence 
Abstract:
 Previous findings regarding the risk-shifting behavior of mid-year
 underperforming mutual fund managers are mixed. In this article, I show
 that this is due to a "sorting bias," which is caused by the sorting of
 first-half risk levels when establishing relative mid-year performance.
 Even without risk-shifting behavior, mean reversion of these sorted risk
 levels results in the detection of tournament behavior. After correcting
 for this bias, I find evidence supporting the hypothesis that first-half
 underperforming managers increase portfolio risk during the second half of
 the year and that this tournament behavior is not dependent on first-half
 market conditions.  The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: Corporate Bond Valuation and Hedging with Stochastic Interest Rates and Endogenous Bankruptcy 
Abstract:
  This paper analyzes corporate bond valuation and optimal call and default
 rules when interest rates and firm value are stochastic. It then uses the
 results to explain the dynamics of hedging. Bankruptcy rules are important
 determinants of corporate bond sensitivity to interest rates and firm
 value. Although endogenous and exogenous bankruptcy models can be
 calibrated to produce the same prices, they can have very different
 hedging implications. We show that empirical results on the relation
 between corporate spreads and Treasury rates provide evidence on duration,
 and we find that the endogenous model explains the empirical patterns
 better than do typical exogenous models.   Copyright 2002, Oxford University Press.

Title: Interbank Contagion at Work: Evidence from a Natural Experiment 
Abstract:
 This article tests financial contagion due to interbank linkages. For
 identification, we exploit an idiosyncratic, sudden shock caused by a
 large-bank failure in conjunction with detailed data on interbank
 exposures. First, we find robust evidence that higher interbank exposure
 to the failed bank leads to large deposit withdrawals. Second, the
 magnitude of contagion is higher for banks with weaker fundamentals.
 Third, interbank linkages among surviving banks further propagate the
 shock. Finally, we find results suggesting that there are real economic
 effects. These results suggest that interbank linkages act as an important
 channel of contagion and hold important policy implications.  The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Volume: 13
Year: 2000
Abstract:
  We analyze the incentives of investment banks to develop innovative
 products. We show that client characteristics and market structure affect
 these incentives significantly. Investment banks with larger market shares
 have greater incentives to innovate and smaller banks are likely to share
 their innovations with the largest bank. Innovation incentives increase in
 volatile environments and regulatory scrutiny actually encourages loophole
 exploitation activity. Our predictions are consistent with stylized facts
 and the analysis has broad testable implications for innovative activity
 in other markets similarly characterized by a lack of comprehensive
 protection for intellectual property rights, for example, the software
 industry.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Asset Returns and the Listing Choice of Firms 
Abstract:
 We propose a mechanism that relates asset returns to the firm's optimal
 listing choice. We use a theoretical model to show that a stock will be
 more liquid when it is listed on a market where "similar" securities are
 traded. We empirically examine the implications of our model using New
 York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and Nasdaq securities. We find that the return
 patterns of stocks that switch markets become more similar to the return
 patterns of securities listed on the new market prior to the switch.
 Stocks that are eligible to switch but stay put are more similar to
 securities listed on their market than to securities listed on the other
 market. Our results suggest that managers make listing decisions that
 enhance the liquidity of their firms' stocks.  The Author 2006. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title: Specialization, Productivity, and Financing Constraints 
Abstract:
 We analyze optimal financial contracts when the specificity of investments
 is endogenous. Specialization decreases the liquidation value of assets,
 but improves the asset's long-term productivity. While the former is known
 to make financing more difficult, we show that the latter can ease
 financing constraints and increase financing capacity by improving an
 entrepreneur's incentive to repay. The overall impact of specialization on
 the terms of financing depends on which effect is more important.
 Specialization decisions interact with the nature of investments, their
 timing, the need for outside financing, and an entrepreneur's ability to
 commit to a level of specialization.  The Author 2013. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: Is Default Risk Negatively Related to Stock Returns? 
Abstract:
 We find a positive cross-sectional relationship between expected stock
 returns and default risk, contrary to the negative relationship estimated
 by prior studies. Whereas prior studies use noisy ex post realized returns
 to estimate expected returns, we use ex ante estimates based on the
 implied cost of capital. The results suggest that investors expected
 higher returns for bearing default risk, but they were negatively
 surprised by lower-than-expected returns on high default risk stocks in
 the 1980s. We also extend the sample compared with prior studies and find
 that the evidence based on realized returns is considerably weaker in the
 1952--1980 period.  The Author 2009. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved. For permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org, Oxford University Press.

Title:   Reputation, Renegotiation, and the Choice between Bank Loans and Publicly Traded Debt.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 475-506
Issue: 3
Volume: 7
Year: 1994
Abstract:
  We model firms' choice between bank loans and publicly traded debt,
 allowing for debt renegotiation in the event of financial distress.
 Entrepreneurs, with private information about their probability of
 financial distress, borrow from banks (multiperiod players) or issue bonds
 to implement projects. If a firm is in financial distress, lenders devote
 a certain amount of resources (unobservable to entrepreneurs) to evaluate
 whether to liquidate the firm or to renegotiate its debt. We demonstrate
 that banks' desire to acquire a reputation for making the "right"
 renegotiation versus liquidation decision provides them an endogenous
 incentive to devote a larger amount of resources than bondholders toward
 such evaluations. In equilibrium, bank loans dominate bonds from the point
 of view of minimizing inefficient liquidation; however, firms with a lower
 probability of financial distress choose bonds over bank loans.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Abstract:
  By identifying the possibility of imposing a credible threat of

 context, we characterize the circumstances under which a mixture of
 informed and uninformed (market) finance is optimal, and explain why bank
 debt is typically secured, senior, and tightly held. We also show that the
 effectiveness of mixed finance may be impaired by the possibility of
 collusion between the firms and their informed lenders, and that in the
 optimal renegotiation-proof contract informed debt capacity will be
 exhausted before appealing to supplementary uninformed finance.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: A Reexamination of Corporate Governance and Equity Prices 
Abstract:
 We reexamine long-term abnormal returns for portfolios sorted on
 governance characteristics. Firms with strong shareholder rights and firms
 with weak shareholder rights differ from the population of firms and from
 each other in how they cluster across industries. Using well-specified
 tests under this industry clustering, we find statistically zero long-term
 abnormal returns for portfolios sorted on governance. Our results have
 important implications for interpreting studies that link governance to
 firm value and stock returns, demonstrate the importance of the coarseness
 of industry definitions in financial research, and shed light on
 addressing statistical problems created by industry clustering in samples.  The Author 2009. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title: Distance and Private Information in Lending 
Abstract:
 We study the effects of physical distance on the acquisition and use of
 private information in informationally opaque credit markets. Using a
 unique data set of all loan applications by small firms to a large bank,
 we show that borrower proximity facilitates the collection of soft
 information, leading to a trade-off in the availability and pricing of
 credit, which is more readily accessible to nearby firms albeit at higher
 interest rates ceteris paribus. Analyzing loan rates and firms' decision
 to switch lenders provides further evidence for banks' strategic use of
 private information. However, distance erodes our lender's ability to
 collect proprietary intelligence and to carve out local captive markets,
 suggesting that the requisite soft information is primarily local.   The Author 2010. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Abstract:
  We develop a dynamic model of the adoption of financial innovations. Each

 excess are, in fact, consistent with fully rational behavior. We also show
 that social welfare is enhanced when more firms adopt innovations of
 questionable value and that financial intermediaries base an incentive to
 encourage such adoption.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Pay for Performance? CEO Compensation and Acquirer Returns in BHCs 
Abstract:
 We examine how managerial incentives affect acquisition decisions in the
 banking industry. We find that higher pay-for-performance sensitivity
 (PPS) leads to value-enhancing acquisitions. Banks whose CEOs have higher
 PPS have significantly better abnormal stock returns around the time of
 the acquisition announcements. On average, acquirers in the high-PPS group
 outperform their counterparts in the low-PPS group by 1.4% in a three-day
 window around the announcement. Higher PPS helps reduce the incentives for
 making value-destroying acquisitions, while at the same time promotes
 value-enhancing acquisitions. The positive market reaction can be
 rationalized by post-merger performance. Following acquisitions, banks
 with higher PPS experience greater improvements in their operating
 performance. We show that the effect of PPS is mainly evident in small and
 medium-sized banks, but is not present in large banks.  The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title: Debt Maturity and the Effects of Growth Opportunities and Liquidity Risk on Leverage 
Abstract:
  I test the hypothesis that short debt maturity attenuates the negative
 effect of growth opportunities on leverage. Using simultaneous equations
 with leverage and maturity endogenous, I find strong support for an
 economically significant attenuation effect. The negative effect of growth
 opportunities on leverage for firms with all shorter-term debt is less
 than one-sixth as large as the effect for firms with all longer-term debt.
 Short maturity also increases liquidity risk, however, which negatively
 affects leverage. The results suggest that firms trade off the cost of
 underinvestment problems against the cost of liquidity risk when choosing
 short maturity.   Copyright 2003, Oxford University Press.

Title: Optimal Property Rights in Financial Contracting 
Abstract:
 This article adopts a definition of property rights from legal
 scholarship: A property right (in contrast to a contractual right) is
 enforceable, not only against the parties to a contract, but also against
 third parties outside the contract. In a financial contracting setting, we
 ask: When should the law enforce a lender's contractual protections as
 property rights, given that these rights may be hidden and costly for
 other lenders to discover? Our model explains why the law limits the
 creation and enforceability of property rights, and develops principles of
 optimal enforceability. These principles are often reflected in the law.  The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

 which there is the potential for moral hazard on each side of the

 the debt need not be monotone in firm risk. The initial terms of the debt
 are not set to price default risk but rather are set to efficiently

Title: Stochastic Discount Factor Bounds with Conditioning Information 
Abstract:
  Hansen and Jagannathan (1991) (hereafter HJ) derive restrictions on the
 volatility of stochastic discount factors that price a given set of
 returns. This article studies the sampling properties of HJ bounds that
 use conditioning information. One approach is to multiply the returns by
 the lagged variables. We also study optimized HJ bounds with conditioning
 information from Gallant, Hansen, and Tauchen (1990) and based on
 portfolios derived in Ferson and Siegel (2001). We document striking
 finite-sample biases in the HJ bounds, where the bounds reject
 asset-pricing models too often. We provide a useful bias correction. We
 also evaluate asymptotic standard errors for the bounds from Hansen,
 Heaton, and Luttmer (1995).   Copyright 2003, Oxford University Press.

Title: Jumps and Information Flow in Financial Markets 
Abstract:
 This article investigates the predictability of jump arrivals in U.S.
 stock markets. Using a new test that identifies jump predictors up to the
 intraday level, I find that jumps are likely to occur shortly after
 macroeconomic information releases, such as the Federal Reserve
 announcements, nonfarm payroll reports, and jobless claims, as well as
 market index jumps. I also find firm-specific jump predictors related to
 earnings releases, analyst recommendations, past stock jumps, and dividend
 dates. Evidence suggests that distinguishing systematic jumps from
 idiosyncratic jumps is possible using the characteristics of jump
 predictors. Finally, I present a short-term jump size clustering.  The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Abstract:
  Changes in stock prices have substantial explanatory power for U.S.
 investment, especially for long-term samples, and even in the presence of
 cash flow variables. The stock market dramatically out-performs a standard
 q-variable because the market-equity component of this variable is only a
 rough proxy for stock market value. Although the stock market did not
 predict accurately after the crash of October 1987, the errors were not
 statistically significant. Parallel relationships for Canada raise the

Title: News--Good or Bad--and Its Impact on Volatility Predictions over Multiple Horizons 
Abstract:
 We introduce a new class of parametric models applicable to a mixture of
 high and low frequency returns and revisit the concept of news impact
 curves introduced by Engle and Ng (1993). Overall, we find that moderately
 good (intra-daily) news reduces volatility (the next day), while both very
 good news (unusual high intra-daily positive returns) and bad news
 (negative returns) increase volatility, with the latter having a more
 severe impact. The asymmetries disappear over longer horizons. Models
 featuring asymmetries dominate in terms of out-of-sample forecasting
 performance, especially during the 2007--2008 financial crisis.  The Author 2010. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title:   Excess Funds and Agency Problems: An Empirical Study of Incremental Cash Disbursements.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 219-47
Issue: 1
Volume: 13
Year: 2000
Abstract:
  This study investigates the excess funds hypothesis using samples of
 special dividends, regular dividend increases, and self-tender offers. All
 three types of firms tend to have funds in excess of industry norms before
 the events. The excess funds are largely nonrecurring for special dividend
 and self-tender offer firms and recurring for regular dividend increase
 firms. The analysis of the stock price reaction suggests that large
 incremental disbursements mitigate the agency problem associated with
 excess funds. In particular, the stock price reaction is positively
 related to excess funds for self-tender offers and large special
 dividends, but not for regular dividend increases (which tend to be
 smaller) or small special dividends.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Nonlinear Mean Reversion in the Short-Term Interest Rate 
Abstract:
  Using a new Bayesian method for the analysis of diffusion processes, this
 article finds that the nonlinear drift in interest rates found in a number
 of previous studies can be confirmed only under prior distributions that
 are best described as informative. The assumption of stationarity, which
 is common in the literature, represents a nontrivial prior belief about
 the shape of the drift function. This belief and the use of "flat" priors
 contribute strongly to the finding of nonlinear mean reversion.
 Implementation of an approximate Jeffreys prior results in virtually no
 evidence for mean reversion in interest rates unless stationarity is
 assumed. Finally, the article documents that nonlinear drift is primarily
 a feature of daily rather than monthly data, and that these data contain a
 transitory element that is not reflected in the volatility of
 longer-maturity yields.   Copyright 2003, Oxford University Press.

Title: Why Leverage Affects Pricing 
Abstract:
 We explain and provide evidence for effects of leverage on pricing. Our
 model identifies two effects that either counteract or reinforce each
 other, depending on the debt maturity structure: (i) firms set higher
 prices (underinvest in market share) if they have more debt, and (ii)
 firms engage in dynamic risk-shifting by setting lower (higher) prices if
 the current debt obligation will be higher (lower) in the next period than
 in the present period. Using a unique dataset of owner-managed hotels in
 Austrian ski resorts, we provide empirical evidence of both effects.  The Author 2008. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title: Good IPOs Draw in Bad: Inelastic Banking Capacity and Hot Markets 
Abstract:
 We posit that screening IPOs requires specialized labor which is in fixed
 supply. A sudden increase in demand for IPO financing increases the
 compensation of IPO screening labor. This results in reduced screening,
 encouraging sub-marginal firms to enter the IPO market, further fueling
 the demand for screening labor. The model's conclusions are consistent
 with empirical findings of increased underpricing during hot markets,
 positive correlation between issue volume and underpricing, and with
 tipping points between hot and cold markets. Finally, the model makes
 sharp predictions relating the IPO market to fundamental values of firms
 and to investment banking returns.  The Author 2007. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org, Oxford University Press.

Title: Capturing Option Anomalies with a Variance-Dependent Pricing Kernel 
Abstract:
 We develop a GARCH option model with a new pricing kernel allowing for a
 variance premium. While the pricing kernel is monotonic in the stock
 return and in variance, its projection onto the stock return is
 nonmonotonic. A negative variance premium makes it U shaped. We present
 new semiparametric evidence to confirm this U-shaped relationship between
 the risk-neutral and physical probability densities. The new pricing
 kernel substantially improves our ability to reconcile the time-series
 properties of stock returns with the cross-section of option prices. It
 provides a unified explanation for the implied volatility puzzle, the
 overreaction of long-term options to changes in short-term variance, and
 the fat tails of the risk-neutral return distribution relative to the
 physical distribution.  The Author 2013. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: Risk Arbitrage in Takeovers 
Abstract:
  This article studies the role of risk arbitrageurs in takeovers and the
 source of their advantage. We show how the presence of arbitrageurs
 affects the value of the target shares, since arbitrageurs are more likely
 to tender. Therefore an arbitrageur has the informational advantage of
 knowing he bought shares. In equilibrium, the number of arbitrageurs
 buying shares and the price they pay are determined endogenously. We also
 present several empirical implications, including the relationship among
 trading volume, takeover premium, liquidity of the shares, and the number
 of risk arbitrageurs investing in one particular deal.   Copyright 2002, Oxford University Press.

Abstract:
  This paper develops and tests arbitrage bounds for a combination of two

 simultaneous use of four options and creates a position that is equivalent
 to riskless lending. The no-arbitrage conditions are compared to existing
 arbitrage bounds and are tested using Chicago Board Options Exchange data.

Title: International asset allocation under regime switching, skew, and kurtosis preferences 
Abstract:
 This paper investigates the international asset allocation effects of
 time-variations in higher-order moments of stock returns such as skewness
 and kurtosis. In the context of a four-moment International Capital Asset
 Pricing Model (ICAPM) specification that relates stock returns in five
 regions to returns on a global market portfolio and allows for
 time-varying prices of covariance, co-skewness, and co-kurtosis risk, we
 find evidence of distinct bull and bear regimes. Ignoring such regimes, an
 unhedged US investor's optimal portfolio is strongly diversified
 internationally. The presence of regimes in the return distribution leads
 to a substantial increase in the investor's optimal holdings of US stocks,
 as does the introduction of skewness and kurtosis preferences.  The Author 2008. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title:   The Endogeneity of Managerial Compensation in Firm Valuation: A Solution.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 735-64
Issue: 3
Volume: 14
Year: 2001
Abstract:
  Much of the empirical literature that has examined the functional
 relationship between firm value and managerial ownership levels assumes
 that managerial ownership levels are exogenous and are the only component
 of managerial compensation related to firm performance. This assumption is
 contrary to the theoretical and empirical literature wherein managerial
 compensation is endogenously determined and includes both shares and
 options. Using instruments for managerial compensation and panel data to
 control for unobservable heterogeneity in the firm's contracting
 environment, we estimate a system of simultaneous equations. We find that
 firms are in equilibrium when they endogenously set their chief executive
 officer's compensation.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Executive Compensation: A New View from a Long-Term Perspective, 1936--2005 
Abstract:
 We analyze the long-run trends in executive compensation using a new
 dataset of top officers of large firms from 1936 to 2005. The median real
 value of compensation was remarkably flat from the late 1940s to the
 1970s, revealing a weak relationship between pay and aggregate firm
 growth. By contrast, this correlation was much stronger in the past thirty
 years. This historical perspective also suggests that compensation
 arrangements have often helped to align managerial incentives with those
 of shareholders because executive wealth was sensitive to firm performance
 for most of our sample. These new facts pose a challenge to several common
 explanations for the rise in executive pay since the 1980s.  Published by Oxford University Press 2010, Oxford University Press.

Title: Life-Cycle Portfolio Choice with Additive Habit Formation Preferences and Uninsurable Labor Income Risk 
Abstract:
  This article explores the implications of additive and endogenous habit
 formation preferences in the context of a life-cycle model of an investor
 who has stochastic uninsurable labor income. To solve the model, I
 analytically derive the habit-wealth feasibility constraints and show that
 they depend on the worst possible path of future labor income and on the
 habit strength, but not on the probability of the worst income. When there
 is only a slim chance of a severe income shock, the model implies much
 more conservative portfolios. The model also predicts that for some low to
 moderately wealthy households, the portfolio share allocated to stocks
 increases with wealth. Because of this feature, the model can generate
 more conservative portfolios for younger than for middle-aged households.
 The effects of habits on portfolio choice are robust to income smoothing
 through borrowing or flexible labor supply. One controversial finding is
 that for high values of the habit strength parameter, usually required for
 the resolution of asset pricing puzzles in general equilibrium, the
 life-cycle model predicts counterfactually high wealth accumulation. (JEL:

Title: The Composition Matters: Capital Inflows and Liquidity Crunch During a Global Economic Crisis 
Abstract:
 This article studies whether the volume and composition of capital flows
 affect the degree of credit crunch during the 2007--2011 crisis. Using
 data on 3,823 firms in 24 emerging countries, we find that, on average,
 the decline in stock prices was more severe for firms that are
 intrinsically more dependent on external finance for working capital.
 Interestingly, while the volume of capital flows per se has no significant
 effect, the composition matters a lot. In particular, greater dependence
 on non-FDI capital inflows before the crisis worsens the credit crunch
 during the crisis, while exposure to FDI alleviates the liquidity
 constraint.  The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Abstract:
  We examine the structure of initial takeover bids and the frequency of
 observing competing bids and target management resistance. We find the use
 of cash is not consistently correlated with the frequency of competition
 or resistance and that the cost of acquiring information about a target is
 associated with the likelihood of competition and resistance. A high bid
 premium appears to deter competing offers and is also associated with a
 lower likelihood of resistance. Finally, target management resistance is
 associated with an increased likelihood of a competing offer arising and a
 larger increase in target shareholder wealth between the initial public
 announcement and outcome dates relative to the not-resisted subsample for
 both successful and unsuccessful acquisition proposals.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Robust Portfolio Rules and Asset Pricing 
Abstract:
  I present a new approach to the dynamic portfolio and consumption problem
 of an investor who worries about model uncertainty (in addition to market
 risk) and seeks robust decisions along the lines of Anderson, Hansen, and
 Sargent (2002). In accordance with max-min expected utility, a robust
 investor insures against some endogenous worst case. I first show that
 robustness dramatically decreases the demand for equities and is
 observationally equivalent to recursive preferences when removing wealth
 effects. Unlike standard recursive preferences, however, robustness leads
 to environment-specific "effective" risk aversion. As an extension, I
 present a closed-form solution for the portfolio problem of a robust
 Duffie-Epstein-Zin investor. Finally, robustness increases the equilibrium
 equity premium and lowers the risk-free rate. Reasonable parameters
 generate a 4% to 6% equity premium.   Copyright 2004, Oxford University Press.

Title: Nondiscriminating Foreclosure and Voluntary Liquidating Costs 
Abstract:
  Since liquidation and bankruptcy are costly, researchers have tried to
 find out why the claimants of a troubled firm do not work out a deal to
 avoid these costs. In this article we show that if a creditor has to deal
 with multiple borrowers who might default, it may be optimal for the
 creditor to randomly reject requests for a loan workout. We further
 demonstrate that the optimal acceptance rate used by a creditor is
 positively related to the liquidating cost and negatively related to the
 default benefit. Our model is particularly relevant when analyzing the
 default decisions of mortgage borrowers and small business owners.   Copyright 2002, Oxford University Press.

Title: Libertarian Paternalism, Information Production, and Financial Decision Making 
Abstract:
 We develop a theoretical model to analyze the effects of libertarian
 paternalism on information production and financial decision making.
 Individuals in our model appreciate the information content of the
 recommendations made by a social planner. This affects their incentive to
 gather information, and in turn the speed at which information spreads
 across market participants, via social learning or formal advice channels.
 We characterize situations in which libertarian paternalism improves
 welfare and contrast them with scenarios in which this policy is
 suboptimal because of its negative impact on the production and
 propagation of information.  The Author 2013. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Abstract:
  A standard empirical finding is that expected changes in exchange rates
 and interest rate differentials across countries are negatively related,
 implying that uncovered interest rate parity is violated in the data. This
 article provides new empirical evidence that suggests that violations of
 uncovered interest rate parity, and its economic implications, depend on
 the sign of the interest rate differentially. A framework related to term
 structure models is developed to account for the puzzling relationship
 between expected changes in exchange rates and interest rate
 differentials. Estimation results suggest that a particular term structure
 model can account for the puzzling empirical evidence.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Market Making with Costly Monitoring: An Analysis of the SOES Controversy 
Abstract:
  This article presents a model of information monitoring and market making
 in a dealership market. We model how intensively dealers monitor public
 information to avoid being picked off by professional day traders when
 monitoring is costly. Price competition among dealers is hampered by their
 incentives to share monitoring costs. The risk of being picked off by the
 day traders makes dealers more competitive. The interaction between these
 effects determines whether a firm quote rule improves trading costs and
 price discovery. Our empirical results support the prediction that
 professional day traders prefer stocks with small spreads, but offer less
 support for the prediction that their trading leads to wider spreads.   Copyright 2003, Oxford University Press.

Title: The Delegated Lucas Tree 
Abstract:
 We analyze the effects of the observed increased share of delegated
 capital for trading strategies and equilibrium prices by introducing
 delegation into a standard Lucas exchange economy. In equilibrium, some
 investors trade on their own account, but others decide to delegate
 trading to professional fund managers. Flow-performance incentive
 functions describe how much capital clients provide to funds at each date
 as a function of past performance. Convex flow-performance relations imply
 that the average fund outperforms the market in recessions and
 underperforms in expansions. When the share of capital that is delegated
 is low, all funds follow the same strategy. However, when the equilibrium
 share of delegated capital is high, funds with identical incentives employ
 heterogeneous trading strategies. A group of managers borrows to take on a
 levered position on the stock. Thus, fund returns are dispersed in the
 cross-section and the outstanding amounts of borrowing and lending
 increase. The relation between the share of delegated capital and the
 Sharpe ratio typically follows an inverse U-shaped pattern.  The Author 2012. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: Incentives and Mutual Fund Performance: Higher Performance or Just Higher Risk Taking? 
Abstract:
 We study the impact of contractual incentives on the performance of mutual
 funds. We find that high-incentive contracts induce managers to take more
 risk and reduce the funds' probability of survival. Yet, funds with
 high-incentive contracts deliver higher risk-adjusted return, and the
 superior performance remains persistent. The top incentive quintile of
 funds outperforms the bottom quintile by 2.70% per year. Moreover,
 high-incentive winner funds from one year have a positive alpha of 0.41%
 per month in the following year. Focusing on funds' holdings, we show that
 active portfolio rebalancing is the main channel through which incentives
 increase performance.  The Author 2008. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org, Oxford University Press.

Title: The Procyclical Effects of Bank Capital Regulation 
Abstract:
 We compare various bank capital regulation regimes using a dynamic
 equilibrium model of relationship lending in which banks are unable to
 access the equity markets every period and the business cycle determines
 loans' probabilities of default. Banks hold endogenous capital buffers as
 a precaution against shocks that impair their future lending capacity. We
 find that Basel II is more procyclical than Basel I but makes banks safer,
 and it is generally superior in welfare terms. For high social costs of
 bank failure, the optimal capital requirements are higher but less
 cyclically varying, like those currently targeted by Basel III.  The Author 2012. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: Portfolio Performance Manipulation and Manipulation-proof Performance Measures 
Abstract:
 Numerous measures have been proposed to gauge the performance of active
 management. Unfortunately, these measures can be gamed. Our article shows
 that gaming can have a substantial impact on popular measures even in the
 presence of high transactions costs. Our article shows there are
 conditions under which a manipulation-proof measure exists and fully
 characterizes it. This measure looks like the average of a power utility
 function, calculated over the return history. The case for using our
 alternative ranking metric is particularly compelling for hedge funds
 whose use of derivatives is unconstrained and whose managers' compensation
 itself induces a nonlinear payoff.  , Oxford University Press.

Title:   Asset Prices in Dynamic Production Economies with Time-Varying Risk.

Pages: 781-801
Issue: 4
Volume: 7
Year: 1994
Abstract:
  We examine the effect of changes in output uncertainty on the price of
 aggregate capital and on the prices of levered claims on capital. The
 relation between the volatility of the marginal product of capital and the
 price of capital depends on the level of capital adjustment costs and the
 elasticity of intertemporal substitution. For available estimates of this
 elasticity, the value of capital and risks are directly related while the
 value of levered equity claims on capital may be decreasing in risk. We
 use these results to analyze the argument that increased risk was
 responsible for the U.S. stock market decline of the 1970s.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: The Inventory Growth Spread 
Abstract:
 Previous studies show that firms with low inventory growth outperform
 firms with high inventory growth in the cross-section of publicly traded
 firms. In addition, inventory investment is volatile and procyclical, and
 inventory-to-sales is persistent and countercyclical. We embed an
 inventory holding motive into the investment-based asset pricing framework
 by modeling inventory as a factor of production with convex and nonconvex
 adjustment costs. The augmented model simultaneously matches the large
 inventory growth spread in the data, as well as the time-series properties
 of the firm-level capital investment, inventory investment, and
 inventory-to-sales. Our conditional single-factor model also implies that
 traditional unconditional factor models such as the CAPM should fail to
 explain the inventory growth spread, although not with the same large
 pricing errors observed in the data.  The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: Portfolio Choice in the Presence of Housing 
Abstract:
  I show that investment in housing plays a crucial role in explaining the
 patterns of cross-sectional variation in the composition of wealth and the
 level of stockholdings observed in portfolio composition data. Due to
 investment in housing, younger and poorer investors have limited financial
 wealth to invest in stocks, which reduces the benefits of equity market
 participation. House price risk crowds out stockholdings, and this
 crowding out effect is larger for low financial net-worth. In the model as
 in the data leverage is positively correlated with stockholdings.   Copyright 2005, Oxford University Press.

Title: Corporate Leverage, Debt Maturity, and Credit Supply: The Role of Credit Default Swaps 
Abstract:
 Does the ability of suppliers of corporate debt capital to hedge risk
 through credit default swap (CDS) contracts impact firms' capital
 structures? We find that firms with traded CDS contracts on their debt are
 able to maintain higher leverage ratios and longer debt maturities. This
 is especially true during periods in which credit constraints become
 binding, as would be expected if the ability to hedge helps alleviate
 frictions on the supply side of credit markets.  The Author 2013. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: Option Valuation with Conditional Heteroskedasticity and Nonnormality 
Abstract:
 We provide results for the valuation of European-style contingent claims
 for a large class of specifications of the underlying asset returns. Our
 valuation results obtain in a discrete time, infinite state space setup
 using the no-arbitrage principle and an equivalent martingale measure
 (EMM). Our approach allows for general forms of heteroskedasticity in
 returns, and valuation results for homoskedastic processes can be obtained
 as a special case. It also allows for conditional nonnormal return
 innovations, which is critically important because heteroskedasticity
 alone does not suffice to capture the option smirk. We analyze a class of
 EMMs for which the resulting risk-neutral return dynamics are from the
 same family of distributions as the physical return dynamics. In this
 case, our framework nests the valuation results obtained by Duan (1995)
 and Heston and Nandi (2000) by allowing for a time-varying price of risk
 and nonnormal innovations. We provide extensions of these results to more
 general EMMs and to discrete-time stochastic volatility models, and we
 analyze the relation between our results and those obtained for
 continuous-time models.  The Author 2009. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org, Oxford University Press.

Title: The Determinants of Stock and Bond Return Comovements 
Abstract:
 We study the economic sources of stock-bond return comovements and their
 time variation using a dynamic factor model. We identify the economic
 factors employing a semi structural regime-switching model for state
 variables such as interest rates, inflation, the output gap, and cash flow
 growth. We also view risk aversion, uncertainty about inflation and
 output, and liquidity proxies as additional potential factors. We find
 that macroeconomic fundamentals contribute little to explaining stock and
 bond return correlations but that other factors, especially liquidity
 proxies, play a more important role. The macro factors are still important
 in fitting bond return volatility, whereas the "variance premium" is
 critical in explaining stock return volatility. However, the factor model
 primarily fails in fitting covariances.  The Author 2010. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title:   Optimal Contracting with Moral Hazard and Cascading.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 559-96
Issue: 3
Volume: 11
Year: 1998
Abstract:
  In this article I identify optimal incentive contracts for managers of
 firms competing in the product market. Such firms often confront similar
 decisions and uncertainties. Managers can improve decision quality by
 generating private signals through costly effort. However, since signals
 are likely to be correlated, firms that decide later get additional
 information from the actions of earlier firms. This impacts effort choice.
 Decision quality is also affected if later managers disregard their own
 signals and blindly imitate preceding decisions. In a competitive
 environment, such cascading hurts profits. Contracts that solve both moral
 hazard and cascading problems typically put more weight on firm profits,
 making them expensive. Contacts with more weight on decision quality are
 less expensive but result in cascades. Shareholders choose contracts that
 maximize their net surplus. This results in testable implications about
 which industries may have more convergence in investment choices, greater
 pay-for-profit sensitivity, larger differences in observed contracts, more
 innovation, larger-size firms, and potential for overcompensation.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Optimal Convergence Trade Strategies 
Abstract:
 Convergence trades exploit temporary mispricing by simultaneously buying
 relatively underpriced assets and selling short relatively overpriced
 assets. This paper studies optimal convergence trades under both recurring
 and nonrecurring arbitrage opportunities represented by continuing and
 "stopped" cointegrated price processes and considers both fixed and
 stochastic (Poisson) horizons. Conventional long-short delta neutral
 strategies are generally suboptimal and it can be optimal to
 simultaneously go long (or short) in two mispriced assets. Optimal
 portfolio holdings critically depend on whether the risky asset position
 is liquidated when prices converge. Our theoretical results are
 illustrated on pairs of Chinese bank shares traded on both the Hong Kong
 and China stock exchanges.  The Author 2013. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Issue: 3
Volume: 9
Year: 1996
Abstract:
  We provide experimental evidence that nonbinding preplay communication
 between bidders in auctions of shares facilitates the adoption of
 equilibrium strategies: cohesive strategies in uniform-price auctions, and
 the unique equilibrium in undominated strategies in discriminatory
 auctions. When communication between bidders is introduced, clearing
 prices and auctioneer profits in uniform-price auctions fall below those
 observed in discriminatory auctions. This evidence suggests that uniform
 price auctions of Treasury securities may result in lower revenues than
 the currently employed discriminatory procedure.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Volume: 13
Year: 2000
Abstract:
  Over the past decade several countries, including the US, have introduced
 or redesigned legislation that confers priority in bankruptcy upon all or
 some bank deposits. We argue that in the presence of contracting costs
 such rules can increase efficiency. We first show in a private information
 model that a borrower can reduce overall costs of finance by letting
 informationally heterogeneous lenders choose between junior and senior
 debt. In particular, we find that debt priorities reduce socially wasteful
 information gathering by investors. We then argue why, particularly in
 banking, legal standardization of debt priorities may be superior to
 bilateral private arrangements.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Abstract:
  This article successively introduces variable velocity, durability, and

 explores their effects on the variability of exchange rate changes,
 forward premiums, and the foreign exchange risk premium. A new feature of
 the model is that agents make decisions at a weekly frequency and face
 conditionally heteroskedastic shocks. Nevertheless, even the most complex
 model fails to deliver sufficiently variable risk premiums without causing
 forward premiums and exchange rates to be excessively variable. Unlike
 previous models, the model can roughly match the persistence of forward
 premiums.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Abstract:
  This article develops an efficient and accurate method for numerical
 evaluation of the integral equation which defines the American put option
 value function. Numerical integration using Gaussian quadrature and
 function approximation using Chebyshev polynomials are combined to
 evaluate recursive expectations and produce an approximation of the option
 value function in two dimensions, across stock prices and over time to
 maturity. A set of such solutions results in a multidimensional
 approximation that is extremely accurate and very quick to compute. The
 method is an effective alternative to finite difference methods, the
 binomial model, and various analytic approximations.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Abstract:
  I characterize the optimal design of a new futures market (an innovation)
 by an exchange in the presence of market frictions. Futures markets are
 characterized by both the contract and the level of trader participation;
 both can be determined by an exchange. A game in which exchanges
 simultaneously design markets is considered, and a particular equilibrium
 (not necessarily unique) is constructed. A game in which exchanges
 sequentially design markets (and incur design costs) is also considered
 and the (generically unique) equilibrium is constructed. The nature of
 equilibrium with multiple exchanges is discussed in these simultaneous and
 sequential settings, illustrating the role played by liquidity
 considerations both in market design and in the nature of competition
 between exchanges.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: The Effect of Bank Mergers on Loan Prices: Evidence from the United States 
Abstract:
 Bank mergers can increase or decrease loan spreads, depending on whether
 the increased market power outweighs efficiency gains. Using proprietary
 loan-level data for U.S. commercial banks, I find that, on average,
 mergers reduce loan spreads, with the magnitude of the reduction being
 larger when postmerger cost savings increase. My results suggest that the
 relation between spreads and the extent of the market overlap between
 merging banks is nonmonotonic. The market overlap increases cost savings
 and consequently lowers spreads, but when the overlap is sufficiently
 large, spreads increase, potentially due to the market-power effect
 dominating the cost savings. Furthermore, the average reduction in spreads
 is significant for small businesses.  The Author 2009. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

 this phenomenon leads to expected return estimates that are more stable
 and precise than estimates delivered by standard methods. Portfolio
 selection can also be improved. At an extreme, optimal portfolio weights
 are proportional to expected returns when no factors are observable. We
 find that such portfolios perform well in simulations and in out-of-sample
 comparisons.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Dynamic Asset Allocation: Portfolio Decomposition Formula and Applications 
Abstract:
 A new decomposition of the optimal portfolio, in dynamic models with von
 Neumann--Morgenstern preferences and Ito prices, is established. The
 formula rests on a change of numéraire that uses pure discount bonds as
 units of account. The dynamic hedging demand has two components. The first
 hedge insures against fluctuations in an optimally designed bond with a
 maturity date matching the investor's horizon. The second hedge immunizes
 against fluctuations in the market price of risk in the bond numéraire.
 Various applications are examined. New results concerning the behavior of
 extremely risk-averse individuals, the demand for bonds and its
 long-horizon limit, and the optimal portfolio in incomplete markets are
 derived.  The Author 2009. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org, Oxford University Press.

Title: Momentum in Corporate Bond Returns 
Abstract:
 This paper documents significant momentum in a comprehensive sample of
 81,491 U.S. corporate bonds with both transaction and dealer-quote data
 from 1973 to 2011. Momentum is driven by noninvestment grade (NIG) bonds.
 Momentum profits have increased over time, along with the growth of this
 segment. From 1991 to 2011, they average 59 basis points (bps) per month
 across all bonds and 192 bps in NIG bonds. NIG bonds issued by private
 firms earn even higher profits (282 bps). Momentum profits do not appear
 to compensate for risk or persist as a result of trading frictions. Bond
 momentum is not just a manifestation of equity momentum.  The Author 2013. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: Endogenous Entry and Partial Adjustment in&nbsp;IPO Auctions: Are Institutional Investors Better Informed? 
Abstract:
 Using a unique dataset of complete bid information for every IPO auction
 in Taiwan during 1995--2000, we examine the behaviors and returns of two
 groups--institutional and retail investors--in a setting in which
 underwriters do not have pricing or allocation discretion. We find that
 the bids of institutional investors are generally consistent with the
 predictions of IPO auction theory for informed bidders, while those of
 individual investors are not. Specifically, returns are higher when more
 institutional investors enter the auction or bid higher prices, suggesting
 institutional investors are informed and are also able to shave bids
 adequately. However, individual investors as a group exhibit
 return-chasing behavior, are uninformed, and systematically overbid.  The Author 2009. Published by Oxford University Press [on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies]. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title:   Empty Promises and Arbitrage.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 807-34
Issue: 4
Volume: 12
Year: 1999
Abstract:
  Analysis of absence of arbitrage normally ignores payoffs in states to
 which the agent assigns zero probability. We extend the fundamental
 theorem of asset pricing to the case of 'no empty promises' in which the
 agent cannot promise arbitrarily large payments in some states. There is a
 superpositive pricing rule that can assign positive price to claims in
 zero probability states important to the market as well as assigning
 positive prices to claims in the states of positive probability. With
 continuous information arrival, no empty promises can be enforced by
 shutting down the agent's subsequent investments once wealth hits zero.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title:   Prices, Liquidity, and the Information Content of Trades.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 659-96
Issue: 3
Volume: 13
Year: 2000
Abstract:
  We investigate the effect of asymmetric information on prices and
 liquidity by analyzing trades, quotes, spreads, and depths. Information
 content should increase with trade size and the information asymmetry of
 the trading period. Results show that price and liquidity effects are
 significantly associated with information content as measured by both
 trade size and timing relative to information events. Results are stronger
 for purchases than sales. Quoted prices are better measures of information
 effects than transaction prices, because they control for bid-ask bounce.
 Finally, trades that a priori contain no information have no impact on
 prices and liquidity, despite their large size.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Do Foreigners Invest Less in Poorly Governed Firms? 
Abstract:
 As domestic sources of outside finance are limited in many countries
 around the world, it is important to understand factors that influence
 whether foreign investors provide capital to a country's firms. We study
 4,409 firms from twenty-nine countries to assess whether and why concerns
 about corporate governance result in fewer foreign holdings. We find that
 foreigners invest less in firms that reside in countries with poor
 outsider protection and disclosure and have ownership structures that are
 conducive to governance problems. This effect is particularly pronounced
 when earnings are opaque, indicating that information asymmetry and
 monitoring costs faced by foreign investors likely drive the results.  The Author 2008. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title: Dividends and Corporate Shareholders 
Abstract:
 Corporations uniquely have a tax preference for cash dividends.
 Nevertheless, dividends do not increase following trades of
 large-percentage blocks of stock from individuals to corporations.
 Moreover, although one-third of firms have corporate blockholders, 68% of
 these firms pay no dividends, and ownership is not clustered at levels
 that increase the tax benefits of dividends. These findings are not driven
 by the investing firms' tax rates or by agency problems. Instead,
 operating companies expand the target firms and pursue joint ventures.
 Dividends are lower with these investors. Financial investors are not
 attracted to dividend-paying firms and tend to be passive.  The Author 2008. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title: Originator Performance, CMBS Structures, and the Risk of Commercial Mortgages 
Abstract:
 This article examines information and incentive problems that can exist in
 the market for commercial mortgages that are pooled and repackaged as
 commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBSs). We find that mortgages that
 are originated by institutions with large negative stock returns in the
 quarters prior to the origination date tend to have higher credit spreads
 and default more than other mortgages with similar observable
 characteristics. Properties financed with these mortgages also exhibit
 weaker post-securitization operating performance. In addition, stock price
 loser institutions are anxious to securitize mortgages they originate more
 quickly. Finally we find that credit rating agencies require higher levels
 of subordination for CMBS pools (i.e., view these pools as riskier) that
 include more mortgages originated by underperforming originators. This
 evidence is consistent with reputation models in which poorly performing
 originators have less incentive to carefully evaluate the credit quality
 of prospective borrowers, thereby letting relatively riskier mortgages
 pass through their weaker screening standards.  The Author 2010. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title: Inheriting Losers 
Abstract:
 We show that new managers who take over mutual fund portfolios sell off
 inherited momentum losers at higher rates than stocks in any other
 momentum decile, even after adjusting for concurrent trades in these
 stocks by continuing fund managers. This behavior is observed regardless
 of fund characteristics and is stronger when new managers are external
 hires. The tendency of continuing fund managers to hold on to losers could
 be consistent with either a behavior bias stemming from an inability to
 ignore the sunk costs associated with the stocks' past underperformance or
 a conscious desire to protect their careers by not admitting prior
 mistakes. Furthermore, we present evidence that selling off loser stocks
 helps improve fund performance.  The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title: Optimal Corporate Governance and Compensation in a Dynamic World 
Abstract:
 We model long-run firm performance, management compensation, and corporate
 governance in a dynamic, nonstationary world. Many features of governance
 and compensation that have caused consternation among commentators arise
 naturally in this dynamic setting, even though boards are rational and
 managers are powerless. Compensation changes depend on changes in the
 evolution of a latent state variable outside the manager's control. Board
 passivity is positively correlated with both the value of management
 compensation and the firm's good fortune. Managerial opportunism tends to
 follow sudden reversals of good fortune. Moreover, managerial private
 benefits, by increasing managers' stake in the long-run viability of the
 firm, may actually ameliorate agency conflicts.  The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: Interpreting the Value Effect Through the Q-Theory: An Empirical Investigation 
Abstract:
 This article interprets the well-known value effect through the
 implications of standard Q-theory. An investment growth factor, defined as
 the difference in returns between low-investment stocks and
 high-investment stocks, contains information similar to the Fama and
 French (1993) value factor (HML), and can explain the value effect about
 as well as HML. In the cross-section, portfolios of firms with low
 investment growth rates (IGRs) or low investment-to-capital ratios have
 significantly higher average returns than those with high IGRs or high
 investment-to-capital ratios. The value effect largely disappears after
 controlling for investment, and the investment effect is robust against
 controls for the marginal product of capital. These results are consistent
 with the predictions of a standard Q-theory model with a stochastic
 discount factor.  The Author 2007. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org, Oxford University Press.

Title:   Multimarket Trading and Market Liquidity.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 483-511
Issue: 3
Volume: 4
Year: 1991
Abstract:
  When a security trades at multiple locations simultaneously, an informed
 trader has several avenues in which to exploit his private information.
 The greater the proportion of liquidity trading by "large" traders who can
 split their trades across markets, the larger is the correlation between
 volume in different markets and the smaller is the informativeness of
 prices. We show that one of the markets emerges as the dominant location
 for trading in that security. When informed traders can use their
 information for more than one trading period, the timely release of price
 information by market makers at one location adversely affects the profits
 informed traders expect to make subsequently at other locations. Market
 makers, competing to offer the lowest cost of trading at their location,
 consequently deter informed trading be voluntarily making the price
 information public and by "cracking down" on insider trading.	 Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Subprime Consumer Credit Demand: Evidence from a Lender's Pricing Experiment 
Abstract:
 Using a unique panel data set from a U.K. credit card company, we analyze
 the interest rate sensitivity of subprime credit card borrowers. In
 addition to all individual transactions and loan terms, we have access to
 details of a randomized interest rate experiment conducted by the lender
 on existing (inframarginal) loans. For the whole sample, we estimate a
 statistically significant &pound;3.4 reduction in monthly credit demand in
 response to a five percentage point increase in interest rates. This
 aggregate response is small, but it masks very interesting heterogeneity
 in the sample. We find that only low-risk borrowers who fully utilize
 their credit cards lower their credit demand significantly when faced with
 an increase in interest rates. We also document that a five percentage
 point increase in interest rates generates significant additional revenue
 for the lender without inducing delinquency over a short horizon.  The Author 2013. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: Level 3 Assets: Booking Profits and Concealing Losses 
Abstract:
 Fair value accounting forces institutions to revalue inventory whenever a
 transaction occurs. An institution that faces a balance sheet constraint
 may have incentives to suspend trading in Level 3 assets (traded on opaque
 over-the-counter markets) in order to avoid such marking-to-market. This
 keeps the book valuation artificially high, relaxing the balance sheet
 constraint. But, the institution loses direct control of the risk of its
 position. Solving this "real options" problem, the institution will report
 profits as they occur but delay reporting losses. A regulator trying to
 control risk imposes fines for balance sheet manipulation and capital
 requirements. Both these tools can increase risk-taking and balance sheet
 manipulation. Audits in comparision generally decrease risk-taking but may
 be costly to the regulator. The model provides predictions on the
 distribution of a bank's trading gains in illiquid markets.  The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: The "Wall Street Walk" and Shareholder Activism: Exit as a Form of Voice 
Abstract:
 We examine whether a large shareholder can alleviate conflicts of interest
 between managers and shareholders through the credible threat of exit on
 the basis of private information. In our model, the threat of exit often
 reduces agency costs, but additional private information need not enhance
 the effectiveness of the mechanism. Moreover, the threat of exit can
 produce quite different effects depending on whether the agency problem
 involves desirable or undesirable actions from shareholders' perspective.
 Our results are consistent with empirical findings on the interaction
 between managers and minority large shareholders and have further
 empirical implications.  The Author 2009. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org, Oxford University Press.

Title: On the Relation Between the Credit Spread Puzzle and the Equity Premium Puzzle 
Abstract:
 Structural models of default calibrated to historical default rates,
 recovery rates, and Sharpe ratios typically generate Baa--Aaa credit
 spreads that are significantly below historical values. However, this
 "credit spread puzzle" can be resolved if one accounts for the fact that
 default rates and Sharpe ratios strongly covary; both are high during
 recessions and low during booms. As a specific example, we investigate
 credit spread implications of the Campbell and Cochrane (1999) pricing
 kernel calibrated to equity returns and aggregate consumption data.
 Identifying the historical surplus consumption ratio from aggregate
 consumption data, we find that the implied level and time variation of
 spreads match historical levels well.  The Author 2008. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org, Oxford University Press.

Title: Investment, Financing Constraints, and Internal Capital Markets: Evidence from the Advertising Expenditures of Multinational Firms 
Abstract:
 We find a significant positive relation between a firm's advertising
 spending in the United States and its contemporaneous foreign cash flow.
 This relation holds even after controlling for factors that should be
 related to the optimal level of domestic advertising, and it is stronger
 for subsets of firms that we expect to be relatively more financially
 constrained. Our evidence supports the hypothesis that there is a causal
 and economically substantial link between cash flow and investment
 spending, even for intangible investments such as advertising. Our
 evidence also suggests that firms have active internal capital markets in
 which capital is moved across geographic regions.  The Author 2008. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title: Discrete-Time Affine-super-&Qopf; Term Structure Models with Generalized Market Prices of Risk 
Abstract:
 This article develops a rich class of discrete-time, nonlinear dynamic
 term structure models (DTSMs). Under the risk-neutral measure, the
 distribution of the state vector X<sub>t</sub> resides within a family of
 discrete-time affine processes that nests the exact discrete-time
 counterparts of the entire class of continuous-time models in Duffie and
 Kan (1996) and Dai and Singleton (2000). Under the historical
 distribution, our approach accommodates nonlinear (nonaffine) processes
 while leading to closed-form expressions for the conditional likelihood
 functions for zero-coupon bond yields. As motivation for our framework, we
 show that it encompasses many of the equilibrium models with habit-based
 preferences or recursive preferences and long-run risks. We illustrate our
 methods by constructing maximum likelihood estimates of a nonlinear
 discrete-time DTSM with habit-based preferences in which bond prices are

Title: The Levered Equity Risk Premium and Credit Spreads: A Unified Framework 
Abstract:
 We embed a structural model of credit risk inside a dynamic
 continuous-time consumption-based asset pricing model, which allows us to
 price equity and corporate debt in a unified framework. Our key economic
 assumptions are that the first and second moments of earnings and
 consumption growth depend on the state of the economy, which switches
 randomly, creating intertemporal risk, which agents prefer to resolve
 sooner rather than later, because they have Epstein-Zin-Weil preferences.
 Agents optimally choose dynamic capital structure and default times. For a
 dynamic cross-section of firms, our model endogenously generates a
 realistic average term structure and time series of actual default
 probabilities and credit spreads, together with a reasonable levered
 equity risk premium, which varies with macroeconomic conditions.  The Author 2009. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org, Oxford University Press.

Title: What Factors Drive Global Stock Returns? 
Abstract:
 Using monthly returns for over 27,000 stocks from 49 countries over a
 three-decade period, we show that a multifactor model that includes
 factor-mimicking portfolios based on momentum and cash flow-to-price
 captures significant time-series variation in global stock returns, and
 has lower pricing errors and fewer model rejections than the global CAPM
 or a popular model that uses size and book-to-market factors. We find
 reliable evidence that the global cash flow-to-price factor is related to
 a covariance risk model. In contrast, we reject the covariance risk model
 in favor of a characteristic model for size and book-to-market factors.  The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Volume: 10
Year: 1997
Abstract:
  We examine whether sharp debt increases through leveraged buyouts and
 recapitalizations interact with market structure to influence plant
 closing and investment decisions of recapitalizing firms and their rivals.
 We take into account the fact that recapitalizations and investment
 decisions are both endogenous and may be simultaneously influenced by the
 same exogenous events. Following their recapitalizations, firms in
 industries with high concentration are more likely to close plants and
 less likely to invest. Rival firms are less likely to close plants and
 more likely to invest when the market share of leveraged firms is higher.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Toward a Quantitative General Equilibrium Asset Pricing Model with Intangible Capital 
Abstract:
 We model investment options as intangible capital in a production economy
 in which younger vintages of assets in place have lower exposure to
 aggregate productivity risk. In equilibrium, physical capital requires a
 substantially higher expected return than intangible capital.
 Quantitatively, our model rationalizes a significant share of the observed
 difference in the average return of book-to-market-sorted portfolios
 (value premium). Our economy also produces (1) a high premium of the
 aggregate stock market over the risk-free interest rate, (2) a low and
 smooth risk-free interest rate, and (3) key features of the consumption
 and investment dynamics in the U.S. data.  The Author 2012. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: Misvaluing Innovation 
Abstract:
 We demonstrate that a firm's ability to innovate is predictable,
 persistent, and relatively simple to compute, and yet the stock market
 appears to ignore the implications of past successes when valuing future
 innovation. We show that two firms that invest the same in R&D can have
 quite divergent, but predictably divergent, future paths based on their
 past track records. A long-short portfolio strategy that takes advantage
 of the information in past track records earns abnormal returns of roughly
 11% annually. Importantly, these past track records also predict divergent
 future real outcomes in patents, patent citations, and new product
 innovations.  The Author 2013. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: Corporate Governance Propagation through Overlapping Directors 
Abstract:
 How are governance practices propagated across firms? This article
 proposes, and empirically verifies, that observed governance practices are
 partly the outcome of network effects among firms with common directors.
 While firms attempt to select directors whose other directorships are at
 firms with similar governance practices ("familiarity effect"), this
 matching of governance practices is imperfect because other factors also
 affect the director choice. This generates an "influence effect" as
 directors acquainted with different practices at other firms influence the
 firm's governance to move toward the practices of those other firms. These
 network effects cause governance practices to converge.  The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Issue: 1
Volume: 12
Year: 1999
Abstract:
  Portfolio turnpike theorems show that if preferences at large wealth
 levels are similar to power utility, then the investment strategy
 converges to the power utility strategy as the horizon increases. We state
 and prove two simple and general portfolio turnpike theorems. Unlike
 existing literature, our main result does not assume independence of
 returns and depends only on discounting of future cash flows. We also
 provide a critique of portfolio turnpike results, based on the
 observations that (1) the time required for convergence is often too large
 to be relevant, and (2) there is no convergence for consumption withdrawal
 problems.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Market Valuation and Acquisition Quality: Empirical Evidence 
Abstract:
 Existing research shows that significantly more acquisitions occur when
 stock markets are booming than when markets are depressed. Rhodes-Kropf
 and Viswanathan (2004) hypothesize that firm-specific and market-wide
 valuations lead to an excess of mergers, and these will be value
 destroying. This article investigates whether acquisitions occurring
 during booming markets are fundamentally different from those occurring
 during depressed markets. We find that acquirers buying during
 high-valuation markets have significantly higher announcement returns but
 lower long-run abnormal stock and operating performance than those buying
 during low-valuation markets. We investigate possible explanations for the
 long-run underperformance and conclude it is consistent with managerial
 herding.  The Author 2007. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title:   Ex-dividend Price Behavior of Common Stocks.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 711-41
Issue: 4
Volume: 7
Year: 1994
Abstract:
  This study examines common stock prices around ex-dividend dates. Such
 price data usually contain a mixture of observations--some with and some
 without arbitrageurs and/or dividend capturers active. Our theory predicts
 that such mixing will result in a nonlinear relation between percentage
 price drop and dividend yield--not the commonly assumed linear relation.
 This prediction and another important prediction of theory are supported
 empirically. In a variety of tests, marginal price drop is not
 significantly different from the dividend amount. Thus, over the last
 several decades, one-for-one marginal price drop has been an excellent
 (average) rule of thumb.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Intragroup Propping: Evidence from the Stock-Price Effects of Earnings Announcements by Korean Business Groups 
Abstract:
 Using earnings announcement events made by firms belonging to Korean
 chaebols, we examine propping within a chaebol. Consistent with the
 market's ex ante valuation of intragroup propping, we find that the
 announcement of increased (decreased) earnings by a chaebol-affiliated
 firm has a positive (negative) effect on the market value of other
 nonannouncing affiliates. The sensitivity of the change in the market
 value of nonannouncing affiliates to abnormal returns for the announcing
 firms is higher if the cash flow right of the announcing firm's
 controlling shareholder is higher. The sensitivity is also higher if the
 announcing firm is larger, performs well, and has a higher debt guarantee
 ratio.  The Author 2008. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title: Competing Theories of Financial Anomalies 
Abstract:
  We compare two competing theories of financial anomalies: "behavioral"
 theories built on investor irrationality, and "rational structural
 uncertainty" theories built on incomplete information about the structure
 of the economic environment. We find that although the theories relax
 opposite assumptions of the rational expectations ideal, their
 mathematical and predictive similarities make them difficult to
 distinguish. Even if irrationality generates financial anomalies, their
 disappearance still may hinge on rational learning--that is, on the
 ability of rational arbitrageurs and their investors to reject competing
 rational explanations for observed price patterns.   Copyright 2002, Oxford University Press.

Title: Inflation Expectations, Real Rates, and Risk Premia: Evidence from Inflation Swaps 
Abstract:
 We develop a model of nominal and real bond yield curves that has four
 stochastic drivers but seven factors: three factors primarily determine
 the cross-section of yields, whereas four volatility factors solely
 determine risk premia. The model is estimated using nominal Treasury
 yields, survey inflation forecasts, and inflation swap rates and has
 attractive empirical properties. Time-varying volatility is particularly
 apparent in short-term real rates and expected inflation. Also, we detail
 the different economic forces that drive short- and long-term real and
 inflation risk premia and provide evidence that Treasury
 inflation-protected securities were undervalued prior to 2004 and during
 the recent financial crisis.  The Author 2012. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Year: 1998
Abstract:
  We determine the minimum cost of superreplicating a nonnegative
 contingent claim when there are convex constraints on portfolio weights.
 We show that the optimal cost with constraints is equal to the price of a
 related claim without constraints. The related claim is a dominating
 claim, that is, a claim whose payoffs are increased in an appropriate way
 relative to the original claim. The results hold for a variety of options,
 including some path-dependent options. Constraints on the gamma of the
 replicating portfolio, constraints on portfolio amounts, and constraints
 on the number of shares are also considered.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: The Spline-GARCH Model for Low-Frequency Volatility and Its Global Macroeconomic Causes 
Abstract:
 Twenty-five years of volatility research has left the macroeconomic
 environment playing a minor role. This paper proposes modeling equity
 volatilities as a combination of macro- economic effects and time series
 dynamics. High-frequency return volatility is specified to be the product
 of a slow-moving component, represented by an exponential spline, and a
 unit GARCH. This slow-moving component is the low-frequency volatility,
 which in this model coincides with the unconditional volatility. This
 component is estimated for nearly 50 countries over various sample periods
 of daily data. Low-frequency volatility is then modeled as a function of
 macroeconomic and financial variables in an unbalanced panel with a
 variety of dependence structures. It is found to vary over time and across
 countries. The low-frequency component of volatility is greater when the
 macroeconomic factors of GDP, inflation, and short-term interest rates are
 more volatile or when inflation is high and output growth is low.
 Volatility is higher not only for emerging markets and markets with small
 numbers of listed companies and market capitalization relative to GDP, but
 also for large economies. The model allows long horizon forecasts of
 volatility to depend on macroeconomic developments, and delivers estimates
 of the volatility to be anticipated in a newly opened market.  The Author 2008. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title: Career Concerns and Resource Allocation in Conglomerates 
Abstract:
  We investigate resource allocation decisions in conglomerates when
 managers are motivated by career concerns. When divisional cash flows are
 differentially informative about managerial ability, we show that it is in
 the managers' interest to overallocate unobservable intangible resources
 to the more informative divisions. Anticipating this bias, it is optimal
 for the firm's owners to also overallocate observable capital to the more
 informative divisions. The model provides rationale for corporate
 socialism and corporate hedging. It also highlights a cost of segment
 reporting and tracking stocks, namely, that they allow managers to distort
 their perceived ability at the expense of investors.   Copyright 2004, Oxford University Press.

Title: Formal versus Informal Finance: Evidence from China 
Abstract:
 The fast growth of Chinese private sector firms is taken as evidence that
 informal finance can facilitate firm growth better than formal banks in
 developing countries. We examine firm financing patterns and growth using
 a database of twenty-four hundred Chinese firms. While a relatively small
 percentage of firms utilize bank loans, bank financing is associated with
 faster growth whereas informal financing is not. Controlling for
 selection, we find that firms with bank financing grow faster than similar
 firms without bank financing and that our results are not driven by bank
 corruption or the selection of firms that have accessed the formal
 financial system. Our findings question whether reputation and
 relationship-based financing are responsible for the performance of the
 fastest-growing firms in developing countries.   The Author 2010. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title: Can Equity Volatility Explain the Global Loan Pricing Puzzle? 
Abstract:
 This paper examines whether unobservable differences in firm volatility
 are responsible for the global loan pricing puzzle, which is the
 observation that corporate loan interest rates appear to be lower in
 Europe than in the United States. We analyze whether equity volatility, an
 error prone measure of firm volatility, can explain this difference in
 loan spreads. We show that using equity volatility in OLS regressions will
 result in biased and inconsistent estimates of the difference in U.S. and
 European loan spreads. We use instrumental variable methods to identify
 consistent estimates and find no difference in U.S. and European loan
 spreads.  The Author 2013. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: Assessing TARP 
Abstract:
 We study the government equity infusions into banks under the Capital
 Purchase Program (CPP) of the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). Strong
 banks opted out of CPP, and equity infusions were provided to banks that
 posed systemic risk and faced high financial distress costs but had strong
 asset quality. Concerns over executive compensation led banks to reject
 CPP infusions and exit the program. CPP infusions did not have meaningful
 certification effects, but the subsequent stress tests conducted for the

Title:   A Test of the Cox, Ingersoll, and Ross Model of the Term Structure.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 619-58
Issue: 3
Volume: 6
Year: 1993
Abstract:
  We test the theory of the term structure of indexed-bond prices due to
 Cox, Ingersoll, and Ross (CIR). The econometric method uses Hansen's
 generalized method of moments and exploits the probability distribution of
 the single-state variable in CIR's model, thus avoiding the use of
 aggregate consumption data. It enables us to estimate a continuous-time
 model based on discretely sampled data. The tests indicate that CIR's
 model for index bonds performs reasonably well when confronted with
 short-term Treasury-bill returns. The estimates indicate that term
 premiums are positive and that yield curves can take several shapes.
 However, the fitted model does poorly in explaining the serial correlation
 in real Treasury-bill returns.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Firm Characteristics and Stock Returns: The Role of Investment-Specific Shocks 
Abstract:
 Average return differences among firms sorted on valuation ratios, past
 investment, profitability, market beta, or idiosyncratic volatility are
 largely driven by differences in exposures of firms to the same systematic
 factor related to embodied technology shocks. Using a calibrated
 structural model, we show that these firm characteristics are correlated
 with the ratio of growth opportunities to firm value, which affects firms'
 exposures to capital-embodied productivity shocks and risk premia. We thus
 provide a unified explanation for several apparent anomalies in the
 cross-section of stock returns--namely, predictability of returns by these
 firm characteristics and return comovement among firms with similar
 characteristics.  The Author 2013. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: Staying, Dropping, or Switching: The Impacts of Bank Mergers on Small Firms 
Abstract:
 Assessing the impacts of bank mergers on small firms requires separating
 borrowers with single versus multiple banking relationships and
 distinguishing the three alternatives of "staying," "dropping," and
 "switching" of relationships. Single-relationship borrowers who "switch"
 to another bank following a merger will be less harmed than those whose
 relationship is "dropped" and not replaced. Using Belgian data, we find
 that single-relationship borrowers of target banks are more likely than
 other borrowers to be dropped. We track postmerger performance and show
 that many dropped target-bank borrowers are harmed by the merger.
 Multiple-relationship borrowers are less harmed, as they can better hedge
 against relationship discontinuations.  The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title: The Impact of Hedge Fund Activism on the Target Firm's Existing Bondholders 
Abstract:
 In contrast to previous studies documenting positive abnormal returns to
 target shareholders, we find that hedge fund activism significantly
 reduces bondholders' wealth. The average excess bond return is  - 3.9%
 around the initial 13D filing, and is an additional  - 4.5% over the
 remaining year. Excess bond returns are related inversely to subsequent
 changes in cash and assets (loss of collateral effects) and directly to
 changes in total debt. Confrontational campaigns and the acquisition of at
 least one seat on the target's board elicit more negative bond returns. We
 also find an expropriation of wealth from the bondholder to the
 shareholder.  The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: Bank Bailouts and Moral Hazard: Evidence from Germany 
Abstract:
 We use a structural econometric model to provide empirical evidence that
 safety nets in the banking industry lead to additional risk taking. To
 identify the moral hazard effect of bailout expectations on bank risk, we
 exploit the fact that regional political factors explain bank bailouts but
 not bank risk. The sample includes all observed capital preservation
 measures and distressed exits in the German banking industry during
 1995--2006. A change of bailout expectations by two standard deviations
 increases the probability of official distress from 6.6% to 9.4%, which is
 economically significant.  The Author 2012. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: Can VCs Time the Market? An Analysis of Exit Choice for Venture-backed Firms 
Abstract:
 We use a sample of 8,163 venture-backed companies over three decades to
 test the competing hypotheses that levels and relative shares of IPO
 (initial public offering) and M&A (mergers and acquisitions) exits are
 affected by market timing, versus pseudo-market timing that reflects
 market conditions. We find evidence of pseudo-market timing.
 Venture-backed issuers react to market or sector runups but do not predict
 downturns. We find no evidence that firm-specific market timing
 contributes to IPO or M&A waves. We also find that acquirers turn to
 acquisition when other opportunities are unattractive, and that the market
 may be slow to recognize that such opportunities are declining.  The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title:   Value-at-Risk-Based Risk Management: Optimal Policies and Asset Prices.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 371-405
Issue: 2
Volume: 14
Year: 2001
Abstract:
  This article analyzes optimal, dynamic portfolio and wealth/consumption
 policies of utility maximizing investors who must also manage market-risk
 exposure using Value-at-Risk (VaR). We find that VaR risk managers often
 optimally choose a larger exposure to risky assets than non-risk managers
 and consequently incur larger losses when losses occur. We suggest an
 alternative risk-management model, based on the expectation of a loss, to
 remedy the shortcomings of VaR. A general-equilibrium analysis reveals
 that the presence of VaR risk managers amplifies the stock-market
 volatility at times of down markets and attenuates the volatility at times
 of up markets.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: The Effect of Liquidity on Governance 
Abstract:
 This paper demonstrates a positive effect of stock liquidity on
 blockholder governance. Liquidity increases the likelihood of block
 formation. Conditional upon acquiring a stake, liquidity reduces the
 likelihood that the blockholder governs through voice (intervention)--as
 shown by the lower propensity for active investment (filing Schedule 13D)
 than passive investment (filing Schedule 13G). The lower frequency of
 activism does not reflect the abandonment of governance, but governance
 through the alternative channel of exit (selling one's shares): A 13G
 filing leads to positive announcement returns and improvements in
 operating performance, especially in liquid firms. Moreover, taking into
 account the increase in block formation, liquidity has an unconditional
 positive effect on voice as well as exit. We use decimalization as an
 exogenous shock to liquidity to identify causal effects.  The Author 2013. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: A Shrinkage Approach to Model Uncertainty and Asset Allocation 
Abstract:
  This article takes a shrinkage approach to examine the empirical
 implications of aversion to model uncertainty. The shrinkage approach
 explicitly shows how predictive distributions incorporate data and prior
 beliefs. It enables us to solve the optimal portfolios for
 uncertainty-averse investors. Aversion to uncertainty about the capital
 asset pricing model leads investors to hold a portfolio that is not
 mean-variance efficient for any predictive distribution. However,
 mean-variance efficient portfolios corresponding to extremely strong
 beliefs in the Fama--French model are approximately optimal for
 uncertainty-averse investors. The empirical Bayes approach does not result
 in optimal portfolios for investors who are averse to model uncertainty.   Copyright 2005, Oxford University Press.

Title: Equilibrium Investment Strategies and Output Price Behavior: A Real-Options Approach 
Abstract:
  The effects of competitive interactions on investment decisions and on
 the dynamics of the price of a nonstorable commodity are studied in a
 model of incremental investment with time to build and operating
 flexibility. I find that an increase in uncertainty may encourage firms to
 increase their capacity. Furthermore, I show that it may be optimal to
 invest in additional capacity during periods in which part of the
 operational capacity is not being utilized. The impact of competition on
 the properties of the endogenous output price is dramatic. For example, I
 find that price volatility may be increasing in the number of competitors
 in the industry.   Copyright 2003, Oxford University Press.

Title: R&D and the Incentives from Merger and Acquisition Activity 
Abstract:
 We provide a model and empirical tests showing how an active acquisition
 market affects firm incentives to innovate and conduct R&D. Our model
 shows that small firms optimally may decide to innovate more when they can
 sell out to larger firms. Large firms may find it disadvantageous to
 engage in an "R&D race" with small firms, as they can obtain access to
 innovation through acquisition. Our model and evidence also show that the
 R&D responsiveness of firms increases with demand, competition, and
 industry merger and acquisition activity. All of these effects are
 stronger for smaller firms than for larger firms.  The Author 2012. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: Why Do (Some) Households Trade So Much? 
Abstract:
 When agents can learn about their abilities as active investors, they
 rationally "trade to learn" even if they expect to lose from active
 investing. The model used to develop this insight draws conclusions that
 are consistent with empirical study of household trading behavior:
 Households' portfolios underperform passive investments; their trading
 intensity depends on past performance; and they begin by trading small
 sums of money. Using household data from Finland, the article estimates a
 structural model of learning and trading. The estimated model shows that
 investors trade to learn even if they are pessimistic about their
 abilities as traders. It also demonstrates that realized returns are
 significantly downward-biased measures of investors' true abilities.  The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: Financial Constraints, Asset Tangibility, and Corporate Investment 
Abstract:
 Pledgeable assets support more borrowing, which allows for further
 investment in pledgeable assets. We use this credit multiplier to identify
 the impact of financing frictions on corporate investment. The multiplier
 suggests that investment-cash flow sensitivities should be increasing in
 the tangibility of firms' assets (a proxy for pledgeability), but only if
 firms are financially constrained. Our empirical results confirm this
 theoretical prediction. Our approach is not subject to the Kaplan and
 Zingales (1997) critique, and sidesteps problems stemming from
 unobservable variation in investment opportunities. Thus, our results
 strongly suggest that financing frictions affect investment decisions.  , Oxford University Press.

Title: Insider Trades and Private Information: The Special Case of Delayed-Disclosure Trades 
Abstract:
 In certain circumstances, insider trades such as private transactions
 between executives and their firms could be disclosed after the end of the
 firm's fiscal year, on a Form-5 filing. We find that insider sales
 disclosed in such a delayed manner for large firms are predictive of
 negative future returns (&#x2212;6 to &#x2212;8 percent), as well as lower
 future annual earnings relative to analyst forecasts. These results stand
 in contrast to existing findings on the uninformativeness of quickly
 disclosed open-market insider sales. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act curtailed the
 use of Form 5 under the presumption that managers used this vehicle
 opportunistically. Our systematic evidence supports this presumption.  , Oxford University Press.

Title:   Bondholder Losses in Leveraged Buyouts.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies

Issue: 4
Volume: 6
Year: 1993
Abstract:
  Announcements of successful leveraged buyouts (LBOs) during January 1985
 to April 1989 caused a significantly negative return on outstanding
 publicly traded nonconvertible bonds. Yet the average risk-adjusted debt
 holder losses are less than 7 percent of the average risk-adjusted equity
 holder gains. Bond losses are related to the pre-LBO rating, but only
 weakly to equity holder gains. We demonstrate that trader-quoted data from
 a major investment bank offers conclusions about the effects of LBOs on
 debt holders different from those drawn from commonly used matrix and
 exchange-based data (such as Standard & Poor's Bond Guide data). This has
 important implications for event studies involving debt instruments.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Control of Corporate Decisions: Shareholders vs. Management 
Abstract:
 This article addresses the issue of whether shareholders would be better
 off with enhanced control over corporate decisions. The issue has been
 hotly debated in the recent literature. Our main contribution is to use
 formal modeling to uncover some factors overlooked in these arguments. For
 example, we show that claims that shareholder control would reduce value
 because shareholders lack sufficient information to make important
 decisions or because they have a non-value-maximizing agenda are flawed.
 We also show, however, that even if shareholders seek to maximize firm
 value and can delegate decisions to management, shareholders should not
 control all major decisions.  The Author 2010. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title: Return Distributions and Improved Tests of Asset Pricing Models 
Abstract:
  We compare and contrast some existing ordinary least squares (OLS)- and
 generalized method of moments (GMM)-based tests of asset pricing models
 with a new more general test. This new test is valid under the assumption
 that returns are elliptically distributed, a necessary and sufficient
 assumption of the linear capital asset pricing model (CAPM). This new test
 fails to reject the CAPM on a dataset of stocks sorted by market
 valuations, whereas similar tests constructed from OLS and GMM estimation
 methods reject the linear CAPM. We also find that outliers reduce the
 OLS-estimated mispricing of the linear CAPM on monthly returns sorted by
 previous performance, that is, momentum. Monte Carlo evidence supports
 superior size and power properties of the new test relative to OLS- and
 GMM-based tests.   Copyright 2003, Oxford University Press.

Title: A Financing-Based Misvaluation Factor and the Cross-Section of Expected Returns 
Abstract:
 Behavioral theories suggest that investor misperceptions and market
 mispricing will be correlated across firms. We use equity and debt
 financing to identify common misvaluation across firms. A zero-investment
 portfolio (UMO, undervalued minus overvalued) built from repurchase and
 issue firms captures comovement in returns beyond that in some standard
 multifactor models, and substantially improves the Sharpe ratio of the
 tangency portfolio. Loadings on UMO incrementally predict the
 cross-section of returns on both portfolios and individual stocks, even
 among firms not recently involved in external financing activities.
 Further evidence suggests that UMO loadings proxy for the common component
 of a stock's misvaluation.  The Author 2010. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title: An Equilibrium Model of Investment Under Uncertainty 
Abstract:
 We analyze the optimal investment decisions of heterogeneous firms in a
 competitive, uncertain environment, characterizing firms' investment
 strategies explicitly and deriving closed-form solutions for firm value.
 Real option premia remain significant, and are even unmitigated relative
 to the standard partial-equilibrium model when both are calibrated to
 observables. Firms consequently delay investment, choosing not to
 undertake some positive NPV projects. We compare competitive behavior to
 that of a strategic monopolist, and quantify the welfare loss associated
 with monopoly. Finally, the model predicts business cycle dependence on
 firm returns, with returns negatively skewed during industry expansions
 but positively skewed in industry recessions.  , Oxford University Press.

Title:   Jumps and Stochastic Volatility: Exchange Rate Processes Implicit in Deutsche Mark Options.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 69-107
Issue: 1
Volume: 9
Year: 1996
Abstract:
  An efficient method is developed for pricing American options on
 stochastic volatility/jump-diffusion processes under systematic jump and
 volatility risk. The parameters implicit in deutsche mark (DM) options of
 the model and various submodels are estimated over the period 1984 to 1991
 via nonlinear generalized least squares, and are tested for consistency
 with $/DM futures prices and the implicit volatility sample path. The
 stochastic volatility submodel cannot explain the "volatility smile"
 evidence of implicit excess kurtosis, except under parameters implausible
 given the time series properties of implicit volatilities.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title:   Why Do Security Prices Change? A Transaction-Level Analysis of NYSE Stocks.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 1035-64
Issue: 4
Volume: 10
Year: 1997
Abstract:
  This article develops and tests a structural model of intraday price
 formation that embodies public information shocks and microstructure
 effects. We use the model to analyze intraday patterns in bid-ask spreads,
 price volatility, transaction costs, and return and quote
 autocorrelations, and to construct metrics for price discovery and
 effective trading costs. Information asymmetry and uncertainty over
 fundamentals decrease over the day, although transaction costs increase.
 The results help explain the U-shaped pattern in intraday bid-ask spreads
 and volatility, and are also consistent with the intraday decline in the
 variance of ask price changes.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Online Investors: Do the Slow Die First? 
Abstract:
  We analyze 1,607 investors who switched from phone-based to online
 trading during the 1990s. Those who switch to online trading perform well
 prior to going online, beating the market by more than 2% annually. After
 going online, they trade more actively, more speculatively, and less
 profitably than before--lagging the market by more than 3% annually.
 Reductions in market frictions (lower trading costs, improved execution
 speed, and greater ease of access) do not explain these findings.
 Overconfidence--augmented by self-attribution bias and the illusions of
 knowledge and control--can explain the increase in trading and reduction
 in performance of online investors.   Copyright 2002, Oxford University Press.

Title:   Shareholder-Value Maximization and Product-Market Competition.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 367-91
Issue: 3
Volume: 3
Year: 1990
Abstract:
  We investigate product-market competition when managers maximize
 shareholders value rather than their expected discounted value of profits.
 If shareholders are imperfectly informed about future profitability,
 shareholder-value maximization can lead to either more or less aggressive
 product-market strategies. Lower rivals' profits lead investors to believe
 that the firm's costs are low relative to those of its rivals and that the
 industry's prospects are poor. If the former (latter) inference dominates,
 each firm tries to lower (raise) its rivals' profits to increase its own
 stock price. We also consider implications for corporate financial
 structure.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Small Trades and the Cross-Section of Stock Returns 
Abstract:
 This paper uses volume arising from small trades to analyze the
 relationship between retail investor trading behavior and the
 cross-section of future stock returns. The central finding is that stocks
 with intense sell-initiated small-trade volume, measured over the past
 several months, outperform stocks with intense buy-initiated small-trade
 volume. This return difference accrues from the first month after the
 portfolio formation up to two years later. Among small- and medium-sized
 firms, the return difference continues in the third year. The results
 suggest that stocks favored by retail investors subsequently experience
 prolonged underperformance relative to stocks out of favor with retail
 investors.  The Author 2008. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title: Do Retail Trades Move Markets? 
Abstract:
 We study the trading of individual investors using transaction data and
 identifying buyer- or seller-initiated trades. We document four results:
 (1) Small trade order imbalance correlates well with order imbalance based
 on trades from retail brokers. (2) Individual investors herd. (3) When
 measured annually, small trade order imbalance forecasts future returns;
 stocks heavily bought underperform stocks heavily sold by 4.4 percentage
 points the following year. (4) Over a weekly horizon, small trade order
 imbalance reliably predicts returns, but in the opposite direction; stocks
 heavily bought one week earn strong returns the subsequent week, while
 stocks heavily sold earn poor returns.  The Author 2008. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org, Oxford University Press.

Title: Real Options Signaling Games with Applications to Corporate Finance 
Abstract:
 We study games in which the decision to exercise an option is a signal of
 private information to outsiders, whose beliefs affect the utility of the
 decision-maker. Signaling incentives distort the timing of exercise, and
 the direction of distortion depends on whether the decision-maker's
 utility increases or decreases in outsiders' belief about the payoff from
 exercise. In the former case, signaling incentives erode the value of the
 option to wait and speed up option exercise, while in the latter case
 option exercise is delayed. We demonstrate the model's implications
 through four corporate finance settings: investment under managerial
 myopia, venture capital grandstanding, investment under cash flow
 diversion, and product market competition.  The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: An Institutional Theory of Momentum and Reversal 
Abstract:
 We propose a theory of momentum and reversal based on flows between
 investment funds. Flows are triggered by changes in fund managers'
 efficiency, which investors either observe directly or infer from past
 performance. Momentum arises if flows exhibit inertia, and because
 rational prices underreact to expected future flows. Reversal arises
 because flows push prices away from fundamental values. Besides momentum
 and reversal, flows generate comovement, lead-lag effects, and
 amplification, with these being larger for high idiosyncratic risk assets.
 A calibration of our model using evidence on mutual fund returns and flows
 generates sizeable Sharpe ratios for momentum and value strategies.  The Author 2013. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: Shareholders at the Gate? Institutional Investors and Cross-Border Mergers and Acquisitions 
Abstract:
 We study the role of institutional investors in cross-border mergers and
 acquisitions (M&As). We find that foreign institutional ownership is
 positively associated with the intensity of cross-border M&A activity
 worldwide. Foreign institutional ownership increases the probability that
 a merger deal is cross-border, successful, and the bidder takes full
 control of the target firm. This relation is stronger in countries with
 weaker legal institutions and in less developed markets, suggesting some
 substitutability between local governance and foreign institutional
 investors. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that foreign
 institutional investors act as facilitators in the international market
 for corporate control; they build bridges between firms and reduce
 transaction costs and information asymmetry between bidder and target. We
 conclude that cross-border portfolio investments of institutional money
 managers and cross-border M&As are complements in promoting financial
 integration worldwide.  The Author 2009. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org, Oxford University Press.

Title: Evidence on the Dark Side of Internal Capital Markets 
Abstract:
 This article documents differences between the Q-sensitivity of investment
 of stand-alone firms and unrelated segments of conglomerate firms.
 Unrelated segments exhibit lower Q-sensitivity of investment than
 stand-alone firms. This fact is driven by unrelated segments of
 conglomerate firms that tend to invest less than stand-alone firms in
 high-Q industries. This finding is robust to matching on industry, year,
 size, age, and profitability. The differences are more pronounced in
 conglomerates in which top management has small ownership stakes,
 suggesting that agency problems explain the investment behavior of
 conglomerates.  The Author 2009. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org, Oxford University Press.

Title: Institutional Investors and the Informational Efficiency of Prices 
Abstract:
 Using a broad panel of NYSE-listed stocks between 1983 and 2004, we study
 the relation between institutional shareholdings and the relative
 informational efficiency of prices, measured as deviations from a random
 walk. Stocks with greater institutional ownership are priced more
 efficiently, and we show that variation in liquidity does not drive this
 result. One mechanism through which prices become more efficient is
 institutional trading activity, even when institutions trade passively.
 But efficiency is also directly related to institutional holdings, even
 after controlling for institutional trading, analyst coverage, short
 selling, variation in liquidity, and firm characteristics.  The Author 2009. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title:   Return Seasonality in Stocks and Their Underlying Assets: Tax-Loss Selling versus Information Explanations.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 255-80
Issue: 2
Volume: 3
Year: 1990
Abstract:
  Results of tests contrasting tax-loss selling with intertemporal
 information variation as explanations of the January seasonal in stock
 returns are reported. Closed-end fund shares display the typical
 size-related January seasonal while their net asset values do not.
 Interpreting the net asset value return as a proxy for information about
 underlying assets, this result indicates information variation is not a
 necessary condition for the January effect in stocks. The share returns at
 the turn of the year are negatively related to their mean preceding year
 returns and positively related to the standard deviations of their
 preceding year returns. These results are consistent with tax-loss
 selling.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Volume: 9
Year: 1996
Abstract:
  The dynamic nonmyopic portfolio behavior of an investor who trades a
 risk-free and risky asset is derived for all HARA utility functions and a
 stochastic risk premium. Conditions are found for when the investor holds
 more or less than the myopic amount of the risky asset; hedges against or
 speculates the risk-premium uncertainty; is long or short on the risky
 asset; and holds more or less of the risky asset at longer horizons. The
 analytical solutions derived take multiple mathematical forms and include
 extreme cases in which investors with long but finite horizons can attain
 nirvana.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Venture Capitalists on Boards of Mature Public Firms 
Abstract:
 Venture capitalists (VCs) often serve on the board of mature public firms
 long after their initial public offering (IPO), even for companies that
 were not VC-backed at the IPO. Board appointments of VC directors are
 followed by increases in research and development intensity, innovation
 output, and greater deal activity with other VC-backed firms. VC director
 appointments are associated with positive announcement returns and are
 followed by an improvement in operating performance. Firms experience
 higher announcement returns from acquisitions of VC-backed targets
 following the appointment of a VC director to the board. Hence, in
 addition to providing finance, monitoring and advice for small private
 firms, VCs play a significant role in mature public firms and have a
 broader influence in promoting innovation than has been established in the
 literature.  The Author 2012. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: Hedge Fund Stock Trading in the Financial Crisis of 2007--2009 
Abstract:
 Hedge funds significantly reduced their equity holdings during the recent
 financial crisis. In 2008:Q3----Q4, hedge funds sold about 29% of their
 aggregate portfolio. Redemptions and margin calls were the primary drivers
 of selloffs. Consistent with forced deleveraging, the selloffs took place
 in volatile and liquid stocks. In comparison, redemptions and stock sales
 for mutual funds were not as severe. We show that hedge fund investors
 withdraw capital three times as intensely as mutual fund investors do in
 response to poor returns. We relate this stronger sensitivity to losses to
 share liquidity restrictions and institutional ownership in hedge funds.  The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: The Information Content of IPO Prospectuses 
Abstract:
 Using word content analysis, we decompose information in the initial
 public offering prospectus into its standard and informative components.
 Greater informative content, as a proxy for premarket due diligence,
 results in more accurate offer prices and less underpricing, because it
 decreases the issuing firm's reliance on bookbuilding to price the issue.
 The opposite is true for standard content. Greater content from high
 reputation underwriters and issuing firm managers, through Management's
 Discussion and Analysis, contribute to the informativeness of the
 prospectus. Our results suggest that premarket due diligence and
 disclosure by underwriters and issuers can serve as a substitute for
 costly bookbuilding.   The Author 2010. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Abstract:
  Implied volatility is widely believed to be informationally superior to
 historical volatility, because it is the "markets" forecast of future
 volatility. But for S&P 100 index options, the most actively traded
 contract in the United States, we find implied volatility. In aggregate
 and across subsamples separated by maturity and strike price, implied
 volatility has virtually no correlation with future volatility, and it
 does not incorporate the information contained in recent observed
 volatility.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: A Model of Portfolio Delegation and Strategic Trading 
Abstract:
 This article endogenizes information acquisition and portfolio delegation
 in a one-period strategic trading model. We find that, when the informed
 portfolio manager is relatively risk tolerant (averse), price
 informativeness increases (decreases) with the amount of noise trading.
 When noise trading is endogenized, the linear equilibrium in the
 traditional literature breaks down under a wide range of parameter values.
 In contrast, a linear equilibrium always exists in our model. In a
 conventional portfolio delegation model under a competitive partial
 equilibrium, the manager's effort of acquiring information is independent
 of a linear incentive contract. In our strategic trading model, however, a
 higher-powered linear contract induces the manager to exert more effort
 for information acquisition.  The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: Recourse and Residential Mortgage Default: Evidence from US States<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1">1 
Abstract:
 We quantify the effect of recourse on default and find that recourse
 affects default by lowering the borrower's sensitivity to negative equity.
 At the mean value of the default option for defaulted loans, borrowers are
 30% more likely to default in non-recourse states. Furthermore, for homes
 appraised at $500,000 to $750,000, borrowers are twice as likely to
 default in non-recourse states. We also find that defaults are more likely
 to occur through a lender-friendly procedure, such as a deed in lieu, in
 states that allow deficiency judgments. We find no evidence that mortgage
 interest rates are lower in recourse states.  The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: Island Goes Dark: Transparency, Fragmentation, and Regulation 
Abstract:
  Responding to a September 2002 regulatory enforcement, the Island
 electronic communications network stopped displaying its limit order book
 in the three most active exchange-traded funds (ETFs) where it was the
 dominant venue. Island's share of trading activity and price discovery
 fell, fragmenting the market. ETF prices adjust more slowly when Island
 goes dark, and there is substantial price discovery movement from ETFs to
 the futures market. Trading costs increase on Island and decrease off
 Island, with higher trading costs overall. When Island later redisplays
 its orders, market quality improves, with transparency and the reduction
 in fragmentation both playing important roles.   Copyright 2005, Oxford University Press.

Title: Combining Banking with Private Equity Investing 
Abstract:
 Bank-affiliated private equity groups account for 30% of all private
 equity investments. Their market share is highest during peaks of the
 private equity market, when the parent banks arrange more debt financing
 for in-house transactions yet have the lowest exposure to debt. Using
 financing terms and ex post performance, we show overall that banks do not
 make superior equity investments to those of stand-alone private equity
 groups. Instead, they appear to expand their private equity engagement to
 take advantage of the credit market booms, while capturing private
 benefits from cross-selling of other banking services.  The Author 2013. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title:   Time-Varying Risk and Return in the Bond Market: A Test of a New Equilibrium Pricing Model.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 631-42
Issue: 3
Volume: 12
Year: 1999
Abstract:
  This article uses bond market data to empirically test the asset pricing
 model of Kazemi (1992). According to this model the rate of return on a
 long-term, pure-discount, default-free bond will be perfectly correlated
 with changes in the marginal utility of the representative investor. The
 covariability between financial asset returns and returns on such a bond
 can therefore serve as a measure of the riskiness of assets. The aim of
 this study is to determine whether the model can explain cross-sectional
 differences in the monthly returns of bonds with different maturity dates.
 We estimate and test the restrictions imposed by the model on returns of
 default-free bonds, while allowing the conditional distribution of bond
 returns to be time varying. The model is rejected during the full sample
 period (1973-1995) and the subperiod (1973-1980) when the Federal
 Reserve's focus is on interest rates, while the model is not rejected
 during the subperiod (1981-1995) when the Federal Reserve's focus is on
 money supply.	 Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title:   Intertemporal Arbitrage Pricing Theory.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 105-22
Issue: 1
Volume: 5
Year: 1992
Abstract:
  It is shown that the arbitrage pricing theory holds in each infinitesimal
 period of a continuous trading model under the assumption that dividend
 payoffs are functionals of factor and idiosyncratic uncertainty. This
 generalizes the one-period model's result that the arbitrage pricing
 theory holds under the assumption that price changes in a given period
 satisfy a factor structure. Since instantaneous returns in a multiperiod
 model are endogenously determined, the theory is derived under assumptions
 that may be viewed as restricting more primitive characteristics of the
 economy than the assumptions made for the one-period model.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title:   Mean Reversion in Short-Horizon Expected Returns.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 225-40
Issue: 2
Volume: 2
Year: 1989
Abstract:
  This article develops and estimates a simple model for monthly expected
 stock returns that relies on the rapidly decaying structure of
 shorter-horizon (weekly) expected returns. The most striking aspect of our
 findings is that the rapid mean reversion in short-horizon expected
 returns implies much greater variation through time in monthly expected
 returns than has been documented in earlier studies. For instance, during
 the 1962 to 1985 period, over 25 percent of the return variance of small
 firms can be explained by time variation in expected returns.	 Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: A Theory of Debt Market Illiquidity and Leverage Cyclicality 
Abstract:
 We analyze determinants of secondary debt market liquidity, identifying
 conditions under which a large investor can profitably buy stakes from
 small bondholders and offer unilateral debt relief to a distressed firm.
 We show that endogenous trading by small bondholders may result in
 multiple equilibria. Some equilibria entail vanishing liquidity and sharp
 increases in yields absent changing fundamentals. In turn, anticipation of
 illiquid equilibria induces firms to eschew public debt financing, since
 such equilibria create higher bankruptcy costs and debt illiquidity
 discounts. The model thus offers a rational micro-foundation for stylized
 facts commonly attributed to investor sentiment and CFO market timing.
 Finally, we show that the vulnerability of debt markets to multiple
 equilibria is highest during downturns, when small bondholders face severe
 adverse selection.  The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Volume: 9
Year: 1996
Abstract:
  We use futures transaction data to investigate cross-sectional
 relationships between market-maker inventory positions and trade activity.
 The investigation documents strongly that traders control inventory
 throughout the trading day. Despite this evidence of inventory management,
 typical inventory control models are contradicted by our data. These
 inventory models predict that market-maker reservation prices are
 negatively influenced by inventory. Surprisingly, our evidence shows, as a
 strong and consistent empirical regularity, that correlations between
 inventory and reservation prices are positive. We interpret the evidence
 as consistent with active position taking by futures market floor traders.

Abstract:
  The short-run interdependence of prices and price volatility across three
 major international stock markets is studied. Daily opening and closing
 prices of major stock indexes for the Tokyo, London, and New York stock
 markets are examined. The analysis utilizes the autoregressive
 conditionally heteroskedastic (ARCH) family of statistical models to
 explore these pricing relationships. Evidence of price volatility
 spillovers from New York to Tokyo, London to Tokyo, and New York to London
 is observed, but no price volatility spillover effects in other directions
 are found for the pre-October 1987 period.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title:   Underestimation of Portfolio Insurance and the Crash of October 1987.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 35-63
Issue: 1
Volume: 5
Year: 1992
Abstract:
  The authors examine market crashes in the multiperiod framework of
 Glosten and Milgrom (1985). Their analysis shows that if the market's
 prior beliefs underestimate the extent of dynamic hedging strategies such
 as portfolio insurance, then the price will be greater than that which
 would be implied by fundamentals if the extent of portfolio insurance were
 known with certainty. Over time, the market learns of the amount of
 portfolio insurance, and consequently reevaluates the previous inferences
 drawn from purchases that were erroneously regarded as based on favorable
 information. The result is that the price falls when the amount of
 portfolio insurance is revealed.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title:   Estimating the Effects of Information Surprises and Trading on Stock Returns Using a Mixed Jump-Diffusion Model.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 451-73
Issue: 3
Volume: 7
Year: 1994
Abstract:
  I present a methodology that uses the mixed jump-diffusion model for
 stock returns to estimate the separate effects of information surprises
 and strategic trading around corporate events. Using simulation
 techniques, I show that for events with multiple announcements spread over
 a long time, the estimators derived from the mixed jump-diffusion model
 are more powerful compared to the traditional cumulative abnormal return
 estimators. The new methodology is used to study the separate effects of
 information surprises and strategic trading associated with blockholdings
 and subsequent targeted repurchases. I find that for more than 93 percent
 of the firms in our sample the mixed jump-diffusion model is statistically
 superior to the pure diffusion model in describing stock returns. More
 important, I find a statistically significant negative effect due to
 trading, while the average effect around announcements is statistically
 insignificant. In contrast, the standard cumulative abnormal return is not
 statistically different from zero.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: A GARCH Option Pricing Model with Filtered Historical Simulation 
Abstract:
 We propose a new method for pricing options based on GARCH models with
 filtered historical innovations. In an incomplete market framework, we
 allow for different distributions of historical and pricing return
 dynamics, which enhances the model's flexibility to fit market option
 prices. An extensive empirical analysis based on S&P 500 index options
 shows that our model outperforms other competing GARCH pricing models and
 ad hoc Black-Scholes models. We show that the flexible change of measure,
 the asymmetric GARCH volatility, and the nonparametric innovation
 distribution induce the accurate pricing performance of our model. Using a
 nonparametric approach, we obtain decreasing state-price densities per
 unit probability as suggested by economic theory and corroborating our
 GARCH pricing model. Implied volatility smiles appear to be explained by
 asymmetric volatility and negative skewness of filtered historical
 innovations.  The Author 2008. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Pages: 279-319
Issue: 2
Volume: 7
Year: 1994
Abstract:
  We test the empirical implications of several models of IPO underpricing.
 Consistent with the winner's-curse hypothesis, we show that in markets
 where investors know a priori that they do not have to compete with
 informed investors, IPOs are not underpriced. We also show that IPOs
 underwritten by reputable investment banks experience significantly less
 underpricing and perform significantly better in the long run. We do not
 find empirical support for the signaling models that try to explain why
 firms underprice. In fact, we find that (1) firms that underprice more
 return to the reissue market less frequently, and for lesser amounts, than
 firms that underprice less, and (2) firms that underprice less experience
 higher earnings and pay higher dividends, contrary to the model's
 predictions.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: The Investor Recognition Hypothesis in a Dynamic General Equilibrium: Theory and Evidence 
Abstract:
  This article analyzes a dynamic general equilibrium under a
 generalization of Merton's (1987) investor recognition hypothesis. A class
 of informationally constrained investors is assumed to implement only a
 particular trading strategy. The model implies that, all else being equal,
 a risk premium on a less visible stock need not be higher than that on a
 more visible stock with a lower volatility--contrary to results derived in
 a static mean-variance setting. A consumption-based capital asset pricing
 model (CAPM) augmented by the generalized investor recognition hypothesis
 emerges as a viable contender for explaining the cross-sectional variation
 in unconditional expected equity returns.   Copyright 2002, Oxford University Press.

Title: Expanding Credit Access: Using Randomized Supply Decisions to Estimate the Impacts 
Abstract:
 Expanding access to commercial credit is a key ingredient of financial
 development strategies. There is less consensus on whether expanding
 access to consumer credit helps borrowers, particularly when loans are
 extended at high interest rates. Popular skepticism about "unproductive,"
 "usurious" lending is fueled by research highlighting behavioral biases
 that may induce overborrowing. We estimate the impacts of expanding access
 to consumer credit at a 200% annual percentage rate (APR) using a field
 experiment and follow-up data collection. The randomly assigned marginal
 loans produced significant net benefits for borrowers across a wide range
 of outcomes. There is also some evidence that the loans were profitable.  The Author 2009. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org, Oxford University Press.

Title: Snow and Leverage 
Abstract:
 Based on a sample of highly leveraged Austrian ski hotels undergoing debt
 restructurings, we show that reducing a debt overhang leads to a
 significant improvement in operating performance. Changes in leverage in
 the debt restructurings are instrumented with Unexpected Snow, which
 captures the extent to which a ski hotel experienced unusually good or bad
 snow conditions prior to the debt restructuring. Unexpected Snow provides
 lending banks with the counterfactual of what would have been the ski
 hotel's operating performance in the absence of strategic default,
 allowing them to distinguish between ski hotels that are in distress due
 to negative demand shocks ("liquidity defaulters") and those that are in
 distress due to debt overhang ("strategic defaulters").  The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: Prospect Theory and Mean-Variance Analysis 
Abstract:
  The experimental results of prospect theory (PT) reveal suggest that
 investors make decisions based on change of wealth rather than total
 wealth, that preferences are S-shaped with a risk-seeking segment, and
 that probabilities are subjectively distorted. This article shows that
 while PT's findings are in sharp contradiction to the foundations of
 mean-variance (MV) analysis, counterintuitively, when diversification
 between assets is allowed, the MV and PT-efficient sets almost coincide.
 Thus one can employ the MV optimization algorithm to construct
 PT-efficient portfolios.   Copyright 2004, Oxford University Press.

Title: Do IPOs Affect the Prices of Other Stocks? Evidence from Emerging Markets 
Abstract:
 We show that the introduction of a large asset permanently affects the
 prices of existing assets in a market. Using data from 254 initial public
 offerings (IPOs) in 22 emerging markets, we find that portfolios that
 covary highly with the IPO experience a decline in prices relative to
 other portfolios during the month of the issue. The effects are stronger
 when the IPO is issued in a market that is less integrated internationally
 and when the IPO is bigger. This evidence is consistent with the idea that
 shocks to asset supply have a significant effect on asset prices.  The Author 2008. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org, Oxford University Press.

Title: Regime Shifts in a Dynamic Term Structure Model of U.S. Treasury Bond Yields 
Abstract:
 This article develops and empirically implements an arbitrage-free,
 dynamic term structure model with 'priced' factor and regime-shift risks.
 The risk factors are assumed to follow a discrete-time Gaussian process,
 and regime shifts are governed by a discrete-time Markov process with
 state-dependent transition probabilities. This model gives closed-form
 solutions for zero-coupon bond prices, an analytic representation of the
 likelihood function for bond yields, and a natural decomposition of
 expected excess returns to components corresponding to regime-shift and
 factor risks. Using monthly data on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon bond yields,
 we show a critical role of priced, state-dependent regime-shift risks in
 capturing the time variations in expected excess returns, and document
 notable differences in the behaviors of the factor risk component of the
 expected returns across high and low volatility regimes. Additionally, the
 state dependence of the regime-switching probabilities is shown to capture
 an interesting asymmetry in the cyclical behavior of interest rates. The
 shapes of the term structure of volatility of bond yield changes are also
 very different across regimes, with the well-known hump being largely a
 low-volatility regime phenomenon.   , Oxford University Press.

Abstract:
  The authors undertake a comprehensive investigation of price and volume
 co-movement using daily New York Stock Exchange data from 1928 to 1987.
 They adjust the data to take into account well-known calendar effects and
 long-run trends. To describe the process, they use a seminonparametric
 estimate of the joint density of current price change and volume
 conditional on past price changes and volume. Four empirical regularities
 are found: (1) positive correlation between conditional volatility and
 volume; (2) large price movements are followed by high volume; (3)
 conditioning on lagged volume substantially attenuates the "leverage"
 effect, and (4) after conditioning on lagged volume, there is a positive
 risk-return relation.	 Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Learning and Asset-price Jumps 
Abstract:
 We develop a general equilibrium model in which income and dividends are
 smooth but asset prices contain large moves (jumps). These large price
 jumps are triggered by optimal decisions of investors to learn the
 unobserved state. We show that learning choice is determined by preference
 parameters and the conditional volatility of income process. An important
 model prediction is that income volatility predicts future jump periods,
 while income growth does not. Consistent with the model, large moves in
 returns in the data are predicted by consumption volatility but not by
 consumption growth. The model quantitatively captures these novel features
 of the data.  The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 593-624
Issue: 4
Volume: 3
Year: 1990
Abstract:
  In an adverse selection model of a securities market with one informed
 trader and several liquidity traders, we study the implications of the
 assumption that the informed trader has more information on Monday than on
 other days. We examine the interday variations in volume, variance, and
 adverse selection costs, and find that on Monday the trading costs and the
 variance of price changes are highest, and the volume is lower than on
 Tuesday. These effects are stronger for firms with better public reporting
 and for firms with more discretionary liquidity trading.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Tournament Behavior in Hedge Funds: High-water Marks, Fund Liquidation, and Managerial Stake 
Abstract:
 We analyze whether risk shifting by a hedge fund manager is related to the
 manager's incentive contract, personal capital stake, and the risk of fund
 closure. We find that the propensity to increase risk following poor
 performance is significantly weaker when incentive pay is tied to the
 fund's high-water mark and when funds face little immediate risk of
 liquidation. Risk shifting is also less prevalent when a manager has a
 significant amount of personal capital invested in the fund. Overall,
 high-water mark provisions, managerial stake, and low risk of fund closure
 appear to make a hedge fund manager more conservative with regard to risk
 shifting.  The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: Information Diffusion Effects in Individual Investors' Common Stock Purchases: Covet Thy Neighbors' Investment Choices 
Abstract:
 We study the relation between households' stock purchases and stock
 purchases made by their neighbors. A ten percentage point increase in
 neighbors' purchases of stocks from an industry is associated with a two
 percentage point increase in households' own purchases of stocks from that
 industry. The effect is considerably larger for local stocks and among
 households in more social states. Controlling for area sociability,
 households' and neighbors' investment style preferences, and the industry
 composition of local firms, we attribute approximately one-quarter to
 one-half of the correlation between households' stock purchases and stock
 purchases made by their neighbors to word-of-mouth communication.  , Oxford University Press.

Title:   Intraday Volatility in the Stock Index and Stock Index Futures Markets.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 657-84
Issue: 4
Volume: 4
Year: 1991
Abstract:
  We examine the intraday relationship between returns and returns
 volatility in the stock index and stock index futures markets. Our results
 indicate a strong intermarket dependence in the volatility of the cash and
 futures returns. Price innovations that originate in either the stock or
 futures markets can predict the future volatility in the other market. We
 show that this relationship persists even during periods in which the
 dependence in the returns themselves appears to weaken. The findings are
 robust to controlling for potential market frictions such as asynchronous
 trading in the stock index. Our results have implications for
 understanding the pattern of information flows between the two markets.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Are Corporate Default Probabilities Consistent with the Static Trade-off Theory? 
Abstract:
 Default probability plays a central role in the static trade-off theory of
 capital structure. We directly test this theory by regressing the
 probability of default on proxies for costs and benefits of debt. Contrary
 to predictions of the theory, firms with higher bankruptcy costs, i.e.,
 smaller firms and firms with lower asset tangibility, choose capital
 structures with higher bankruptcy risk. Further analysis suggests that the
 capital structures of smaller firms with lower asset tangibility--which
 tend to have less access to capital markets--are more sensitive to
 negative profitability and equity value shocks, making them more
 susceptible to bankruptcy risk.  The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title:   Optimal Financial Contracting: Debt versus Outside Equity.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 383-418
Issue: 2
Volume: 11
Year: 1998
Abstract:
  This article presents a theory of outside equity based on the control
 rights and the maturity design of equity. I show that outside equity is a
 tacit agreement between investors and management supported by the
 equity-holders' right to dismiss management regardless of performance and
 by the lack of a prespecified expiration date on equity. As a tacit
 agreement outside equity is sustainable despite management's potential for
 manipulating the cash flows and regardless of how costly it is for
 equity-holders to establish a case against managerial wrongdoing. I
 establish that the only outside equity that investors are willing to hold
 in equilibrium is that with unlimited life, the very outside equity that
 corporations issue. Consistent with empirical evidence, this model
 predicts that debt-equity ratios are higher (lower) in industries with low
 (high) cash flow variability.	 Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Family Values and the Star Phenomenon: Strategies of Mutual Fund Families 
Abstract:
  We examine the extent to which a fund's cash flows are affected by the
 stellar performance of other funds in its family -- and consequences of
 such spillovers. We show that star performance results in greater cash
 inflow to the fund and to other funds in its family. Moreover, families
 with higher variation in investment strategies across funds are shown to
 be more likely to generate star performance. We argue that spillovers may
 induce lower ability families to pursue star-creating strategies.
 Consistent with our conjecture, families with high variation in investment
 strategies across funds significantly underperform low-variation families.   Copyright 2004, Oxford University Press.

Title: Trust and Credit: The Role of Appearance in Peer-to-peer Lending 
Abstract:
 Although it is well known that appearance-based impressions affect labor
 market and election outcomes, little is known about the role appearance
 plays in financial transactions. We address this question using
 photographs of potential borrowers from a peer-to-peer lending site.
 Consistent with the trust-intensive nature of lending, we find that
 borrowers who appear more trustworthy have higher probabilities of having
 their loans funded. Moreover, borrowers who appear more trustworthy indeed
 have better credit scores and default less often. Overall, our findings
 suggest that impressions of trustworthiness matter in financial
 transactions as they predict investor, as well as borrower, behavior. A
 man I do not trust could not get money from me on all the bonds in
 Christendom. --John Pierpont Morgan, 1913  The Author 2012. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: Strategic Cost of Diversification 
Abstract:
 This article proposes a new explanation for the large cross-sectional
 variation in the excess values of diversified firms. The model applies the
 idea of shareholders' limited liability affecting firms' output market
 strategies to the analysis of financial and operating choices of
 conglomerates. The inability of conglomerates to commit to unconstrained
 optimal operating strategies, following from the lack of flexibility in
 choosing their divisions' capital structures, reduces their value. Thus,
 the model highlights a new type of inefficiency of the conglomerate
 organizational structure, which is suboptimal financing. The predictions
 of the model are generally supported by the data.  , Oxford University Press.

Title:   Two-Person Dynamic Equilibrium in the Capital Market.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 157-88
Issue: 2
Volume: 2
Year: 1989
Abstract:
  When several investors with different risk aversions trade competitively
 in a capital market, the allocation of wealth fluctuates randomly among
 them and acts as a state variable against which each market participant
 will want to hedge. This hedging motive complicates the investors'
 portfolio choice and the equilibrium in the capital market. This article
 features two investors, with the same degree of impatience, one of them
 being logarithmic and the other having an isoelastic utility function.
 They face one risky constant- return-to-scale stationary production
 opportunity and they can borrow and lend to and from each other. The
 behaviors of the allocation of wealth and of the aggregate capital stock
 are characterized, along with the behavior of the rate of interest, the
 security market line, and the portfolio holdings.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title:   Asset Pricing with Stochastic Differential Utility.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 411-36
Issue: 3
Volume: 5
Year: 1992
Abstract:
  Asset pricing theory is presented with representative-agent utility given
 by a stochastic differential formulation of recursive utility. Asset
 returns are characterized from general first-order conditions of the
 Hamilton-Bellman-Jacobi equation for optimal control. Homothetic
 representative-agent recursive utility functions are shown to imply that
 excess expected rates of return on securities are given by a linear
 combination of the continuous-time market-portfolio-based capital asset
 pricing model (CAPM) and the consumption-based CAPM. The Cox, Ingersoll,
 and Ross characterization of the term structure is examined with a
 recursive generalization, showing the response of the term structure to
 variations in risk aversion. Also, a new multicommodity factor-return
 model, as well as an extension of the "usual" discounted expected value
 formula for asset prices, is introduced.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: The "Dominant Bank Effect:" How High Lender Reputation Affects the Information Content and Terms of Bank Loans 
Abstract:
 Three large banks control over half of the U.S. commercial loan market by
 volume through the syndication process. Using attributes of a borrower's
 location to instrument for lender-- borrower matching, I show that the
 borrower stock price response to a loan announcement is more favorable if
 one of these dominant banks is the lender, especially if the borrower is
 "opaque." I then show that these banks charge lower interest rates and are
 more likely to lend without the protection of a borrowing base. The
 results suggest that the dominant banks have a particularly high
 reputation for screening and monitoring borrowers.  The Author 2010. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title:   Real and Nominal Interest Rates: A Discrete-Time Model and Its Continuous-Time Limit.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 581-611
Issue: 4
Volume: 5
Year: 1992
Abstract:
  I provide a general equilibrium theory of the term structure of real
 interest rates in a discrete-time economy. I derive the prices for
 one-period and two-period real bonds and a simple recursive formula for
 general k-period bonds, and prove that the price formula with
 appropriately specified parameters converges to that of the Cox,
 Ingersoll, and Ross model (1985). In addition, I consider the behavior of
 nominal bond prices in a partial equilibrium setting in which an exogenous
 price level process is correlated with the real economy. Finally, I
 provide an illustrative empirical investigation of the model. The results
 indicate a significant correlation between the price level and the growth
 rate of consumption, which does not support the "money nuetrality"
 assumption underlying Cox, Ingersoll, and Ross's nominal bond prices and
 related empirical studies, such as Gibbons and Ramaswamyu (1992),
 Heston(1991), and Pearson and Sun (1991).   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Obfuscation, Learning, and the Evolution of Investor Sophistication 
Abstract:
 Investor sophistication has lagged behind the growing complexity of retail
 financial markets. To explore this, we develop a dynamic model to study
 the interaction between obfuscation and investor sophistication in mutual
 fund markets. Taking into account different learning mechanisms within the
 investor population, we characterize the optimal timing of obfuscation for
 financial institutions who offer retail products. We show that educational
 initiatives that are directed to facilitate learning by investors may
 induce providers to increase wasteful obfuscation, further disorienting
 investors and decreasing overall welfare. Obfuscation decreases with
 competition among firms, since the information rents from obfuscation
 dissipate as each institution attracts a smaller market share.  The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title: Excess Comovement of Stock Returns: Evidence from Cross-Sectional Variation in Nikkei 225 Weights 
Abstract:
 Relative to their weights in a value-weighted index, a number of stocks in
 Japan's Nikkei 225 stock index are overweighted by a factor of 10 or more.
 I document a strong positive relation between overweighting and the
 comovement of a stock with other stocks in the Nikkei index, and a
 negative relationship between index overweighting and comovement with
 stocks outside of the index. The cross-sectional approach resolves
 endogeneity problems associated with event study demonstrations of excess
 comovement. A trading strategy that bets on the reversion of stock prices
 of overweighted stocks generates economic profits, confirming that the
 observed comovement patterns are excessive, and providing further evidence
 that comovement of stock returns can be a consequence of commonality in
 trading behavior.  The Author 2007. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies., Oxford University Press.

Abstract:
  While folklore in finance holds that split valuation effects are due to

 effects. We find that splits and dividends are indeed informational
 substitutes, a notion we characterize more precisely, but a significant
 portion of split valuation effects, 46% according to our estimates, cannot
 be attributed to dividend information in splits. Our techniques extend the

 practical value in testing hypotheses and analyzing data not amenable to
 analysis by standard procedures.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title:   The Stop-Loss Start-Gain Paradox and Option Valuation: A New Decomposition into Intrinsic and Time Value.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 469-92
Issue: 3
Volume: 3
Year: 1990
Abstract:
  The downside risk in a leveraged stock position can be eliminated by
 using stop-loss orders. The upside potential of such a position can be
 captured using contingent buy orders. The terminal payoff to this
 stop-loss start-gain strategy is identical to that of a call option, but
 the strategy costs less initially. This article resolves this paradox by
 showing that the strategy is not self-financing for continuous stock-
 price processes of unbounded variation. The resolution of the paradox
 leads to a new decomposition of an option's price into its intrinsic and
 time value. When stock price follows geometric Brownian motion, this
 decomposition is proven to be mathematically equivalent to the
 Black-Scholes (1973) formula.	 Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Debt Financing and Financial Flexibility Evidence from Proactive Leverage Increases 
Abstract:
 Firms that intentionally increase leverage through substantial debt
 issuances do so primarily as a response to operating needs rather than a
 desire to make a large equity payout. Subsequent debt reductions are
 neither rapid, nor the result of proactive attempts to rebalance the
 firm's capital structure toward a long-run target. Instead, the evolution
 of the firm's leverage ratio depends primarily on whether or not the firm
 produces a financial surplus. In fact, firms that generate subsequent
 deficits tend to cover these deficits predominantly with more debt even
 though they exhibit leverage ratios that are well above estimated target
 levels. Our findings are broadly consistent with a capital structure
 theory in which financial flexibility, in the form of unused debt
 capacity, plays an important role in capital structure choices.   The Author 2012. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: Bank Liquidity, Interbank Markets, and Monetary Policy 
Abstract:
 A lesson of the recent financial crisis is that the interbank market is
 crucial for banks facing uncertainty regarding their liquidity needs. This
 article studies the efficiency of the interbank market in allocating
 funds. We show that the central bank should lower the interbank rate when
 confronted with a crisis that causes a disparity in the liquidity held
 among banks. This suggests that the traditional tenet prescribing the
 separation between prudential regulation and monetary policy should be
 abandoned. We also show that failure to cut interest rates during a crisis
 erodes financial stability by increasing the risk of bank runs.  The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: Identifying Term Structure Volatility from the LIBOR-Swap Curve 
Abstract:
 This paper proposes a new family of specification tests and applies them
 to affine term structure models of the London Interbank Offered Rate
 (LIBOR)-swap curve. Contrary to Dai and Singleton (2000), the tests show
 that when standard estimation techniques are used, affine models do a poor
 job of forecasting volatility at the short end of the term structure.
 Improving the volatility forecast does not require different models;
 rather, it requires a different estimation technique. The paper
 distinguishes between two econometric procedures for identifying
 volatility. The 'cross-sectional' approach backs out volatility from a
 cross section of bond yields, and the 'time-series' approach imputes
 volatility from time-series variation in yields. For an affine model, the
 volatility implied by the time-series procedure passes the specification
 tests, while the cross-sectionally identified volatility does not. This is
 surprising, since under correct specification, the 'cross-sectional'
 approach is maximum likelihood. One explanation is that affine models are
 slightly misspecified; another is that bond yields do not span volatility,
 as in Collin-Dufresne and Goldstein (2002).  , Oxford University Press.

Title:   A Closed-Form GARCH Option Valuation Model.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 585-625
Issue: 3
Volume: 13
Year: 2000
Abstract:
  This paper develops a closed-form option valuation formula for a spot
 asset whose variance follows a GARCH(p, q) process that can be correlated
 with the returns of the spot asset. It provides the first readily computed
 option formula for a random volatility model that can be estimated and
 implemented solely on the basis of observables. The single lag version of
 this model contains Heston's (1993) stochastic volatility model as a
 continuous-time limit. Empirical analysis on S&P500 index options shows
 that the out-of-sample valuation errors from the single lag version of the
 GARCH model are substantially lower than the ad hoc Black-Scholes model of
 Dumas, Fleming and Whaley (1998) that uses a separate implied volatility
 for each option to fit to the smirk/smile in implied volatilities. The
 GARCH model remains superior even though the parameters of the GARCH model
 are held constant and volatility is filtered from the history of asset
 prices while the ad hoc Black-Scholes model is updated every period. The
 improvement is largely due to the ability of the GARCH model to
 simultaneously capture the correlation of volatility, with spot returns
 and the path dependence in volatility.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Identifying the Valuation Effects and Agency Costs of Corporate Diversification: Evidence from the Geographic Diversification of U.S. Banks 
Abstract:
 This paper assesses the impact of the geographic diversification of bank
 holding company (BHC) assets across the United States on their market
 valuations. Using two new identification strategies based on the dynamic
 process of interstate bank deregulation, we find that exogenous increases
 in geographic diversity reduced BHC valuations. We also find that the
 geographic diversification of BHC assets increased insider lending and
 reduced loan quality. Taken together, these findings are consistent with
 theories predicting that geographic diversity intensifies agency problems.  The Author 2013. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: Does Anonymity Matter in Electronic Limit Order Markets? 
Abstract:
 We develop a model in which limit order traders possess volatility
 information. We show that in this case the size of the bid-ask spread is
 informative about future volatility. Moreover, if volatility information
 is in part private, we establish that (i) the size of the bid-ask spread
 and (ii) its informativeness about future volatility should change in the
 same direction when limit order traders' identifiers stop being disclosed.
 We test these predictions using data from the Paris Bourse. As expected,
 we find that the average quoted spread and its informativeness are
 significantly smaller when limit order traders' identifiers are concealed.
 These findings suggest that the limit order book is a channel for
 volatility information.  , Oxford University Press.

Title: Understanding Index Option Returns 
Abstract:
 Previous research concludes that options are mispriced based on the high
 average returns, CAPM alphas, and Sharpe ratios of various put selling
 strategies. One criticism of these conclusions is that these benchmarks
 are ill suited to handle the extreme statistical nature of option returns
 generated by nonlinear payoffs. We propose an alternative way to evaluate
 the statistical significance of option returns by comparing historical
 statistics to those generated by option pricing models. The most puzzling
 finding in the existing literature, the large returns to writing
 out-of-the-money puts, is not inconsistent (i.e., is statistically
 insignificant) relative to the Black-Scholes model or the Heston
 stochastic volatility model due to the extreme sampling uncertainty
 associated with put returns. This sampling problem can largely be
 alleviated by analyzing market-neutral portfolios such as straddles or
 delta-hedged returns. The returns on these portfolios can be explained by
 jump risk premiums and estimation risk.  The Author 2009. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title:   Sunshine Trading and Financial Market Equilibrium.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 443-81
Issue: 3
Volume: 4
Year: 1991
Abstract:
  In this article, we consider the possibility that some liquidity traders
 preannounce the size of their orders, a practice that has come to be known
 as "sunshine trading." Two possible effects preannouncement might have on
 the equilibrium are examined. First, since it identifies certain trades as
 informationless, preannouncement changes the nature of any informational
 asymmetries in the market. Second, preannouncement can coordinate the
 supply and demand of liquidity in the market.	We show that
 preannouncement typically reduces the trading costs of those who
 preannounce, but its effects on the trading costs and welfare of other
 traders are ambiguous. We also examine the implications of preannouncement
 for the distribution of prices and the amount of information that prices
 reveal.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Endogenous Events and Long-Run Returns 
Abstract:
 We analyze event abnormal returns when returns predict events. In fixed
 samples, we show that the expected abnormal return is negative and becomes
 more negative as the holding period increases. Asymptotically, abnormal
 returns converge to zero provided that the process of the number of events
 is stationary. Nonstationarity in the process of the number of events is
 needed to generate a large negative bias. We present theory and
 simulations for the specific case of a lognormal model to characterize the
 magnitude of the small-sample bias. We illustrate the theory by analyzing
 long-term returns after initial public offerings (IPOs) and seasoned
 equity offerings (SEOs).  The Author 2008. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title: Tournaments in Mutual-Fund Families 
Abstract:
 We examine intrafirm competition in the mutual-fund industry. We test the
 hypothesis that fund managers within mutual-fund families compete with
 each other in a tournament. Our empirical study of the US equity
 mutual-fund market shows that they adjust the risk they take depending on
 the relative position within their fund family. The direction of the
 adjustment depends on the competitive situation in that family. Risk
 adjustments are particularly pronounced among managers of funds with high
 expense ratios, which are managed by a single manager and which belong to
 large families.  The Author 2007. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org, Oxford University Press.

Title: How Deep Is the Annuity Market Participation Puzzle? 
Abstract:
 Using microeconomic data for the United Kingdom, we analyze the empirical
 determinants of voluntary annuity market demand. We find that annuity
 market participation increases with financial wealth, life expectancy, and
 education and decreases with other pension income and a possible bequest
 motive for surviving spouses. We then show that these empirically
 motivated determinants of annuity market participation have the same,
 quantitatively important, effects in a life-cycle model of annuity and
 life insurance demand, saving, and portfolio choice. Moreover, reasonable
 preference parameters predict annuity demand levels comparable to the
 data. For stockholders, a strong bequest motive can simultaneously
 generate balanced portfolios and low annuity demand.  The Author 2010. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title: Is Unbiased Financial Advice to Retail Investors Sufficient? Answers from a Large Field Study 
Abstract:
 Working with one of the largest brokerages in Germany, we record what
 happens when unbiased investment advice is offered to a random set of
 approximately 8,000 active retail customers out of the brokerage's several
 hundred thousand retail customers. We find that investors who most need
 the financial advice are least likely to obtain it. The investors who do
 obtain the advice (about 5%), however, hardly follow the advice and do not
 improve their portfolio efficiency by much. Overall, our results imply
 that the mere availability of unbiased financial advice is a necessary but
 not sufficient condition for benefiting retail investors.  The Author 2012. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: Estimating the Benefits of Contractual Completeness 
Abstract:
 I provide a revealed-preference-based framework that uses covenant prices
 and choices to quantitatively study how covenants generate firm benefits
 by completing debt contracts. I use a rational-expectations-based panel
 estimator of covenant prices, which does not require quasi-experimental
 variation, to circumvent the problem of endogenous covenant choices. I
 find that firms' surpluses exceed the spread paid on a loan. Leverage and
 interest-rate covenants produce the largest benefits, lending quantitative
 credence to several standard theories of covenants. Once covenants are
 chosen, the benefits from fine-tuning them are small, thus rationalizing
 "boilerplate" covenants. I conclude by discussing the extensions and
 limitations of my method.  The Author 2013. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: Is Default Event Risk Priced in Corporate Bonds? 
Abstract:
  This article provides an empirical decomposition of the default,
 liquidity, and tax factors that determine expected corporate bond returns.
 In particular, the risk premium associated with a default event is
 estimated. The intensity-based model is estimated using bond price data
 for 104 US firms and historical default rates. Significant risk premia on
 common intensity factors and important tax and liquidity effects are
 found. These components go a long way towards explaining the level of
 expected corporate bond returns. Adding a positive default event risk
 premium helps to explain the remaining error, although this premium cannot
 be estimated with high statistical precision.   Copyright 2005, Oxford University Press.

Title: Optimal Mortgage Design 
Abstract:
 This article studies optimal mortgage design in a continuous-time setting
 with volatile and privately observable income, costly foreclosure, and a
 stochastic market interest rate. We show that the features of the optimal
 mortgage are consistent with an option adjustable-rate mortgage (option
 ARM). Under the optimal contract, the borrower is given discretion of how
 much to repay until his balance reaches a certain limit. The default rates
 and interest rate payment on the mortgage correlate positively with the
 market interest rate. Gains from using the optimal contract relative to
 simpler mortgages are the biggest for those who face more income
 variability, buy pricey houses given their income level, or make little or
 no down payment. Our model thus may help to explain a high concentration
 of option ARMs among riskier borrowers.   The Author 2010. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title: Corporate Governance and Value Creation: Evidence from Private Equity 
Abstract:
 Using deal-level data from transactions initiated by large private equity
 houses, we find that the abnormal performance of deals is positive on
 average, after controlling for leverage and sector returns. Higher
 abnormal performance is related to improvement in sales and operating
 margin during the private phase, relative to that for quoted peers.
 General partners who are ex-consultants or ex--industry managers are
 associated with outperforming deals focused on internal value-creation
 programs, and ex-bankers or ex-accountants with outperforming deals
 involving significant mergers and acquisitions. The findings suggest the
 presence, on average, of positive but heterogeneous skills at the
 deal-partner level in large private equity transactions.  The Author 2012. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: Average Idiosyncratic Volatility in&nbsp;G7&nbsp;Countries 
Abstract:
 We argue that changes in average idiosyncratic volatility provide a proxy
 for changes in the investment opportunity set and that this proxy is
 closely related to the book-to-market factor. We test this idea in two
 ways using G7 countries' data. First, we show that idiosyncratic
 volatility has statistically significant predictive power for aggregate
 stock market returns over time. Second, we show that idiosyncratic
 volatility performs just as well as the book-to-market factor in
 explaining the cross section of stock returns. Our results suggest that
 the hedge against changes in investment opportunities is an important
 determinant of asset prices.  The Author 2008. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org, Oxford University Press.

Title: Side-by-Side Management of Hedge Funds and Mutual Funds 
Abstract:
 We examine situations where the same fund manager simultaneously manages
 mutual funds and hedge funds. We refer to this as side-by-side management.
 We document 344 such cases involving 693 mutual funds and 538 hedge funds.
 Proponents of this practice argue that it is essential to hire and retain
 star performers. Detractors argue that the temptation for abuse is high,
 and the practice should be banned. Our analysis based on various
 performance metrics shows that side-by-side mutual fund managers
 significantly outperform peer funds, consistent with this privilege being
 granted primarily to star performers. Interestingly, side-by-side hedge
 fund managers are at best on par with their style category peers, casting
 further doubt on the idea that conflicts of interest undermine mutual fund
 investors. Thus, we find no evidence of welfare loss for mutual fund
 investors due to exploitation of conflicts of interest.  The Author 2010. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Issue: 2
Volume: 13
Year: 2000
Abstract:
  This article reports an asset market experiment in which asymmetrically
 informed traders transact through competing dealers. Dealers face a
 classic adverse selection problem because some traders have private
 information regarding the asset value while other traders are uninformed.
 When dealers cannot communicate outside the market, they price the asset
 competitively and the market is generally informationally efficient. When
 dealers communicate privately between periods, they collude successfully
 to widen spreads and increase profit. Another treatment permits traders to
 post limit orders, while still allowing dealers to communicate. Limit
 orders restore informational efficiency and narrow spreads but cause
 dealers to earn negative trading profits.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: CEO Replacement Under Private Information 
Abstract:
 This article examines the optimal CEO compensation and replacement policy
 when the CEO is privately informed about the firm's continuation value
 under his leadership. Ex ante moral hazard implies that the CEO must
 receive ex post quasi rents, which endogenously biases him toward
 continuation. Our model shows that to induce "bad" CEOs to quit, it may be
 best to make continuation costly (through steep incentive pay) rather than
 simply rewarding quitting (through severance pay). Incentive pay makes
 continuation attractive for "good" CEOs, who can expect high future
 on-the-job pay, but unattractive for "bad" CEOs, who may instead prefer to
 take their outside option payoff. Our model generates novel empirical
 implications that jointly relate CEO compensation and turnover to
 corporate governance, firm size, cash-flow risk, and the informativeness
 of performance measurement.  The Author 2010. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title: Time-Varying Liquidity Risk and the Cross Section of Stock Returns 
Abstract:
 This paper studies whether stock returns' sensitivities to aggregate
 liquidity fluctuations and the pricing of liquidity risk vary over time.
 We find that liquidity betas vary across two distinct states: one with
 high liquidity betas and the other with low betas. The high liquidity-beta
 state is short lived and characterized by heavy trade, high volatility,
 and a wide cross-sectional dispersion in liquidity betas. It also delivers
 a disproportionately large liquidity risk premium, amounting to more than
 twice the value premium. Our results are consistent with a model of
 liquidity risk in which investors face uncertainty about their trading
 counterparties' preferences.  The Author 2007. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title:   A Simple Model of the Taxable and Tax-Exempt Yield Curves.

Pages: 233-64
Issue: 2
Volume: 6
Year: 1993
Abstract:
  I examine the anomalous behavior of the taxable and tax-exempt yield
 curves. Long municipal yields appear too high relative to the equivalent
 after-tax yield that can be earned in Treasury or corporate bonds. I
 discuss existing explanations of the problem and propose a simple model
 that relates the yields of taxable bonds to the yield curve for par tax
 exempts. The ratio of the tax-exempt yield to the taxable yield increases
 with maturity in the model, so it is consistent with observed phenomena
 such as inverted yield curves for taxables and contemporaneous rising
 yield curves for tax exempts. Statistical and descriptive comparisons
 between the yields predicted.by the model and observed yields on par bonds
 that the model has some promise in explaining the apparent anomalies in
 the behaviors of the two yield curves.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: The Market Portfolio May Be Mean/Variance Efficient After All 
Abstract:
 Numerous studies have examined the mean/variance efficiency of various
 market proxies by employing sample parameters and have concluded that
 these proxies are inefficient. These findings cast doubt about the capital
 asset pricing model (CAPM), one of the cornerstones of modern finance.
 This study adopts a reverse-engineering approach: given a particular
 market proxy, we find the minimal variations in sample parameters required
 to ensure that the proxy is mean/variance efficient. Surprisingly, slight
 variations in parameters, well within estimation error bounds, suffice to
 make the proxy efficient. Thus, many conventional market proxies could be
 perfectly consistent with the CAPM and useful for estimating expected
 returns.  The Author 2010. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Abstract:
  Brokerage analysts frequently comment on and sometimes recommend
 companies that their firms have recently taken public. We show that stocks
 that underwriter analysts recommend perform more poorly than 'buy'
 recommendations by unaffiliated brokers prior to, at the time of, and
 subsequent to the recommendation date. We conclude that the
 recommendations by underwriter analysts show significant evidence of bias.
 We show also that the market does not recognize the full extent of this
 bias. The results suggest a potential conflict of interest inherent in the
 different functions that investment bankers perform.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Optimal Filtering of Jump Diffusions: Extracting Latent States from Asset Prices 
Abstract:
 This paper provides an optimal filtering methodology in discretely
 observed continuous-time jump-diffusion models. Although the filtering
 problem has received little attention, it is useful for estimating latent
 states, forecasting volatility and returns, computing model diagnostics
 such as likelihood ratios, and parameter estimation. Our approach combines
 time-discretization schemes with Monte Carlo methods. It is quite general,
 applying in nonlinear and multivariate jump-diffusion models and models
 with nonanalytic observation equations. We provide a detailed analysis of
 the filter's performance, and analyze four applications: disentangling
 jumps from stochastic volatility, forecasting volatility, comparing models
 via likelihood ratios, and filtering using option prices and returns.  The Author 2009. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org, Oxford University Press.

Title:   Learning to be Overconfident.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 1-27
Issue: 1
Volume: 14
Year: 2001
Abstract:
  We develop a multiperiod market model describing both the process by
 which traders learn about their ability and how a bias in this learning
 can create overconfident traders. A trader in our model initially does not
 know his own ability. He infers this ability from his successes and
 failures. In assessing his ability the trader takes too much credit for
 his successes. This leads him to become overconfident. A trader's expected
 level of overconfidence increases in the early stages of his career. Then,
 with more experience, he comes to better recognize his own ability. The
 patterns in trading volume, expected profits, price volatility, and
 expected prices resulting from this endogenous overconfidence are
 analyzed.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Informed and Strategic Order Flow in the Bond Markets 
Abstract:
 We study the role played by private and public information in the process
 of price formation in the U.S. Treasury bond market. To guide our
 analysis, we develop a parsimonious model of speculative trading in the
 presence of two realistic market frictions&#x2014;information
 heterogeneity and imperfect competition among informed traders&#x2014;and
 a public signal. We test its equilibrium implications by analyzing the
 response of two-year, five-year, and ten-year U.S. bond yields to order
 flow and real-time U.S. macroeconomic news. We find strong evidence of
 informational effects in the U.S. Treasury bond market: unanticipated
 order flow has a significant and permanent impact on daily bond yield
 changes during both announcement and nonannouncement days. Our analysis
 further shows that, consistent with our stylized model, the
 contemporaneous correlation between order flow and yield changes is higher
 when the dispersion of beliefs among market participants is high and
 public announcements are noisy.  , Oxford University Press.

Title: Bank Lines of Credit in Corporate Finance: An Empirical Analysis 
Abstract:
 I empirically examine the factors that determine whether firms use bank
 lines of credit or cash in corporate liquidity management. I find that
 bank lines of credit, also known as revolving credit facilities, are a
 viable liquidity substitute only for firms that maintain high cash flow.
 In contrast, firms with low cash flow are less likely to obtain a line of
 credit, and they rely more heavily on cash in their corporate liquidity
 management. An important channel for this correlation is the use of cash
 flow-based financial covenants by banks that supply credit lines. I find
 that firms must maintain high cash flow to remain compliant with
 covenants, and banks restrict firm access to credit facilities in response
 to covenant violations. Using the cash-flow sensitivity of cash as a
 measure of financial constraints, I provide evidence that lack of access
 to a line of credit is a more statistically powerful measure of financial
 constraints than traditional measures used in the literature.  The Author 2007. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org, Oxford University Press.

Title:   Rational Beliefs and Security Design.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 1183-1213
Issue: 4
Volume: 14
Year: 2001
Abstract:
  This article studies the security-design problem of a cash-constrained
 firm facing investors with diverse beliefs. Investor "rational beliefs"
 are modeled as varying and yet rational in the sense of Kurz (1994). With
 two investors, optimal designs are similar under rational beliefs and
 rational expectations. With many investors, however, optimal securities
 under rational beliefs maximize investor differences of opinion, while
 under rational expectations optimal designs minimize disagreements. We
 demonstrate that the common practice of issuing multiple securities backed
 by a single asset is optimal under rational beliefs but not under rational
 expectations. Researching market beliefs can create substantial value for
 firms.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Cross-Listing, Investment Sensitivity to Stock Price, and the Learning Hypothesis 
Abstract:
 Cross-listed firms in the United States have a higher investment-to-price
 sensitivity than do firms that never cross-list. This difference is
 strong, does not exist prior to the cross-listing date, and does not
 vanish afterward. Moreover, it does not appear to be primarily driven by
 improvements in governance, disclosure, and access to capital associated
 with a U.S. cross-listing. Instead, we argue that a cross-listing enhances
 managers' reliance on stock prices because it makes stock prices more
 informative to them. Consistent with this explanation, U.S. cross-listings
 that are more likely to strengthen the informativeness of stock prices for
 managers feature a higher investment-to-price sensitivity.  The Author 2012. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: Why Does the Law of One Price Fail? An Experiment on Index Mutual Funds 
Abstract:
 We evaluate why individuals invest in high-fee index funds. In our
 experiments, subjects each allocate $10,000 across four S&P 500 index
 funds and are rewarded for their portfolio's subsequent return. Subjects
 overwhelmingly fail to minimize fees. We reject the hypothesis that
 subjects buy high-fee index funds because of bundled nonportfolio
 services. Search costs for fees matter, but even when we eliminate these
 costs, fees are not minimized. Instead, subjects place high weight on
 annualized returns since inception. Fees paid decrease with financial
 literacy. Interestingly, subjects who choose high-fee funds sense they are
 making a mistake.  The Author 2009. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title: Fuzzy Math, Disclosure Regulation, and Market Outcomes: Evidence from Truth-in-Lending Reform 
Abstract:
 We posit that consumer lenders shroud interest rates and market "low
 monthly payments" to price discriminate on "fuzzy math" or
 "payment/interest bias": consumers' pervasive tendency to underestimate
 borrowing costs when an interest rate is not disclosed. We test whether
 mandated disclosure changes lenders' ability to price discriminate using
 within-household interactions between payment/interest bias and
 policy-induced variation in the strength of Truth-in-Lending Act (TILA)
 enforcement across lenders and time. Weak TILA enforcement substantially
 widens the gap between rates paid by more-biased and less-biased
 borrowers. TILA compliance costs appear to increase interest rates
 overall, making the net effect on interest rates ambiguous.  The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title: Dynamic Portfolio Choice with Parameter Uncertainty and the Economic Value of Analysts' Recommendations 
Abstract:
  We derive a closed-form solution for the optimal portfolio of a nonmyopic
 utility maximizer who has incomplete information about the alphas or
 abnormal returns of risky securities. We show that the hedging component
 induced by learning about the expected return can be a substantial part of
 the demand. Using our methodology, we perform an "ex ante" empirical
 exercise, which shows that the utility gains resulting from optimal
 allocation are substantial in general, especially for long horizons, and
 an "ex post" empirical exercise, which shows that analysts'
 recommendations are not very useful. (JEL C61, G11, G24)   Copyright 2006, Oxford University Press.

Title: Fiduciary Duties and Equity-debtholder Conflicts 
Abstract:
 We use an important legal event to examine the effect of managerial
 fiduciary duties on equity-debt conflicts. A 1991 legal ruling changed
 corporate directors' fiduciary duties in Delaware firms, limiting
 managers' incentives to take actions that favor equity over debt for
 distressed firms. After this, affected firms responded by increasing
 equity issues and investment and by reducing risk. The ruling was also
 followed by an increase in leverage, reduced reliance on covenants, and
 higher values. Fiduciary duties appear to affect equity-bondholder
 conflicts in a way that is economically important, has impact on ex ante
 capital structure choices, and affects welfare.  The Author 2012. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: Macroeconomic Conditions and Capital Raising 
Abstract:
 Do macroeconomic conditions affect firms' abilities to raise capital? If
 so, how do they affect the manner in which the capital is raised? Using a
 large sample of publicly traded debt issues, seasoned equity offers, bank
 loans, and private placements of equity and debt, we find that a
 borrower's credit quality significantly affects its ability to raise
 capital during macroeconomic downturns. For noninvestment-grade borrowers,
 capital raising tends to be procyclical, while for investment-grade
 borrowers, it is countercyclical. Poor market conditions also affect the
 structure of securities offered, shifting them toward shorter maturities
 and more security. Overall, our results suggest that macroeconomic
 conditions influence the securities that firms issue to raise capital, the
 way in which these securities are structured, and indeed firms' ability to
 raise capital at all.  The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: Financial Visibility and the Decision to Go Private 
Abstract:
 A large fraction of the companies that went private between 1990 and 2007
 were fairly young public firms, often with the same management team making
 the crucial restructuring decisions at both the time of the initial public
 offering (IPO) and the buyout. This article investigates the determinants
 of the decision to go private over a firm's entire public life cycle. Our
 evidence reveals that firms with declining growth in analyst coverage,
 falling institutional ownership, and low stock turnover were more likely
 to go private and opted to do so sooner. We argue that a primary reason
 behind the decision of IPO firms to abandon their public listing was a
 failure to attract a critical mass of financial visibility and investor
 interest.  The Author 2009. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title: A Reexamination of Tunneling and Business Groups: New Data and New Methods 
Abstract:
 One of the most rigorous methodologies in the corporate governance
 literature uses firms' reactions to industry shocks to characterize the
 quality of governance. This methodology can produce the wrong answer
 unless one considers the ways firms compete. Because macro-level shocks
 reverberate differently at the firm level depending on whether a firm has
 a cost structure that requires significant adjustment, the quality of
 governance can only be elucidated accurately analyzing a firm's business
 strategy and their corporate governance. These differences can help one
 determine whether the fruits of a positive macro-level shock have been
 expropriated by insiders. Using the example of Indian firms, we show that
 an influential finding is reversed when these differences are considered.
 We further argue that the conventional wisdom about tunneling and business
 groups will need to be reformulated in light of the data, methodology, and
 findings presented here.  The Author 2012. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: Family Business Groups around the World: Financing Advantages, Control Motivations, and Organizational Choices 
Abstract:
 Using a dataset of 28,635 firms in 45 countries, this study investigates
 the motivations for family-controlled business groups. We provide new
 evidence consistent with the argument that particular group structures
 emerge not only to perpetuate control, but also to alleviate financing
 constraints at the country and firm levels. At the country level, family
 groups, especially those structured as pyramids, are more prevalent in
 markets with limited availability of capital. At the firm level,
 investment intensity is greater for firms held in pyramidal rather than in
 horizontal structures, reflecting the financing advantages of the former.
 Within a pyramid, internal equity funding, investment intensity, and firm
 value all increase down the ownership chain. However, group firm
 performance declines when dual-class shares and cross shareholdings are
 employed as additional control-enhancing mechanisms.  The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Abstract:
  This article investigates why, in October 1987, almost all stock markets
 fell together despite widely differing economic circumstances. The authors
 construct a model in which "contagion" between markets occurs as a result
 of attempts by rational agents to infer information from price changes in
 other markets. This provides a channel through which a "mistake" in one
 market can be transmitted to other markets. The authors offer supporting
 evidence for contagion effects using two different sources of data.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Beauty Contests and Iterated Expectations in Asset Markets 
Abstract:
  In a financial market where traders are risk averse and short lived and
 prices are noisy, asset prices today depend on the average expectation
 today of tomorrow's price. Thus (iterating this relationship) the date 1
 price equals the date 1 average expectation of the date 2 average
 expectation of the date 3 price. This will not, in general, equal the date
 1 average expectation of the date 3 price. We show how this failure of the
 law of iterated expectations for average belief can help understand the
 role of higher-order beliefs in a fully rational asset pricing model.   Copyright 2006, Oxford University Press.

Title: Innovation, Differentiation, and the Choice of an Underwriter: Evidence from Equity-Linked Securities 
Abstract:
  Investment banks imitate other bank's innovative corporate securities and
 compete with the innovator to underwrite new issues. This article uses
 data of all the corporate offerings of equity-linked and derivative
 securities in the Securities Data Company (SDC) to estimate the issuer's
 demand of underwriting services provided by investment banks across
 different varieties of securities. It finds that the demand for the
 innovator's variety is larger than the imitators'. This demand advantage
 decreases with time and faster for securities that appear later in a
 sequence of innovations. Imitation becomes less attractive later in the
 sequence as information from earlier deals spills-over to all banks.   Copyright 2006, Oxford University Press.

Title: Real Flexibility and Financial Structure: An Empirical Analysis 
Abstract:
  I examine the empirical relation between real flexibility and financial
 structure. I test whether real flexibility increases debt capacity by
 lowering default risk and making assets more marketable or decreases debt
 capacity by facilitating risk shifting and asset substitution. I measure
 real flexibility as the sensitivity of marginal production and investment
 decisions to variations in the economic environment. I find that financial
 leverage is negatively related to production flexibility but positively
 related to investment flexibility. This split in results suggests that
 although asset substitution facilitated by investment flexibility can be
 prevented contractually, risk shifting facilitated by production
 flexibility is intractable.   Copyright 2003, Oxford University Press.

Title: Choosing to Cofinance: Analysis of Project-Specific Alliances in the Movie Industry 
Abstract:
 We use a movie industry project-by-project dataset to analyze the choice
 of financing a project internally versus financing it through outside
 alliances. The results indicate that project risk is positively correlated
 with alliance formation. Movie studios produce a variety of films and tend
 to develop their safest projects internally. Our findings are consistent
 with internal capital market explanations. We find mixed evidence
 regarding resource pooling, i.e., sharing the cost of large projects.
 Finally, the evidence shows that projects developed internally perform
 similarly to projects developed through outside alliances.  The Author 2007. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org, Oxford University Press.

Title:   Market Making, Prices, and Quantity Limits.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 1129-51
Issue: 4
Volume: 13
Year: 2000
Abstract:
  This article develops a model of spread and depth setting under
 asymmetric information where the equilibrium depth is proportionally more
 sensitive than the spread to changes in the degree of information
 asymmetry. The analysis uses a one-period model in which a risk-neutral,
 monopolistic market maker faces a price-sensitive liquidity trader and a
 better informed trader who is alternatively risk neutral and risk averse.
 The equilibrium depth can take values ranging from 0 to infinity,
 depending on the information asymmetry, the asset volatility, and the
 strength of the liquidity demand, while the spread remains positive and
 finite.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Convertibles and Hedge Funds as Distributors of Equity Exposure 
Abstract:
 By buying convertibles and shorting the underlying stock, hedge funds
 distribute equity exposure to well-diversified shareholders. We find that
 firms with characteristics that make seasoned equity offerings expensive
 are more likely to issue convertibles to hedge funds. We conclude that
 hedge funds provide opportunities for firms to issue convertible
 securities at a lower cost than seasoned equity by serving as relatively
 low-cost distributors of equity exposure. A higher fraction of a
 convertible is privately placed with hedge funds when institutional
 ownership, stock liquidity, issue size, concurrent stock repurchases, and
 limitations on callability suggest that shorting costs will be lower.  The Author 2012. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: Interbank Market Integration under Asymmetric Information 
Abstract:
  Cross-country bank lending appears to be subject to market imperfections
 leading to persistent interest rate differentials. In a model where banks
 need to cope with liquidity shocks by borrowing or by liquidating assets,
 we study the scope for international interbank market integration with
 unsecured lending when cross-country information is noisy. We find that an
 equilibrium with integrated markets need not always exist, and that it may
 coexist with one characterized by segmentation. A repo market reduces
 interest rate spreads and improves upon the segmentation equilibrium.
 However, it may destroy the unsecured integrated equilibrium.   Copyright 2005, Oxford University Press.

Title: Book-to-Market Equity, Financial Leverage, and the Cross-Section of Stock Returns 
Abstract:
 I propose a new dynamic model of the firm that links operating leverage to
 both value premium and book-leverage premium in stock returns. Value firms
 are low-productivity firms with either high operating leverage or high
 financial leverage. Firms with high operating leverage maintain low book
 leverage ratios. When operating leverage is economically significant, both
 value firms and low book-leverage firms can have high equity risk
 premiums. In particular, value premium becomes positive while
 book-leverage premium becomes negative. Without operating leverage, the
 signs of these premiums are reversed. The model captures quantitatively
 several important properties of the cross-section of stock returns.  The Author 2013. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title:   The Optimal Trading and Pricing of Securities with Asymmetric Capital Gains Taxes and Transaction Costs.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 921-52
Issue: 3
Volume: 9
Year: 1996
Abstract:
  This article explores the optimal trading and pricing of taxable
 securities with asymmetric capital gains taxes and transaction costs. In
 the long-term region, investors realize all gains below some critical
 cutoff level, which we derive analytically. In the short-term region,
 investors defer all gains and, depending upon the time remaining in the
 short-term region, may also defer small losses. Contrary to common
 intuition, deferral of short-term losses can be optimal even without
 transaction costs. The value of tax timing is considerably bigger under
 the optimal trading strategy than under alternative strategies previously
 analyzed. The impact of offset rules is also explored.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Loan Prospecting 
Abstract:
 We analyze corporate lending when loan officers must be incentivized to
 prospect for loans and to transmit the soft information they obtain in
 that process. We explore how this multi-task agency problem shapes loan
 officers' compensation, banks' use of soft information in credit approval,
 and their lending standards. When competition intensifies, prospecting for
 loans becomes more important and banks' internal agency problems worsen.
 In response to more competition, banks lower lending standards, may choose
 to disregard soft and use only hard information in their credit approval,
 and in that case reduce loan officers to salespeople with steep,
 volume-based compensation. Our model generates "excessive lending" as
 banks' optimal response to an internal agency problem.  The Author 2012. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oup.com, Oxford University Press.

Title: Evaluating Government Bond Fund Performance with Stochastic Discount Factors 
Abstract:
  This article shows how to evaluate the performance of managed portfolios
 using stochastic discount factors (SDFs) from continuous-time term
 structure models. These models imply empirical factors that include time
 averages of the underlying state variables. The approach addresses a
 performance measurement bias, described by Goetzmann, Ingersoll, and
 Ivkovic (2000) and Ferson and Khang (2002), arising because fund managers
 may trade within the return measurement interval or hold positions in
 replicable options. The empirical factors contribute explanatory power in
 factor model regressions and reduce model pricing errors. We illustrate
 the approach on US government bond funds during 1986--2000.   Copyright 2006, Oxford University Press.

Title: Explaining Credit Default Swap Spreads with the Equity Volatility and Jump Risks of Individual Firms 
Abstract:
 This paper attempts to explain the credit default swap (CDS) premium,
 using a novel approach to identify the volatility and jump risks of
 individual firms from high-frequency equity prices. Our empirical results
 suggest that the volatility risk alone predicts 48% of the variation in
 CDS spread levels, whereas the jump risk alone forecasts 19%. After
 controlling for credit ratings, macroeconomic conditions, and firms'
 balance sheet information, we can explain 73% of the total variation. We
 calibrate a Merton-type structural model with stochastic volatility and
 jumps, which can help to match credit spreads after controlling for the
 historical default rates. Simulation evidence suggests that the
 high-frequency-based volatility measures can help to explain the credit
 spreads, above and beyond what is already captured by the true leverage
 ratio.  The Author 2009. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org, Oxford University Press.

Title: Optimal Consumption and Portfolio Choices with Risky Housing and Borrowing Constraints 
Abstract:
  We examine the optimal dynamic portfolio decisions for investors who
 acquire housing services from either renting or owning a house. Our
 results show that when indifferent between owning and renting, investors
 owning a house hold a lower equity proportion in their net worth (bonds,
 stocks, and home equity), reflecting the substitution effect, yet hold a
 higher equity proportion in their liquid portfolios (bonds and stocks),
 reflecting the diversification effect. Furthermore, following the
 suboptimal policy of always renting leads investors to overweigh in
 stocks, while following the suboptimal policy of always owning a house
 causes investors to underweigh in stocks.   Copyright 2005, Oxford University Press.

Title: Common Risk Factors in Currency Markets 
Abstract:
 We identify a "slope" factor in exchange rates. High interest rate
 currencies load more on this slope factor than low interest rate
 currencies. This factor accounts for most of the cross-sectional variation
 in average excess returns between high and low interest rate currencies. A
 standard, no-arbitrage model of interest rates with two factors--a
 country-specific factor and a global factor--can replicate these findings,
 provided there is sufficient heterogeneity in exposure to global or common
 innovations. We show that our slope factor identifies these common shocks,
 and we provide empirical evidence that it is related to changes in global
 equity market volatility. By investing in high interest rate currencies
 and borrowing in low interest rate currencies, U.S. investors load up on
 global risk.  The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: Risk Adjustment and Trading Strategies 
Abstract:
  We assess the profitability of momentum strategies using a stochastic
 discount factor approach. In unconditional tests, approximately half of
 the strategies' profitability is explained. In conditional tests we see a
 further slight decline in profits. We argue that the risk of these
 strategies should be increasing in the market risk premium. Empirically,
 while their risk measures estimated relative to the stochastic discount
 factor behave as predicted, market betas do not; thus capital asset
 pricing model (CAPM)-like benchmarks may lead to incorrect inferences.
 Given that our nonparametric risk adjustment explains roughly half of
 momentum strategy profits, we cannot rule out the possibility of residual
 mispricing.   Copyright 2003, Oxford University Press.

Title: Factor-Loading Uncertainty and Expected Returns 
Abstract:
 Firm-specific information can affect expected returns if it affects
 investor uncertainty about risk-factor loadings. We show that a stock's
 expected return is decreasing in factor-loading uncertainty, controlling
 for the average level of its factor loading. When loadings are persistent,
 learning by investors can induce time-series variation in price-dividend
 ratios, expected returns, and idiosyncratic volatility, even when the
 aggregate risk-premium is constant and fundamental shocks are
 homoscedastic. Consistent with our predictions, we estimate that average
 annual returns of a firm with the median level of factor-loading
 uncertainty are 400 to 525 basis points lower than a comparable firm
 without factor-loading uncertainty.  The Author 2012. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title:   Toeholds, Bid Jumps, and Expected Payoffs in Takeovers.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 841-82
Issue: 4
Volume: 13
Year: 2000
Abstract:
  We estimate sequentially outcome probabilities and expected payoffs
 associated with first, second, and final bids in a large sample of tender
 offer contests. Rival bids arrive quickly and produce large bid jumps.
 Greater bidder toeholds (prebid ownership of target shares) reduce the
 probability of competition and target resistance and are associated with
 both lower bid premiums and lower prebid target stock price runups. The
 expected payoff to target shareholders is increasing in the bid premium
 and in the probability of competition, but decreasing in the bidder's
 toehold. The initial bidder's expected payoff is significantly positive in
 the "rival-bidder-win" outcome, in part reflecting gains from the pending
 toehold sale. Despite these dramatic toehold effects, only half of the
 initial bidders acquire toeholds.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title:   Deposits and Relationship Lending.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 579-607
Issue: 3
Volume: 12
Year: 1999
Abstract:
  We empirically examine whether access to deposits with inelastic rates
 (core deposits) permits a bank to make contractual agreements with
 borrowers that are infeasible if the bank must pay market rates for funds.
 Such access insulates a bank's costs of funds from exogenous shocks,
 allowing it to insulate its borrowers against exogenous credit shocks. We
 find that, controlling for loan market competition, banks funded more
 heavily with core deposits provide more loan rate smoothing in response to
 exogenous changes in aggregate credit risk. Thus we provide evidence for a
 novel channel linking bank liabilities to relationship lending.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Trading Fees and Efficiency in Limit Order Markets 
Abstract:
 Competition among trading platforms has considerably reduced trading fees
 in stock markets. We show that this evolution is not necessarily
 beneficial to investors. Although they increase gains from trade when a
 trade happens, lower trading costs can induce investors to post limit
 orders with a smaller execution probability. In this case, gains from
 trade are realized less frequently and investors can be worse off. Our
 model has testable implications for the effects of trading fees and their
 breakdown between liquidity suppliers and liquidity demanders on limit
 order fill rates and bid-ask spreads.  The Author 2012. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: Do Investment Banks Matter for M&A Returns? 
Abstract:
 We document a significant investment bank fixed effect in the announcement
 returns of M&A deals. The interquartile range of bank fixed effects is
 1.26%, compared with a full-sample average return of 0.72%. The results
 remain significant after controlling for the component of returns
 attributable to the acquirer. Our findings suggest that investment banks
 matter for M&A outcomes, and contrast earlier studies that show no
 positive link between various measures of advisor quality and M&A returns.
 Differences in average returns across banks are also persistent over time
 and predictable from prior performance. Clients do not chase past returns,
 which may explain why persistence exists in M&A performance while it is
 absent in mutual funds.  The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: Learning and Asset Prices Under Ambiguous Information 
Abstract:
 In a Lucas exchange economy with standard power utility, we study asset
 prices under learning and ambiguous information. In contrast with models
 featuring only learning or ambiguity, our model is successful in matching
 the equity premium, the interest rate, and the volatility of stock returns
 under empirically reasonable parameters. Our closed-form formulas also
 show that a severe downward bias arises in the empirical relation between
 stock returns and return volatility. We quantify this bias in simulations
 and show that our model can explain why such a relation is difficult to
 detect in the data.  The Author 2007. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title: Harming Depositors and Helping Borrowers: The Disparate Impact of Bank Consolidation 
Abstract:
 A model of multimarket spatial competition is developed where small,
 single-market banks compete with large, multimarket banks (LMBs) for
 retail loans and deposits. Consistent with empirical evidence, LMBs are
 assumed to set retail interest rates uniformly across markets, have
 different operating costs, and have access to wholesale funding. If LMBs
 have significant funding advantages that offset potential loan operating
 cost disadvantages, then market-extension mergers by LMBs promote loan
 competition, especially in concentrated markets. However, such mergers
 reduce retail deposit competition, especially in less concentrated
 markets. Prior empirical research and our own analysis of retail deposit
 rates support the model's predictions.  The Author 2008. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title:   The Dynamics of Default and Debt Reorganization.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 535-78
Issue: 3
Volume: 12
Year: 1999
Abstract:
  This article documents the fact that when debtors decide to default on
 their obligations too early, it is in the creditors' collective interest,
 as residual claimants, to make concessions prior to forcing a costly
 liquidation. Symmetrically, when debtors prefer to default at an
 inefficiently late stage, it is in the creditors' interest to propose a
 departure from the absolute priority rule. This article develops a
 continuous time pricing model of dynamic debt restructuring that reflects
 the crucial influence of the two counterparties' relative bargaining
 power. Simple and intuitive path-dependent pricing formulae are derived
 for equity and debt. The debt capacity as well as the evolution of the
 firm's capital structure throughout its existence is provided.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

 in 30 stocks. Effective spreads cannot be matched. However, the

Title: How Important Is the Financial Media in Global Markets? 
Abstract:
 This article studies differences in the information content of 870,000
 news announcements in 56 markets around the world. In most developed
 markets, a firm's stock price moves much more on days with public news
 about the firm. In contrast, in many emerging markets volatility is
 similar on news and non-news days. We examine several hypotheses for our
 findings. Cross-country differences in stock price reactions are best
 explained by insider trading, followed by differences in the quality of
 the news dissemination mechanism. Our findings are useful for quantifying
 the extent of insider trading and how the financial media affects
 international markets.  The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Pages: 461-79
Issue: 3
Volume: 12
Year: 1999
Abstract:
  This article integrates strategic product market analysis with
 price-taking asset pricing theory. We demonstrate that a firm's market
 power can lead to scale-dependent and potentially infinite required
 returns. Scale dependency, which we relate to risk spillovers between
 expansionary and existing cash flows, reflects the divergence of
 incremental from existing required returns. The firm-specific nature of
 risk spillovers potentially destroys the concept of a common industry
 'risk class'. Our analysis raises important questions regarding the
 validity of widely used 'comparables' methods for determining
 risk-adjusted discount rates.	 Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title:   Global Diversification, Growth, and Welfare with Imperfectly Integrated Markets for Goods.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 277-305
Issue: 1
Volume: 14
Year: 2001
Abstract:
  In this article we examine the effect of the imperfect mobility of goods
 on international risk sharing and, through that, on the investment in
 risky projects, welfare, and growth. Our main result is that the welfare
 gain from integration of financial markets is not greatly reduced by the
 presence of goods market imperfections, modeled as a cost of transferring
 goods from one country to the other. We also find that the gain is
 nonmonotonic with respect to investors' risk aversion and the aggregate
 volatility of output growth. The policy implication to be drawn is that
 financial market integration is a worthwhile goal to pursue even when full
 goods mobility has not been achieved.	 Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Large Shareholders and Corporate Policies 
Abstract:
 We analyze the effects of heterogeneity across large shareholders, using a
 new blockholder-firm panel dataset in which we can track all unique
 blockholders among large public firms in the United States. We find
 statistically significant and economically important blockholder fixed
 effects in investment, financial, and executive compensation policies. We
 also find blockholder fixed effects in firm performance measures, and
 differences in corporate policies are systematically related to
 differences in firm performance. We study potential sources of the
 heterogeneity and find that blockholders with a larger block size, board
 membership, direct management involvement, or with a single decision maker
 are associated with larger effects on corporate policies and firm
 performance.  The Author 2008. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title: Greener Pastures and the Impact of Dynamic Institutional Preferences 
Abstract:
  Although institutional investors have a preference for large
 capitalization stocks, over time they have shifted their preferences
 toward smaller, riskier securities. These changes in aggregate preferences
 have arisen primarily from changes in the preferences of each class of
 institution, rather than changes in the importance of different classes.
 Evidence also suggests that recent growth in institutional investment
 combined with this shift in preferences helps explain why markets in
 general, and smaller stocks in particular, have exhibited greater
 firm-specific risk and liquidity in recent years. Additional analyses
 suggest that institutional investors moved toward smaller securities
 because such securities offer "greener pastures."   Copyright 2003, Oxford University Press.

Title: Information Sales and Strategic Trading 
Abstract:
 We study information sales in financial markets with strategic risk-averse
 traders. The optimal selling mechanism is one of the following two: (i)
 sell to as many agents as possible very imprecise information; (ii) sell
 to a small number of agents information as precise as possible. As
 risk-sharing considerations prevail over the negative effects of
 competition, the newsletters or rumors associated with (i) dominate the
 exclusivity contract in (ii). These allocations of information have
 implications for price informativeness and trading volume, and thus we
 suggest a direct link between properties of asset prices and financial
 intermediation. Moreover, as more information is sold when the externality
 in its valuation is relatively less intense, we find a ranking reversal of
 the informational content of prices between (a) market structures
 (market-orders vs. limit-orders); and (b) models of traders' behavior
 (imperfect vs. perfect competition).  The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: Two Trees 
Abstract:
 We solve a model with two i.i.d. Lucas trees. Although the corresponding
 one-tree model produces a constant price-dividend ratio and i.i.d.
 returns, the two-tree model produces interesting asset-pricing dynamics.
 Investors want to rebalance their portfolios after any change in value.
 Because the size of the trees is fixed, prices must adjust to offset this
 desire. As a result, expected returns, excess returns, and return
 volatility all vary through time. Returns display serial correlation and
 are predictable from price-dividend ratios. Return volatility differs from
 cash-flow volatility, and return shocks can occur without news about cash
 flows.  The Author 2007. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org, Oxford University Press.

Title: Limit Order Book as a Market for Liquidity 
Abstract:
  We develop a dynamic model of a limit order market populated by strategic
 liquidity traders of varying impatience. In equilibrium, patient traders
 tend to submit limit orders, whereas impatient traders submit market
 orders. Two variables are the key determinants of the limit order book
 dynamics in equilibrium: the proportion of patient traders and the order
 arrival rate. We offer several testable implications for various market
 quality measures such as spread, trading frequency, market resiliency, and
 time to execution for limit orders. Finally, we show the effect of
 imposing a minimal price variation on these measures.   Copyright 2005, Oxford University Press.

Title: A Theory of IPO Waves 
Abstract:
 In the IPO market, investors coordinate on acceptable IPO price based on
 the performance of past IPOs, and this generates an incentive for
 investment banks to produce information about IPO firms. In hot periods,
 the information produced by investment banks improves the quality of IPO
 firms, and this allows ex ante low quality firms to go public and
 increases the secondary market price, thus synchronizing high IPO volumes
 and high first day returns. When investment banks behave asymmetrically in
 information production, the &#x201C;reputations&#x201D; of investment
 banks are interpreted as a form of market segmentation to economize on the
 social cost of information production.  , Oxford University Press.

Title:   On the Estimation of Beta-Pricing Models.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 1-33
Issue: 1
Volume: 5
Year: 1992
Abstract:
  An integrated econometric view of maximum likelihood methods and more
 traditional two-pass approaches to estimating beta-pricing models is
 presented. Several aspects of the well-known errors-in-variables problem
 are considered, and an earlier conjecture concerning the merits of
 simultaneous estimation of beta and price of risk parameters is evaluated.
 The traditional inference procedure is found, under standard assumptions,
 to overstate the precision of price of risk estimates and an
 asymptotically valid correction is derived. Modifications to accommodate
 serial correlation in market-wide factors are also discussed.	 Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title:   The Effect of Derivative Assets on Information Acquisition and Price Behavior in a Rational Expectations Equilibrium.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 131-63
Issue: 1
Volume: 12
Year: 1999
Abstract:
  This article shows that introducing derivative assets increases
 incentives to collect information about asset payoffs. The increase in
 information collection makes the price of the underlying asset more
 informative and causes the expected price to increase. Extending the model
 to a dynamic setting with multiple risky assets, we find the introducing
 derivative assets for one asset increases the expected prices of
 positively correlated assets and reduces price reaction to future earnings
 announcements. These findings are consistent with the bulk of the
 empirical evidence on the relationship between the introduction of
 derivative assets and the behavior of asset prices.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Stock Return Predictability: A Bayesian Model Selection Perspective 
Abstract:
  Attempts to characterize stock return predictability have resulted in
 little consensus on the important conditioning variables, giving rise to
 model uncertainty and data snooping fears. We introduce a new methodology
 that explicitly incorporates model uncertainty by comparing all possible
 models simultaneously and in which the priors are calibrated to reflect
 economically meaningful information. Our approach minimizes data snooping
 given the information set and the priors. We compare the prior views of a
 skeptic and a confident investor. The data imply posterior probabilities
 that are in general more supportive of stock return predictability than
 the priors for both types of investors.   Copyright 2002, Oxford University Press.

Title: Improved Estimates of Higher-Order Comoments and Implications for Portfolio Selection 
Abstract:
 In the presence of nonnormally distributed asset returns, optimal
 portfolio selection techniques require estimates for variance-covariance
 parameters, along with estimates for higher-order moments and comoments of
 the return distribution. This is a formidable challenge that severely
 exacerbates the dimensionality problem already present with mean-variance
 analysis. This article extends the existing literature, which has mostly
 focused on the covariance matrix, by introducing improved estimators for
 the coskewness and cokurtosis parameters. We find that the use of these
 enhanced estimates generates a significant improvement in investors'
 welfare. We also find that it is only when improved estimators are used
 that portfolio selection with higher-order moments dominates mean-variance
 analysis from an out-of-sample perspective.  The Author 2009. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org, Oxford University Press.

Title: Global versus Local Asset Pricing: A New Test of Market Integration 
Abstract:
 Should capital cost calculations be based on a global or local market
 benchmark? The December 2000 redefinition of the Morgan Stanley Capital
 International (MSCI) global equity index was a natural experiment
 addressing this question. It is argued that this event triggered a
 portfolio shift (by index funds) large enough to affect the residual asset
 supplies constituting the global and local market benchmarks of all
 actively managed capital. Changes in the market benchmarks imply distinct
 and predictable changes to global and local stock betas. Exploring whether
 global or local beta changes best explain the cross-section of event
 returns reveals that stocks in developed markets are priced globally and
 not locally.  The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: Why Do Larger Orders Receive Discounts on the London Stock Exchange? 
Abstract:
  We argue that competition between dealers in a classic dealer market is
 intertemporal: A trader identifies a particular dealer and negotiates a
 final price with only the intertemporal threat to switch dealers imposing
 pricing discipline on the dealer. In this kind of market structure, we
 show that dealers will offer greater price improvement to more regular
 customers, and, in turn, these customers optimally choose to submit larger
 orders. Hence, price improvement and trade size should be negatively
 correlated in a dealer market. We confirm our model's predictions using
 unique data from the London Stock Exchange during 1991.   Copyright 2005, Oxford University Press.

Title: Where Is the Market? Evidence from Cross-Listings in the United States 
Abstract:
 We analyze the location of stock trading for firms with a US
 cross-listing. The fraction of trading that occurs in the United States
 tends to be larger for companies from countries that are geographically
 close to the United States and feature low financial development and poor
 insider trading protection. For companies based in developed countries,
 trading volume in the United States is larger if the company is small,
 volatile, and technology-oriented, while this does not apply to emerging
 country firms. The domestic turnover rate increases in the cross-listing
 year and remains higher for firms based in developed markets, but not for
 emerging market firms. Domestic trading volume actually declines for
 companies from countries with poor enforcement of insider trading
 regulation.  The Author 2007. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title:   Agency and Brokerage of Real Assets in Competitive Equilibrium.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 239-80
Issue: 2
Volume: 11
Year: 1998
Abstract:
  Brokerage contracts for many categories of real assets are characterized
 by a common, constant commission rate payable upon sale, exclusive agency,
 and contractual asking prices. For a large market in steady state, these
 conventional contracts produce in equilibrium no agency problem between a
 broker and his clients. Each broker spends the same time or effort selling
 each client's asset as the broker would spend on his own assets. As in
 standard agency problems, extra effort by a broker generates first-order
 stochastically dominant distributions of bids by potential buyers. Unlike
 standard agency problems, each broker can allocate his time or effort
 between selling the assets of his multiple clients and searching for new
 clients in competition with other brokers. Because brokers' time spent
 searching for new sellers is dissipative, entry by brokers is excessive in
 equilibrium.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Multiple Unit Auctions and Short Squeezes 
Abstract:
  This article develops a theory of multiunit auctions where short squeezes
 can occur in the secondary market. Both uniform and discriminatory
 auctions are studied and bidders can submit multiple bids. We show that
 bidders with short and long preauction positions have different valuations
 in an otherwise common value setting. Discriminatory auctions lead to more
 short squeezing and higher revenue than uniform auctions, ceteris paribus.
 Asymptotically, as the auction size approaches infinity, the two formats
 lead to equivalent outcomes. Shorts employ more aggressive equilibrium
 bidding strategies. Most longs strategically choose to be passive. Free
 riding on a squeeze by small, long players has no impact on these results,
 but affects revenue in discriminatory auctions.   Copyright 2004, Oxford University Press.

Title: Does Idiosyncratic Volatility Proxy for Risk Exposure? 
Abstract:
 We decompose aggregate market variance into an average correlation
 component and an average variance component. Only the latter commands a
 negative price of risk in the cross section of portfolios sorted by
 idiosyncratic volatility. Portfolios with high (low) idiosyncratic
 volatility relative to the Fama-French (1993) model have positive
 (negative) exposures to innovations in average stock variance and
 therefore lower (higher) expected returns. These two findings explain the
 idiosyncratic volatility puzzle of Ang et al. (2006, 2009). The factor
 related to innovations in average variance also reduces the pricing errors
 of book-to-market and momentum portfolios relative to the Fama-French
 (1993) model.  The Author 2012. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oup.com, Oxford University Press.

 demands: risk-averse arbitrageurs can use the new market to hedge their
 positions in the preexisting security, which can affect liquidity in the
 old market. More generally, the availability of such hedging opportunities
 will influence the strategies to which traders will direct resources.	 Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: How Active Is Your Fund Manager? A New Measure That Predicts Performance 
Abstract:
 We introduce a new measure of active portfolio management, Active Share,
 which represents the share of portfolio holdings that differ from the
 benchmark index holdings. We compute Active Share for domestic equity
 mutual funds from 1980 to 2003. We relate Active Share to fund
 characteristics such as size, expenses, and turnover in the cross-section,
 and we also examine its evolution over time. Active Share predicts fund
 performance: funds with the highest Active Share significantly outperform
 their benchmarks, both before and after expenses, and they exhibit strong
 performance persistence. Nonindex funds with the lowest Active Share
 underperform their benchmarks.  The Author 2009. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org, Oxford University Press.

Title: Do Envious CEOs Cause Merger Waves? 
Abstract:
 We develop a theory which shows that merger waves can arise even when the
 shocks that precipitated the initial mergers in the wave are
 idiosyncratic. The analysis predicts that the earlier acquisitions produce
 higher bidder returns, involve smaller targets, and result in higher
 compensation gains for the acquirer's top management team than the later
 acquisitions in the wave. We find strong empirical support for these
 predictions. The model also generates additional predictions, some of
 which remain to be tested.  The Author 2009. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Abstract:
  The author investigate the empirical importance of information revelation
 in the pricing of block trades. In particular, he examine whether block
 prices are correlated with the unexpected part of firms' quarterly

Title: Variance Risk-Premium Dynamics: The Role of Jumps 
Abstract:
 Using high-frequency stock market data and (synthetic) variance swap
 rates, this paper identifies and investigates the temporal variation in
 the market variance risk-premium. The variance risk is manifest in two
 salient features of financial returns: stochastic volatility and jumps.
 The pricing of these two components is analyzed in a general
 semiparametric framework. The key empirical results imply that investors'
 fears of future jumps are especially sensitive to recent jump activity and
 that their willingness to pay for protection against jumps increases
 significantly immediately after the occurrence of jumps. This in turn
 suggests that time-varying risk aversion, as previously documented in the
 literature, is primarily driven by large, or extreme, market moves. The
 dynamics of risk-neutral jump intensity extracted from deep
 out-of-the-money put options confirms these findings.  The Author 2009. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org, Oxford University Press.

Title: Portfolio Selection in Stochastic Environments 
Abstract:
  In this article, I explicitly solve dynamic portfolio choice problems, up
 to the solution of an ordinary differential equation (ODE), when the asset
 returns are quadratic and the agent has a constant relative risk aversion
 (CRRA) coefficient. My solution includes as special cases many existing
 explicit solutions of dynamic portfolio choice problems. I also present
 three applications that are not in the literature. Application 1 is the
 bond portfolio selection problem when bond returns are described by
 "quadratic term structure models." Application 2 is the stock portfolio
 selection problem when stock return volatility is stochastic as in Heston
 model. Application 3 is a bond and stock portfolio selection problem when
 the interest rate is stochastic and stock returns display stochastic
 volatility. (JEL G11)   Copyright 2007, Oxford University Press.

Title: Expected Returns and Expected Growth in Rents of Commercial Real Estate 
Abstract:
 Commercial real estate expected returns and expected rent growth rates are
 time-varying. Relying on transactions data from a cross-section of U.S.
 metropolitan areas, we find that up to 30% of the variability of realized
 returns to commercial real estate can be accounted for by expected return
 variability, while expected rent growth rate variability explains up to
 45% of the variability of realized rent growth rates. The cap rate--that
 is, the rent-price ratio in commercial real estate--captures fluctuations
 in expected returns for apartments and retail properties, as well as
 industrial properties. For offices, by contrast, cap rates do not forecast
 (in-sample) returns even though expected returns on offices are also
 time-varying. As implied by the present value relation, cap rates
 marginally forecast office rent growth but not rent growth of apartments,
 retail properties, and industrial properties. We link these differences in
 in-sample predictability to differences in the stochastic properties of
 the underlying commercial real estate data-generating processes. Also,
 rent growth predictability is observed mostly in locations characterized
 by higher population density and stringent land-use restrictions. The
 opposite is true for return predictability. The dynamic portfolio
 implications of time-varying commercial real estate returns are also
 explored in the context of a portfolio manager investing in the aggregate
 stock market and Treasury bills, as well as commercial real estate.  The Author 2010. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title:   Equilibrium Mispricing in a Capital Market with Portfolio Constraints.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 715-48
Issue: 3
Volume: 13
Year: 2000
Abstract:
  This article develops a general equilibrium, continuous time model where
 portfolio constraints generate mispricing between redundant securities.
 Constrained consumption-portfolio optimization techniques are adapted to
 incorporate redundant, possibly mispriced securities. Under logarithmic
 preferences, we provide explicit conditions for mispricing and closed-form
 expressions for all economic quantities. Existence of an equilibrium where
 mispricing occurs with positive probability is verified in a specific
 case. In a more general setting, we demonstrate the necessity of
 mispricing for equilibrium when agents are heterogeneous enough. The
 construction of a representative agent with stochastic weights allows us
 to characterize prices and allocations, given mispricing occurs.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title:   Closed-End Country Funds and U.S. Market Sentiment.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 879-918
Issue: 3
Volume: 8
Year: 1995
Abstract:
  Closed-end country funds can trade at large premiums and discounts from
 their foreign asset vales (NAVs). Investigating this anomaly, we find that
 individual fund premiums move together, primarily because of the
 comovement of their stock prices with the U.S. market. Moreover, an index
 of country fund premiums differentiates size-ranked U.S. portfolio returns
 and forecasts country fund stock returns. These findings suggest that
 international equity prices are affected by local risk. In particular, we
 show that country fund premium movements reflect a U.S specific risk,
 which may be interpreted as U.S. market sentiment.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: The Real Effects of Debt Certification: Evidence from the Introduction of Bank Loan Ratings 
Abstract:
 I examine the introduction of syndicated bank loan ratings by Moody's and
 Standard & Poor's in 1995 to evaluate whether third-party rating agencies
 affect firm financial and investment policy. The introduction of bank loan
 ratings leads to an increase in the use of debt by firms that obtain a
 rating, and also increases in firms' asset growth, cash acquisitions, and
 investment in working capital. Consistent with a causal effect of the
 ratings, the increase in debt usage and investment is concentrated in the
 set of borrowers who are of lower credit quality and do not have an issuer
 credit rating before 1995. A loan-level analysis demonstrates that
 previously unrated borrowers who obtain a loan rating gain increased
 access to the capital of less-informed investors. The results suggest that
 third-party debt certification has real effects on firm investment policy.  The Author 2007. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org, Oxford University Press.

Title: Cross-Sectional and Time-Series Determinants of Momentum Returns 
Abstract:
  Portfolio strategies that buy stocks with high returns over the previous
 3--12 months and sell stocks with low returns over this same time period
 perform well over the following 12 months. A recent article by Conrad and
 Kaul (1998) presents striking evidence suggesting that the momentum
 profits are attributable to cross-sectional differences in expected
 returns rather than to any time-series dependence in returns. This article
 shows that Conrad and Kaul reach this conclusion because they do not take
 into account the small sample biases in their tests and bootstrap
 experiments. Our unbiased empirical tests indicate that cross-sectional
 differences in expected returns explain very little, if any, of the
 momentum profits.   Copyright 2002, Oxford University Press.

Year: 2001
Abstract:
  This article examines the use of foreign currency derivatives (FCDs) in a
 sample of 720 large U.S. nonfinancial firms between 1990 and 1995 and its
 potential impact on firm value. Using Tobin's Q as a proxy for firm value,
 we find a positive relation between firm value and the use of FCDs. The
 hedging premium is statistically and economically significant for firms
 with exposure to exchange rates and is on average 4.87% of firm value. We
 also find some evidence consistent with the hypothesis that hedging causes
 an increase in firm value.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title:   Trading Volume: Definitions, Data Analysis, and Implications of Portfolio Theory.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 257-300
Issue: 2
Volume: 13
Year: 2000
Abstract:
  We examine the implications of portfolio theory for the cross-sectional
 behavior of equity trading volume. Two-fund separation theorems suggest a
 natural definition for trading activity: share turnover. If two-fund
 separation holds, share turnover must be identical for all securities. If
 (K + 1)-fund separation holds, we show that turnover satisfies an
 approximately linear K-factor structure. These implications are examined
 empirically using individual weekly turnover data for NYSE and AMEX
 securities from 1962 to 1996. We find strong evidence against two-fund
 separation, and a principal-components decomposition suggests that
 turnover is well approximated by a two-factor linear model.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

  Using a unique dataset based on daily and hourly high-yield bond

 prices is similar to that of the underlying stocks. We find that stocks do
 not lead bonds in reflecting firm-specific information. We further examine
 price behavior around earnings news and find that information is quickly
 incorporated into both bond and stock prices, even at short return
 horizons. Finally, we find that measures of market quality are no poorer

Title: Market-Based Corrective Actions 
Abstract:
 Many economic agents take corrective actions based on information inferred
 from market prices of firms' securities. Examples include directors and
 activists intervening in the management of firms and bank supervisors
 taking actions to improve the health of financial institutions. We provide
 an equilibrium analysis of such situations in light of a key problem: if
 agents use market prices when deciding on corrective actions, prices
 adjust to reflect this use and potentially become less revealing. We show
 that market information and agents' information are complementary, and
 discuss measures that can increase agents' ability to learn from market
 prices.  The Author 2009. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org, Oxford University Press.

Volume: 12
Year: 1999
Abstract:
  We study the precursors and outcomes of refocusing episodes by 107
 diversified firms that were not taken over between 1984 and 1993. These
 firms had more value-reducing diversification policies than diversified
 firms that did not refocus. However, major disciplinary or
 incentive-altering events (including management turnover, outside
 shareholder pressure, changes in management compensation, and financial
 distress) usually occurred before refocusing took place. The cumulative
 abnormal returns over a firm's refocusing-related announcements averaged
 7.3% and were significantly related to the amount of value reduction
 associated with the refocuser's diversification policy.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Abstract:
 This paper proposes a new method of forming basis assets. We use return
 correlations to sort securities into portfolios and compare the inferences
 drawn from this set of basis assets with those drawn from other benchmark
 portfolios. The proposed set of portfolios appears capable of generating
 measures of risk--return trade-off that are estimated with a lower error.
 In tests of asset pricing models, we find that the returns of these
 portfolios are significantly and positively related to both CAPM and
 Consumption CAPM risk measures, and there are significant components of
 these returns that are not captured by the three-factor model.  The Author 2009. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org, Oxford University Press.

  The valuation of debt and equity, reorganization boundaries, and firm's

 debt-equity swaps and strategic debt service resulting from negotiated
 debt service reductions. We study the effects of bond covenants on payout
 policies and distinguish liquidity-induced defaults from strategic
 defaults. We derive optimal equity issuance and payout policies. The debt
 capacity of the firm and the optimal capital structure are characterized.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

 they receive favorable private information. This result is consistent with

 explaining how taxes can affect corporate decision making and firm value

 a discussion of unresolved issues. Tax research generally supports the
 hypothesis that high tax rate firms pursue policies that provide tax
 benefits. Many issues remain unresolved, however, including understanding
 whether tax effects are of first-order importance, why firms do not pursue
 tax benefits more aggressively, and whether corporate actions are affected
 by investor-level taxes.   Copyright 2003, Oxford University Press.

Title: Anonymity, Adverse Selection, and the Sorting of Interdealer Trades 
Abstract:
  This article uses unique data from the London Stock Exchange to examine
 how trader anonymity and market liquidity affect dealers' decisions about
 where to place interdealer trades. During our sample period, dealers could
 trade with each other in the direct, nonanonymous public market or use one
 of four anonymous brokered trading systems. Surprisingly, we find that
 adverse selection is less prevalent in the anonymous brokered markets. We
 show that this pattern can be explained by the way dealers "price" the
 adverse selection risk inherent in trading with other dealers. We also
 relate our findings to recent changes in dealer markets.   Copyright 2005, Oxford University Press.

Volume: 13
Year: 2000
Abstract:
  We analyze a model of voluntary disclosure by firms and the desirability

 private and social value, and its precision is endogenous. We show that
 (i) a convexity in the value of disclosure can lead to a discontinuity in
 the disclosure policy; (ii) the Nash equilibrium of a voluntary disclosure
 game is often socially inefficient; (iii) regulation that requires a
 minimal precision level sometimes but not always improves welfare; (iii)
 the same is true for subsidies that change the perceived cost of
 disclosures; and (iv) neither regulation method dominates the other.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: A Trade-Based Analysis of Momentum 
Abstract:
  This article uses transactions data for all NYSE/AMEX stocks in the
 period 1983--2002 to study how investors trade in Jegadeesh and Titman's
 (1993) momentum portfolios. Among small trades, there is an extremely
 sluggish reaction to the past returns. For instance, an initial
 small-trade buying pressure exists for loser stocks, and it gradually
 converts into an intense selling pressure over the following year. The
 results are consistent with initial underreaction followed by delayed
 reaction among small traders. Moreover, small-trade imbalances during the
 formation period significantly affect momentum returns, suggesting that
 underreaction among small traders contributes to the momentum effect.
 Large traders, by contrast, show no evidence of underreaction, and
 large-trade imbalances have little impact on subsequent returns. Overall,
 the results suggest that momentum could partly be driven by the behavior
 of small traders.   Copyright 2006, Oxford University Press.

Abstract:
  We propose alternative generalized method of moments (GMM) tests that are

 analytical GMM tests for asset pricing models with time-varying risk
 premiums. We also provide simulation evidence showing that the proposed
 tests have good finite sample properties and that their asymptotic
 distribution is reliable for the sample size commonly used. We apply our
 tests to study the number of latent factors in the predictable variations
 of the returns on portfolios grouped by industries. Using data from
 October 1941 to September 1986 and two sets of instrumental variables, we
 find that the tests reject a one-factor model but not a two-factor one.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 1033-59
Issue: 4
Volume: 9
Year: 1996
Abstract:
  Within the past few years several articles have suggested that returns on
 large equity portfolios may contain a significant predictable component at
 horizons three to six years. Subsequently, the tests used in these
 analyses have been criticized (appropriately) for having widely
 misunderstood size and power, rendering the conclusions inappropriate.
 This criticism, however, has not focused on the data, it addresses the
 properties of the tests. In this article we adopt a subjectivist
 analysis--treating the data as fixed--to ascertain whether the data have
 anything to say about the permanent-temporary decomposition. The data
 speak clearly and they tell us that for all intents and purposes, stock
 prices follow a random walk.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Investment Banks as Insiders and the Market for Corporate Control 
Abstract:
 We study holdings in merger and acquisition (M&A) targets by financial
 conglomerates in which affiliated investment banks advise the bidders. We
 show that advisors take positions in the targets before M&A announcements.
 These stakes are positively related to the probability of observing the
 bid and to the target premium. We argue that this can be explained in
 terms of advisors who are privy to important information about the deal,
 investing in the target in the expectation of its price increasing. We
 document the high profits of this strategy. The advisory stake is
 positively related to the likelihood of deal completion and to the
 termination fees. However, these deals are not wealth creating: there is a
 negative relation between the advisory stake and the viability of the
 deal.  The Author 2009. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title: Scaling the Hierarchy: How and Why Investment Banks Compete for Syndicate Co-management Appointments 
Abstract:
 We show that relatively optimistic research and even the mere provision of
 research coverage for the issuer (regardless of its direction) attract
 co-management appointments for securities offerings. Co-management
 appointments are valuable because they help banks establish relationships
 with issuers. These relationships, in turn, substantially increase the
 banks' chances of winning more lucrative lead-management mandates in the
 future. This is true even in the presence of historically exclusive
 banking relationships.  The Author 2009. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title: Dynamic Mean-Variance Asset Allocation 
Abstract:
 We solve the dynamic mean-variance portfolio problem and derive its
 time-consistent solution using dynamic programming. Previous literature,
 in contrast, only determines either myopic or precommitment (committing to
 follow the initially optimal policy) solutions. We provide a fully
 analytical simple characterization of the dynamically optimal
 mean-variance portfolios within a general incomplete-market economy. We
 also identify a probability measure that incorporates intertemporal
 hedging demands and facilitates tractability. We illustrate this by easily
 computing portfolios explicitly under various stochastic investment
 opportunities. A calibration exercise shows that the mean-variance hedging
 demands are economically significant.   The Author 2010. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title: Investor Protection and Interest Group Politics 
Abstract:
 We model how three groups--insiders in existing public companies,
 institutional investors, and entrepreneurs planning to take firms
 public--compete for influence over politicians setting the level of
 investor protection. We identify factors that push toward suboptimal
 investor protection, including corporate insiders' ability to use public
 firms' assets to influence politicians, and institutional investors'
 inability to capture fully the value of investor protection for outside
 investors. Entrepreneurs and public firms' interest in raising equity
 capital does not fully eliminate the distortions arising from insiders
 seeking to extract rents from capital in place. Our analysis produces many
 testable predictions concerning how investor protection varies over time
 and around the world.  The Author 2009. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title: A Market-Based Study of the Cost of Default 
Abstract:
 This article proposes a novel method of extracting the cost of default
 from the change in the market value of a firm's assets upon default. Using
 a large sample of firms with observed prices of debt and equity that
 defaulted over fourteen years, we estimate the cost of default for an
 average defaulting firm to be 21.7% of the market value of assets. The
 costs vary from 14.7% for bond renegotiations to 30.5% for bankruptcies,
 and are substantially higher for investment-grade firms (28.8%) than for
 highly levered bond issuers (20.2%), which extant estimates are based on
 exclusively. (JEL G21, G30, G33)  The Author 2012. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: Optimal Priority Structure, Capital Structure, and Investment 
Abstract:
 We study the interaction between financing and investment decisions in a
 dynamic model, where the firm has multiple debt issues and equityholders
 choose the timing of investment. Jointly optimal capital and priority
 structures can virtually eliminate investment distortions because debt
 priority serves as a dynamically optimal contract. Examining the relative
 efficiency of priority rules observed in practice, we develop several
 predictions about how firms adjust their priority structure in response to
 changes in leverage, credit conditions, and firm fundamentals. Notably,
 financially unconstrained firms with few growth opportunities prefer
 senior debt, while financially constrained firms, with or without growth
 opportunities, prefer junior debt. Moreover, lower-rated firms are
 predicted to spread priority across debt classes. Finally, our analysis
 has a number of important implications for empirical capital structure
 research, including the relations between market leverage, book leverage,
 and credit spreads and Tobin's Q, the influence of firm fundamentals on
 the agency cost of debt, and the conservative debt policy puzzle.  The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title:   Competitive Equilibrium with Type Convergence in an Asymmetrically Informed Market.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 49-71
Issue: 1
Volume: 2
Year: 1989
Abstract:
  This article studies an asymmetric information game with "type
 convergence," in which, under some realizations of a common uncertainity,
 inducing informed agents to reveal their types through self-selection by
 contract choice is either costly or impossible. Under other realizations,
 self-selection permits costless distinctions between informed agents. I
 obtain sufficient conditions under which contracting with options prior to
 the realization of the common uncertainity leads to the existence of a
 perfectly separating, costless Nash equilibrium. Applications to variable
 rate loan commitments and life insurance contracting are discussed.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title:   Asymmetric Volatility and Risk in Equity Markets.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 1-42
Issue: 1
Volume: 13
Year: 2000
Abstract:
  It appears that volatility in equity markets is asymmetric: returns and
 conditional volatility are negatively correlated. We provide a unified
 framework to simultaneously investigate asymmetric volatility at the firm
 and the market level and to examine two potential explanations of the
 asymmetry: leverage effects and volatility feedback. Our empirical
 application uses the market portfolio and portfolios with different
 leverage constructed from Nikkei 225 stocks. We reject the pure leverage
 model of Christie (1982) and find support for a volatility feedback story.
 Volatility feedback at the firm level is enhanced by strong asymmetries in
 conditional covariances. Conditional betas do not show significant
 asymmetries. We document the risk premium implications of these findings.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Repeated Signaling and Firm Dynamics 
Abstract:
 As an alternative to the pecking order, we develop a dynamic calibratable
 model where the firm avoids mispricing via signaling. The model is rich,
 featuring endogenous investment, debt, default, dividends, equity
 flotations, and share repurchases. In equilibrium, firms with negative
 private information have negative leverage, issue equity, and overinvest.
 Firms signal positive information by substituting debt for equity. Default
 costs induce such firms to underinvest. Model simulations reveal that
 repeated signaling can account for countercyclical leverage, leverage
 persistence, volatile procylical investment, and correlation between size
 and leverage. The model generates other novel predictions. Investment
 rates are the key predictor of abnormal announcement returns in simulated
 data, with leverage only predicting returns unconditionally. Firms facing
 asymmetric information actually exhibit higher mean Q ratios and
 investment rates.  The Author 2010. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title: Implications of Data Screens on Merger and Acquisition Analysis: A Large Sample Study of Mergers and Acquisitions from 1992 to 2009 
Abstract:
 We analyze a comprehensive set of mergers and acquisitions from SDC data
 from 1992 through 2009. We do not impose common restrictions such as
 excluding private bidders, small targets, or deals without a deal value.
 We show a broader scope of mergers and acquisitions activity than that
 implied in the literature, which generally oversamples larger deals
 involving public firms. Further, some of our results differ from the
 extant literature. For example, the finding that mergers occur in waves is
 attenuated with a greater presence of smaller and/or non-public firms.
 Also, acquirers gain in most takeovers despite a threefold decline over
 the sample period in acquirer returns.  The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: The Capital Structure Decisions of New Firms 
Abstract:
 We study capital structure choices that entrepreneurs make in their firms'
 initial year of operation, using restricted-access data from the Kauffman
 Firm Survey. Firms in our data rely heavily on external debt sources, such
 as bank financing, and less extensively on friends-and-family-based
 funding sources. Many startups receive debt financed through the personal
 balance sheets of the entrepreneur, effectively resulting in the
 entrepreneur holding levered equity claims in their startups. This fact is
 robust to numerous controls, including credit quality. The reliance on
 external debt underscores the importance of credit markets for the success
 of nascent business activity.  The Author 2012. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title:   Repurchase Premia as a Reason for Dividends: A Dynamic Model of Corporate Payout Policies.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 321-50
Issue: 2
Volume: 7
Year: 1994
Abstract:
  We propose that it is precisely because firms' repurchases of their own
 stock through tender offers are associated with large stock-price
 increases that repurchases are unattractive as a means of distributing
 cash. As a result, firms distribute some cash in the form of
 dividends--despite the tax disadvantage--and carry the rest to future
 periods. However, when their stock is sufficiently undervalued, firms
 distribute all accumulated cash through stock repurchases. We show that
 dividends are smoothed and are positively related both to earnings
 innovations and to previous period's dividends. Also, the stock-price
 reaction to a repurchase announcement, of a given size, is increasing in
 the previous period's dividends.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Information in (and not in) the Term Structure 
Abstract:
 Standard approaches to building and estimating dynamic term structure
 models rely on the assumption that yields can serve as the factors.
 However, the assumption is neither theoretically necessary nor empirically
 supported. This article documents that almost half of the variation in
 bond risk premia cannot be detected using the cross-section of yields.
 Fluctuations in this hidden component have strong forecast power for both
 future short-term interest rates and excess bond returns. They are also
 negatively correlated with aggregate economic activity, but macroeconomic
 variables explain only a small fraction of variation in the hidden factor.  The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: The Model-Free Implied Volatility and Its Information Content 
Abstract:
  Britten-Jones and Neuberger (2000) derived a model-free implied
 volatility under the diffusion assumption. In this article, we extend
 their model-free implied volatility to asset price processes with jumps
 and develop a simple method for implementing it using observed option
 prices. In addition, we perform a direct test of the informational
 efficiency of the option market using the model-free implied volatility.
 Our results from the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index (SPX) options suggest
 that the model-free implied volatility subsumes all information contained
 in the Black--Scholes (B--S) implied volatility and past realized
 volatility and is a more efficient forecast for future realized
 volatility.   Copyright 2005, Oxford University Press.

Title: Incomplete Consumption Risk Sharing and Currency Risk Premiums 
Abstract:
  This article studies the impact of imperfect consumption risk sharing
 across countries on the formation of time-varying risk premiums in the
 foreign exchange market and on their cross-sectional differences. These
 issues are addressed within the framework of the Constantinides and Duffie
 (1996) model applied to a multicountry world. The article shows that the
 cross-country variance of consumption growth rates is counter-cyclical and
 that this feature of consumption data is mildly helpful for currency
 pricing. In particular, unlike the standard CCAPM, the new model is able
 to generate currency risk premiums at lower values of risk aversion and
 provide certain explanatory power for cross-sectional differences in
 currency returns.   Copyright 2003, Oxford University Press.

Title:   General Equilibrium Pricing of Options on the Market Portfolio with Discontinuous Returns.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 493-521
Issue: 4
Volume: 3
Year: 1990
Abstract:
  When the price process for a long-lived asset is of a mixed
 jump-diffusion type, pricing of options on that asset by arbitrage is not
 possible if trading is allowed only in the underlaying asset and a
 risk-less bond. Using a general equilibrium framework, we derive and
 analyze option prices when the underlying asset is the market portfolio
 with discontinuous returns. The premium for the risk of jumps and the
 diffusion risks forms a significant part of the prices of the options. In
 this economy, an attempted replication of call and put options by the
 Black-Scholes type of trading strategies may require substantial infusion
 of funds when jumps occur. We study the cost and risk implications of such
 dynamic hedging plans.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Year: 1994
Abstract:
  The use of analyst forecasts as proxies for investors' earnings
 expectations is commonplace in empirical research. An implicit assumption
 behind their use is that they reflect analysts' private information in an
 unbiased manner. As demonstrated here, this assumption is not necessarily
 valid. There is shown to be a tendency for analysts to release forecasts
 closer to prior earnings expectations than is appropriate, given their
 information. Further, analysts exhibit herding behavior, whereby they
 release forecasts similar to those previously announced by other analysts,
 even when this is not justified by their information. These results are
 shown to have interesting empirical implications.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Do Retail Incentives Work in Privatizations? 
Abstract:
 Twenty countries around the world have used &#x00024;27 billion in
 incentives such as bonus shares and discounts to attract retail investors
 to participate in privatizations and to discourage them from flipping
 their shares. Our results show that incentives have performed well,
 increasing retail investor participation much more cost effectively than
 underpricing. Flipping is not only much reduced in the short term but
 remains cumulatively at least 15% lower after 1000 trading days. The
 expiration of bonus share plans is associated with a 6-day abnormal return
 of -1.0% and a long-term increase in trading volume.  , Oxford University Press.

Title: Do Demand Curves for Currencies Slope Down? Evidence from the MSCI Global Index Change 
Abstract:
 Traditional portfolio balance theory derives a downward sloping currency
 demand function from limited international asset substitutability.
 Historically, this theory enjoyed little empirical support. We provide
 direct evidence by examining the exchange rate effect of a major
 redefinition of the MSCI Global Equity Index in 2001 and 2002. The index
 redefinition implied large changes in the representation of different
 countries in the MSCI Global Equity Index and therefore produced strong
 exogenous equity flows by index funds. Our event study reveals that
 countries with a relatively increasing equity representation experienced a
 relative currency appreciation upon announcement of the index change.
 Moreover, stock markets that are upweighted (downweighted) feature a
 higher (lower) permanent comovement of their currency with the basket of
 other MSCI currencies.  The Author 2009. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org, Oxford University Press.

Title: Industry Information Diffusion and the Lead-lag Effect in Stock Returns 
Abstract:
 I argue that the slow diffusion of industry information is a leading cause
 of the lead-lag effect in stock returns. I find that the lead-lag effect
 between big firms and small firms is predominantly an intra-industry
 phenomenon. Moreover, this effect is driven by sluggish adjustment to
 negative information, and is robust to alternative determinants of the
 lead-lag effect. Small, less competitive and neglected industries
 experience a more pronounced lead-lag effect. The lead-lag effect is
 related to the post-announcement drift of small firms following the
 earnings releases of big firms within the industry.  , Oxford University Press.

Abstract:
 We provide direct evidence on the impact of asymmetric information on both
 financing and operating activities through a study of credit evaluations
 of microfinance institutions (MFIs). We employ a regression discontinuity
 model that exploits the eligibility criteria of an evaluation subsidy
 o&fflig;ered by a nonprofit consortium. Evaluations dramatically cut the
 cost of financing. This e&fflig;ect is strongest for commercial lenders
 and for short-term MFI--lender relationships. The impact of evaluations on
 the supply of finance is mixed. Evaluated MFIs lend more e&ffilig;ciently,
 extending more loans per employee.   The Author 2010. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title:   Signaling, Investment Opportunities, and Dividend Announcements.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 995-1018
Issue: 4
Volume: 8
Year: 1995
Abstract:
  This article examines potential explanations for the wealth effects
 surrounding dividend change announcements. We find that new information
 concerning managers' investment policies is not revealed at the time of
 the dividend announcement. We also find that dividend increases
 (decreases) are associated with subsequent significant increases
 (decreases) in capital expenditure over the three years following the
 dividend change, and that dividend change announcements are associated
 with revisions in analysts' forecasts of current earnings. These results
 are consistent with the cash flow signalling hypothesis rather than the
 free cash flow hypothesis as an explanation for the observed stock price
 reactions to dividend change announcements.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Failure Is an Option: Impediments to Short Selling and Options Prices 
Abstract:
 Regulations allow market makers to short sell without borrowing stock, and
 the transactions of a major options market maker show that in most
 hard-to-borrow situations, it chooses not to borrow and instead fails to
 deliver stock to its buyers. A part of the value of failing passes through
 to options prices: when failing is cheaper than borrowing, the relation
 between borrowing costs and options prices is significantly weaker. The
 remaining value is profit to the market maker, and its ability to profit
 despite competition between market makers appears to result from the cost
 advantage of larger market makers.  , Oxford University Press.

Title: Skewness in Stock Returns: Reconciling the Evidence on Firm Versus Aggregate Returns 
Abstract:
 Aggregate stock market returns display negative skewness. Firm stock
 returns display positive skewness. The large literature that tries to
 explain the first stylized fact ignores the second. This article provides
 a unified theory that reconciles the two facts by explicitly modeling
 firm-level heterogeneity. I build a stationary asset pricing model of firm
 announcement events where firm returns display positive skewness. I then
 show that cross-sectional heterogeneity in firm announcement events can
 lead to conditional asymmetric stock return correlations and negative
 skewness in aggregate returns. I provide evidence consistent with the
 model predictions.  The Author 2012. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: Ability or Finances as Constraints on Entrepreneurship? Evidence from Survival Rates in a Natural Experiment 
Abstract:
 We use a natural experiment in Denmark to test the hypothesis that
 aspiring entrepreneurs face financial constraints because of low
 entrepreneurial quality. We identify 304 constrained entrepreneurs who
 start a business after receiving windfall wealth and examine the
 performance of these marginal entrepreneurs. We find that constrained
 entrepreneurs have significantly lower survival rates and lower profits
 when compared with a matched sample of unconstrained entrepreneurs. These
 results are consistent with the hypothesis that the marginal entrepreneur
 is of low quality.  The Author 2012. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: Mispricing of S&P 500 Index Options 
Abstract:
 Widespread violations of stochastic dominance by 1-month S&P 500 index
 call options over 1986--2006 imply that a trader can improve expected
 utility by engaging in a zero-net-cost trade net of transaction costs and
 bid-ask spread. Although precrash option prices conform to the
 Black-Scholes-Merton model reasonably well, they are incorrectly priced if
 the distribution of the index return is estimated from time-series data.
 Substantial violations by postcrash OTM calls contradict the notion that
 the problem lies primarily with the left-hand tail of the index return
 distribution and that the smile is too steep. The decrease in violations
 over the postcrash period of 1988--1995 is followed by a substantial
 increase over 1997--2006, which may be due to the lower quality of the
 data but, in any case, does not provide evidence that the options market
 is becoming more rational over time.  The Author 2008. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title: Optimal Versus Naive Diversification: How Inefficient is the 1-N Portfolio Strategy? 
Abstract:
 We evaluate the out-of-sample performance of the sample-based
 mean-variance model, and its extensions designed to reduce estimation
 error, relative to the naive 1-N portfolio. Of the 14 models we evaluate
 across seven empirical datasets, none is consistently better than the 1-N
 rule in terms of Sharpe ratio, certainty-equivalent return, or turnover,
 which indicates that, out of sample, the gain from optimal diversification
 is more than offset by estimation error. Based on parameters calibrated to
 the US equity market, our analytical results and simulations show that the
 estimation window needed for the sample-based mean-variance strategy and
 its extensions to outperform the 1-N benchmark is around 3000 months for a
 portfolio with 25 assets and about 6000 months for a portfolio with 50
 assets. This suggests that there are still many "miles to go" before the
 gains promised by optimal portfolio choice can actually be realized out of
 sample.  The Author 2007. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org, Oxford University Press.

Title: The Real Effects of Asset Market Bubbles: Loan- and Firm-Level Evidence of a Lending Channel 
Abstract:
 This article studies how a shock to the financial health of banks, caused
 by a decline in the asset markets, affects the real economy. The land
 market collapse in Japan provides an ideal testing field in separating the
 impact of a loan supply shock from demand shocks. I find that banks with
 greater real estate exposure have to reduce lending. Firms' investment and
 market valuation are negatively associated with their top lender's real
 estate exposure. The lending channel is economically important: it
 accounts for one-third of lending contraction, one-fifth of the decline in
 investment, and a quarter of value loss.  , Oxford University Press.

Title:   Optimal Consumption and Investment with Capital Gains Taxes.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 583-616
Issue: 3
Volume: 14
Year: 2001
Abstract:
  This article characterizes optimal dynamic consumption and portfolio
 decisions in the presence of capital gains taxes and short-sale
 restrictions. The optimal decisions are a function of the investor's age,
 initial portfolio holdings, and tax basis. Our results capture the
 trade-off between the diversification benefits and tax costs of trading
 over an investor's lifetime. The incentive to rediversify the portfolio is
 inversely related to the size of the embedded gain and investor's age.
 Contrary to standard financial advice, the optimal equity holding
 increases well into an investor's lifetime in our model due to the
 forgiveness of capital gains taxes at death.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: The Role of Lockups in Initial Public Offerings 
Abstract:
  In a sample of 2,794 initial public offerings (IPOs), we test three
 potential explanations for the existence of IPO lockups: lockups serve as
 (i) a signal of firm quality, (ii) a commitment device to alleviate moral
 hazard problems, or (iii) a mechanism for underwriters to extract
 additional compensation from the issuing firm. Our results support the
 commitment hypothesis. Insiders of firms that are associated with greater
 potential for moral hazard lockup their shares for a longer period of
 time. Insiders of firms that have experienced larger excess returns, are
 backed by venture capitalists, or go public with high-quality underwriters
 are more likely to be released from the lockup restrictions.   Copyright 2003, Oxford University Press.

Title: Do Implicit Barriers Matter for Globalization? 
Abstract:
 Market liberalization may not result in full market integration if
 implicit barriers are important. We test this proposition for investable
 and non-investable segments of twenty-two emerging markets (EMs). We also
 measure the degree of integration for six major developed markets (DMs) as
 a meaningful benchmark. We find that while the DMs are close to fully
 integrated, both EM segments are not effectively integrated with the
 global economy. We quantify the importance of implicit barriers and show
 that better institutions, stronger corporate governance, and more
 transparent markets in EMs would jointly contribute to a higher degree of
 integration by about 20% to 30%.  The Author 2013. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: Dynamic Debt Runs 
Abstract:
 This article analyzes the dynamic coordination problem among creditors of
 a firm with a time-varying fundamental and a staggered debt structure. In
 deciding whether to roll over his debt, each maturing creditor is
 concerned about the rollover decisions of other creditors whose debt
 matures during his next contract period. We derive a unique threshold
 equilibrium and characterize the roles of fundamental volatility, credit
 lines, and debt maturity in driving runs. In particular, we show that when
 fundamental volatility is sufficiently high, commonly used measures such
 as temporarily keeping the firm alive under runs and increasing debt
 maturity can exacerbate rather than mitigate runs.  The Author 2012. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title:   Cheap Talk, Fraud, and Adverse Selection in Financial Markets: Some Experimental Evidence.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 481-518
Issue: 3
Volume: 12
Year: 1999
Abstract:
  We examine communication in laboratory games with asymmetric information.
 Sellers know true asset qualities. Potential buyers only know the quality
 distribution. Prohibiting communication, we document the degree of adverse
 selection. Then we examine two alternative communication mechanisms. Under
 'cheap talk', each seller can announce any subset of qualities. Under
 'antifraud', the subset must include the true quality. Both mechanisms
 improve market efficiency, but very differently. Relying on sellers'
 frequently exaggerated claims, buyers often overpay under cheap talk.
 Efficiency gains come at the buyer's expense. The antifraud rule improves
 efficiency further and eliminates the wealth transfer from buyers to
 sellers.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Hedge Funds: Pricing Controls and the Smoothing of Self-reported Returns 
Abstract:
 We investigate the extent to which hedge fund managers smooth
 self-reported returns. In contrast to prior research on the "anomalous"
 properties of hedge fund returns, we observe the mechanisms used to price
 the fund's investment positions and report the fund's performance to
 investors, thereby allowing us to differentiate between asset illiquidity
 and misreporting-based explanations. We find that funds using less
 verifiable pricing sources and funds that provide managers with greater
 discretion in pricing investment positions are more likely to have returns
 consistent with intentional smoothing. Traditional controls, however, such
 as removing the manager from the setting and reporting of the fund's net
 asset value and the use of reputable auditors and administrators, are not
 associated with lower levels of smoothing. With respect to asset
 illiquidity versus misreporting, investment style and portfolio
 characteristics explain 14.0--24.3% of the variation in our smoothing
 measures, and pricing controls explain an additional 4.1--8.8%, suggesting
 that asset illiquidity is the major factor driving the anomalous
 properties of self-reported hedge fund returns.  The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Volume: 9
Year: 1996
Abstract:
  This article focuses on the difference between market makers and limit
 orders in their role as suppliers of liquidity. For both sources of
 liquidity I analyze the price behavior of stocks and options around large
 option trades and I estimate the premium paid by the initiator of the
 large trade. My findings suggest that limit orders for options are "picked
 off" after adverse changes in the underlying stock price. Furthermore, I
 find that for these transactions there is a permanent change in quotations
 in the direction of the transaction. After transactions where market
 makers supply liquidity, quotes tend to return to their pretrade level.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Evaporating Liquidity 
Abstract:
 The returns of short-term reversal strategies in equity markets can be
 interpreted as a proxy for the returns from liquidity provision. Using
 this approach, this article shows that the return from liquidity provision
 is highly predictable with the VIX index. Expected returns and conditional
 Sharpe ratios from liquidity provision spike during periods of financial
 market turmoil. The results point to withdrawal of liquidity supply and an
 associated increase in the expected returns from liquidity provision, as a
 main driver behind the evaporation of liquidity during times of financial
 market turmoil, consistent with theories of liquidity provision by
 financially constrained intermediaries.  The Author 2012. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: Strategic Disclosure and Stock Returns: Theory and Evidence from US Cross-Listing 
Abstract:
 When a firm exercises discretion to disclose or withhold information
 (strategic disclosure), risk-averse investors command higher expected
 returns when expected cash flows decrease, producing a negative
 correlation between these expectations. Moreover, stock returns exhibit
 stronger reversal than they do when full disclosure is enforced. We
 propose a model that makes these predictions and provide consistent
 evidence using a panel of foreign firms that list American Depositary
 Receipts (ADRs). We find significant shifts in the time-series properties
 of stock returns for firms that undergo large changes in disclosure
 environments, such as those cross-listing on the NYSE/AMEX/NASDAQ and
 those from less-developed/emerging markets and code-law countries.  The Author 2008. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org, Oxford University Press.

Title: Financial Contracting with Optimistic Entrepreneurs 
Abstract:
 Optimistic beliefs are a source of nonpecuniary benefits for entrepreneurs
 that can explain the "Private Equity Puzzle." This paper looks at the
 effects of entrepreneurial optimism on financial contracting. When the
 contract space is restricted to debt, we show the existence of a
 separating equilibrium in which optimists self-select into short-term debt
 and realists into long-term debt. Long-term debt is optimal for a realist
 entrepreneur as it smooths payoffs across states of nature. Short-term
 debt is optimal for optimists for two reasons: (i) "bridging the gap in
 beliefs" by letting the entrepreneur take a bet on his project's success,
 and (ii) letting the investor impose adaptation decisions in bad states.We
 test our theory on a large data set of French entrepreneurs. First, in
 agreement with the psychology literature, we find that biases in beliefs
 may be (partly) explained by individual characteristics and tend to
 persist over time. Second, as predicted by our model, we find that
 short-term debt is robustly correlated with "optimistic" expectation
 errors, even controlling for firm risk and other potential determinants of
 short-term leverage.  The Author 2008. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org, Oxford University Press.

Title: Fiscal Policy and Asset Prices with Incomplete Markets 
Abstract:
 We study the simultaneous impact of fiscal policy decisions on
 macroeconomic activity, wealth distribution, and asset prices. We consider
 a general equilibrium, overlapping generations model with incomplete
 markets and heterogeneous agents, where government debt and capital are
 imperfect substitutes. Increases in public debt lead to significant
 increases in the riskless rate and to a reduction in the equity premium,
 while higher capital income tax rates lead to a higher equity premium. The
 crowding-out effects (on capital and output) are much higher than in
 models where government debt and capital are perfect substitutes, which
 thus ignore households' portfolio reallocation decisions.  The Author 2012. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: Extreme Value Dependence in Financial Markets: Diagnostics, Models, and Financial Implications 
Abstract:
  This article presents a general framework for identifying and modeling
 the joint-tail distribution based on multivariate extreme value theories.
 We argue that the multivariate approach is the most efficient and
 effective way to study extreme events such as systemic risk and crisis. We
 show, using returns on five major stock indices, that the use of
 traditional dependence measures could lead to inaccurate portfolio risk
 assessment. We explain how the framework proposed here could be exploited
 in a number of finance applications such as portfolio selection, risk
 management, Sharpe ratio targeting, hedging, option valuation, and credit
 risk analysis.   Copyright 2004, Oxford University Press.

Title: A Bayesian Analysis of Return Dynamics with Lévy Jumps 
Abstract:
 We have developed Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods for
 inferences of continuous-time models with stochastic volatility and
 infinite-activity Lévy jumps using discretely sampled data. Simulation
 studies show that (i) our methods provide accurate joint identification of
 diffusion, stochastic volatility, and Lévy jumps, and (ii) the affine
 jump-diffusion (AJD) models fail to adequately approximate the behavior of
 infinite-activity jumps. In particular, the AJD models fail to capture the
 "infinitely many" small Lévy jumps, which are too big for Brownian motion
 to model and too small for compound Poisson process to capture. Empirical
 studies show that infinite-activity Lévy jumps are essential for modeling
 the S&P 500 index returns.  The Author 2006. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org, Oxford University Press.

Title: How Firms Should Hedge 
Abstract:
  Substantial academic research explains why firms should hedge, but little
 work has addressed how firms should hedge. We assume that firms can
 experience costly states of nature and derive optimal hedging strategies
 using vanilla derivatives (e.g., forwards and options) and custom "exotic"
 derivative contracts for a value-maximizing firm facing both hedgable
 (price) and unhedgable (quantity) risks. Customized exotic derivatives are
 typically better than vanilla contracts when correlations between prices
 and quantities are large in magnitude and when quantity risks are
 substantially greater than price risks. Finally, we discuss how our model
 may be applied in practice.   Copyright 2002, Oxford University Press.

Title: Monopoly and Information Advantage in the Residential Mortgage Market 
Abstract:
 Information advantage and entry deterrence incentives are investigated as
 they affect lending outcomes and competitive structure of the U.S.
 residential mortgage market. In the model, when assessing a loan
 applicant, the incumbent monopoly lender employs a proprietary screening
 technology to produce a privately observed estimate of loan credit
 quality. When faced with potential competitive entry, the incumbent
 signals poor credit quality by charging high prices to higher-quality
 borrowers. Market structure and loan pricing strategy are derived
 endogenously, where the incumbent deters entry first by segmenting
 consumers into prime and sub-prime loan markets and second by charging
 prime market borrowers a uniform rate that is higher than the risk-based
 monopoly rate. Empirical implications of the model are identified, and
 evidence is presented that is consistent with predictions.  The Author 2007. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title:   Volatility Timing in Mutual Funds: Evidence from Daily Returns.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 1009-41
Issue: 5
Volume: 12
Year: 1999
Abstract:
  I use daily mutual fund returns to shed new light on the question of
 whether or not mutual fund managers are successful market timers. Previous
 studies find that funds are unable to time the market return. I study the
 funds' ability to time market volatility. I show that volatility timing is
 an important factor in the returns of mutual funds and has led to higher
 risk-adjusted returns. The returns of surviving funds are especially
 sensitive to market volatility; those of nonsurvivors are not.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Solving Consumption and Portfolio Choice Problems: The State Variable Decomposition Method 
Abstract:
 We develop a new solution method for a broad class of discrete-time
 dynamic portfolio choice problems. The method efficiently approximates
 conditional expectations of the value function by using (i) a
 decomposition of the state variables into a component observable by the
 investor and a stochastic deviation; and (ii) a Taylor expansion of the
 value function. We illustrate the accuracy of the method in handling
 several realistic features of portfolio choice problems such as
 intermediate consumption, multiple assets, multiple state variables,
 portfolio constraints, non-time-separable preferences, and nonredundant
 endogenous state variables. We finally use the method to solve a realistic
 large-scale life-cycle portfolio choice and consumption problem with
 predictable expected returns and recursive preferences.  The Author 2010. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title: Stochastic House Appreciation and Optimal Mortgage Lending 
Abstract:
 We characterize the optimal mortgage contract in a continuous-time setting
 with stochastic growth in house price and income, costly foreclosure, and
 a risky borrower who requires incentives to repay his debt. We show that
 many features of subprime loans can be consistent with properties of the
 optimal contract and that, when house prices decline, mortgage
 modification can create value for borrowers and lenders. Our model
 provides a number of empirical predictions that relate the features of
 mortgage contracts originated in a housing boom and the extent of their
 modification in a slump to location and borrowers' characteristics.  The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: Entrepreneurial Finance and Nondiversifiable Risk 
Abstract:
 We develop a dynamic incomplete-markets model of entrepreneurial firms,
 and demonstrate the implications of nondiversifiable risks for
 entrepreneurs' interdependent consumption, portfolio allocation,
 financing, investment, and business exit decisions. We characterize the
 optimal capital structure via a generalized tradeoff model where risky
 debt provides significant diversification benefits. Nondiversifiable risks
 have several important implications: More risk-averse entrepreneurs
 default earlier, but choose higher leverage; lack of diversification
 causes entrepreneurial firms to underinvest relative to public firms, and
 risky debt partially alleviates this problem; and entrepreneurial risk
 aversion can overturn the risk-shifting incentives induced by risky debt.
 We also analytically characterize the idiosyncratic risk premium.  The Author 2010. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title:   The Ex-Dividend-Day Behavior of Stock Prices: The Case of Japan.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 817-47
Issue: 3
Volume: 8
Year: 1995
Abstract:
  We provide a comprehensive empirical analysis of stock price behavior
 around the ex-dividend day in Japan. We find that prices rise on the
 ex-day and that dividend-related tax effects appear to be secondary.
 Returns around ex-dividend days are dominated by the proximity of many
 ex-days to the fiscal year end. Excess returns of 1 percent, which are
 independent of any dividend-related considerations, are higher than
 round-trip transaction costs on medium-sized transactions. Prices seem to
 imply selling pressure before and buying pressure at the start of the new
 fiscal year. These trading patterns appear to be motivated by
 intercorporate manipulative trading around the end of the firms' fiscal
 year, which are unrelated to dividends.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Model Comparison Using the Hansen-Jagannathan Distance 
Abstract:
 Although it is of interest to test whether or not a particular asset
 pricing model is literally true, a more useful task for empirical
 researchers is to determine how wrong a model is and to compare the
 performance of competing asset pricing models. In this paper, we propose a
 new methodology to test whether or not two competing linear asset pricing
 models have the same Hansen-Jagannathan distance. We show that the
 asymptotic distribution of the test statistic depends on whether the
 competing models are correctly specified or misspecified, and on whether
 the competing models are nested or non-nested. In addition, given the
 increasing interest in misspecified models, we propose a simple
 methodology for computing the standard errors of the estimated stochastic
 discount factor parameters that are robust to model misspecification.
 Using monthly data on 25 size and book-to-market ranked portfolios and the
 one-month T-bill, we show that the commonly used returns and factors are,
 for the most part, too noisy for us to conclude that one model is superior
 to the other models in terms of Hansen-Jagannathan distance. Specifically,
 there is little evidence that conditional and intertemporal capital asset
 pricing model (CAPM)-type specifications outperform the simple
 unconditional CAPM. In addition, we show that many of the macroeconomic
 factors commonly used in the literature are no longer priced once
 potential model misspecification is taken into account.  The Author 2008. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org, Oxford University Press.

Title: Public Trading and Private Incentives 
Abstract:
  This article studies the link between public trading and the activity of
 a firm's large shareholder who can affect firm value. Public trading
 results in the formation of a stock price that is informative about the
 large shareholder's activity. This increases the latter's incentives to
 engage in value-increasing activities. Indeed, if he has to liquidate part
 of his stake before the effect of his activity is publicly observed, a
 more informative price rewards him for his activity. Implications are
 derived for the decision to go public, capital structure, and security
 design.   Copyright 2004, Oxford University Press.

Title: Variance Risk Premiums 
Abstract:
 We propose a direct and robust method for quantifying the variance risk
 premium on financial assets. We show that the risk-neutral expected value
 of return variance, also known as the variance swap rate, is well
 approximated by the value of a particular portfolio of options. We propose
 to use the difference between the realized variance and this synthetic
 variance swap rate to quantify the variance risk premium. Using a large
 options data set, we synthesize variance swap rates and investigate the
 historical behavior of variance risk premiums on five stock indexes and 35
 individual stocks.  The Author 2008. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org, Oxford University Press.

Title: How Well Do Institutional Theories Explain Firms' Perceptions of Property Rights? 
Abstract:
 We examine how well several institutional- and firm-level factors explain
 firms' perceptions of property rights protection. The institutional
 theories we investigate account for approximately 50% of the country-level
 variation, indicating that current research addresses first-order factors.
 Firm-level characteristics, such as legal organization and ownership
 structure, are comparable with institutional factors in explaining
 variations in property rights protection. A country's legal origin
 predicts property rights variation better than its religion, ethnic
 fractionalization, or natural endowments. However, these results are
 driven by the inclusion of former Socialist economies in the sample. When
 we exclude the former Socialist economies, legal origin explains
 considerably less than ethnic fractionalization does. (JEL D23, K4, C5)  The Author 2006. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org, Oxford University Press.

Title: The Effectiveness of Reputation as a Disciplinary Mechanism in Sell-Side Research 
Abstract:
 We examine whether the quality differentials in earnings forecasts between
 reputable and nonreputable analysts vary with the severity of conflicts of
 interest. We measure personal reputation using the Institutional Investor
 All-American (AA) awards, and bank reputation using Carter-Manaster ranks.
 While both personal and bank reputation are associated with higher quality
 forecasts overall, their effectiveness against conflicts of interest
 differs. The severity of conflicts has a negative and significant effect
 on the performance of non-AAs at top-tier banks relative to other
 analysts, while it has a positive and significant effect on the
 performance of AAs at top-tier banks relative to others. Thus personal
 reputation is an effective disciplinary device against conflicts of
 interest, while bank reputation alone is not.  The Author 2009. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title: Liquidity and Market Crashes 
Abstract:
 In this paper, we develop an equilibrium model for stock market liquidity
 and its impact on asset prices when constant market presence is costly. We
 show that even when agents' trading needs are perfectly matched, costly
 market presence prevents them from synchronizing their trades and hence
 gives rise to endogenous order imbalances and the need for liquidity.
 Moreover, the endogenous liquidity need, when it occurs, is characterized
 by excessive selling of significant magnitudes. Such liquidity-driven
 selling leads to market crashes in the absence of any aggregate shocks.
 Finally, we show that illiquidity in the market leads to high expected
 returns, negative and asymmetric return serial correlation, and a positive
 relation between trading volume and future returns. We also propose new
 measures of liquidity based on its asymmetric impact on prices and
 demonstrate a negative relation between these measures and expected stock
 returns.  The Author 2008. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org, Oxford University Press.

Title: Complex Ownership Structures and Corporate Valuations 
Abstract:
 The bulk of corporate governance theory examines the agency problems that
 arise from two extreme ownership structures: 100% small shareholders or
 one large, controlling owner combined with small shareholders. In this
 paper, we question the empirical validity of this dichotomy. In fact,
 one-third of publicly listed firms in Europe have multiple large owners,
 and the market value of firms with multiple blockholders differs from
 firms with a single large owner and from widely held firms. Moreover, the
 relationship between corporate valuations and the distribution of
 cash-flow rights across multiple large owners is consistent with the
 predictions of recent theoretical models.  The Author 2007. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org, Oxford University Press.

Title: Expected Idiosyncratic Skewness 
Abstract:
 We test the prediction of recent theories that stocks with high
 idiosyncratic skewness should have low expected returns. Because lagged
 skewness alone does not adequately forecast skewness, we estimate a
 cross-sectional model of expected skewness that uses additional predictive
 variables. Consistent with recent theories, we find that expected
 idiosyncratic skewness and returns are negatively correlated.
 Specifically, the Fama-French alpha of a low-expected-skewness quintile
 exceeds the alpha of a high-expected-skewness quintile by 1.00% per month.
 Furthermore, the coefficients on expected skewness in Fama-MacBeth
 cross-sectional regressions are negative and significant. In addition, we
 find that expected skewness helps explain the phenomenon that stocks with
 high idiosyncratic volatility have low expected returns.  The Author 2009. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org, Oxford University Press.

Title: Information Acquisition Under Uncertainty in Credit Markets 
Abstract:
  This article studies information acquisition through investment in
 improved risk assessment technology in competitive credit markets. A
 technology has two attributes: its ability to screen in productive
 borrowers, and its ability to screen out unproductive borrowers. The two
 attributes have fundamentally different effects on acquisition incentives
 and the structure of equilibrium informational externalities between
 lenders. The article also studies how uncertainty associated with the
 quality of superior technology affects information acquisition incentives.
 Uncertainty influences information acquisition even with risk-neutral
 banks. Increased uncertainty may raise or dampen incentives, depending on
 whether uncertainty is, respectively, about screening out or screening in
 quality.   Copyright 2005, Oxford University Press.

Title: Commodity Liquidity Measurement and Transaction Costs 
Abstract:
 We examine the performance of liquidity proxies in commodities. The Amihud
 measure has the largest correlation with liquidity benchmarks. Amivest and
 Effective Tick measures also perform well. These proxies are useful for
 studies of commodity liquidity over a long time period and those that lack
 access to high-frequency data. We use various aspects of transaction
 costs, such as spread, depth, immediacy, and resiliency, to give insight
 into the costs of different execution approaches. Transaction costs
 increase with volatility and exhibit mean reversion. Splitting trades over
 one hour can reduce trading costs by two-thirds compared to an immediate
 execution.  The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Year: 1994
Abstract:
  A firm must decide what security to sell to raise external capital to
 finance a profitable investment opportunity. There is ex ante asymmetry of
 information regarding the probability distribution of cash flow generated
 by the investment. In this setting, we derive necessary and sufficient
 conditions for a security to be optimal (uniquely optimal, that is, for
 pooling at this security to be an (the unique) equilibrium outcome. Using
 these conditions we show that the debt contract is (uniquely) optimal if
 and only if cash flows are ordered by (strict conditional stochastic
 dominance. Finally, we derive an equivalence relationship between optimal
 security designs and designs that minimize mispricing.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Risk Shifting versus Risk Management: Investment Policy in Corporate Pension Plans 
Abstract:
 The asset allocation of defined benefit pension plans is a setting where
 both risk-shifting and risk-management incentives are likely be present.
 Empirically, firms with poorly funded pension plans and weak credit
 ratings allocate a greater share of pension fund assets to safer
 securities such as government debt and cash, whereas firms with
 well-funded pension plans and strong credit ratings invest more heavily in
 equity. These relations hold both in pooled regressions and within firms
 and plans over time. The incentive to limit costly financial distress
 plays a considerably larger role than risk shifting in explaining
 variation in pension fund investment policy among firms in the United
 States.  The Author 2008. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org, Oxford University Press.

Title: Theory and Evidence on the Resolution of Financial Distress 
Abstract:
  We analyze a financially distressed owner-managed project. The main
 results of the model are: (1) borrower default is an endogenous response
 to the anticipated restructuring--foreclosure outcome; (2) the lender's
 restructuring--foreclosure decision depends critically on the interaction
 between project value and industry liquidity; and (3) the lender waits for
 the industry to recapitalize before selling assets obtained through
 foreclosure. Empirical analysis of a large sample of defaulted commercial
 real estate loans supports many of the model predictions, including
 restructuring--foreclosure outcomes that are consistent with endogenous
 borrower default and firesale discounts that vary depending on industry
 market conditions at the time of foreclosure. (JEL G33)   Copyright 2006, Oxford University Press.

Title: Bankruptcy Codes and Innovation 
Abstract:
 We argue that when bankruptcy code is creditor friendly, excessive
 liquidations cause levered firms to shun innovation, whereas by promoting
 continuation upon failure, a debtor-friendly code induces greater
 innovation. We provide empirical support for this claim by employing
 patents as a proxy for innovation. Using time-series changes within a
 country and cross-country variation in creditor rights, we confirm that a
 creditor-friendly code leads to a lower absolute level of innovation by
 firms, as well as relatively lower innovation by firms in technologically
 innovative industries. When creditor rights are stronger, technologically
 innovative industries employ relatively less leverage and grow
 disproportionately slower.  The Author 2009. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org, Oxford University Press.

Title:   Quote Disclosure and Price Discovery in Multiple-Dealer Financial Markets.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 37-59
Issue: 1
Volume: 12
Year: 1999
Abstract:
  We examine the effects of price disclosure on market performance in a
 continuous experimental multiple-dealer market in which seven professional
 market makers trade a single security. The dealers trade with one another
 and with computerized informed and liquidity traders. Our key comparison
 is between fully public price queues (pretrade transparent market) and
 bilateral quoting (pretrade opaque). We find that opening spreads are
 wider and trading volume is lower in the opaque markets due to higher
 search costs there. More importantly, however, higher search costs also
 induce more aggressive pricing strategies, so that price discovery is much
 faster in the opaque markets.	 Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Cointegration and Consumption Risks in Asset Returns 
Abstract:
 We argue that the cointegrating relation between dividends and
 consumption, a measure of long-run consumption risks, is a key determinant
 of risk premia at all investment horizons. As the investment horizon
 increases, transitory risks disappear, and the asset's beta is dominated
 by long-run consumption risks. We show that the return betas, derived from
 the cointegration-based VAR (EC-VAR) model, successfully account for the
 cross-sectional variation in equity returns at both short and long
 horizons; however, this is not the case when the cointegrating restriction
 is ignored. Our evidence highlights the importance of cointegration-based
 long-run consumption risks for financial markets.  The Author 2007. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title: IPO Market Timing 
Abstract:
  I develop a model of information spillovers in initial public offerings
 (IPOs). The outcomes of pioneers' IPOs reflect participating investors'
 private information on common valuation factors. This makes the pricing of
 subsequent issues relatively easier and attracts more firms to the IPO
 market. I show that IPO market timing by the followers emerges as an
 equilibrium clustering pattern. High offer price realizations for
 pioneers' IPOs better reflect investors' private information and trigger a
 larger number of subsequent IPOs than low offer price realizations do.
 This asymmetry in the spillover effect is more pronounced early on in a
 hot market. The model provides an explanation for recent empirical
 findings that illustrate the high sensitivity of going public decision to
 IPO market conditions.   Copyright 2005, Oxford University Press.

Title: Financial Constraints and Growth: Multinational and Local Firm Responses to Currency Depreciations 
Abstract:
 This article examines how financial constraints and product market
 exposures determine the response of multinational and local firms to sharp
 depreciations. U.S. multinational affiliates increase sales, assets, and
 investment significantly more than local firms during, and subsequent to,
 depreciations. Differing product market exposures do not explain these
 differences in performance. Instead, a differential ability to circumvent
 financial constraints is a significant determinant of the observed
 differences in investment responses. Multinational affiliates also access
 parent equity when local firms are most constrained. These results
 indicate another role for foreign direct investment in emerging
 markets--multinational affiliates expand economic activity during currency
 crises when local firms are most constrained.  The Author 2007. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title: Corporate Governance, Incentives, and Industry Consolidations 
Abstract:
  This article studies the determinants of the success of industry
 consolidations using a unique sample of firms established at the time of
 their initial public offering: roll-up IPOs. In these transactions, small,
 private firms merge into a shell company, which goes public at the same
 time. These firms deliver poor stock returns; their operating performance
 mimics that of comparable firms but does not justify their high initial
 valuations. However, if the managers and owners of the firms included in
 the transaction remain involved in the business as shareholders and
 directors, operating and stock price performance improve, and future
 acquisitions are better received by the market. Higher ownership by the
 sponsor of the transaction leads to a reduction in performance, consistent
 with the view that the sponsor's compensation is excessive. These findings
 highlight the impact of corporate governance on performance.   Copyright 2005, Oxford University Press.

Title: Testing Portfolio Efficiency with Conditioning Information 
Abstract:
 We develop asset pricing models' implications for portfolio efficiency
 with conditioning information in the form of lagged instruments. A model
 identifies a portfolio that should be minimum-variance efficient with
 respect to the conditioning information. Our framework refines tests of
 portfolio efficiency by using the given conditioning information
 optimally. The optimal use of the lagged variables is economically
 important; by using the instruments optimally, we reject several
 efficiency hypotheses that are not otherwise rejected. The Sharpe ratios
 of a sample of hedge fund indexes appear consistent with the optimal use
 of conditioning information.  The Author 2009. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org, Oxford University Press.

Title: Real Option Financing Under Asymmetric Information 
Abstract:
 This study examines the financing of innovation in the presence of adverse
 selection in the capital market. An entrepreneur with private information
 needs outside funding for a project requiring costly experimentation.
 Equilibrium contracts use the duration of the experimentation period,
 together with pay-for-performance, to signal information to outside
 investors. As a result, investment is delayed, entrepreneurs with stronger
 growth options receive vested stock options, and entrepreneurs with a
 lower probability of success are compensated in case of failure. These
 predictions are in line with empirical evidence on venture capital
 contracts, and on the impact of internal financing on risk taking.  The Author 2012. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: Strategic Financial Innovation in Segmented Markets 
Abstract:
 We study an equilibrium model with restricted investor participation in
 which strategic arbitrageurs reap profits by exploiting mispricings across
 different market segments. We endogenize the asset structure as the
 outcome of a security design game played by the arbitrageurs. The
 equilibrium asset structure depends realistically upon considerations such
 as depth and gains from trade. It is neither complete nor socially optimal
 in general; the degree of inefficiency depends upon the heterogeneity of
 investors.  The Author 2008. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org, Oxford University Press.

Title: Consumption and Portfolio Choice over the Life Cycle 
Abstract:
  This article solves a realistically calibrated life cycle model of
 consumption and portfolio choice with non-tradable labor income and
 borrowing constraints. Since labor income substitutes for riskless asset
 holdings, the optimal share invested in equities is roughly decreasing
 over life. We compute a measure of the importance of human capital for
 investment behavior. We find that ignoring labor income generates large
 utility costs, while the cost of ignoring only its risk is an order of
 magnitude smaller, except when we allow for a disastrous labor income
 shock. Moreover, we study the implications of introducing endogenous
 borrowing constraints in this incomplete-markets setting.   Copyright 2005, Oxford University Press.

Title:   The Capital Structure Puzzle Revisited.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 1185-1208
Issue: 4
Volume: 8
Year: 1995
Abstract:
  Corporate finance researchers have long been puzzled by low corporate
 debt ratios given debt's corporate tax advantage. This article recognizes
 that firm value typically reflects a growing stream of earnings, while
 current debt reflects a nongrowing stream of interest payments. Debt to
 value is therefore a distorted measure of corporate tax shielding. Even
 with very small debt- related costs, this may explain the observed
 magnitude and cross- sectional variation of debt ratios. Since this
 variation may be independent of tax shielding, debt ratios provide an
 inappropriate framework for empirically examining the trade-off theory of
 capital structure.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Estimating the Dynamics of Mutual Fund Alphas and Betas 
Abstract:
 This article develops a Kalman filter model to track dynamic mutual fund
 factor loadings. It then uses the estimates to analyze whether managers
 with market-timing ability can be identified ex ante. The primary findings
 are as follows: (i) Ordinary least squares (OLS) timing models produce
 false positives (nonzero alphas) at too high a rate with either daily or
 monthly data. In contrast, the Kalman filter model produces them at
 approximately the correct rate with monthly data; (ii) In monthly data,
 though the OLS models fail to detect any timing among fund managers, the
 Kalman filter does; (iii) The alpha and beta forecasts from the Kalman
 model are more accurate than those from the OLS timing models; (iv) The
 Kalman filter model tracks most fund alphas and betas better than OLS
 models that employ macroeconomic variables in addition to fund returns.  The Author 2007. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies., Oxford University Press.

Title: The Overseas Listing Decision: New Evidence of Proximity Preference 
Abstract:
  Using a cross section of effectively the entire universe of overseas
 listings across world markets, we examine the market preferences of firms
 listing their stock abroad. We find that geographic, economic, cultural,
 and industrial proximity play the dominant role in the choice of overseas
 listing venue. Contrary to the notion that firms maximize international
 portfolio diversification gains in listing abroad, cross-listing activity
 is more common across markets for which diversification gains are
 relatively low. Our findings imply that the same proximity constraints
 that are believed to lead to "home bias" in investment portfolio decisions
 also exert a profound influence on financing decisions.   Copyright 2004, Oxford University Press.

Year: 1997
Abstract:
  We explore the implications of financial system design for financial
 innovation. We begin with assumptions about the investment opportunities
 of firms, their observable attributes, and the roles of commercial banks,
 investment banks, and the financial market. We examine the borrower's
 choice between bank and financial market funding, the commercial bank's
 choice of monitoring capacity, and the investment bank's choice of whether
 to invest in financial innovation. Our main result is that financial
 innovation in a universal banking system is stochastically lower than
 innovation in a financial system in which commercial and investment banks
 are functionally separated.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Expectations, Bond Yields, and Monetary Policy 
Abstract:
 Through explicitly incorporating analysts' forecasts as observable factors
 in a dynamic arbitrage-free model of the yield curve, this research
 proposes a framework for studying the impact of shifts in market sentiment
 on interest rates of all maturities. An empirical examination reveals that
 survey expectations about inflation, output growth, and the anticipated
 path of monetary policy actions contain important information for
 explaining movements in bond yields. Estimates from a forward-looking
 monetary policy rule suggest that the central bank exhibits a preemptive
 response to inflationary expectations while accommodating output growth
 and monetary policy expectations. Forecasted GDP growth plays a
 significant role in explaining time variation in the market prices of
 risk. The sensitivity of long yields is linked to the persistence of
 expected inflation under the risk-neutral measure. Models of this type may
 provide traders and policymakers with a new set of tools for formally
 assessing the reaction of bond yields to shifts in market expectations.  The Author 2010. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Abstract:
  A dynamic finite-horizon market for a risky asset with a continuum of
 risk-averse heterogeneously informed investors and a risk-neutral
 competitive market-making sector is examined. The article analyzes the
 effect of investors' horizons on the information content of prices. It is
 shown that short horizons enhance or reduce accumulated price
 informativeness depending on the temporal pattern of private information
 arrival. With concentrated arrival of information, short horizons reduce
 final price informativeness; with diffuse arrival of information, short
 horizons enhance it. In the process a closed-form solution to the dynamic
 equilibrium with long-term investors is derived.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Reconciling the Return Predictability Evidence 
Abstract:
 Evidence of stock-return predictability by financial ratios is still
 controversial, as documented by inconsistent results for in-sample and
 out-of-sample regressions and by substantial parameter instability. This
 article shows that these seemingly incompatible results can be reconciled
 if the assumption of a fixed steady state mean of the economy is relaxed.
 We find strong empirical evidence in support of shifts in the steady state
 and propose simple methods to adjust financial ratios for such shifts. The
 in-sample forecasting relationship of adjusted price ratios and future
 returns is statistically significant and stable over time. In real time,
 however, changes in the steady state make the in-sample return
 forecastability hard to exploit out-of-sample. The uncertainty of
 estimating the size of steady-state shifts rather than the estimation of
 their dates is responsible for the difficulty of forecasting stock returns
 in real time. Our conclusions hold for a variety of financial ratios and
 are robust to changes in the econometric technique used to estimate shifts
 in the steady state.  The Author 2007. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org, Oxford University Press.

Title: Do Regulations Based on Credit Ratings Affect a Firm's Cost of Capital? 
Abstract:
 In February 2003, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission officially
 certified a fourth credit rating agency, Dominion Bond Rating Service
 (DBRS), for use in bond investment regulations. After DBRS certification,
 bond yields change in the direction implied by the firm's DBRS rating
 relative to its ratings from other certified rating agencies. A
 one-notch-higher DBRS rating corresponds to a 39-basis-point reduction in
 a firm's debt cost of capital. The impact on yields is driven by cases
 where the DBRS rating is better than other ratings and is larger among
 bonds rated near the investment-grade cutoff. These findings indicate that
 ratings-based regulations on bond investment affect a firm's cost of debt
 capital.  The Author 2010. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title: The Representative Agent of an Economy with External Habit Formation and Heterogeneous Risk Aversion 
Abstract:
 In this article, we derive an analytic expression for the representative
 agent of a large class of economies populated by agents with "catching up
 with the Joneses" preferences, but who exhibit heterogeneous risk
 aversion. As Chan and Kogan (2002) show numerically, the representative
 agent has stochastic risk that moves countercyclically to the state
 variable. However, we show that heterogeneity of risk aversion alone is
 insu&fflig;icient for explaining empirical regularities--namely the
 variability of the Sharpe ratio--that Campbell and Cochrane&nbsp;(1999)
 obtain in a model of a representative agent with stochastic risk aversion.   The Author 2010. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title: Explaining the Level of Credit Spreads: Option-Implied Jump Risk Premia in a Firm Value Model 
Abstract:
 We study whether option-implied jump risk premia can explain the high
 observed level of credit spreads. We use a structural jump-diffusion firm
 value model to assess the level of credit spreads generated by
 option-implied jump risk premia. Prices and returns of equity index and
 individual options are used to estimate the jump parameters. We further
 calibrate the model to historical information on default risk and the
 equity premium. The results show that incorporating option-implied jump
 risk premia brings predicted credit spread levels much closer to observed
 levels. The introduction of jumps also helps to improve the fit of the
 volatility of credit spreads and equity returns.  The Author 2008. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org, Oxford University Press.

Title: Can Managerial Discretion Explain Observed Leverage Ratios? 
Abstract:
  This article analyzes the impact of managerial discretion and corporate
 control mechanisms on leverage and firm value within a contingent claims
 model where the manager derives perquisites from investment. Optimal
 capital structure reflects both the tax advantage of debt less bankruptcy
 costs and the agency costs of managerial discretion. Actual capital
 structure reflects the trade-off made by the manager between his
 empire-building desires and the need to ensure sufficient efficiency to
 prevent control challenges. The model shows that manager-shareholder
 conflicts can explain the low debt levels observed in practice. It also
 examines the impact of these conflicts on the cross-sectional variation in
 capital structures.   Copyright 2004, Oxford University Press.

  German dividends typically carry a tax credit which makes the dividend
 worth 42.86% more to a taxable German shareholder than to a tax-exempt or
 foreign shareholder. This results in a penalty for foreign investors who
 buy and hold German dividend-paying stocks. I document that, as a result
 of the credit, the ex-day drop exceeds the dividend by more than one-half
 of the tax credit, and show that futures and option prices embed more than
 one-half of the tax credit. The existence of the credit creates
 opportunities for cross-border tax arbitrage--in which foreign holders of
 German stock transfer the dividend to German shareholders--and implies
 that it is tax efficient for foreign investors to hold derivatives rather
 than investing directly in German stocks. The empirical findings are
 consistent with costly tax arbitrage activity by German investors, who
 face tax risk due to antiarbitrage rules. Since dividend tax credits exist
 in many other countries, the findings are potentially of broad interest.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Learning by Trading 
Abstract:
 Using a large sample of individual investor records over a nine-year
 period, we analyze survival rates, the disposition effect, and trading
 performance at the individual level to determine whether and how investors
 learn from their trading experience. We find evidence of two types of
 learning: some investors become better at trading with experience, while
 others stop trading after realizing that their ability is poor. A
 substantial part of overall learning by trading is explained by the second
 type. By ignoring investor attrition, the existing literature
 significantly overestimates how quickly investors become better at
 trading.  The Author 2009. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org, Oxford University Press.

Title:   Adverse Selection and Competitive Market Making: Empirical Evidence from a Limit Order Market.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 705-34
Issue: 3
Volume: 14
Year: 2001
Abstract:
  This article presents a new methodology for testing economic restrictions
 on the price schedules offered in a limit order book that are based on (i)
 break-even conditions for marginal limit orders and (ii) rational updating
 conditions for order book revisions over time. Using order flow data from
 the Stockholm Stock Exchange, I find strong evidence of insufficient depth
 in the limit order books relative to the theoretical predictions. An
 extended model, which allows the model parameters to depend on market
 conditions, captures some of the systematic variation in the observed
 order book depth.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Underreaction to Self-Selected News Events: The Case of Stock Splits 
Abstract:
  An emerging literature looking at self-selected, corporate news events
 concludes that markets appear to underreact to news. Recent theoretical
 articles have explored why or how underreaction might occur. However, the
 notion of underreaction is contentious. We revisit this issue by focusing
 on one of the most simple of corporate transactions, the stock split.
 Prior studies that report abnormal return drifts subsequent to splits do
 not appear to be spurious, nor a consequence of misspecified benchmarks.
 Using recent cases, we report a drift of 9% in the year following a split
 announcement. We consider fundamental operating performance as a source of
 the underreaction and find that splitting firms have an unusually low
 propensity to experience a contraction in future earnings. Further,
 analysts' earnings forecasts are comparatively low at the time of the
 split announcement and revise sluggishly over time. Together these results
 are consistent with the notion of market underreaction to the information
 in corporate news events.   Copyright 2002, Oxford University Press.

Title: Margin Trading, Overpricing, and Synchronization Risk 
Abstract:
 We provide experimental evidence that relaxing margin restrictions to
 allow more short selling can exacerbate overpricing, even though it
 reduces equilibrium price levels. This is because smart-money traders
 initially profit more by front-running optimistic investor sentiment than
 by disciplining prices. When short selling is not possible, competitive
 pressures among arbitrageurs rapidly drive prices to the equilibrium.
 However, the risk of margin calls slows the convergence process, because
 arbitrageurs who sell short too early face substantial losses if they are
 unable to synchronize their trades with other arbitrageurs (as in Abreu
 and Brunnermeier. 2002. Journal of Financial Economics 66(2--3):341--60;
 2003. Econometrica 71(1):173--204).  The Author 2008. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title: A Dynamic Model for the Forward Curve 
Abstract:
 This article develops and estimates a dynamic arbitrage-free model of the
 current forward curve as the sum of (i) an unconditional component, (ii) a
 maturity-specific component and (iii) a date-specific component. The model
 combines features of the Preferred Habitat model, the Expectations
 Hypothesis (ET) and affine yield curve models; it permits a class of
 low-parameter, multiple state variable dynamic models for the forward
 curve. We show how to construct alternative parametric examples of the
 three components from a sum of exponential functions, verify that the
 resulting forward curves satisfy the Heath-Jarrow-Morton (HJM) conditions,
 and derive the risk-neutral dynamics for the purpose of pricing interest
 rate derivatives. We select a model from alternative affine examples that
 are fitted to the Fama-Bliss Treasury data over an initial training period
 and use it to generate out-of-sample forecasts for forward rates and
 yields. For forecast horizons of 6 months or longer, the forecasts of this
 model significantly outperform those from common benchmark models.  The Author 2007. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies., Oxford University Press.

Title:   Convergence from Discrete- to Continuous-Time Contingent Claims Prices.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies

Volume: 3
Year: 1990
Abstract:
  This article generalizes the Cox, Ross, and Rubinstein (1979) binomial
 option-pricing model, and establishes a convergence from discrete-time
 multivariate multinomial models to continuous-time multidimensional
 diffusion models for contigent claims prices. The key to the approach is
 to approximate the N-dimensional diffusion price process by a sequence of
 N-variate, (N+1)-nomial processes. It is shown that contingent claims
 prices and dynamic replicating portfolio strategies derived from the
 discrete time models converge to their corresponding continuous-time
 limits.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Abstract:
  We show that there is an asymmetry in the predictability of the
 volatilities of large versus small firms. Using both univariate and
 multivariate ARMA-GARCH-M parameterizations, we find that volatility
 surprises to large market value firms are important to the future dynamics
 of their own returns as well as the returns of smaller firms. Conversely,
 however, shocks to smaller firms have no impact on the behavior of either
 the mean or the variance of the returns of larger capitalization
 companies.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Does Asymmetric Information Drive Capital Structure Decisions? 
Abstract:
 Using a novel information asymmetry index based on measures of adverse
 selection developed by the market microstructure literature, we test
 whether information asymmetry is an important determinant of capital
 structure decisions, as suggested by the pecking order theory. Our index
 relies exclusively on measures of the market's assessment of adverse
 selection risk rather than on ex ante firm characteristics. We find that
 information asymmetry does affect the capital structure decisions of U.S.
 firms over the sample period 1973--2002. Our findings are robust to
 controlling for conventional leverage factors (size, tangibility, Q ratio,
 profitability), the sources of firms' financing needs, and such firm
 attributes as stock return volatility, stock turnover, and intensity of
 insider trading. For example, we estimate that on average, for every
 dollar of financing deficit to cover, firms in the highest adverse
 selection decile issue 30 cents of debt more than firms in the lowest
 decile. Overall, this evidence explains why the pecking order theory is
 only partially successful in explaining all of firms' capital structure
 decisions. It also suggests that the theory finds support when its basic
 assumptions hold in the data, as should reasonably be expected of any
 theory.  The Author 2008. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org, Oxford University Press.

Volume: 11
Year: 1998
Abstract:
  We analyze an overlapping generations model with fixed costs of stock
 market participation. Participation in the stock market is determined
 endogenously and covaries positively with preceding innovations in
 dividends. The equilibrium share price is positively related to market
 participation of the same period and to information about future
 dividends. There is "rational trend chasing" in the sense that, although
 all agents are rational, market participation rises after an increase of
 the share price and falls after a decrease. Finally, we show that the
 endogenous fluctuations of market participation lead to increased
 volatility of the share price.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title:   Measurement Effects and the Variance of Returns after Stock Splits and Stock Dividends.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 143-62
Issue: 1
Volume: 11
Year: 1998
Abstract:
  This article examines the relation between two factors affecting stock
 returns, the bid-ask spread and price discreteness, and the increase in
 return variance after ex-dates of stock splits and stock dividends.
 Controlling for these effects, the variance of daily returns still
 increases significantly. The variance of weekly returns also increases
 significantly, and the variance of returns for a control sample of
 nonsplitting firms shows no significant increase. Variance ratio tests
 show that bid-ask errors are small for these stocks and therefore cannot
 explain the large increase in variance. Spreads and price discreteness do
 not explain increased variance after stock distributions.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title:   Portfolio Performance Measurement: Theory and Applications.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 511-55
Issue: 2
Volume: 9
Year: 1996
Abstract:
  Any admissible portfolio performance measure should satisfy four minimal
 conditions: it assigns zero performance to each reference portfolio and it
 is linear, continuous, and nontrivial. Such an admissible measure exists
 if and only if the securities market obeys the law of one price. A
 positive admissible measure exists if and only if there is no arbitrage.
 This article characterizes the (infinite) set of admissible performance
 measures. It is shown that performance evaluation is generally quite
 arbitrary. A mutual fund data set is also used to demonstrate how the
 measurement method developed here can be applied.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title:   The Summary Informativeness of Stock Trades: An Econometric Analysis.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 571-95
Issue: 3
Volume: 4
Year: 1991
Abstract:
  In a security market with asymmetrically informed participants, trades
 are signals of private information. In this article, new measures of trade
 informativeness are proposed based on a decomposition of the variance of
 changes in the efficient price into trade-correlated and -uncorrelated
 components. The trade-correlated component has a natural interpretation as
 an absolute measure of trade informativeness. The ratio of this component
 to the total variance is a relative measure (i.e., a proportion normalized
 with respect to the total public information). For a sample NYSE-listed
 companies, trade are found to be more informative for small firms in both
 absolute and relative senses. From an analysis of intraday patterns, it
 appears that trades are in absolute terms more informative at the
 beginning of trading, but slightly less informative in relative terms.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Underpricing and Market Power in Uniform Price Auctions 
Abstract:
  In uniform auctions, buyers choose demand schedules as strategies and pay
 the same "market clearing" price for units awarded. Despite the widespread
 use of these auctions, the extant theory shows that they are susceptible
 to arbitrarily large underpricing. We make a realistic modification to the
 theory by letting prices, quantities, and bids be discrete. We show that
 underpricing can be made arbitrarily small by choosing a sufficiently
 small price tick size and a sufficiently large quantity multiple. We also
 show how one might improve revenues by modifying the allocation rule. A
 trivial change in the design can have a dramatic impact on prices. Our
 conclusions are robust to bidders being capacity constrained. Finally, we
 examine supply uncertainty robust equilibria.   Copyright 2004, Oxford University Press.

Title: The Skew Risk Premium in the Equity Index Market 
Abstract:
 We develop a new method for measuring moment risk premiums. We find that
 the skew premium accounts for over 40% of the slope in the implied
 volatility curve in the S&P 500 market. Skew risk is tightly related to
 variance risk, in the sense that strategies designed to capture the one
 and hedge out exposure to the other earn an insignificant risk premium.
 This provides a new testable restriction for asset pricing models trying
 to capture, in particular, disaster risk premiums. We base our results on
 a general trading strategy by replicating contracts that swap implied for
 realized conditional asset moments.  The Author 2013. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: Loyalty-Based Portfolio Choice 
Abstract:
 I evaluate the effect of loyalty on individuals' portfolio choice using a
 unique dataset of retirement contributions. I exploit the statutory
 difference that, in 401(k) plans, stand-alone employees can invest
 directly in their division, while conglomerate employees must invest in
 the entire firm, including all unrelated divisions. Consistent with
 loyalty, employees of stand-alone firms invest 10 percentage points (75%)
 more in company stock than conglomerate employees. Support is also found
 using variation in loyalty between different groups of employees, across
 and within firms. The cost to employees of loyalty is large, amounting to
 nearly a 20% loss in retirement income.  The Author 2008. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org, Oxford University Press.

Title: Credit Line Usage, Checking Account Activity, and Default Risk of Bank Borrowers 
Abstract:
 Information on borrower quality is a fundamental issue in debt
 contracting, corporate and consumer finance, and financial intermediation.
 We investigate the link between account activity and information
 production on borrower risk. Based on a unique data set, we find that
 credit line usage, limit violations, and cash inflows exhibit abnormal
 patterns approximately 12 months before default events. Measures of
 account activity substantially improve default predictions and are
 especially helpful for monitoring small businesses and individuals.
 Furthermore, early warning indications result in higher loan spreads, and
 in a higher likelihood of limit reductions and complete write-offs. Our
 study shows that account activity provides a real-time window into the
 borrower's cash flows, thus explaining why banks have an advantage in
 providing certain types of debt financing.  The Author 2010. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Abstract:
 Feedback from stock prices to cash flows occurs because information
 revealed by firms' stock prices influences the actions of competitors. We
 explore the implications of feedback within a noisy rational expectations
 setting with incumbent publicly traded firms and privately held new
 entrants. In this setting the equilibrium relation among stock prices and
 both future dividends and aggregate output depends on the strategic
 environment in which these firms operate. In general, under reasonable
 conditions, the relations between prices, dividends, and economic output
 in our framework are consistent with empirical evidence in the
 macroliterature. We also generate new, potentially testable, implications.  The Author 2013. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: Consumer Confidence and Asset Prices: Some Empirical Evidence 
Abstract:
  We explore the time-series relationship between investor sentiment and
 the small-stock premium using consumer confidence as a measure of investor
 optimism. We estimate the components of consumer confidence related to
 economic fundamentals and investor sentiment. After controlling for the
 time variation of beta, we study the time-series variation of the pricing
 error with sentiment. Over the last 25 years, investor sentiment measured
 using consumer confidence forecasts the returns of small stocks and stocks
 with low institutional ownership in a manner consistent with the
 predictions of models based on noise-trader sentiment. Sentiment does not
 appear to forecast time-series variation in the value and momentum
 premiums. (JEL G10, G12, G14)   Copyright 2006, Oxford University Press.

Title: Distinguishing the Effect of Overconfidence from Rational Best-Response on Information Aggregation 
Abstract:
 This article studies the causal effect of individuals' overconfidence and
 bounded rationality on information aggregation by using a new multiperiod
 game in which agents are rewarded for submitting accurate estimates of an
 unknown asset's value based on (i) their private information and (ii)
 others' past estimates. By carrying out laboratory sessions of this game
 in which subjects' overconfidence is a treatment variable, I find that
 overconfidence affects the information aggregation process by increasing
 the dispersion of estimates and decreasing the rate of estimates'
 convergence. However, even when subjects are not overconfident,
 qualitatively similar deviations from the fully rational model predictions
 are observed. I show that this can be explained by subjects' strategic
 response to errors.  The Author 2008. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org, Oxford University Press.

Title: The Myth of Long-Horizon Predictability 
Abstract:
 The prevailing view in finance is that the evidence for long-horizon stock
 return predictability is significantly stronger than that for short
 horizons. We show that for persistent regressors, a characteristic of most
 of the predictive variables used in the literature, the estimators are
 almost perfectly correlated across horizons under the null hypothesis of
 no predictability. For the persistence levels of dividend yields, the
 analytical correlation is 99% between the 1- and 2-year horizon estimators
 and 94% between the 1- and 5-year horizons. Common sampling error across
 equations leads to ordinary least squares coefficient estimates and
 R-super-2s that are roughly proportional to the horizon under the null
 hypothesis. This is the precise pattern found in the data. We perform
 joint tests across horizons for a variety of explanatory variables and
 provide an alternative view of the existing evidence.  The Author 2006. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org, Oxford University Press.

Title:   Competition and the Medium of Exchange in Takeovers.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 153-74
Issue: 2
Volume: 3
Year: 1990
Abstract:
  The role of the medium of exchange in competition among bidders and its
 effect on returns to stockholders in corporate takeovers are investigated.
 Consistent with recent empirical evidence, our model shows that
 stockholders of both acquiring and target firms obtain higher returns when
 a takeover is financed with cash rather than equity, and that returns to
 target shareholders increase with competition. The model predicts that the
 fraction of synergy captured by the target decreases with the level of
 synergy. Finally, it is shown that, as competition increases, the cash
 component of the offer as well as the proportion of cash offered
 increases.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Jackknifing Bond Option Prices 
Abstract:
  Prices of interest rate derivative securities depend crucially on the
 mean reversion parameters of the underlying diffusions. These parameters
 are subject to estimation bias when standard methods are used. The
 estimation bias can be substantial even in very large samples and much
 more serious than the discretization bias, and it translates into a bias
 in pricing bond options and other derivative securities that is important
 in practical work. This article proposes a very general and
 computationally inexpensive method of bias reduction that is based on
 Quenouille's (1956; Biometrika, 43, 353--360) jackknife. We show how the
 method can be applied directly to the options price itself as well as the
 coefficients in the models. We investigate its performance in a Monte
 Carlo study. Empirical applications to U.S. dollar swap rates highlight
 the differences between bond and option prices implied by the jackknife
 procedure and those implied by the standard approach. These differences
 are large and suggest that bias reduction in pricing options is important
 in practical applications.   Copyright 2005, Oxford University Press.

Title: Sovereign Debt, Government Myopia, and the Financial Sector 
Abstract:
 What determines the sustainability of sovereign debt? We develop a model
 where myopic governments seek popularity but can nevertheless commit
 credibly to service external debt. They do not default when debt is low
 because they would lose access to debt markets and be forced to reduce
 spending; they do not default as debt builds up and net new borrowing
 becomes difficult, because of the adverse consequences from default to the
 domestic financial sector. More myopic governments default less often, but
 tax in a more distortionary way and increase the vulnerability of the
 domestic financial sector to future government debt default.  The Author 2013. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title:   Transactions, Volume, and Volatility.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 631-51
Issue: 4
Volume: 7
Year: 1994
Abstract:
  We show that the positive volatility-volume relation documented by
 numerous researchers actually reflects the positive relation between
 volatility and the number of transactions. Thus, it is the occurrence of
 transactions per se, and not their size, that generates volatility; trade
 size has no information beyond that contained in the frequency of
 transactions. Our results suggest that theoretical research needs to
 entertain scenarios in which (1) both the frequency and size of trades are
 endogenously determined, yet (2) the size of trades has no information
 content beyond that contained in the number of transactions.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title:   The Many Faces of Information Disclosure.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 1021-57
Issue: 4
Volume: 14
Year: 2001
Abstract:
  In this article we ask: what kind of information and how much of it
 should firms voluntarily disclose? Three types of disclosures are
 considered. One is information that complements the information available
 only to informed investors (to-be-processed complementary information).
 The second is information that is orthogonal to that which any investor
 can acquire and thus complements the information available to all
 investors (preprocessed complementary information). And the third is
 information that substitutes for the information of the informed investors
 in that it reveals to all what was previously known only by the informed
 (substitute information). Our main results are as follows. First, in
 equilibrium, all types of firms voluntarily disclose all three types of
 information. Second, in contrast to the existing literature, complementary
 information disclosure by firms strengthens investors' private incentives
 to acquire information. Substitute information disclosure weakens private
 information acquisition incentives. Third, while complementary information
 disclosure has an ambiguous effect on financial innovation incentives,
 substitute information disclosure weakens those incentives.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title:   Underpricing and Entrepreneurial Wealth Losses in IPOs: Theory and Evidence.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 433-58
Issue: 2
Volume: 14
Year: 2001
Abstract:
  We model owners as solving a multidimensional problem when taking their
 firms public. Owners can affect the level of underpricing through the
 choices they make in promoting an issue, such as which underwriter to hire
 or on what exchange to list. The benefits of reducing underpricing in this
 way depend on the owners' participation in the offering and the magnitude
 of the dilution they suffer on retained shares. We argue that the extent
 to which owners trade off underpricing and promotion is determined by the
 minimization of their wealth losses. Evidence from a sample of U.S.
 initial public offering confirms our empirical predictions.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Information Quality and Options 
Abstract:
 Microstructure researchers have long understood that information quality
 has an effect on price formation in the underlying asset market. However,
 option researchers have largely ignored the fact that information quality
 might also impact the options market. This article characterizes the
 nature of the impact by showing how option prices and implied volatility
 levels are related to the forward looking information quality path. This
 result follows from a noisy rational expectations model that abandons the
 normal distribution in favor of the gamma distribution, but maintains the
 standard assumption of exponential utility. Thus the new model bridges the
 gap between the microstructure literature that relies so heavily on the
 normal-exponential framework, and the options literature that relies
 exclusively on models that are consistent with the limited liability of
 stock prices. The model's tractability allows for a robustness check
 against the standard framework and provides a viable setting for analyzing
 the empirical implications of information quality for the options market.  The Author 2007. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title:   Equilibrium Positive Interest Rates: A Unified View.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 187-214
Issue: 1
Volume: 14
Year: 2001
Abstract:
  This article develops precise connections among two general approaches to
 building interest rate models: a general equilibrium approach using a
 pricing kernel and the Heath, Jarrow, and Morton framework based on
 specifying forward rate volatilities and the market price of risk. The
 connections exploit the observation that a pricing kernel is uniquely
 determined by its drift. Through these connections we provide, for any
 arbitrage-free term structure model, a representative-consumer real
 production economy supporting that term structure model in equilibrium. We
 put particular emphasis on models in which interest rates remain positive.
 By modeling the dynamics of the drift of the pricing kernel, we construct
 a new family of Markovian-positive interest rate models.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Ambiguity in Asset Markets: Theory and Experiment 
Abstract:
 This paper studies the impact of ambiguity and ambiguity aversion on
 equilibrium asset prices and portfolio holdings in competitive financial
 markets. It argues that attitudes toward ambiguity are heterogeneous
 across the population, just as attitudes toward risk are heterogeneous
 across the population, but that heterogeneity of attitudes toward
 ambiguity has different implications than heterogeneity of attitudes
 toward risk. In pa rticular, when some state probabilities are not known,
 agents who are sufficiently ambiguity averse find open sets of prices for
 which they refuse to hold an ambiguous portfolio. This suggests a
 different cross section of portfolio choices, a wider range of state
 price/probability ratios, and different rankings of state
 price/probability ratios than would be predicted if state probabilities
 were known. Experiments confirm all of these suggestions. Our findings
 contradict the claim that investors who have cognitive biases do not
 affect prices because they are inframarginal: ambiguity-averse investors
 have an indirect effect on prices because they change the per capita
 amount of risk that is to be shared among the marginal investors. Our
 experimental data also suggest a positive correlation between risk
 aversion and ambiguity aversion that might explain the "value effect" in
 historical data.  The Author 2010 Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Volume: 8
Year: 1995
Abstract:
  This article examines the effects of portfolio insurance on market and
 asset price dynamics in a general equilibrium continuous-time model.
 Portfolio insurers are modeled as expected utility maximizing agents.
 Martingale methods are employed in solving the individual agents' dynamic
 consumption-portfolio problems. Comparisons are made between the optimal
 consumption processes, optimally invested wealth and portfolio strategies
 of the portfolio insurers and "normal agents." At a general equilibrium
 level, comparisons across economies reveal that the market volatility and
 risk premium are decreased, and the asset and market price levels
 increased, by the presence of portfolio insurance.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: On the Timing and Execution of Open Market Repurchases 
Abstract:
  Little is known about the timing and execution of open market
 repurchases. U.S. firms are under no obligation to disclose when they are
 trading, and generally report only quarterly changes in shares
 outstanding. We use 64 firms' supplementally disclosed repurchase trading
 data to provide the first examination of repurchase timing and execution.
 Across the days reported in our sample, firms adopted a variety of
 execution styles ranging from immediate intense repurchasing to delayed
 and smoothed repurchasing. We find no clear evidence that repurchases are
 timed to coincide with, precede, or follow, days on which information is
 released. We benchmark the costs and value of a given repurchase program
 against naive accumulation strategies achieving the same terminal
 portfolio. While there is considerable variation across the firms, NYSE
 firms on average beat their benchmarks, whereas NASDAQ firms do not.
 Finally, we document the liquidity impact of open market repurchases. We
 find that repurchasing contributes to market liquidity by narrowing
 bid-ask spreads and attenuating the price impact of order imbalances on
 days when repurchase trades are completed.   Copyright 2004, Oxford University Press.

Title: Growth or Glamour? Fundamentals and Systematic Risk in Stock Returns 
Abstract:
 The cash flows of growth stocks are particularly sensitive to temporary
 movements in aggregate stock prices, driven by shocks to market discount
 rates, while the cash flows of value stocks are particularly sensitive to
 permanent movements, driven by shocks to aggregate cash flows. Thus, the
 high betas of growth (value) stocks with the market's discount-rate
 (cash-flow) shocks are determined by the cash-flow fundamentals of growth
 and value companies. Growth stocks are not merely "glamour stocks" whose
 systematic risks are purely driven by investor sentiment. More generally,
 the systematic risks of individual stocks with similar accounting
 characteristics are primarily driven by the systematic risks of their
 fundamentals.  The Author 2009. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org, Oxford University Press.

Title: Indexing Executive Compensation Contracts 
Abstract:
 We analyze the efficiency of indexing executive pay by calibrating the
 standard compensation model to a large sample of U.S. CEOs. The benefits
 from indexing the strike price of options are small, and fully indexing
 all options would increase compensation costs by 50% for most firms.
 Indexing has several effects with overall ambiguous outcome; the
 quantitatively most important effect is to reduce incentives, because
 indexed options pay off when CEOs' marginal utility is low. The results
 also hold if CEOs can extract rents and extend to the case of indexing
 shares. Our findings may justify the common practice of "pay-for-luck."  The Author 2013. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: Informal Financial Networks: Theory and Evidence 
Abstract:
  We develop a model of informal financial networks and present
 corroborating evidence by studying the role of property brokers in the
 U.S. commercial real estate market. Our model demonstrates that service
 intermediaries, who do not themselves supply loans, can facilitate their
 clients' access to finance through informal relationships with lenders.
 Empirically we find that, controlling for endogenous broker selection,
 hiring a broker strikingly increases the probability of obtaining bank
 finance. Our results demonstrate that even in the United States, with its
 well-developed capital markets, informal networks play an important role
 in controlling access to finance.   Copyright 2003, Oxford University Press.

Title: How Does Venture Capital Financing Improve Efficiency in Private Firms? A Look Beneath the Surface 
Abstract:
 We use the Longitudinal Research Database (LRD) of the U.S. Census Bureau,
 which covers the entire universe of private and public U.S. manufacturing
 firms, to study several related questions regarding the efficiency gains
 generated by venture capital (VC) investment in private firms. First, do
 VCs indeed improve the efficiency (total factor productivity, TFP) of
 private firms, and if so, are certain kinds of VCs (high reputation vs.
 low reputation) better at generating such efficiency gains than others?
 Second, do VCs invest in more efficient firms to begin with (screening),
 or do they improve efficiency after investment (monitoring)? Third, do
 efficiency improvements due to VC backing arise from increases in sales or
 reductions in costs? Fourth, do VC backing and the associated efficiency
 gains affect the probability of a successful exit (IPO or acquisition)?
 Our analysis shows that the overall efficiency of VC-backed firms is
 higher than that of non-VC-backed firms at every point in time. This
 efficiency advantage of VC-backed firms arises from both screening and
 monitoring: The efficiency of VC-backed firms prior to receiving financing
 is higher than that of non-VC-backed firms, and further, the growth in
 efficiency subsequent to VC financing is greater for such firms. The above
 increases in efficiency of VC-backed firms are spread over the first two
 rounds of VC financing after which the TFP of such firms remains constant
 until exit. Additionally, we show that while the TFP of firms prior to
 receiving financing is lower for high-reputation VC-backed firms, the
 increase in TFP subsequent to financing is significantly greater for these
 firms, consistent with high-reputation VCs having greater monitoring
 ability. We disentangle the screening and monitoring effects of VC backing
 using three different methodologies: switching regression with endogenous
 switching, regression discontinuity analysis, and propensity score
 matching. We show that while overall efficiency gains generated by VC
 backing arise primarily from improvements in sales, the efficiency gains
 of high-reputation VC-backed firms arise also from lower increases in
 production costs. Finally, we show that VC backing and the associated
 efficiency gains positively affect the probability of a successful exit.  The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: How Do CEOs Matter? The Effect of Industry Expertise on Acquisition Returns 
Abstract:
 This paper shows how chief executive officer (CEO) characteristics affect
 the performance of acquirers in diversifying takeovers. When the
 acquirer's CEO has previous experience in the target industry, the
 acquirer's abnormal announcement returns are between 1.2 and 2.0
 percentage points larger than those generated by a CEO who is new to the
 target industry. This outcome is driven by the industry-expert CEO's
 ability to capture a larger fraction of the merger surplus.
 Industry-expert CEOs typically negotiate better deals and pay a lower
 premium for the target. This effect is stronger when information asymmetry
 is high and in bilateral negotiations compared to auctions. We also find
 that industry-expert CEOs on average select lower surplus deals. This
 evidence is consistent with industry-expert CEOs having superior
 negotiation skills.  The Author 2013. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: Macro Factors in Bond Risk Premia 
Abstract:
 Are there important cyclical fluctuations in bond market premiums and, if
 so, with what macroeconomic aggregates do these premiums vary? We use the
 methodology of dynamic factor analysis for large datasets to investigate
 possible empirical linkages between forecastable variation in excess bond
 returns and macroeconomic fundamentals. We find that "real" and
 "inflation" factors have important forecasting power for future excess
 returns on U.S. government bonds, above and beyond the predictive power
 contained in forward rates and yield spreads. This behavior is ruled out
 by commonly employed affine term structure models where the
 forecastability of bond returns and bond yields is completely summarized
 by the cross-section of yields or forward rates. An important implication
 of these findings is that the cyclical behavior of estimated risk premia
 in both returns and long-term yields depends importantly on whether the
 information in macroeconomic factors is included in forecasts of excess
 bond returns. Without the macro factors, risk premia appear virtually
 acyclical, whereas with the estimated factors risk premia have a marked
 countercyclical component, consistent with theories that imply investors
 must be compensated for risks associated with macroeconomic activity.  The Author 2009. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org, Oxford University Press.

Title:   Pricing Real Assets with Costly Search.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 55-90
Issue: 1
Volume: 8
Year: 1995
Abstract:
  Markets for many real assets are characterized by sequential search
 followed by bilateral bargaining between matched buyers and sellers. For a
 category of real assets, the joint, intertemporal valuation problems of
 buyers, owners, and sellers, and the associated Nash pricing function are
 solved explicitly. In equilibrium, the average transaction price is a
 noisy, proportional random walk, and the liquidity premium is positive for
 matched owners. Depending on the values of the parameters, the liquidity
 premium can be substantial. In a related problem of optimal development
 with costly search, the optimal exercise point, cost of development, and
 value of the undeveloped asset are calculated analytically. With search,
 development can occur sooner and undeveloped assets have lower market
 values than the standard solution without search.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Short Selling and the Price Discovery Process 
Abstract:
 We show that stock prices are more accurate when short sellers are more
 active. First, in a large panel of NYSE-listed stocks, intraday
 informational efficiency of prices improves with greater shorting flow.
 Second, at monthly and annual horizons, more shorting flow accelerates the
 incorporation of public information into prices. Third, greater shorting
 flow reduces post-earnings-announcement drift for negative earnings
 surprises. Fourth, short sellers change their trading around extreme
 return events in a way that aids price discovery and reduces divergence
 from fundamental values. These results are robust to various econometric
 specifications, and their magnitude is economically meaningful.  The Author 2012. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: Financial Analysts' Performance: Sector Versus Country Specialization 
Abstract:
 Brokerage houses normally structure their research activities along either
 country or sector lines. I investigate whether organizational structure
 affects the quality of financial analysts' earnings forecasts.
 Specifically, I compare the performance of country-specialized financial
 analysts with that of sector-specialized financial analysts. The former
 issue forecasts considerably more accurately than the latter. Country
 specialists benefit from an informational advantage over sector
 specialists. A superior knowledge of country-specific factors, as well as
 geographical proximity between analysts and the firms they cover, are
 significant determinants of this advantage.  The Author 2007. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org, Oxford University Press.

Title: Overvalued Equity and Financing Decisions 
Abstract:
 We test whether and how equity overvaluation affects corporate financing
 decisions using an ex ante misvaluation measure that filters firm scale
 and growth prospects from market price. We find that equity issuance and
 total financing increase with equity overvaluation, but only among
 overvalued stocks, and that equity issuance is more sensitive than debt
 issuance to misvaluation. Consistent with managers catering to maintain
 overvaluation and with investment-scale economy effects, the sensitivity
 of equity issuance and total financing to misvaluation is stronger among
 firms with potential growth opportunities (low book-to-market, high R&D,
 or small size) and high share turnover.  The Author 2012. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: Does Public Financial News Resolve Asymmetric Information? 
Abstract:
 I use uniquely comprehensive data on financial news events to test four
 predictions from an asymmetric information model of a firm's stock price.
 Certain investors trade on information before it becomes public; then,
 public news levels the playing field for other investors, increasing their
 willingness to accommodate a persistent liquidity shock. Empirically, I
 measure public information using firms' stock returns on news days in the
 Dow Jones archive. I find four patterns in postnews returns and trading
 volume that are consistent with the asymmetric information model's
 predictions. Some evidence is, moreover, inconsistent with alternative
 theories in which traders interpret news differently for rational or
 behavioral reasons.  The Author 2010. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title:   Return Autocorrelations around Nontrading Days.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 155-89
Issue: 1
Volume: 6
Year: 1993
Abstract:
  We document a pattern in the serial dependence of security returns around
 nontrading days. The correlation of returns the second day after a weekend
 or holiday with returns the first day after is unusually low, and in many
 return series is negative, implying a reversal of price movements. We also
 document unusually large positive return autocorrelations the last day
 before and the first day after weekends and holidays. The pattern has
 existed in equity returns for over 100 years, and also exists in several
 futures markets, implying that the pattern is robust to alternative market
 microstructures.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Liquidity Management and Corporate Investment During a Financial Crisis 
Abstract:
 This article uses a unique dataset to study how firms managed liquidity
 during the 2008--2011 financial crisis. Our analysis provides new insights
 on interactions between internal liquidity, external funds, and real
 corporate decisions, such as investment and employment. We first describe
 how companies used credit lines during the crisis (access, size of
 facilities, and drawdown activity), the characteristics of these
 facilities (fees, markups, maturity, and collateral), and whether managers
 had difficulties in renewing or initiating lines. We also describe the
 dynamics of credit line violations and the outcome of subsequent
 renegotiations. We show how companies substitute between credit lines and
 internal liquidity (cash and profits) when facing a severe credit
 shortage. Looking at real-side decisions, we find that credit lines are
 associated with greater spending when companies are not cash-strapped.
 Firms with limited access to credit lines, in contrast, appear to choose
 between saving and investing during the crisis. Our evidence indicates
 that credit lines eased the impact of the financial crisis on corporate
 spending.  The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: On Loan Sales, Loan Contracting, and Lending Relationships 
Abstract:
 This paper examines the secondary market for loan sales and, in
 particular, loan contract design as a mechanism to resolve informational
 issues in loan sales and associated costs and benefits. Using loan-level
 data, we find that sold loans contain additional covenants and more
 restrictive net worth covenants, particularly when agency and
 informational problems are more severe. Why do borrowers agree to incur
 the additional costs associated with loan sales? Our evidence suggests
 that these borrowers benefit through increased private debt availability.
 Further, loan sales go hand in hand with more durable lending
 relationships, suggesting that risk management aids continued relationship
 lending.  The Author 2008. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org, Oxford University Press.

Title: The Life Cycle of Family Ownership: International Evidence 
Abstract:
 We show that in countries with strong investor protection, developed
 financial markets, and active markets for corporate control, family firms
 evolve into widely held companies as they age. In countries with weak
 investor protection, less developed financial markets, and inactive
 markets for corporate control, family control is very persistent over
 time. While family control in high investor protection countries is
 concentrated in industries that have low investment opportunities and low
 merger and acquisition (M&A) activity, the same is not so in countries
 that have low investor protection, where the presence of family control in
 an industry is unrelated to investment opportunities and M&A activity.  The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: Pricing Options in an Extended Black Scholes Economy with Illiquidity: Theory and Empirical Evidence 
Abstract:
  This article studies the pricing of options in an extended Black Scholes
 economy in which the underlying asset is not perfectly liquid. The
 resulting liquidity risk is modeled as a stochastic supply curve, with the
 transaction price being a function of the trade size. Consistent with the
 market microstructure literature, the supply curve is upward sloping with
 purchases executed at higher prices and sales at lower prices. Optimal
 discrete time hedging strategies are then derived. Empirical evidence
 reveals a significant liquidity cost intrinsic to every option.   Copyright 2006, Oxford University Press.

Title: Dynamic Consumption and Portfolio Choice with Stochastic Volatility in Incomplete Markets 
Abstract:
  This paper examines the optimal consumption and portfolio-choice problem
 of long-horizon investors who have access to a riskless asset with
 constant return and a risky asset ("stocks") with constant expected return
 and time-varying precision--the reciprocal of volatility. Markets are
 incomplete, and investors have recursive preferences defined over
 intermediate consumption. The paper obtains a solution to this problem
 which is exact for investors with unit elasticity of intertemporal
 substitution of consumption and approximate otherwise. The optimal
 portfolio demand for stocks includes an intertemporal hedging component
 that is negative when investors have coefficients of relative risk
 aversion larger than one, and the instantaneous correlation between
 volatility and stock returns is negative, as typically estimated from
 stock return data. Our estimates of the joint process for stock returns
 and precision (or volatility) using U.S. data confirm this finding. But we
 also find that stock return volatility does not appear to be variable and
 persistent enough to generate large intertemporal hedging demands.   Copyright 2005, Oxford University Press.

Title: Credit Market Competition and Capital Regulation 
Abstract:
 Empirical evidence suggests that banks hold capital in excess of
 regulatory minimums. This did not prevent the financial crisis and
 underlines the importance of understanding bank capital determination.
 Market discipline is one of the forces that induces banks to hold positive
 capital. The literature has focused on the liability side. We develop a
 simple theory based on monitoring to show that discipline from the asset
 side can also be important. In perfectly competitive markets, banks can
 find it optimal to use costly capital rather than the interest rate on the
 loan to commit to monitoring because it allows higher borrower surplus.  The Author 2009. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org, Oxford University Press.

Title:   Implementing Statistical Criteria to Select Return Forecasting Models: What Do We Learn?
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 405-28
Issue: 2
Volume: 12
Year: 1999
Abstract:
  Statistical model selection criteria provide an informed choice of the
 model with best external (i.e., out-of-sample) validity. Therefore they
 guard against overfitting ('data snooping'). We implement several model
 selection criteria in order to verify recent evidence of predictability in
 excess stock returns and to determine which variables are valuable
 predictors. We confirm the presence of in-sample predictability in an
 international stock market dataset, but discover that even the best
 prediction models have no out-of-sample forecasting power. The failure to
 detect out-of-sample predictability is not due to lack of power.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Participation Constraints in the Stock Market: Evidence from Unexpected Inheritance Due to Sudden Death 
Abstract:
 We use a natural experiment to investigate the impact of participation
 constraints on individuals' decisions to invest in the stock market.
 Unexpected inheritance due to sudden deaths results in exogenous variation
 in financial wealth, and allows us to examine whether fixed entry and
 ongoing participation costs cause non-participation. We have three key
 findings. First, windfall wealth has a positive effect on participation.
 Second, the majority of households do not react to sizeable windfalls by
 entering the stock market, but hold on to substantial safe assets--even
 over longer horizons. Third, the majority of households inheriting stock
 holdings actively sell the entire portfolio. Overall, these findings
 suggest that participation by many individuals is unlikely to be
 constrained by financial participation costs.  The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: New Measures for Performance Evaluation 
Abstract:
 This paper characterizes performance measures satisfying a set of proposed
 axioms. We develop four new measures consistent with the axioms and show
 that they improve on the economic properties of the Sharpe Ratio and the
 Gain-Loss Ratio. In our treatment, the performance measures, or the
 indexes of acceptability, are linked to positive expectations resulting
 from a stressed sampling of the cash-flow distribution. Theoretically, it
 is shown that the level of acceptability varies directly with the amount
 of stress tolerated. In an empirical application, the performance measures
 are applied to cash flows generated by writing options on the SPX and the
 FTSE. This exercise reveals that acceptability levels are U-shaped in the
 strike direction.  The Author 2008. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org, Oxford University Press.

Abstract:
  This article presents a mean-variance framework for likelihood- ratio
 tests of asset pricing models. A pricing model is tested by examining the
 position of one or more reference portfolios in sample
 mean-standard-deviation space. Included are tests of both single-beta and
 multiple-beta relations, with or without a riskless asset, using either a
 general or a specific alternative hypothesis. Tests with a factor that is
 not a portfolio return are also included. The mean-variance framework is
 illustrated by testing the zero-beta CAPM, a two- beta pricing model, and
 the consumption-beta model.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Year: 1995
Abstract:
  This article argues that the size-related regularities in asset prices
 should not be regarded as anomalies. Indeed, the opposite result is
 demonstrated. Namely, a truly anomalous regularity would be if an inverse
 relation between size and return was not observed. We show theoretically
 (1) that the size-related regularities should be observed in the economy
 and (2) why size will in general explain the part of the cross-section of
 expected returns left unexplained by an incorrectly specified asset
 pricing model. In light of these results we argue that size-related
 measures should be used in cross-sectional tests to detect model
 misspecifications.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Optimal Asset Allocation and Risk Shifting in Money Management 
Abstract:
 This article investigates a fund manager's risk-taking incentives induced
 by an increasing and convex relationship of fund flows to relative
 performance. In a dynamic portfolio choice framework, we show that the
 ensuing convexities in the manager's objective give rise to a finite
 risk-shifting range over which she gambles to finish ahead of her
 benchmark. Such gambling entails either an increase or a decrease in the
 volatility of the manager's portfolio, depending on her risk tolerance. In
 the latter case, the manager reduces her holdings of the risky asset
 despite its positive risk premium. Our empirical analysis lends support to
 the novel predictions of the model.  , Oxford University Press.

Abstract:
  This article investigates the long-term equity performance of Japanese

 perform poorly (except for equity rights issues) compared to nonissuing
 firms even though the stock-price reaction to convertible debt and equity
 issues is not negative for Japanese firms. This underperformance is
 strongest for firms issuing public convertible debt. In contrast to the
 United States, poor performance is not concentrated in smaller firms and
 in firms with a high market-to-book ratio. Simple behavioral explanations
 advanced for the new issue puzzle in the United States do not seem
 consistent with the Japanese experience.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Optimal Portfolio Selection with Transaction Costs and Finite Horizons 
Abstract:
  We examine the optimal trading strategy for a CRRA investor who maximizes
 the expected utility of wealth on a finite date and faces transaction
 costs. Closed-form solutions are obtained when this date is uncertain. We
 then show a sequence of analytical solutions converge to the solution to
 the problem with a deterministic finite horizon. Consistent with the
 common life-cycle investment advice, the optimal trading strategy is found
 to be horizon dependent and largely buy and hold. Moreover, it might be
 optimal for the investor in our model not to buy any stock, even when the
 risk premium is positive. Further analysis of the optimal policy is also
 provided.   Copyright 2002, Oxford University Press.

Title: Information Immobility and Foreign Portfolio Investment 
Abstract:
 We examine how residents of the United States allocate their stock
 portfolios internationally. We find that a large U.S. Foreign Direct
 Investment (FDI) position in a destination country in 1990 is associated
 with a relatively large stock portfolio position in that country in the
 2001--2006 period. Moreover, a change in the U.S. FDI position from 1980
 to 1990 helps predict the change in the U.S. Foreign Portfolio Investment
 position from 1994 to 2006. These results are rationalized by Van
 Nieuwerburgh and Veldkamp's (2009) equilibrium model of learning and
 portfolio choice under an information processing constraint. FDI
 establishes marginal differences in the endowments of information about
 different countries, which later translate into differences in stock
 portfolio holdings. We control for cross-country differences in capital
 controls, proximity along different dimensions, corporate governance, and
 economic and capital market development. Our results also hold for the G6
 countries collectively.  The Author 2010. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title: The Myth of Diffuse Ownership in the United States 
Abstract:
 This article offers evidence on the ownership concentration at a
 representative sample of U.S. public firms. Ninety-six percent of these
 firms have blockholders; these blockholders in aggregate own an average
 39% of the common stock. The ownership of U.S. firms is similar to and by
 some measures more concentrated than the ownership of firms in other
 countries. These findings challenge current thinking on a number of
 issues, ranging from the nature of the agency conflict in domestic
 corporations to the relationship between ownership concentration and legal
 protections for investors around the world.  The Author 2007. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org, Oxford University Press.

Title: Momentum Profits, Factor Pricing, and Macroeconomic Risk 
Abstract:
 Recent winners have temporarily higher loadings than recent losers on the
 growth rate of industrial production. The loading spread derives mostly
 from the positive loadings of winners. The growth rate of industrial
 production is a priced risk factor in standard asset pricing tests. In
 many specifications, this macroeconomic risk factor explains more than
 half of momentum profits. We conclude that risk plays an important role in
 driving momentum profits.  The Author 2008. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title:   Private Information, Trading Volume, and Stock-Return Variances.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 233-53
Issue: 2
Volume: 3
Year: 1990
Abstract:
  New evidence is provided on the determinants of stock-return variances.
 First, when the Tokyo Stock Exchange is open on Saturday, the weekend
 variance increases; weekly variance is unaffected, however, despite an
 increase in weekly volume. Second, the listing of U.S. stocks in Tokyo
 substantially increases the number of trading hours, but Tokyo volume is
 negligible for these U.S. stocks and their 24-hour variance is unaffected.
 The overall results are consistent with the predictions of
 private-information-based rational trading models, but inconsistent with
 both the irrational trading noise and public-information hypotheses.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title:   Do Bulls and Bears Move across Borders? International Transmission of Stock Returns and Volatility.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 507-38
Issue: 3
Volume: 7
Year: 1994
Abstract:
  This article investigates empirically how returns and volatilities of
 stock indices are correlated between the Tokyo and New York markets. Using
 intradaily data that define daytime and overnight returns for both
 markets, we find that Tokyo (New York) daytime returns are correlated with
 New York (Tokyo) overnight returns. We interpret this result as evidence
 that information revealed during the trading hours of one market has a
 global impact on the returns of the other market. In order to extract the
 global factor from the daytime returns of one market, we propose and
 estimate a signal-extraction model with GARCH processes.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Underpricing in the Corporate Bond Market 
Abstract:
 This article examines underpricing of initial public offerings (IPOs) and
 seasoned offerings in the corporate bond market. We investigate whether
 underpricing represents a solution to an information problem or a
 liquidity problem. We find that underpricing occurs with both IPOs and
 seasoned offerings and is highest among riskier, unknown firms. Our
 evidence suggests that information problems drive underpricing, with
 support for both the bookbuilding view of underpricing and the asymmetric
 information theory. We do not find evidence in favor of the Rock model of
 underpricing or any evidence that illiquidity causes underpricing.  , Oxford University Press.

Title: Competition and Strategic Information Acquisition in Credit Markets 
Abstract:
  We investigate the interaction between banks' use of information
 acquisition as a strategic tool and their role in promoting the efficiency
 of credit markets when a bank's ability to gather information varies with
 its distance to the borrower. We show that banks acquire proprietary
 information both to soften lending competition and to extend their market
 share. As competition increases, investments in information acquisition
 fall, leading to lower interest rates but also to less efficient lending
 decisions. Consistent with the recent wave of bank acquisitions, we also
 find that merging for informational reasons with a competitor is an
 optimal response to industry consolidation.   Copyright 2006, Oxford University Press.

Title: Options Trading and the CAPM 
Abstract:
  This article studies equilibrium asset pricing when agents face
 nonnegative wealth constraints. In the presence of these constraints it is
 shown that options on the market portfolio are nonredundant securities and
 the economy's pricing kernel is a function of both the market portfolio
 and the nonredundant options. This implies that the options should be
 useful for explaining risky asset returns. To test the theory, a model is
 derived in which the expected excess return on any risky asset is linearly
 related (via a collection of betas) to the expected excess return on the
 market portfolio and to the expected excess returns on the nonredundant
 options. The empirical results indicate that the returns on traded index
 options are relevant for explaining the returns on risky asset portfolios.   Copyright 2004, Oxford University Press.

Title:   American Capped Call Options on Dividend-Paying Assets.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 161-91
Issue: 1
Volume: 8
Year: 1995
Abstract:
  This article addresses the problem of valuing American call options with
 caps on dividend paying assets. Since early exercise is allowed, the
 valuation problem requires the determination of optimal exercise policies.
 Options with two types of caps are analyzed: constant caps and caps with a
 constant growth rate. For constant caps, it is optimal to exercise at the
 first time at which the underlying asset's price equals or exceeds the
 minimum of the cap and the optimal exercise boundary for the corresponding
 uncapped option. For caps that grow at a constant rate, the optimal
 exercise strategy can be specified by three endogenous parameters.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: How Does Industry Affect Firm Financial Structure? 
Abstract:
  We examine the importance of industry to firm-level financial and real
 decisions. We find that in addition to standard industry fixed effects,
 financial structure also depends on a firm's position within its industry.
 In competitive industries, a firm's financial leverage depends on its
 natural hedge (its proximity to the median industry capital--labor ratio),
 the actions of other firms in the industry, and its status as entrant,
 incumbent, or exiting firm. Financial leverage is higher and less
 dispersed in concentrated industries, where strategic debt interactions
 are also stronger, but a firm's natural hedge is not significant. Our
 results show that financial structure, technology, and risk are jointly
 determined within industries. These findings are consistent with recent
 industry equilibrium models of financial structure.   Copyright 2005, Oxford University Press.

Title: Analyst Hype in IPOs: Explaining the Popularity of Bookbuilding 
Abstract:
 The bookbuilding IPO procedure has captured significant market share from
 auction alternatives recently, despite the significantly lower costs
 related to the auction mechanism. In France, where both mechanisms were
 used in the 1990s, the ostensible advantages of bookbuilding were
 advertising-related benefits. Book-built issues were more likely to be
 followed and positively recommended by lead underwriters. Even
 nonunderwriters' analysts promote book-built issues more in order to curry
 favor with the IPO underwriter for allocations of future deals. Yet we do
 not observe valuation or post-IPO return differentials that suggest these
 types of promotion have any value to the issuing firm.  , Oxford University Press.

Title:   A Theory of Acquisition Markets: Mergers versus Tender Offers, and Golden Parachutes.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 149-74
Issue: 1
Volume: 4
Year: 1991
Abstract:
  We develop a model of the acquisition market in which the acquirer has a
 choice between two takeover mechanisms: mergers and tender offers. A
 merger is modeled as a bargaining game between the acquiring and target
 firms; whereas a tender offer is modeled as an auction in which bidders
 arrive sequentially and compete for the target. At any stage of the
 bargaining game the acquiring firm can stop negotiating and make a tender
 offer. In equilibrium, there is a unique level of synergy gains below
 which the acquiring firm makes only a merger attempt as it expects to lose
 in the competition resulting from a tender offer. For synergy gains above
 this level, tender offers can occur. However, to get tender offers, target
 shareholders must give their managers golden parachutes that give higher
 payoffs in tender offers than in mergers.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title:   Tax Planning, Regulatory Capital Planning, and Financial Reporting Strategy for Commercial Banks.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 625-50
Issue: 4
Volume: 3
Year: 1990
Abstract:
  We test whether banks' investment and financing policies can be explained
 by tax status. We document changes in bank holdings of municipal bonds in
 response to changes in tax rules relating to deductibility of interest
 expense. We also document an association between banks' marginal tax rates
 and their investment and financing decisions, which is consistent with the
 existence of tax clienteles. However, banks do not sort themselves
 perfectly into investment and financing clienteles because of adjustment
 costs. We posit specific types of transaction-cost impediments to tax
 planning, and document that banks apparently trade off these costs against
 tax-planning benefits.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Mutual Fund's R-super-2 as Predictor of Performance 
Abstract:
 We propose that fund performance can be predicted by its R-super-2,
 obtained from a regression of its returns on a multifactor benchmark
 model. Lower R-super-2 indicates greater selectivity, and it significantly
 predicts better performance. Stock funds sorted into lowest-quintile
 lagged R-super-2 and highest-quintile lagged alpha produce significant
 annual alpha of 3.8%. Across funds, R-super-2 is positively associated
 with fund size and negatively associated with its expenses and manager's
 tenure.  The Author 2013. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: Turning over Turnover 
Abstract:
 This article applies the methodology of Bai and Ng (2002, 2004) for
 decomposing panel data into systematic and idiosyncratic components to
 both stock returns and turnover panels. This approach works well for both
 returns and turnover, despite the presence of severe heteroscedasticity
 and nonstationarity of individual stocks' turnover. We test the mutual
 fund separation model of Lo and Wang (2000). Trading due to systematic
 risk in returns can account for 66% of systematic turnover. Thus,
 portfolio rebalancing due to systematic risk is a very important motive
 for stock trading. Finally, several common turnover measures may
 understate the impact of stock trading.  , Oxford University Press.

Title: Too Many to Fail? Evidence of Regulatory Forbearance When the Banking Sector Is Weak 
Abstract:
 This article studies bank failures in twenty-one emerging market countries
 in the 1990s. By using a competing risk hazard model for bank survival, we
 show that a government is less likely to take over or close a failing bank
 if the banking system is weak. This Too-Many-to-Fail effect is robust to
 controlling for macroeconomic factors, financial crises, the
 Too-Big-to-Fail effect, domestic financial development, and concerns due
 to systemic risk and information spillovers. The article also shows that
 the Too-Many-to-Fail effect is stronger for larger banks and when there is
 a large government budget deficit.  The Author 2009. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title: Fee Speech: Signaling, Risk-Sharing, and the Impact of Fee Structures on Investor Welfare 
Abstract:
  The fee structure used to compensate investment advisers is central to
 the study of fund design, and affects investor welfare in at least three
 ways: (i) by influencing the portfolio-selection incentives of the
 adviser, (ii) by affecting risk-sharing between adviser and investor, and
 (iii) through its use as a signal of quality by superior investment
 advisers. In this paper, we describe a model in which all of these
 features are present, and use it to compare two popular and contrasting
 forms of fee contracts, the "fulcrum " and the "incentive " types, from
 the standpoint of investor welfare. While the former has some undeniably
 attractive features (that have, in particular, been used by regulators to
 justify its mandatory use in a mutual fund context), we find surprisingly
 that it is the latter that is often more attractive from the standpoint of
 investor welfare. Our model is a flexible one; our conclusions are shown
 to be robust to many extensions of interest. The results are also extended
 to consider unrestricted fee structures and competitive markets for fund
 managers.   Copyright 2002, Oxford University Press.

Title: Shareholder Activism and CEO Pay 
Abstract:
 We study 134 vote-no campaigns and 1,198 shareholder proposals related to
 executive pay between 1997 and 2007. Union pension funds sponsor most of
 these initiatives, yet their targeting criteria do not appear to reflect
 labor-related motives. Shareholders favor proposals related to the
 pay-setting process (e.g., subject severance pay to shareholder approval)
 over proposals that micromanage pay level or structure. While activists
 target firms with high CEO pay (whether excessive or not), voting support
 is higher only at firms with excess CEO pay. Firms with excess CEO pay
 targeted by vote-no campaigns experience a significant reduction in CEO
 pay ($7.3 million). Our findings contribute to the debate on "say on pay"
 and other reforms empowering shareholders.  The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title: Quadratic Term Structure Models: Theory and Evidence 
Abstract:
  This article theoretically explores the characteristics underpinning
 quadratic term structure models (QTSMs), which designate the yield on a
 bond as a quadratic function of underlying state variables. We develop a
 comprehensive QTSM, which is maximally flexible and thus encompasses the
 features of several diverse models including the double square-root model
 of Longstaff (1989), the univariate quadratic model of Beaglehole and
 Tenney (1992), and the squared-autoregressive-independent-variable nominal
 term structure (SAINTS) model of Constantinides (1992). We document a
 complete classification of admissibility and empirical identification for
 the QTSM, and demonstrate that the QTSM can overcome limitations inherent
 in affine term structure models (ATSMs). Using the efficient method of
 moments of Gallant and Tauchen (1996), we test the empirical performance
 of the model in determining bond prices and compare the performance to the
 ATSMs. The results of the goodness-of-fit tests suggest that the QTSMs
 outperform the ATSMs in explaining historical bond price behavior in the
 United States.   Copyright 2002, Oxford University Press.

Title:   On the Recoverability of Preferences and Beliefs.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 417-31
Issue: 2
Volume: 13
Year: 2000
Abstract:
  We examine the extent to which an investor's tastes and beliefs can be
 jointly recovered from knowledge of his/her consumption choice. More
 precisely, we assume that the investor's preferences admit an expected
 utility representation, but with subjective (unknown) probabilities, and
 investigate what joint restrictions can be placed on utility functions and
 beliefs. If the investor draws utility from intertemporal consumption, we
 show that the set of utility functions and beliefs that are consistent
 with a given consumption choice can be characterized by a martingale
 condition. In the Markovian case, this characterization can be restated in
 terms of a Riccati differential equation that must be satisfied by the
 investor's relative risk aversion function. To each solution of this
 differential equation is associated a unique utility function and a unique
 set of beliefs supporting the given consumption choice. Moreover, we show
 that the differential equation has at most one solution in the class of
 utility functions displaying infinite absolute risk aversion at the
 origin. Thus, preferences (and associated beliefs) can be uniquely
 recovered within this class.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Walrasian Tâtonnement Auctions on the Tokyo Grain Exchange 
Abstract:
 The Tokyo Grain Exchange (TGE)&#x2019;s itayose mechanism provides the
 opportunity to analyze functioning Walrasian tâtonnement auctions (WTA).
 In 15,677 auctions conducted over 1997&#x2013;1998 for corn and redbean
 futures contracts, price formation is unexpectedly similar to that
 observed in continuous double auctions. Provisional prices and pledges are
 informative. In contrast to behavior observed in experiments, few pledges
 are deceptive, because the traders participate repeatedly and because the
 auctioneer has flexibility when changing the provisional price and ending
 the auction. Both the risk of the auction ending and the more equitable
 dispersion of information increase depth and the speed at which
 information is embodied in price.  , Oxford University Press.

Title: Do Market Efficiency Measures Yield Correct Inferences? A Comparison of Developed and Emerging Markets 
Abstract:
 Using data from 56 markets, we find that short-term reversal,
 post-earnings drift, and momentum strategies earn similar returns in
 emerging and developed markets. Variance ratios and market delay measures
 often show greater deviations from random walk pricing in developed
 markets. Conceptually, we show that commonly used efficiency tests can
 yield misleading inferences because they do not control for the
 information environment. Our evidence corrects misperceptions that
 emerging markets feature larger trading profits and higher return
 autocorrelation, highlights crucial limitations of weak and semi-strong
 form efficiency measures, and points to the importance of measuring
 informational aspects of efficiency.   The Author 2010. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Abstract:
  We view debt and outside equity as serving to elicit credible information

 that reveals information about the value of the enterprise in its primary
 use. The debt valuation specialist provides a price forecast for debt that
 reveals information about the value of the enterprise in its alternative
 use. The prices forecast by the valuation specialists credibly reveal
 their private information because they are required to buy the associated
 claims at the forecast prices, thereby bonding their valuations.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: A Theory of Board Control and Size 
Abstract:
 This article presents a model of optimal control of corporate boards of
 directors. We determine when one would expect inside versus outside
 directors to control the board, when the controlling party will delegate
 decision-making to the other party, the extent of communication between
 the parties, and the number of outside directors. We show that
 shareholders can sometimes be better off with an insider-controlled board.
 We derive endogenous relationships among profits, board control, and the
 number of outside directors that call into question the usual
 interpretation of some documented empirical regularities. (JEL G34)  The Author 2006. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title: Does Competition Reduce the Risk of Bank Failure? 
Abstract:
 A large theoretical literature shows that competition reduces banks'
 franchise values and induces them to take more risk. Recent research
 contradicts this result: When banks charge lower rates, their borrowers
 have an incentive to choose safer investments, so they will in turn be
 safer. However, this argument does not take into account the fact that
 lower rates also reduce the banks' revenues from performing loans. This
 paper shows that when this effect is taken into account, a U-shaped
 relationship between competition and the risk of bank failure generally
 obtains.  The Author 2010. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title:   Hedging Long-Term Exposures with Multiple Short-Term Futures Contracts.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 429-59
Issue: 3
Volume: 12
Year: 1999
Abstract:
  This article analyzes the problem facing an agent who has a long-term
 commodity supply commitment and who wishes to hedge that commitment using
 short-maturity commodity futures contracts. As time evolves, the agent has
 to roll the hedge as old futures contracts mature and new futures
 contracts are listed. This gives rise to hedge errors. The optimal hedging
 strategy is characterized in a world where contracts of several different
 maturities coexist. The strategy is independent both of the agent's risk
 aversion and, under certain conditions, of beliefs about expected returns
 from holding futures contracts. The methodology is compared with
 approaches based on dynamic models of the term structure. It is tested on
 data from the oil futures market.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title:   What Is Different about International Lending?
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 121-48
Issue: 1
Volume: 4
Year: 1991
Abstract:
  An attempt is made to explain how enforceability is achieved n
 international debt contracts. Each bank announces the policy of denying
 credit to borrowers who default and chooses to adhere to it to maintain
 its reputation of being a tough bank to discipline its other borrowers.
 Loans are made by syndicates of banks in order to make the penalty for
 default severe enough so borrowers would choose not to default
 voluntarily. The model predicts that the interest rate charged on loans is
 smaller for the larger borrowers. Also, for any given borrower, the
 interest rate may fall after each successive default.	 Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title:   Auctions of Divisible Goods: On the Rationale for the Treasury Experiment.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 733-64
Issue: 4
Volume: 6
Year: 1993
Abstract:
  We compare a sealed-bid uniform-price auction (the Treasury's
 experimental format) with a sealed bid discriminatory auction (the
 Treasury's format heretofore), assuming the good is perfectly divisible.
 We show that the auction theory that prompted the experiment, which
 assumes single-unit demands, does not adequately describe the bidding game
 for Treasury securities. Collusive strategies are self-enforcing in
 uniform-price divisible-good auctions. In these equilibria, the seller's
 expected revenue is lower than in equilibria of discriminatory auctions.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title:   Does the Japanese Governance System Enhance Shareholder Wealth? Evidence from the Stock-Price Effects of Top Management Turnover.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 1061-95
Issue: 4
Volume: 9
Year: 1996
Abstract:
  This article examines the stock-price effects of top management turnover
 announcements for 432 Japanese corporations from 1985 to 1990. We find
 that these announcements are associated with significantly positive
 abnormal returns. The returns are greater when turnover is forced than
 when turnover represents normal succession. The stock-price effects are
 also significantly positive when turnover is forced and the successor is
 appointed from outside the firm. We find that large shareholders play an
 important role during outside succession. This evidence suggests that the
 disciplinary decisions of Japanese governance mechanisms are consistent
 with shareholder wealth maximization.	 Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Risks and Portfolio Decisions Involving Hedge Funds 
Abstract:
  This article characterizes the systematic risk exposures of hedge funds
 using buy-and-hold and option-based strategies. Our results show that a
 large number of equity-oriented hedge fund strategies exhibit payoffs
 resembling a short position in a put option on the market index and
 therefore bear significant left-tail risk, risk that is ignored by the
 commonly used mean-variance framework. Using a mean-conditional
 value-at-risk framework, we demonstrate the extent to which the
 mean-variance framework underestimates the tail risk. Finally, working
 with the systematic risk exposures of hedge funds, we show that their
 recent performance appears significantly better than their long-run
 performance.   Copyright 2004, Oxford University Press.

Title: Journalists and the Stock Market 
Abstract:
 We use exogenous scheduling of Wall Street Journal columnists to identify
 a causal relation between financial reporting and stock market
 performance. To measure the media's unconditional effect, we add columnist
 fixed effects to a daily regression of excess Dow Jones Industrial Average
 returns. Relative to standard control variables, these fixed effects
 increase the R-super-2 by about 35%, indicating each columnist's average
 persistent "bullishness" or "bearishness." To measure the media's
 conditional effect, we interact columnist fixed effects with lagged
 returns. This increases explanatory power by yet another one-third, and
 identifies amplification or attenuation of prevailing sentiment as a tool
 used by financial journalists.  The Author 2012. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: Dynamic Hedging in Incomplete Markets: A Simple Solution 
Abstract:
 We provide fully analytical, optimal dynamic hedges in incomplete markets
 by employing the traditional minimum-variance criterion. Our hedges are in
 terms of generalized "Greeks" and naturally extend no-arbitrage--based
 risk management in complete markets to incomplete markets. Whereas the
 literature characterizes either minimum-variance static, myopic, or
 dynamic hedges from which a hedger may deviate unless able to precommit,
 our hedges are time-consistent. We apply our results to derivatives
 replication with infrequent trading and determine hedges and replication
 values, which reduce to generalized Black-Scholes expressions in specific
 settings. We also investigate dynamic hedging with jumps, stochastic
 correlation, and portfolio management with benchmarking.  The Author 2012. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: Relationship Banking, Fragility, and the Asset-Liability Matching Problem 
Abstract:
 We address a fundamental question in relationship banking: why do banks
 that make relationship loans finance themselves primarily with core
 deposits and when would it be optimal to finance such loans with purchased
 money? We show that not only are relationship loans informationally opaque
 and illiquid, but they also require the relationship between the bank and
 the borrower to endure in order for the bank to add value. However, the
 informational opacity of relationship loans gives rise to endogenous
 withdrawal risk that makes the bank fragile. Core deposits are an
 attractive funding source for such loans because the bank provides
 liquidity services to core depositors and this diminishes the likelihood
 of premature deposit withdrawal, thereby facilitating the continuity of
 relationship loans. That is, we show that banks will wish to match the
 highest value-added liabilities with the highest value-added loans and
 that doing so simultaneously minimizes the bank's fragility owing to
 withdrawal risk and maximizes the value the bank adds in relationship
 lending. We also examine the impact of interbank competition on the bank's
 asset-liability matching and extract numerous testable predictions.  , Oxford University Press.

Title: Flight-to-Quality or Flight-to-Liquidity? Evidence from the Euro-Area Bond Market 
Abstract:
 Do bond investors demand credit quality or liquidity? The answer is both,
 but at different times and for different reasons. Using data on the
 Euro-area government bond market, which features a unique negative
 correlation between credit quality and liquidity across countries, we show
 that the bulk of sovereign yield spreads is explained by differences in
 credit quality, though liquidity plays a nontrivial role, especially for
 low credit risk countries and during times of heightened market
 uncertainty. In contrast, the destination of large flows into the bond
 market is determined almost exclusively by liquidity. We conclude that
 credit quality matters for bond valuation but that, in times of market
 stress, investors chase liquidity, not credit quality.  The Author 2008. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org, Oxford University Press.

Title: Asset Salability and Debt Maturity: Evidence from Nineteenth-Century American Railroads 
Abstract:
 I investigate the effect of assets' liquidation values on capital
 structure by exploiting the diversity of track gauges in
 nineteenth-century American railroads. The abundance of track gauges
 limited the redeployability of rolling stock and tracks to potential users
 with similar track gauge. Moreover, potential demand for both rolling
 stock and tracks was further diminished when many railroads went under
 equity receiverships. I find that the potential demand for a railroad's
 rolling stock and tracks were significant determinants of debt maturity
 and the amount of debt that was issued by railroads. The results are
 consistent with liquidation values models of financial contracting and
 capital structure.  The Author 2008. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org, Oxford University Press.

Title: The Hazards of Debt: Rollover Freezes, Incentives, and Bailouts 
Abstract:
 We investigate the trade-off between incentive provision and inefficient
 rollover freezes for a firm financed with short-term debt. First, debt
 maturity that is too short-term is inefficient, even with incentive
 provision. The optimal maturity is an interior solution that avoids
 excessive rollover risk while providing sufficient incentives for the
 manager to avoid risk-shifting when the firm is in good health. Second,
 allowing the manager to risk-shift during a freeze actually increases
 creditor confidence. Debt policy should not prevent the manager from
 holding what may appear to be otherwise low-mean strategies that have
 option value during a freeze. Third, a limited but not perfectly reliable
 form of emergency financing during a freeze--a "bailout"--may improve the
 terms of the trade-off and increase total ex ante value by instilling
 confidence in the creditor markets. Our conclusions highlight the
 endogenous interaction between risk from the asset and liability sides of
 the balance sheet.  The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: Unspanned Stochastic Volatility and the Pricing of Commodity Derivatives 
Abstract:
 Commodity derivatives are becoming an increasingly important part of the
 global derivatives market. Here we develop a tractable stochastic
 volatility model for pricing commodity derivatives. The model features
 unspanned stochastic volatility, quasi-analytical prices of options on
 futures contracts, and dynamics of the futures curve in terms of a
 low-dimensional affine state vector. We estimate the model on NYMEX crude
 oil derivatives using an extensive panel data set of 45,517 futures prices
 and 233,104 option prices, spanning 4082 business days. We find strong
 evidence for two predominantly unspanned volatility factors.  The Author 2009. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Volume: 14
Year: 2001
Abstract:
  Traditional models of portfolio choice assume that investors can
 continuously trade unlimited amounts of securities. In reality, investors
 face liquidity constraints. I analyze a model where investors are
 restricted to trading strategies that are of bounded variation. An
 investor facing this type of illiquidity behaves very differently from an
 unconstrained investor. A liquidity-constrained investor endogenously acts
 as if facing borrowing and short-selling constraints, and one may take
 riskier positions than in liquid markets. I solve for the shadow cost of
 illiquidity and show that large price discounts can be sustained in a
 rational model.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Assessing the Costs and Benefits of Brokers in the Mutual Fund Industry 
Abstract:
 Many investors purchase mutual funds through intermediated channels,
 paying brokers or financial advisors for fund selection and advice. This
 article attempts to quantify the benefits that investors enjoy in exchange
 for the costs of these services. We study broker-sold and direct-sold
 funds from 1996 to 2004, and fail to find that brokers deliver substantial
 tangible benefits. Relative to direct-sold funds, broker-sold funds
 deliver lower risk-adjusted returns, even before subtracting distribution
 costs. These results hold across fund objectives, with the exception of
 foreign equity funds. Further, broker-sold funds exhibit no more skill at
 aggregate-level asset allocation than do funds sold through the direct
 channel. Our results are consistent with two hypotheses: that brokers
 deliver substantial intangible benefits that we do not observe and that
 there are material conflicts of interest between brokers and their
 clients.  The Author 2009. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title: Measurement Errors in Investment Equations 
Abstract:
 We use Monte Carlo simulations and real data to assess the performance of
 methods dealing with measurement error in investment equations. Our
 experiments show that fixed effects, error heteroscedasticity, and data
 skewness severely affect the performance and reliability of methods found
 in the literature. Estimators that use higher-order moments return biased
 coefficients for (both) mismeasured and perfectly measured regressors.
 These estimators are also very inefficient. Instrumental-variable-type
 estimators are more robust and efficient, although they require
 restrictive assumptions. We estimate empirical investment models using
 alternative methods. Real-world investment data contain firm-fixed effects
 and heteroscedasticity, causing high-order moments estimators to deliver
 coefficients that are unstable and not economically meaningful.
 Instrumental variables methods yield estimates that are robust and conform
 to theoretical priors. Our analysis provides guidance for dealing with
 measurement errors under circumstances researchers are likely to find in
 practice.  The Author 2010. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title: Ambiguity and Nonparticipation: The Role of Regulation 
Abstract:
 We investigate the implications of ambiguity aversion for performance and
 regulation of markets. In our model, agents' decision making may
 incorporate both risk and ambiguity, and we demonstrate that
 nonparticipation arises from the rational decision by some traders to
 avoid ambiguity. In equilibrium, these participation decisions affect the
 equilibrium risk premium, and distort market performance when viewed from
 the perspective of traditional asset pricing models. We demonstrate how
 regulation, particularly regulation of unlikely events, can moderate the
 effects of ambiguity, thereby increasing participation and generating
 welfare gains. Our analysis demonstrates how legal systems affect
 participation in financial markets through their influence on ambiguity.  The Author 2009. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title: Understanding the Subprime Mortgage Crisis 
Abstract:
 Using loan-level data, we analyze the quality of subprime mortgage loans
 by adjusting their performance for differences in borrower
 characteristics, loan characteristics, and macroeconomic conditions. We
 find that the quality of loans deteriorated for six consecutive years
 before the crisis and that securitizers were, to some extent, aware of it.
 We provide evidence that the rise and fall of the subprime mortgage market
 follows a classic lending boom-bust scenario, in which unsustainable
 growth leads to the collapse of the market. Problems could have been
 detected long before the crisis, but they were masked by high house price
 appreciation between 2003 and 2005.  The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title:   Liquidity as a Choice Variable: A Lesson from the Japanese Government Bond Market.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 265-92
Issue: 2
Volume: 6
Year: 1993
Abstract:
  In Japan, almost identical government bonds can be trade at large price
 differentials. Motivated by this phenomenon, we examine the issue of the
 value of liquidity in markets for riskless securities. We develop a model
 of an issuer of bonds, a market maker, and heterogeneous investors trading
 in an incomplete market. We show not only that divergent prices for
 similar securities can be sustained in a rational expectations
 equilibrium, but also that this divergnece may be optimal from the
 perspective of the issuer. Price segmentation is possible because agents
 have a desire to trade, but shortsale restrictions limit their trading
 strategies and prevent them from forcing bond prices to be equal.
 Restricting the form of market making to exclude price competition and
 unregulated profit maximization is also necessary to sustain price
 segmentation. The optimality of segmentation from the issuer's standpoint
 arises because of the issuer's standpoint arises because of the issuer's

Title: The Same Bond at Different Prices: Identifying Search Frictions and Selling Pressures 
Abstract:
 I propose a new measure that identifies when the market price of an
 over-the-counter traded asset is below its fundamental value due to
 selling pressure. The measure is the difference between prices paid by
 small traders and those paid by large traders. In a model for
 over-the-counter trading with search frictions and periods with selling
 pressures, I show that this measure identifies liquidity crises (i.e.,
 high number of forced sellers). Using a structural estimation, the model
 is able to identify liquidity crises in the U.S. corporate bond market
 based on the relative prices paid by small and large traders. New light is
 shed on two crises, the downgrade of General Motors and Ford in 2005 and
 the subprime crisis  The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title:   Securities Trading in the Absence of Dealers: Trades and Quotes on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 849-78
Issue: 3
Volume: 8
Year: 1995
Abstract:
  This article investigates the behavior of intraday trades and quotes for
 individual stocks on the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE). We examine the
 transaction and quote record for three firms for the first 3 months of
 1990. Our findings suggest that the immediacy available (at least for
 small trades) in the market is high, despite the reliance on public limit
 orders to supply liquidity. When orders that would otherwise walk through
 the limit order book are converted into limit orders, execution is
 delayed, but some orders execute (at least in part) at more favorable
 prices.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Self-fulfilling Credit Market Freezes 
Abstract:
 This article develops a model of a self-fulfilling credit market freeze
 and uses it to study alternative governmental responses to such a crisis.
 We study an economy in which operating firms are interdependent, where
 their success depends on the ability of other operating firms to obtain
 financing. In such an economy, an inefficient credit market freeze may
 arise in which banks abstain from lending to operating firms with good
 projects because of their self-fulfilling expectations that other banks
 will not be making such loans. Our model enables us to study the
 effectiveness of using alternative measures as a means of getting an
 economy out of an inefficient credit market freeze. In particular, we
 study the effectiveness of interest rate cuts, an infusion of capital into
 banks, direct lending by the government to operating firms, and the
 provision of government capital or guarantees to encourage privately
 managed lending. Our analysis provides a framework for analyzing and
 evaluating the standard and nonstandard instruments used by authorities
 during the 2008--2009 financial crisis. Our analysis also provides
 testable implications for how firms, banks, and economies can be expected
 to be affected by shocks to the banking system.  The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: Labor Income and Predictable Stock Returns 
Abstract:
  We propose a novel economic mechanism that generates stock return
 predictability in both the time series and the cross-section. Investors'
 income has two sources, wages and dividends that grow stochastically over
 time. As a consequence the fraction of total income produced by wages
 fluctuates depending on economic conditions. We show that the risk premium
 that investors require to hold stocks varies with these fluctuations. A
 regression of stock returns on lagged values of the labor income to
 consumption ratio produces statistically significant coefficients and
 large adjusted R-super-2s. Tests of the model's cross-sectional
 predictions on the set of 25 Fama--French portfolios sorted on size and
 book-to-market are also met with considerable support.   Copyright 2006, Oxford University Press.

Title: Explaining Returns with Cash-Flow Proxies 
Abstract:
  Stock returns are correlated with contemporaneous earnings growth,
 dividend growth, future real activity, and other cash-flow proxies. The
 correlation between cash-flow proxies and stock returns may arise from
 association of cash-flow proxies with one-period expected returns,
 cash-flow news, and/or expected-return news. We use Campbell's (1991)
 return decomposition to measure the relative importance of these three
 effects in regressions of returns on cash-flow proxies. In some of the
 popular specifications, variables that are motivated as proxies for
 cash-flow news also track a nontrivial proportion of one-period expected
 returns and expected-return news. As a result, the R-super-2 from a
 regression of returns on cash-flow proxies may overstate or understate the
 importance of cash-flow news as a source of return variance.   Copyright 2006, Oxford University Press.

Title:   Production Flexibility, Stochastic Separation, Hedging, and Futures Prices.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 935-57
Issue: 4
Volume: 6
Year: 1993
Abstract:
  We study a dynamic model where uncertainty about interim output
 adjustments causes producers to face price, cost and output uncertainty.
 Stochastically separable production decisions are independent of the
 producer's risk preferences and expectations and are based on the
 prevailing futures price as a certain output price. Conditions under which
 futures contracts achieve stochastic separation are established. Optimal
 hedging and maturity structure of futures contracts, equilibrium futures
 prices, and the effects of futures trading on output are studied. The
 systematic risk premium depends on the product of the futures beta and the
 covariance of the market return with production revenues.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title:   Program Trading and Intraday Volatility.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies

Issue: 4
Volume: 7
Year: 1994
Abstract:
  Program trading and intraday changes in the S&P 500 Index are correlated.
 Future prices and, to a lesser extent, cash prices lead program trades.
 Index extent, cash prices lead program trades. Index arbitrage trades are
 followed by an immediate change in the cash index, which ultimately
 reverses slightly. No reversal follows nonarbitrage trades. The cumulative
 index changes associated with buy-and-sell trades and with arbitrage and
 nonarbitrage trades all are similar. Price decompositions suggest that the
 results are not due to microstructure effects. Program trades in this
 1989-90 sample do not seem to have created major short-term liquidity
 problems. The results are stable within the sample.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: New Orders and Asset Prices 
Abstract:
 We investigate the asset pricing and macroeconomic implications of the
 ratio of new orders (NO) to shipments (S) of durable goods. NO/S measures
 investment commitments by firms, and high values of NO/S are associated
 with a business cycle peak. We find that NO/S proxies for a short-horizon
 component of risk premia not identified in prior work. Higher levels of
 NO/S forecast lower excess returns on equities and many types of bonds, at
 horizons from one month to one year. These effects are generally robust to
 the inclusion of common return predictors and are significant on an
 out-of-sample basis as well. We also address the term structure of risk
 premia by constructing a similar ratio to measure longer-term investment
 commitments, which predicts returns primarily at longer horizons.  The Author 2012. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Abstract:
  I examine a two-period noisy rational expectations model of a futures

 average of future prices measures both the additional volatility and the
 additional expected.volume of trade associated with noisy information. The
 role played by dispersion helps clarify several stylized facts concerning
 volume and price behavior. Specifically, dispersion can be a factor
 contributing to the positive correlation between volume and absolute price
 changes, and the positive correlation between consecutive absolute price
 changes.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Market Liquidity and Funding Liquidity 
Abstract:
 We provide a model that links an asset's market liquidity (i.e., the ease
 with which it is traded) and traders' funding liquidity (i.e., the ease
 with which they can obtain funding). Traders provide market liquidity, and
 their ability to do so depends on their availability of funding.
 Conversely, traders' funding, i.e., their capital and margin requirements,
 depends on the assets' market liquidity. We show that, under certain
 conditions, margins are destabilizing and market liquidity and funding
 liquidity are mutually reinforcing, leading to liquidity spirals. The
 model explains the empirically documented features that market liquidity
 (i) can suddenly dry up, (ii) has commonality across securities, (iii) is
 related to volatility, (iv) is subject to "flight to quality," and (v)
 co-moves with the market. The model provides new testable predictions,
 including that speculators' capital is a driver of market liquidity and
 risk premiums.  The Author 2008. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title: Adverse Selection and the Required Return 
Abstract:
  An important feature of financial markets is that securities are traded
 repeatedly by asymmetrically informed investors. We study how current and
 future adverse selection affect the required return. We find that the
 bid-ask spread generated by adverse selection is not a cost, on average,
 for agents who trade, and hence the bid-ask spread does not directly
 influence the required return. Adverse selection contributes to
 trading-decision distortions, however, implying allocation costs, which
 affect the required return. We explicitly derive the effect of adverse
 selection on required returns, and show how our result differs from models
 that consider the bid-ask spread to be an exogenous cost.   Copyright 2004, Oxford University Press.

Title: Ambiguity Aversion and the Term Structure of Interest Rates 
Abstract:
 This paper studies the term structure implications of a simple structural
 model in which the representative agent displays ambiguity aversion,
 modeled by Multiple Priors Recursive Utility. Bond excess returns reflect
 a premium for ambiguity, which is observationally distinct from the risk
 premium of affine yield curve models. The ambiguity premium can be large
 even in the simplest log-utility setting and is also nonzero for
 stochastic factors that have a zero risk premium. A calibrated
 low-dimensional two-factor model with ambiguity is able to reproduce the
 deviations from the expectations hypothesis documented in the literature,
 without modifying in a substantial way the nonlinear mean-reversion
 dynamics of the short interest rate. Moreover, the model does not imply
 any apparent trade-off between fitting the first and second moments of the
 yield curve.  The Author 2008. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title: Capital Budgeting in Multidivision Firms: Information, Agency, and Incentives 
Abstract:
  We examine optimal capital allocation and managerial compensation in a
 firm with two investment projects (divisions) each run by a risk-neutral
 manager who can provide (i) (unverifiable) information about project
 quality and (ii) (unverifiable) access to value-enhancing, but privately
 costly resources. The optimal managerial compensation contract offers
 greater performance pay and a lower salary when managers report that their
 project is higher quality. The firm generally underinvests in capital and
 managers underutilize resources (relative to first-best). We also derive
 cross-sectional predictions about the sensitivity of investment in one
 division to the quality of investment opportunities in the other division,
 and the relative importance of division-level and firm-level
 performance-based pay in managerial compensation contracts.   Copyright 2004, Oxford University Press.

Title: Performance-Sensitive Debt 
Abstract:
 This article studies performance-sensitive debt (PSD), the class of debt
 obligations whose interest payments depend on some measure of the
 borrower's performance. We demonstrate that the existence of PSD
 obligations cannot be explained by the trade-off theory of capital
 structure, as PSD leads to earlier default and lower equity value compared
 to fixed-rate debt of the same market value. We show that, consistent with
 the pecking-order theory, PSD can be used as an inexpensive screening
 device, and we find empirically that firms choosing PSD loans are more
 likely to improve their credit ratings than firms choosing fixed-interest
 loans. We also develop a method to value PSD obligations allowing for
 general payment profiles and obtain closed-form pricing formulas for
 step-up bonds and linear PSD.  The Author 2010. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title: Institutional Liquidity Needs and the Structure of Monitored Finance 
Abstract:
  A financial institution that finances and monitors firms learns private
 information about these firms. When the institution seeks funds to meet
 its own liquidity needs, it faces adverse selection ("liquidity") costs
 that increase with the risk of its claims on these firms. The institution
 can reduce its liquidity costs by holding debt rather than equity.
 Conversely, except in a limited setting resembling venture capital, firms
 that depend on monitored finance prefer to give the monitoring institution
 debt rather than equity. Institutions with less frequent or less severe
 liquidity needs have greater appetite for equity and for the debt of more
 risky borrowers. These predictions are consistent with general patterns of
 monitored finance.   Copyright 2003, Oxford University Press.

Title: Relative Wealth Concerns and Financial Bubbles 
Abstract:
 We present a rational general equilibrium model that highlights the fact
 that relative wealth concerns can play a role in explaining financial
 bubbles. We consider a finite-horizon overlapping generations model in
 which agents care only about their consumption. Though the horizon is
 finite, competition over future investment opportunities makes agents'
 utilities dependent on the wealth of their cohort and induces relative
 wealth concerns. Agents herd into risky securities and drive down their
 expected return. Even though the bubble is likely to burst and lead to a
 substantial loss, agents' relative wealth concerns make them afraid to
 trade against the crowd.  The Author 2007. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org, Oxford University Press.

Title: Return Reversals, Idiosyncratic Risk, and Expected Returns 
Abstract:
 The empirical evidence on the cross-sectional relation between
 idiosyncratic risk and expected stock returns is mixed. We demonstrate
 that the omission of the previous month's stock returns can lead to a
 negatively biased estimate of the relation. The magnitude of the omitted
 variable bias depends on the approach to estimating the conditional
 idiosyncratic volatility. Although a negative relation exists when the
 estimate is based on daily returns, it disappears after return reversals
 are controlled for. Return reversals can explain both the negative
 relation between value-weighted portfolio returns and idiosyncratic
 volatility and the insignificant relation between equal-weighted portfolio
 returns and idiosyncratic volatility. In contrast, there is a
 significantly positive relation between the conditional idiosyncratic
 volatility estimated from monthly data and expected returns. This relation
 remains robust after controlling for return reversals.  The Author 2009. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title:   Rational Prepayment and the Valuation Mortgage-Backed Securities.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 677-708
Issue: 3
Volume: 8
Year: 1995
Abstract:
  This article presents a new model of mortgage prepayments, based on
 rational decisions by mortgage holders. These mortgage holders face
 heterogeneous transaction costs, which are explicitly modeled. The model
 is estimated using a version of Hansen's (1982) generalized method of
 moments, and is shown to capture many of the empirical features of
 mortgage prepayment. Estimation results indicate that mortgage holders act
 as though they face transaction costs that far exceed the explicit costs
 usually incurred on refinancing. They also wait an average of more than a
 year before refinancing, even when it is optimal to do so. The model fits
 observed prepayment behavior as well as the recent empirical model of
 Schwartz and Torous (1989). Implications for pricing mortgage-backed
 securities are discussed.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Abstract:
  The author analyzes optimal capital and ownership structures as resulting
 from anticipated future control contests. He focuses on leverage as a
 device that enables the incumbent management to extract the maximum value
 from the rival. He shows that firm value depends on both capital and
 ownership structures. The analysis leads to the following predictions: (1)
 more efficient managers use less debt, (2) firms facing better rivals for
 control issue more debt, and (3) firms with supermajority rules issue less
 debt. Several predictions are consistent with known empirical
 regularities.	 Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

 This article argues that the finite-horizon linear habit model also
 implies an inverse relation between expected returns and surplus
 consumption. This article also presents empirical evidence, which
 indicates that expected returns on stocks and bonds vary with surplus
 consumption implied by the habit models. The volatility of returns and the
 reward to volatility are also related to surplus consumption. However,
 less than 30% of the predictable variation of expected returns, using
 standard lagged information variables, is attributed to surplus
 consumption.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Ownership: Evolution and Regulation 
Abstract:
 This article is the first study of long-run evolution of investor
 protection and corporate ownership in the United Kingdom over the
 twentieth century. Formal investor protection emerged only in the second
 half of the century. We assess the influence of investor protection on
 ownership by comparing cross-sections of firms at different times in the
 century and the evolution of firms incorporating at different stages of
 the century. Investor protection had little impact on dispersion of
 ownership: even in the absence of investor protection, rates of dispersion
 of ownership were high, associated primarily with mergers. Preliminary
 evidence suggests that ownership dispersion in the United Kingdom relied
 more on informal relations of trust than on formal investor protection.  The Author 2008. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title: Forecasting Stock Returns Through an Efficient Aggregation of Mutual Fund Holdings 
Abstract:
 We develop a stock return--predictive measure based on an efficient
 aggregation of the portfolio holdings of all actively managed U.S.
 domestic equity mutual funds, and use this model to study the source of
 fund managers' stock selection abilities. This "generalized inverse alpha"
 (GIA) approach reveals differences in the ability of managers to predict
 firms' future earnings from fundamental research. Notably, the GIA's
 return-forecasting power is not subsumed by publicly available
 quantitative predictors, such as momentum, value, and earnings quality,
 nor is it subsumed by methods shown in past research to forecast stock
 returns using fund holdings or trades.  The Author 2012. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: Jumps in Financial Markets: A New Nonparametric Test and Jump Dynamics 
Abstract:
 This article introduces a new nonparametric test to detect jump arrival
 times and realized jump sizes in asset prices up to the intra-day level.
 We demonstrate that the likelihood of misclassification of jumps becomes
 negligible when we use high-frequency returns. Using our test, we examine
 jump dynamics and their distributions in the U.S. equity markets. The
 results show that individual stock jumps are associated with prescheduled
 earnings announcements and other company-specific news events.
 Additionally, S&P 500 Index jumps are associated with general market news
 announcements. This suggests different pricing models for individual
 equity options versus index options.  The Author 2007. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title:   Econometric Aspects of the Variance-Bounds Tests: A Survey.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 753-91
Issue: 4
Volume: 4
Year: 1991
Abstract:
  We survey the variance-bounds tests of asset-price volatility, stressing
 the econometric aspects of these tests. The first variance-bounds tests of
 the present-value relation reported apparently striking evidence of excess
 volatility of asset prices. The statistical significance of the results,
 however, was either marginal or, in the case of model-free tests,
 impossible to assess. Moreover, the tests were soon criticized for a
 number of biases. Various other tests of the present-value relations were
 later developed, avoiding in different degrees the econometric problems
 attending the first-generation tests also found excess volatility, though
 sometimes of borderline statistical significance. This finding of excess
 volatility is robust and is difficult to explain within the
 representative-consumer, frictionless-market model.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Consensus in Diverse Corporate Boards 
Abstract:
 Many directors are not simply insiders or outsiders. For example, an
 officer of a supplier is neither independent nor captive of management. We
 use a spatial model of board decision-making to analyze bargaining among
 multiple types of directors. Board decisions are modeled using a new
 solution concept called consensus. We use consensus to show that the
 information a new director brings is more important than the new
 director's impact on bargaining when the board is large and not too
 diverse. Our model suggests broadening the regulatory definition of
 independence and requiring a supermajority of outsiders. It also cautions
 that strong penalties, such as those imposed by Sarbanes-Oxley erode
 incentives when board performance is difficult to measure.  The Author 2008. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title: A Comprehensive Look at The Empirical Performance of Equity Premium Prediction 
Abstract:
 Our article comprehensively reexamines the performance of variables that
 have been suggested by the academic literature to be good predictors of
 the equity premium. We find that by and large, these models have predicted
 poorly both in-sample (IS) and out-of-sample (OOS) for 30 years now; these
 models seem unstable, as diagnosed by their out-of-sample predictions and
 other statistics; and these models would not have helped an investor with
 access only to available information to profitably time the market.  The Author 2007. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title: The Effect of Risk on the CEO Market 
Abstract:
 This article presents a market equilibrium model of CEO assignment, pay,
 and incentives under risk aversion and moral hazard. Each of the three
 outcomes can be summarized by a single closed-form equation. In the
 presence of moral hazard, assignment is distorted from positive
 assortative matching on firm size as firms with higher risk or disutility
 choose less talented CEOs. Such firms also pay higher salaries in the
 cross-section, but economy-wide increases in risk or the disutility of
 being a CEO do not affect pay. The strength of incentives depends only on
 the disutility of effort and is independent of risk and risk aversion. If
 the CEO can affect firm risk, incentives rise and are increasing in risk
 and risk aversion. We calibrate the losses from various forms of poor
 corporate governance, such as failures in monitoring and inefficiencies in
 CEO assignment.  The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: Financing under Extreme Risk: Contract Terms and Returns to Private Investments in Public Equity 
Abstract:
 We study financial contracting using transactions from the private
 investments in public equity market. Our tests show that the use of terms
 that are contingent on an issuer's future performance increases with
 issuer risk. Among issuers with poorer stock performance, higher cash burn
 rates, and more uncertain investment prospects, purchase discount-only
 contracts are uncommon and contracts with contingent terms are frequently
 used. Our evidence also supports arguments that issuer bargaining power
 with investors erodes as financing alternatives grow more limited. In
 particular, terms that can transfer control to investors are most commonly
 used by issuers in the weakest financial condition.   The Author 2010. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title: The Economics of Private Equity Funds 
Abstract:
 This article analyzes the economics of the private equity industry using a
 novel model and dataset. We obtain data from a large investor in private
 equity funds, with detailed records on 238 funds raised between 1993 and
 2006. We build a model to estimate the expected revenue to managers as a
 function of their investor contracts, and we test how this estimated
 revenue varies across the characteristics of our sample funds. Among our
 sample funds, about two-thirds of expected revenue comes from
 fixed-revenue components that are not sensitive to performance. We find
 sharp differences between venture capital (VC) and buyout (BO) funds. BO
 managers build on their prior experience by increasing the size of their
 funds faster than VC managers do. This leads to significantly higher
 revenue per partner and per professional in later BO funds. The results
 suggest that the BO business is more scalable than the VC business and
 that past success has a differential impact on the terms of their future
 funds.   The Author 2010. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title: Good Times or Bad Times? Investors' Uncertainty and Stock Returns 
Abstract:
 This paper investigates empirically the dynamics of investors' beliefs and
 Bayesian uncertainty about the state of the economy as state variables
 that describe the time-variation in investment opportunities. Using
 measures of uncertainty constructed from the state probabilities estimated
 from two-state regime-switching models of aggregate market return and of
 aggregate output, I find a negative relationship between the level of
 uncertainty and asset valuations. This relationship shows substantial
 cross-sectional variation across portfolios sorted on size,
 book-to-market, and past returns, especially conditional on the state of
 the economy. I show that a conditional model with investors' beliefs and
 an uncertainty risk factor is remarkably successful in explaining a large
 part of the cross-sectional variation in average portfolio returns. The
 uncertainty risk factor retains its incremental explanatory power when
 compared to other conditional models such as the conditional CAPM.  The Author 2008. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title: Competition, Adverse Selection, and Information Dispersion in the Banking Industry 
Abstract:
  Proprietary information generated through the process of lending can
 impact the structure of the banking industry. With more competing banks,
 borrower-specific information becomes more disperse, as each bank becomes
 informed about a smaller pool of borrowers. This reduces banks' screening
 ability, creating an inefficiency as more low-quality borrowers obtain
 financing. Incumbent banks' information advantage may also create
 difficulties for potential entrants, so that entry should be easier in
 markets with high borrower turnover or where entrants have specific
 expertise in evaluating credit risks. We draw implications for whether
 financial deregulation is likely to increase borrowers' surplus, and what
 patterns of entry might be observed.   Copyright 2002, Oxford University Press.

Title:   A Theory of Mutual Formation and Moral Hazard with Evidence from the History of the Insurance Industry.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 545-77
Issue: 2
Volume: 8
Year: 1995
Abstract:
  Nonprofit, mutually owned insurance and banking organizations have
 significant market shares in the insurance and banking industries. A first
 step in a systematic study of these financial mutual is to examine the
 reasons for their formation. Doing so provides empirical support for the
 view that these mutual arose as an efficient means of addressing
 contracting challenges caused by aggregate uncertainties and moral hazard.
 A formal model with this property is presented. We argue that information
 asymmetries do more to explain the kinds of contracts offered by financial
 mutual than do agency problems between owners, managers, and customers.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title:   Expectations and Volatility of Consumption and Asset Returns.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 207-32
Issue: 2
Volume: 3
Year: 1990
Abstract:
  The authors find that conditional means and variances of consumption
 growth vary through time, and this variation appears to be associated with
 the business cycle. A pricing model with fluctuating means and variances
 of consumption growth provides implications about conditional moments of
 returns for both short and long investment horizons, and these
 implications are explored empirically. The U-shaped pattern of first-order
 autocorrelations of returns, as well as business cycle patterns in the
 price of risk, appears to be consistent with the model, but the authors'
 exploration suggests that other implications about conditional return
 moments are at odds with the data.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Event Study Testing with Cross-sectional Correlation of Abnormal Returns 
Abstract:
 This article examines the issue of cross-sectional correlation in event
 studies. When there is event-date clustering, we find that even relatively
 low cross-correlation among abnormal returns is serious in terms of
 over-rejecting the null hypothesis of zero average abnormal returns. We
 propose a new test statistic that modifies the t-statistic of Boehmer,
 Musumeci, and Poulsen (1991) to take into account cross-correlation and
 show that it performs well in competition with others, including the
 portfolio approach, which is less powerful than other alternatives under
 study. Also, our statistic is readily useable to test multiple-day
 cumulative abnormal returns.  The Author 2010. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title: An Analysis of Covariance Risk and Pricing Anomalies 
Abstract:
  This article examines the link between several well-known asset pricing
 "anomalies" and the covariance structure of returns. I find size,
 book-to-market, and momentum strategies exhibit a strong, weak, and
 negligible relation to covariance risk, respectively. A size factor helps
 predict future volatility and covariation, improving the efficiency of
 investment strategies. Moreover, its premium rises following increases in
 both its volatility and covariation with other assets. These effects are
 amplified in recessions. No such relations exist for book-to-market or
 momentum. These findings may shed light on explanations for these premia
 and present a challenging set of facts for future theory.   Copyright 2003, Oxford University Press.

Title: Are U.S. CEOs Paid More Than U.K. CEOs? Inferences from Risk-adjusted Pay 
Abstract:
 We compute and compare risk-adjusted CEO pay in the United States and
 United Kingdom, where the risk adjustment is based on estimated risk
 premiums stemming from the equity incentives borne by CEOs. Controlling
 for firm and industry characteristics, we find that U.S. CEOs have higher
 pay, but also bear much higher stock and option incentives than U.K. CEOs.
 Using reasonable estimates of risk premiums, we find that risk-adjusted
 U.S. CEO pay does not appear to be large compared to that of U.K. CEOs. We
 also examine differences in pay and equity incentives between a sample of
 non-U.K. European CEOs and a matched sample of U.S. CEOs, and find that
 risk-adjusting pay may explain about half of the apparent higher pay for
 U.S. CEOs.  The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title: Momentum and Autocorrelation in Stock Returns 
Abstract:
  This article studies momentum in stock returns, focusing on the role of
 industry, size, and book-to-market (B-M) factors. Size and B-M portfolios
 exhibit momentum as strong as that in individual stocks and industries.
 The size and B-M portfolios are well diversified, so momentum cannot be
 attributed to firm- or industry-specific returns. Further, industry, size,
 and B-M portfolios are negatively autocorrelated and cross-serially
 correlated over intermediate horizons. The evidence suggests that stocks
 covary "too strongly" with each other. I argue that excess covariance, not
 underreaction, explains momentum in the portfolios.   Copyright 2002, Oxford University Press.

Pages: 1-36
Issue: 1
Volume: 9
Year: 1996
Abstract:
  This article develops a model of the upstairs market where order size,
 beliefs, and prices are determined endogenously. We test the model's
 predictions using unique data for 5,625 equity trades during the period
 1985 to 1992 that are known to be upstairs transactions and are identified
 as either buyer or seller initiated. We find that price movements prior to
 the trade data are significantly positively related to trade size,
 consistent with information leakage as the block is "shopped" upstairs.
 Further, the temporary price impact or liquidity effect is a concave
 function of order size, which may result from upstairs intermediation.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

  The literature on conditional event-study methods criticizes standard
 event-study procedures as being misspecified if events are voluntary and
 investors are rational. We argue, however, that standard procedures (1)
 lead to statistically valid inferences, under conditions described in this
 article; and (2) are often a superior means of inference, even when
 event-study data are generated exactly as per a class of rational
 expectations specifications introduced by the conditional methods
 literature. Our results provide an equilibrium justification for
 traditional event-study methods, and we suggest how these simple
 procedures may be combined with conditional methods to improve statistical
 power in event studies.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Executive Networks and Firm Policies: Evidence from the Random Assignment of MBA Peers 
Abstract:
 Using the historical random assignment of MBA students to sections at
 Harvard Business School (HBS), I explore how executive peer networks can
 affect managerial decision making. Within an HBS class, firm outcomes are
 significantly more similar among graduates from the same section than
 among graduates from different sections, with the strongest effects in
 executive compensation and acquisitions strategy. I demonstrate the role
 of ongoing social interactions by showing that peer effects are more than
 twice as strong in the year following staggered alumni reunions.
 Supplementary tests suggest that peer influence can operate in ways that
 do not contribute to firm productivity.  The Author 2013. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: Y2K Options and the Liquidity Premium in Treasury Markets 
Abstract:
 Financial institutions around the world expected the millennium date
 change (Y2K) to cause an aggregate liquidity shortage. Responding to the
 concern, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York auctioned Y2K options to
 primary dealers. The options gave the dealers the right to borrow from the
 Fed at a predetermined interest rate. Using the implied volatilities of
 Y2K options and the on-off-the-run spread, we demonstrate that the Fed's
 action eased the fears of bond dealers, contributing to a drop in the
 liquidity premium of Treasury securities. Our analysis shows the link
 between the microstructure of government debt markets and the central
 bank's provision of liquidity. We argue that Y2K options and their effects
 on liquidity premium broadly conform to the economic theory on public
 provision of private liquidity.  The Author 2008. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title: The Economic Consequences of IPO Spinning 
Abstract:
 Using a sample of fifty-six companies going public in 1996--2000 in which
 top executives received allocations of other hot initial public offerings
 (IPOs) from the bookrunner, a practice known as spinning, we examine the
 consequences of spinning. The fifty-six IPOs had first-day returns that
 were, on average, 23% higher than similar IPOs. The profits collected by
 these executives were only a small fraction of the incremental amount of
 money left on the table by their companies when they went public. These
 companies were dramatically less likely to switch investment bankers in a
 follow-on offer: only 6% of issuers whose executives were spun switched
 underwriters, whereas 31% of other issuers switched. These findings
 suggest that the spinning of executives accomplished its goal of affecting
 corporate decisions.  The Author 2010. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title: Do Domestic Investors Have an Edge? The Trading Experience of Foreign Investors in Korea 
Abstract:
  We investigate whether domestic investors have an edge over foreign
 investors in trading domestic stocks. Using Korean data, we show that
 foreign money managers pay more than domestic money managers when they buy
 and receive less when they sell for medium and large trades. The sample
 average daily trade-weighted disadvantage of foreign money managers is 21
 basis points for purchases and 16 basis points for sales. There is also
 some evidence that domestic individual investors have an edge over foreign
 investors. The explanation for these results is that prices move more
 against foreign investors than against domestic investors before trades.   Copyright 2005, Oxford University Press.

Title: Habit Formation, Incomplete Markets, and the Significance of Regional Risk for Expected Returns 
Abstract:
 This paper introduces a consumption-based capital asset pricing model
 (CCAPM) that combines undiversifiable income shocks and external habit
 formation. Using US state-level data, the paper provides realistic
 estimates for preference parameters when the external habit of the state
 investors is based on the consumption of the four Census regions. The
 model also implies four asset pricing factors: the cross-sectional means
 of consumption growth and habit growth (capturing national systematic
 risk) and the cross-sectional variances of consumption growth and habit
 growth (capturing regional systematic risk). This four-factor model has
 greater power in explaining expected returns than the CCAPM described in
 Breeden (1979).  , Oxford University Press.

Title: Capital Structure and Debt Structure 
Abstract:
 Using a novel dataset that records individual debt issues on the balance
 sheets of public firms, we demonstrate that traditional capital structure
 studies that ignore debt heterogeneity miss substantial capital structure
 variation. Relative to high-credit-quality firms, low-credit-quality firms
 are more likely to have a multi-tiered capital structure consisting of
 both secured bank debt with tight covenants and subordinated non-bank debt
 with loose covenants. We discuss the extent to which these findings are
 consistent with existing theoretical models of debt structure in which
 firms simultaneously use multiple debt types to reduce incentive
 conflicts.  The Author 2010. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title: The Price Impact of Institutional Herding 
Abstract:
 We develop a simple model of the price impact of institutional herding.
 The empirical literature indicates that institutional herding positively
 predicts short-term returns but negatively predicts long-term returns. We
 offer a theoretical resolution to this dichotomy. In our model,
 career-concerned money managers trade with security dealers endowed with
 market power and exhibit an endogenous tendency to imitate past trades.
 This tendency is exploited by dealers and thus affects prices. In
 equilibrium, institutional herding positively predicts short-term returns
 but negatively predicts long-term returns. Our article also generates
 several new, testable predictions that link institutional herding with the
 time-series properties of returns and volume.  The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Year: 2000
Abstract:
  We analyze a distressed firm indebted to many creditors. The firm's
 owners have the option of choosing the sequence of restructuring
 negotiations with the creditors. We show that sequencing flexibility is
 beneficial to firm owners, and that the optimal sequencing of
 restructuring negotiations involves exploiting the firm's liabilities to
 some creditors so as to moderate the demands of others. Moderately
 distressed firms will extract concessions from all creditors. In this
 case, owners can gain if they can credibly commit to conditional
 restructuring agreements that link the concessions of one creditor to
 concessions by others.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Issue: 4
Volume: 6
Year: 1993
Abstract:
  In aggregate, options on real and financial assets can have very
 different properties. Typically, the good or service produced by a real
 asset has a finite elasticity of demand, and developers have finite
 capacities. Also, the supply of options can be limited, and developers can
 be less than perfectly competitive. In a subgame, perfect Nash equilibrium
 with these properties, the optimal exercise policy, and resulting values
 of developed and undeveloped assets are calculated explicitly. The novel
 comparative statics are discussed in detail.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Do the Best Hedge Funds Hedge? 
Abstract:
 We provide a simple argument that suggests that better-informed hedge
 funds choose to have less exposure to factor risk. Consistent with this
 argument, we find that hedge funds that exhibit lower R-squareds with
 respect to systematic factors have higher Sharpe ratios, higher
 information ratios, and higher alphas. They also exhibit higher
 manipulation-proof performance measures and charge higher fees.  The Author 2010. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title: Takeovers and Divergence of Investor Opinion 
Abstract:
 We test several hypotheses on how takeover premium is related to
 investors' divergence of opinion on a target's equity value. We show that
 the total takeover premium, the pre-announcement target stock price
 run-up, and the post-announcement stock price markup are all higher when
 investors have higher divergence of opinion. We obtain identical results
 with higher market-level investor sentiment. When divergence of opinion is
 higher, a firm is less likely to be a takeover target, although takeover
 synergy in successful takeovers is higher. Our results suggest that
 takeovers may play a role in explaining high contemporaneous stock prices
 in the presence of high divergence of investor opinion.  The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: Information Technology and Financial Services Competition 
Abstract:
  We analyze how two dimensions of technological progress affect
 competition in financial services. While better technology may result in
 improved information processing, it might also lead to low-cost or even
 free access to information through, for example, informational spillovers.
 In the context of credit screening, we show that better access to
 information decreases interest rates and the returns from screening.
 However, an improved ability to process information increases interest
 rates and bank profits. Hence predictions regarding financial claims'
 pricing hinge on the overall effect ascribed to technological progress.
 Our results generalize to other financial markets where informational
 asymmetries drive profitability, such as insurance and securities markets.   Copyright 2003, Oxford University Press.

Title: IPO Pricing and Allocation: A Survey of the Views of Institutional Investors 
Abstract:
 Despite the central importance of investors to all initial public offering
 (IPO) theories, relatively little is known about their role in practice.
 This article is based on a survey of how institutional investors assess
 IPOs, what information they provide to the investment banking syndicate,
 and the factors they believe influence allocations. We find that investor
 characteristics, in particular brokerage relationships with the
 bookrunner, are perceived to be the most important factors influencing
 allocations, which supports the view that IPO allocations are part of
 implicit quid pro quo deals with investment banks. The survey raises
 doubts as to the extent of information production or revelation.  The Author 2008. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title: Do Foreigners Invest Less in Poorly Governed Firms? 
Abstract:
 As domestic sources of outside finance are limited in many countries
 around the world, it is important to understand factors that influence
 whether foreign investors provide capital to a country's firms. We study
 4,409 firms from twenty-nine countries to assess whether and why concerns
 about corporate governance result in fewer foreign holdings. We find that
 foreigners invest less in firms that reside in countries with poor
 outsider protection and disclosure and have ownership structures that are
 conducive to governance problems. This effect is particularly pronounced
 when earnings are opaque, indicating that information asymmetry and
 monitoring costs faced by foreign investors likely drive the results.  The Author 2008. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Year: 1992
Abstract:
  The continuous-time version of A. Kyle's (1985) model of asset pricing
 with asymmetric information is studied. It is shown that there is a unique
 equilibrium pricing rule within a certain class. This pricing rule is
 obtained in closed form for general distributions of the asset value. A
 particular example is a lognormal distribution, for which the equilibrium
 price process is a geometric Brownian motion. General trading strategies
 are allowed. In equilibrium, the informed agent, who is risk neutral, has
 many optima, but he does not correlate his trades locally with the noise
 trades nor does he submit discrete orders.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Abstract:
  A change of numeraire argument is used to derive a general option parity,

 obtain new expressions for futures and forward prices. The general parity
 result unifies and extends a number of existing results. The new futures
 and forward pricing formulas are often simpler to compute in multifactor
 models than existing alternatives. We also extend previous work by
 deriving a general formula relating exchange options to ordinary call
 options. A number of applications to diffusion models, including
 stochastic volatility, stochastic interest rate, and stochastic dividend
 rate models, and jump-diffusion models are examined.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: State Dependence Can Explain the Risk Aversion Puzzle 
Abstract:
 Risk aversion functions extracted from observed stock and option prices
 can be negative, as shown by Aït-Sahalia and Lo (2000), Journal of
 Econometrics 94: 9--51; and Jackwerth (2000), The Review of Financial
 Studies 13(2), 433--51. We rationalize this puzzle by a lack of
 conditioning on latent state variables. Once properly conditioned, risk
 aversion functions and pricing kernels are consistent with economic
 theory. To differentiate between the various theoretical explanations in
 terms of heterogeneity of beliefs or preferences, market sentiment,
 state-dependent utility, or regimes in fundamentals, we calibrate several
 consumption-based asset pricing models to match the empirical pricing
 kernel and risk aversion functions at different dates and over several
 years.  The Author 2007. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title:   IPOs and Long-Term Relationships: An Advantage of Book Building.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 697-714
Issue: 3
Volume: 13
Year: 2000
Abstract:
  There is a global trend in initial public offerings toward the increased
 use of book building. Relative to other methods such as auctions, a key
 feature of book building is that the underwriter has total discretion in
 allocating shares, allowing allocations to be based on long-term
 relationships between underwriters and investors. In a multiperiod model
 with endogenous (and costly) information acquisition. I show that the
 underwriter's ability to lower underpricing depends largely on its ability
 to favor regular uninformed investors. One implication is that the hybrid
 book building/open offer method, which is becoming increasingly popular
 internationally, will lead to higher underpricing than straight book
 building.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Mutual Fund Survivorship 
Abstract:
  This article provides a comprehensive study of survivorship issues using
 the mutual fund data of Carhart (1997). We demonstrate theoretically that
 when survival depends on multiperiod performance, the survivorship bias in
 average performance typically increases with the sample length. This is
 empirically relevant because evidence suggests a multiyear survival rule
 for U.S. mutual funds. In the data we find the annual bias increases from
 0.07% for 1-year samples to 1% for samples longer than 15 years. We find
 that survivor conditioning weakens evidence of performance persistence.
 Finally, we explain how survivor conditioning affects the relation between
 performance and fund characteristics.   Copyright 2002, Oxford University Press.

Title: Conflicts of Interest and Stock Recommendations: The Effects of the Global Settlement and Related Regulations 
Abstract:
 We study the effect of the Global Analyst Research Settlement and related
 regulations on sell-side research. These regulations attempted to mitigate
 the interdependence between research and investment banking. We document
 that following the regulations many brokerage houses have migrated from
 the traditional five-tier rating system to a three-tier system. Optimistic
 recommendations have become less frequent and more informative, whereas
 neutral and pessimistic recommendations have become more frequent and less
 informative. Importantly, the overall informativeness of recommendations
 has declined. The likelihood of issuing optimistic recommendations no
 longer depends on affiliation with the covered firm, although affiliated
 analysts are still reluctant to issue pessimistic recommendations.  The Author 2009. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org, Oxford University Press.

Title: The Pooling and Tranching of Securities: A Model of Informed Intermediation 
Abstract:
  I show that when an issuer has superior information about the value of
 its assets, it is better off selling assets separately rather than as a
 pool due to the information destruction effect of pooling. If, however,
 the issuer can create a derivative security that is collateralized by the
 assets, pooling and "tranching" may be optimal. If the residual risk of
 each asset is not highly correlated, tranching allows the issuer to
 exploit the risk diversification effect of pooling to create a low-risk
 and highly liquid security. In contrast, for an uninformed seller, pure
 pooling reduces underpricing and is preferred to separate asset sales.
 These results lead to a dynamic model of financial intermediation:
 originators sell pools of assets, some of which are purchased by informed
 intermediaries who then further pool and tranche them. Pooling and
 tranching allow intermediaries to leverage their capital more efficiently,
 enhancing the returns to their private information.   Copyright 2005, Oxford University Press.

Title:   Volatility in the Foreign Currency Futures Market.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 543-69
Issue: 3
Volume: 4
Year: 1991
Abstract:
  We examine the volatility implications of around-the-clock foreign
 exchange trading with transaction data on futures contracts from the
 Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the London International Financial Futures
 Exchange. We find higher U.S.-European and U.S.-Japanese exchange-rate
 volatilities during U.S. trading hours and higher European cross-rate
 volatilities during European trading hours. While the diclosure of private
 information through trading may partly explain these volatility patterns,
 we conclude that the increased volatility is more likely driven by
 macroeconomic news announcements. An analysis of inter- and intraday data
 also reveals that volatility increases at times that coincide with the
 release of U.S. macroeconomic news.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title:   Bank Liquidity and Stability in an Overlapping Generations Model.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 389-417
Issue: 2
Volume: 7
Year: 1994
Abstract:
  In an infinitely repeated version of the Diamond and Dybvig (1983) model,
 intergenerational transfers enable a bank to achieve interest rate
 smoothing and to provide depositors with liquidity insurance without
 Diamond and Dybvig's assumption of no side trades. The bank is subject to
 runs that may result from either excessive withdrawals or the lack of new
 deposits. The latter cause, which cannot occur in Diamond and Dybvig's
 one-generation model, implies that suspension of convertibility may not
 prevent bank runs. Government intervention may be necessary to maintain
 bank stability.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Market Discipline and Internal Governance in the Mutual Fund Industry 
Abstract:
 We develop a continuous-time model in which a portfolio manager is hired
 by a management company. On the basis of observed portfolio returns, all
 agents update their beliefs about the manager's skills. In response,
 investors can move capital into or out of the mutual fund, and the
 management company can fire the manager. Introducing firing rationalizes
 several empirically documented findings, such as the positive relation
 between manager tenure and fund size or the increase of portfolio risk
 before a manager replacement and the following risk decrease. The analysis
 predicts that the critical performance threshold that triggers firing
 increases significantly over a manager's tenure and that management
 replacements are accompanied by capital inflows when a young manager is
 replaced but may be accompanied by capital outflows when a manager with a
 long tenure is fired. Our model yields much lower valuation levels for
 management companies than simple applications of discounted cash flow
 (DCF) methods and is thus more consistent with empirical observations.  , Oxford University Press.

Title: Product Market Synergies and Competition in Mergers and Acquisitions: A Text-Based Analysis 
Abstract:
 We use text-based analysis of 10-K product descriptions to examine whether
 firms exploit product market synergies through asset complementarities in
 mergers and acquisitions. Transactions are more likely between firms that
 use similar product market language. Transaction stock returns, ex post
 cash flows, and growth in product descriptions all increase for
 transactions with similar product market language, especially in
 competitive product markets. These gains are larger when targets are less
 similar to acquirer rivals and when targets have unique products. Our
 findings are consistent with firms merging and buying assets to exploit
 synergies to create new products that increase product differentiation.  The Author 2010. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title: Originate-to-distribute Model and the Subprime Mortgage Crisis 
Abstract:
 An originate-to-distribute (OTD) model of lending, where the originator of
 a loan sells it to various third parties, was a popular method of mortgage
 lending before the onset of the subprime mortgage crisis. We show that
 banks with high involvement in the OTD market during the pre-crisis period
 originated excessively poor-quality mortgages. This result is not
 explained away by differences in observable borrower quality, geographical
 location of the property, or the cost of capital of high- and low-OTD
 banks. Instead, our evidence supports the view that the originating banks
 did not expend resources in screening their borrowers. The effect of OTD
 lending on poor mortgage quality is stronger for capital-constrained
 banks. Overall, we provide evidence that lack of screening incentives
 coupled with leverage-induced risk-taking behavior significantly
 contributed to the current subprime mortgage crisis.  The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: Relative Wealth Concerns and Complementarities in Information Acquisition 
Abstract:
 This article studies how relative wealth concerns, in which a person's
 satisfaction with their own consumption depends on how much others are
 consuming, affect investors' incentives to acquire information. We find
 that such externalities can generate complementarities in information
 acquisition within the standard rational expectations paradigm. When
 agents are sensitive to the wealth of others, they herd on the same
 information, trying to mimic each other's trading strategies. We show that
 there can be multiple herding equilibria in which different communities
 pursue different information acquisition strategies. This multiplicity of
 equilibria generates price discontinuities: An infinitesimal shift in
 fundamentals can lead to a discrete price movement.  The Author 2010. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title:   How Different Is Japanese Corporate Finance? An Investigation of the Information Content of New Security Issues.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 109-39
Issue: 1
Volume: 9
Year: 1996
Abstract:
  This article studies the shareholder wealth effects associated with 875
 new security issues in Japan from January 1, 1985, to May 31, 1991. The
 announcement of convertible debt issues has a significant positive
 abnormal return of 1.05 percent. There is an abnormal return of 0.45
 percent at the announcement of equity issues that is offset by an abnormal
 return of 1.01 percent on the issue day. Abnormal returns are negatively
 related to firm size, so that large Japanese firms have abnormal returns
 less different from those of U.S. firms than small Japanese firms. Our
 evidence is consistent with the view that Japanese managers decide to
 issue shares based on different considerations than American managers.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title:   A New Dividend Forecasting Procedure That Rejects Bubbles in Asset Prices: The Case of 1929's Stock Crash.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 333-83
Issue: 2
Volume: 9
Year: 1996
Abstract:
  We develop a new procedure to forecast future cash flows from a financial
 asset and then use the present value of our cash flow forecasts to
 calculate the asset's fundamental price. As an example, we construct a
 nonlinear ARMA-ARCH-Artificial Neural Network Model to obtain
 out-of-sample dividend forecasts for 1920 and beyond, using only in-sample
 dividend data. The present value of our forecasted dividends yield
 fundamental prices that reproduce the magnitude, timing, and time-series
 behavior of the boom and crash in 1929 stock prices. We therefore reject
 the popular claim that the 1920s stock market contained a bubble.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Abstract:
  In this article we study the effects of transaction costs on asset
 prices. We assume an overlapping generations economy with a riskless,
 liquid bond, and many risky stocks carrying proportional transaction
 costs. We obtain stock prices and turnover in closed form. Surprisingly, a
 stock's price may increase in transaction costs, and a more frequently
 traded stock may be less adversely affected by an increase in transaction
 costs. Calculations based on the "marginal" investor overestimate the
 effects of transaction costs. For realistic parameter values, transaction
 costs have very small effects on stock prices but large effects on
 turnover.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Nonparametric Estimation of State-Price Densities Implicit in Interest Rate Cap Prices 
Abstract:
 Based on a multivariate extension of the constrained locally polynomial
 estimator of Aït-Sahalia and Duarte (2003), we provide one of the first
 nonparametric estimates of probability densities of LIBOR rates under
 forward martingale measures and state-price densities (SPDs) implicit in
 interest rate cap prices. The forward densities and SPDs depend
 significantly on the slope and volatility of LIBOR rates, and mortgage
 markets activities have strong impacts on the shape of the forward
 densities. The SPDs exhibit a pronounced U-shape as a function of future
 LIBOR rates, suggesting that the state prices are high at both extremely
 low and high interest rates, which tend to be associated with recessions
 and periods of high inflation, respectively. Our results provide
 nonparametric evidence of unspanned stochastic volatility and suggest that
 the unspanned factors could be partly driven by activities in the mortgage
 markets.  The Author 2009. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title:   Insider and Liquidity Trading in Stock and Options Markets.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 743-80
Issue: 4
Volume: 7
Year: 1994
Abstract:
  We analyze the introduction of a nonredundant option, which completes the
 markets, and the effects of this on information revelation and risk
 sharing. The option alters the interaction between liquidity and insider
 trading. We find that the option mitigates the market breakdown problem
 created by the combination of market incompleteness and asymmetric
 information. The introduction of the option has ambiguous consequences on
 the informational efficiency of the market. One the one hand, by avoiding
 market breakdown, it enables trades to occur and convey information. On
 the other hand, the introduction of the option enlarges the set of trading
 strategies the insider can follow. This can make it more difficult for the
 market makers to interpret the information content of trades and
 consequently can reduce the informational efficiency of the market. The
 introduction of the option also has an ambiguous effect on the
 profitability of insider trades, which can either increase or decrease
 depending on parameter values.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Fundamental Properties of Bond Prices in Models of the Short-Term Rate 
Abstract:
  This article develops restrictions that arbitrage-constrained bond prices
 impose on the short-term rate process in order to be consistent with given
 dynamic properties of the term structure of interest rates. The central
 focus is the relationship between bond prices and the short-term rate
 volatility. In both scalar and multidimensional diffusion settings,
 typical relationships between bond prices and volatility are generated by
 joint restrictions on the risk-neutralized drift functions of the state
 variables and convexity of bond prices with respect to the short-term
 rate. The theory is illustrated by several examples and is partially
 extended to accommodate the occurrence of jumps and default.   Copyright 2003, Oxford University Press.

Title: Board Composition, Board Effectiveness, and the Observed Form of Takeover Bids 
Abstract:
  We show that bidding firms consider target board characteristics when
 deciding takeover offer types and initial offer premiums. We study a
 sample of 436 proposed negotiated mergers and bypass offers. Firms with
 individuals holding the titles of both chief executive officer (CEO) and
 board chair are more likely to receive bypass offers. These offers are
 more likely to be successful and generate higher target shareholder gains
 over the takeover offer period. When the target's board is independent,
 the target is less likely to receive a high premium and the offer is less
 likely to succeed.   Copyright 2004, Oxford University Press.

Abstract:
  Previous research finds that fundamental macroeconomic news has little

 of the business cycle, a stronger relationship between stock prices and
 news is evident. In addition to stock prices, we examine the effect of
 real activity news on proxies for expected cash flows and equity discount
 rates. We find that when the economy is strong the stock market responds
 negatively to news about higher real economic activity. This negative
 relation is caused by the larger increase in discount rates relative to
 expected cash flows.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Do Heterogeneous Beliefs Matter for Asset Pricing? 
Abstract:
  We study how heterogeneous beliefs affect returns and examine whether
 they are a priced factor in traditional asset pricing models. To
 accomplish this task, we suggest new empirical measures based on the
 disagreement among analysts about expected earnings (short-term and
 long-term) and show they are good proxies. We first establish that the
 heterogeneity of beliefs matters for asset pricing and then turn our
 attention to estimating a structural model in which we use the forecasts
 of financial analysts to proxy for agents' beliefs. Finally, we
 investigate whether the amount of heterogeneity in analysts' forecasts can
 help explain asset pricing puzzles.   Copyright 2005, Oxford University Press.

Title: The Effects of Price Risk on Housing Demand: Empirical Evidence from U.S. Markets 
Abstract:
 This article examines how price risk affects housing demand. It identifies
 two relevant channels: a financial risk effect that reduces demand, and a
 hedging effect that increases demand since current homes may hedge future
 housing costs. The latter dominates when hedging incentives are strong,
 namely when the likelihood of moving up the housing ladder is high and the
 tendency to move across markets is low. For households with weak hedging
 incentives, the article finds negative effects of price risk on the timing
 and size of home purchases, but positive effects for households with
 strong hedging incentives.  The Author 2010. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title: The Economics of Super Managers 
Abstract:
 We study a competitive model in which managers differ in ability and
 choose unobservable effort. Each firm chooses its size, how able a manager
 is to hire, and managerial compensation. The model can be considered an
 amalgam of agency and Superstars, where optimizing incentives enhances the
 firm's ability to provide a talented manager with greater resources. The
 model delivers many testable implications. Preliminary results show that
 the model is useful for understanding interesting compensation trends, for
 example, why CEO pay has recently become more closely associated with firm
 size. Allowing for firm productivity differences generally strengthens our
 results.  The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Volume: 12

Abstract:
  In contrast to previous literature, we argue that are two types of poorly
 performing firms going private through a leveraged buyout (LBO). One group
 consists of firms in which managers own an insignificant fraction of their
 firm's stock and are vulnerable to a hostile takeover. The other group
 consists of firms in which managers own a significant fraction of their
 firm's stock and so face little risk of hostile takeover. Our evidence
 indicates that there are two such groups of LBOs and that their
 motivations and posttransaction actions are different.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Pairs Trading: Performance of a Relative-Value Arbitrage Rule 
Abstract:
  We test a Wall Street investment strategy, "pairs trading," with daily
 data over 1962--2002. Stocks are matched into pairs with minimum distance
 between normalized historical prices. A simple trading rule yields average
 annualized excess returns of up to 11% for self-financing portfolios of
 pairs. The profits typically exceed conservative transaction-cost
 estimates. Bootstrap results suggest that the "pairs" effect differs from
 previously documented reversal profits. Robustness of the excess returns
 indicates that pairs trading profits from temporary mispricing of close
 substitutes. We link the profitability to the presence of a common factor
 in the returns, different from conventional risk measures.   Copyright 2006, Oxford University Press.

Title: Downside Risk 
Abstract:
  Economists have long recognized that investors care differently about
 downside losses versus upside gains. Agents who place greater weight on
 downside risk demand additional compensation for holding stocks with high
 sensitivities to downside market movements. We show that the cross section
 of stock returns reflects a downside risk premium of approximately 6% per
 annum. Stocks that covary strongly with the market during market declines
 have high average returns. The reward for beasring downside risk is not
 simply compensation for regular market beta, nor is it explained by
 coskewness or liquidity risk, or by size, value, and momentum
 characteristics. (JEL C12, C15, C32, G12)   Copyright 2006, Oxford University Press.

Title: Bond Ladders and Optimal Portfolios 
Abstract:
 We analyze complex bond portfolios within the framework of a dynamic
 general equilibrium asset-pricing model. Equilibrium bond portfolios are
 nonsensical and imply a trading volume that vastly exceeds observed
 trading volume on financial markets. Instead, portfolios that combine bond
 ladders with a market portfolio of equity assets are nearly optimal
 investment strategies. The welfare loss of these simple investment

Title:   Pricing Interest Rate Options in a Two-Factor Cox-Ingersoll-Ross Model of the Term Structure.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 613-36
Issue: 4
Volume: 5
Year: 1992
Abstract:
  Solutions are presented for prices on interest rate options in a
 two-factor version of the Cox-Ingersoll-Ross model of the term structure.
 Specific solutions are developed for caps on floating interest rates and
 for European options on discount bonds, coupon bonds, coupon bond futures,
 and Euro-dollar futures. The solutions for the options are expressed as
 multivariate integrals, and we show how to reduce the calculations to
 univariate numerical integrations, which can be calculated very quickly.
 The two-factor model provides more flexibility in fitting observed term
 structures, and the fixed parameters of the model can be set to capture
 the variability of the term structure over time.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Corruption, Political Connections, and Municipal Finance 
Abstract:
 We show that state corruption and political connections have strong
 effects on municipal bond sales and underwriting. Higher state corruption
 is associated with greater credit risk and higher bond yields. Corrupt
 states can eliminate the corruption yield penalty by purchasing credit
 enhancements. Underwriting fees were significantly higher during an era
 when underwriters made political contributions to win underwriting
 business. This pay-to-play underwriting fee premium exists only for
 negotiated bid bonds where underwriting business can be allocated on the
 basis of political favoritism. Overall, our results show a strong impact
 of corruption and political connections on financial market outcomes.  The Author 2009. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org, Oxford University Press.

Title: Running for the Exit? International Bank Lending During a Financial Crisis 
Abstract:
 We use loan-level data to examine how large international banks reduced
 their cross-border lending after the collapse of Lehman Brothers. Country,
 firm, and bank fixed effects allow us to disentangle credit supply and
 demand and to simultaneously control for the unobserved traits of banks
 and the countries and firms they lend to. We document substantial
 heterogeneity in the extent to which different banks retrenched from the
 same country. Banks reduced credit less to markets that were
 geographically close; where they were more experienced; where they
 operated a subsidiary; and where they were integrated into a network of
 domestic co-lenders.  The Author 2012. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: How Do Retirees Value Life Annuities? Evidence from Public Employees 
Abstract:
 Because life annuities can increase the level and decrease the volatility
 of lifetime consumption, economists have long been puzzled by the low
 demand for life annuities. One potential rational explanation is that
 adverse selection drives up life annuity prices, which drives down demand.
 We study the choice between life annuities and lump sums made by 32,000
 retiring public employees. These unique data allow us to extend the
 existing literature by exploiting economically significant cross-sectional
 and time-series variation in life annuity pricing. We find little evidence
 that retiree demand for life annuities rises when life annuity prices
 fall. We find strong evidence that demand responds to salient variation in
 individual characteristics, such as health, and to measures of investor
 sentiment, such as recent equity returns.  The Author 2012. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: SEO Risk Dynamics 
Abstract:
 We theoretically and empirically investigate firm-level risk dynamics
 around seasoned equity offerings (SEOs). Empirically, beta increases
 before SEOs and decreases gradually thereafter. Using real options theory,
 commitment-to-invest generates a gradual post-issuance beta decline
 whereas instantaneous investment and time-to-build do not. In a behavioral
 theory, systematic mispricing can cause increasing pre-issuance and
 decreasing post-issuance risk but idiosyncratic mispricing cannot. In the
 empirical cross-section, investment, own-firm runup, SEO proceeds, and
 primary issuance--associated with the real options theory--predict beta
 declines. Sentiment proxies have weaker effects in the full sample, but
 are significant in a post-1996 subsample. SEOs coincide with low firm- and
 market-volatility, suggesting volatility-timing in corporate decisions.  The Author 2010. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title: What Drives Stock Price Movements? 
Abstract:
 A central issue in finance is whether stock prices move because of
 revisions in expected cash flows or discount rates, and by how much of
 each. Using direct cash flow forecasts, we show that stock returns have a
 significant cash flow news component whose importance increases with the
 investment horizon. For horizons over two years, cash flow news is more
 important. These conclusions hold at both the firm and aggregate levels,
 and diversification plays a secondary role in affecting the relative
 importance of cash flow and discount rate news. Our findings highlight the
 importance of cash flows in asset pricing.  The Author 2013. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: Revisiting Asset Pricing Puzzles in an Exchange Economy 
Abstract:
 We show that several well-known asset pricing puzzles are largely
 mitigated if we endow the representative agent with an arbitrarily small
 minimum consumption level. This allows us to solve the model for parameter
 values where the standard "Lucas tree" model is not defined. For these
 parameters, disasters become more important, and the market risk premium
 therefore higher, even though consumption is less risky. Our model yields
 reasonable risk premia, Sharpe ratios, and discount rates; excess price
 volatility; and a high market price-dividend ratio. We derive closed-form
 solutions for all variables of interest.  The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title: Term Structure Dynamics in Theory and Reality 
Abstract:
  This article is a critical survey of models designed for pricing
 fixed-income securities and their associated term structures of market
 yields. Our primary focus is on the interplay between the theoretical
 specification of dynamic term structure models and their empirical fit to
 historical changes in the shapes of yield curves. We begin by overviewing
 the dynamic term structure models that have been fit to treasury or swap
 yield curves and in which the risk factors follow diffusions,
 jump-diffusion, or have "switching regimes." Then the goodness-of-fit of
 these models is assessed relative to their abilities to (i) match linear
 projections of changes in yields onto the slope of the yield curve; (ii)
 match the persistence of conditional volatilities, and the shapes of term
 structures of unconditional volatilities, of yields; and (iii) to reliably
 price caps, swaptions, and other fixed-income derivatives. For the case of
 defaultable securities we explore the relative fits to historical yield
 spreads.   Copyright 2003, Oxford University Press.

Title: Transmission of Information across International Equity Markets 
Abstract:
  This article provides evidence of information transmission from the
 United States and Japan to Korean and Thai equity markets. Information is
 defined as important macroeconomic announcements in the United States,
 Japan, Korea, and Thailand. Using high-frequency intraday data, I find a
 large and significant association between developed-economy macroeconomic
 announcements and emerging-economy equity volatility and trading volume at
 short time horizons. Previous studies' findings of at most weak evidence
 of transmission from developed to emerging economies may be due to their
 use of lower frequency data and their focus on developed-economy financial
 market innovations as a proxy for information. (JEL E44, G14, G15)   Copyright 2006, Oxford University Press.

Title: Lender Screening and the Role of Securitization: Evidence from Prime and Subprime Mortgage Markets 
Abstract:
 This article examines the link between mortgage securitization and lender
 screening during the boom and bust of the U.S. housing market. Using
 comprehensive data on both prime and subprime securitized and bank-held
 loans, we provide evidence that securitization affected lenders' screening
 decisions in the subprime market for low-documentation loans through two
 channels: the securitization rate and the time it takes to securitize a
 loan. The change in decision-making by subprime lenders occurs on
 dimensions that are unreported to investors. Examining the time-series
 evolution of the securitization market further reinforces these findings.
 We exploit heterogeneity across subprime and prime markets to illustrate
 that the potential for moral hazard may be reduced with greater collection
 of hard information and increased monitoring of lenders. Our results
 suggest that the policy debate regarding securitization and lenders'
 underwriting standards should separately evaluate the agency and
 non-agency markets, with special attention toward the extent of soft
 information in assets being securitized.  The Author 2012. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Year: 2000
Abstract:
  Opening mechanisms play a crucial role in information aggregation
 following the overnight nontrading period. This article examines the
 process of price discovery at the New York Stock Exchange single-price
 opening auction. We develop a theoretical model to explain the
 determinants of the opening price and test the model using order-level
 data. We show that the presence of designated dealers facilitates price
 discovery relative to a fully automated call auction market. This is
 consistent with specialists extracting information from observing the
 evolution of the limit order book. In addition, the specialist's opening
 trade reflects noninformational factors such as price stabilization
 requirements.	 Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Portfolio Selection with Parameter and Model Uncertainty: A Multi-Prior Approach 
Abstract:
  We develop a model for an investor with multiple priors and aversion to
 ambiguity. We characterize the multiple priors by a "confidence interval"
 around the estimated expected returns and we model ambiguity aversion via
 a minimization over the priors. Our model has several attractive features:
 (1) it has a solid axiomatic foundation; (2) it is flexible enough to
 allow for different degrees of uncertainty about expected returns for
 various subsets of assets and also about the return-generating model; and
 (3) it delivers closed-form expressions for the optimal portfolio. Our
 empirical analysis suggests that, compared with portfolios from classical
 and Bayesian models, ambiguity-averse portfolios are more stable over time
 and deliver a higher out-of sample Sharpe ratio. (JEL G11)   Copyright 2007, Oxford University Press.

Title: Credit Ratings and Stock Liquidity 
Abstract:
  We analyze contemporaneous and predictive relations between credit
 ratings and measures of equity market liquidity and find that common
 measures of adverse selection, which reflect a portion of the uncertainty
 about future firm value, are larger when credit ratings are poorer. We
 also show that future rating changes can be predicted using current levels
 of adverse selection. Collectively, our results validate widely used
 microstructure measures of adverse selection and offer new insights into
 the value of credit ratings and the specific nature of the information
 they contain.   Copyright 2006, Oxford University Press.

Title: How Do Mergers Create Value? A Comparison of Taxes, Market Power, and Efficiency Improvements as Explanations for&nbsp;Synergies 
Abstract:
 There is little evidence in the literature on the relative importance of
 the underlying sources of merger gains. Prior literature suggests that
 synergies could arise due to taxes, market power, or efficiency
 improvements. Based on Value Line forecasts, we estimate the average
 synergy gains in a broad sample of 264 large mergers to be 10.03% of the
 combined equity value of the merging firms. The detailed data in Value
 Line projections allow for the decomposition of these gains into
 underlying operating and financial synergies. We estimate that tax savings
 contribute only 1.64% in additional value, while operating synergies
 account for the remaining 8.38%. Operating synergies are higher in focused
 mergers, while tax savings constitute a large fraction of the gains in
 diversifying mergers. The operating synergies are generated primarily by
 cutbacks in investment expenditures rather than by increased operating
 profits. Overall, the evidence suggests that mergers generate gains by
 improving resource allocation rather than by reducing tax payments or
 increasing the market power of the combined firm.  The Author 2008. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org, Oxford University Press.

Title: Capital Controls, Liberalizations, and Foreign Direct Investment 
Abstract:
  This article evaluates the impact of capital controls and their
 liberalization on the activities of US multinational firms. These firms
 attempt to circumvent capital controls by reducing reported local
 profitability and increasing the frequency of dividend repatriations. As a
 result, the reported profit impact of local capital controls is comparable
 with the effect of 27% higher corporate tax rates, and affiliates located
 in countries imposing capital controls are 9.8% more likely than other
 affiliates to remit dividends to parent companies. Multinational
 affiliates located in countries with capital controls face 5.25% higher
 interest rates on local borrowing than do affiliates of the same parent
 borrowing locally in countries without capital controls. Capital control
 liberalizations are associated with significant increases in multinational
 activity--property, plant, and equipment grow at 6.9% faster annual rates
 following liberalizations. The combination of the costliness of avoidance
 and higher interest rates discourages investment in countries with capital
 controls, and this effect is reversed upon liberalization of controls.

Title: A Liquidity-Based Theory of Closed-End Funds 
Abstract:
 This paper develops a rational, liquidity-based model of closed-end funds
 (CEFs) that provides an economic motivation for the existence of this
 organizational form: They offer a means for investors to buy illiquid
 securities, without facing the potential costs associated with direct
 trading and without the externalities imposed by an open-end fund
 structure. Our theory predicts the patterns observed in CEF initial public
 offerings (IPOs) and the observed behavior of the CEF discount, which
 results from a trade-off between the liquidity benefits of investing in
 the CEF and the fees charged by the fund's managers. In particular, the
 model explains why IPOs occur in waves in certain sectors at a time, why
 funds are issued at a premium to net asset value (NAV), and why they later
 usually trade at a discount. We also conduct an empirical investigation,
 which, overall, provides more support for a liquidity-based model than for
 an alternative sentiment-based explanation.  The Author 2008. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org, Oxford University Press.

Title: Asset Pricing with Endogenous Disasters 
Abstract:
 We develop a parsimonious model in which frictions in the labor market may
 turn small, continuous labor productivity declines into large drops in
 employment, endogenously causing disasters. Assuming one state variable
 and CRRA agents, we solve for prices in closed form, calibrate the model
 using labor market data, and show that this simple setting captures the
 high, countercyclical volatility and equity premium observed in the United
 States. Moreover, returns in our model are conditionally predicted by
 dividend yields. Finally, as in the data, in our setting the disasters are
 larger when the capital's share of income is higher.  The Author 2013. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Volume: 5
Year: 1992
Abstract:
  Alternative ways of conducting inference and measurement for long-horizon
 forecasting are explored with an application to dividend yields as
 predictors of stock returns. Monte Carlo analysis indicates that the L.
 Hansen and R. Hodrick (1980) procedure is biased at long horizons, but the
 alternatives perform better. These include an estimator derived under the
 null hypothesis as in M. Richardson and T. Smith (1991), a reformulation
 of the regression as in N. Jegadeesh (1990), and a vector autoregression
 (VAR) as in J. Campbell and R. Shiller (1988), S. Kandel and R. Stambaugh
 (1988), and J. Campbell (1991). The statistical properties of long-horizon
 statistics generated from the VAR indicate interesting patterns in
 expected stock returns.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Pay for Performance from Future Fund Flows: The Case of Private Equity 
Abstract:
 Lifetime incomes of private equity general partners (GPs) are affected by
 their current funds' performance not only directly, through carried
 interest profit-sharing provisions, but also indirectly by the effect of
 the current fund's performance on GPs' abilities to raise capital for
 future funds. In the context of a rational learning model, which we show
 better matches the empirical relations between future fund-raising and
 current performance than behavioral alternatives, we estimate that
 indirect pay for performance from future fund-raising is of the same order
 of magnitude as direct pay for performance from carried interest.
 Consistent with the learning framework, indirect pay for performance is
 stronger when managerial abilities are more scalable and weaker when
 current performance is less informative about ability. Specifically, it is
 stronger for buyout funds than for venture capital funds, and declines in
 the sequence of a partnership's funds. Total pay for performance in
 private equity is both considerably larger and much more heterogeneous
 than implied by the carried interest alone. Our framework can be adapted
 to estimate indirect pay for performance in other asset management
 settings.  The Author 2012. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title:   Optimal Bankruptcy Laws across Different Economic Systems.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 347-77
Issue: 2
Volume: 12
Year: 1999
Abstract:
  We model fundamental differences across economic systems and propose
 optimal bankruptcy laws. We show that creditor-debtor relationships in a
 given economy are affected by the ability of creditors to obtain
 information about fundamentals and the managers' ability to strategically
 use their private information. An optimal bankruptcy law utilizes
 creditors' information while minimizing managers' use of strategic
 information. Our proposed laws for a developed bank-based system like
 Germany include a creditor chapter only, for a developed market-based
 system like the United States include both a creditor chapter and a debtor
 chapter, and for an underdeveloped system include both a creditor chapter
 and a debtor chapter that gives the manager more protection than in a
 market-based system.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Internal Capital Markets and Corporate Politics in a Banking Group 
Abstract:
 We analyze proprietary internal capital allocation data from a large
 retail banking group consisting of member banks and a headquarters
 organization. We find that capital allocations from headquarters
 compensate for deposit shortfalls on the bank level, suggesting that the
 headquarters offers deposit smoothing to member banks. We then analyze how
 the distribution of influence within the group relates to capital
 allocations and lending behavior. More influential banks are allocated
 more funds from headquarters, and their loan growth is less sensitive to
 their deposit base. The effects of influence are stronger if banks have a
 greater demand for deposit smoothing.  The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title: Asset Pricing with Limited Risk Sharing and Heterogeneous Agents 
Abstract:
 We develop a model with incomplete markets and heterogeneous agents that
 generates a large equity premium, while simultaneously matching stock
 market participation and individual asset holdings. The high risk-premium
 is driven by incomplete risk sharing among stockholders, which results
 from the combination of aggregate uncertainty, borrowing constraints, and
 a (realistically) calibrated life-cycle earnings profile subject to
 idiosyncratic shocks. We show that it is challenging to simultaneously
 match asset pricing moments and individual portfolio decisions, while
 limited participation has a negligible impact on the risk-premium,
 contrary to the results of models where it is imposed exogenously.  The Author 2007. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org, Oxford University Press.

Title: Option Exercise Games: An Application to the Equilibrium Investment Strategies of Firms 
Abstract:
  Under the standard real options approach to investment under uncertainty,
 agents formulate optimal exercise strategies in isolation and ignore
 competitive interactions. However, in many real-world asset markets,
 exercise strategies cannot be determined separately, but must be formed as
 part of a strategic equilibrium. This article provides a tractable
 approach for deriving equilibrium investment strategies in a
 continuous-time Cournot--Nash framework. The impact of competition on
 exercise strategies is dramatic. For example, while standard real options
 models emphasize that a valuable "option to wait" leads firms to invest
 only at large positive net present values, the impact of competition
 drastically erodes the value of the option to wait and leads to investment
 at very near the zero net present value threshold.   Copyright 2002, Oxford University Press.

Title:   The Dynamics of Portfolio Management Contracts.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 351-87
Issue: 2
Volume: 7
Year: 1994
Abstract:
  We consider the multiperiod relationship between a client and a portfolio
 manager and the resulting problem of motivating a manager of unknown
 ability to acquire valuable information. We explore the contractual forms
 and the optimal retention policy of the client and find that the optimal
 initial set of contracts features a smaller performance based fee
 component paid to the manager than in a first-best contract, and the
 contract choice elicits only partial information about the manager. As a
 result, ex post performance measurement is critical to future
 recontracting. In general, managers are retained only if the returns on
 their portfolio exceed the benchmark by an appropriate amount.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Strategic Alliances and the Boundaries of the Firm 
Abstract:
 Strategic alliances are long-term contracts between legally distinct
 organizations that provide for sharing the costs and benefits of a
 mutually beneficial activity. In this paper, I develop and test a model
 that helps explain why firms sometimes prefer alliances over internally
 organized projects. I introduce managerial effort into a model of internal
 capital markets and show how strategic alliances help overcome incentive
 problems that arise when headquarters cannot pre-commit to particular
 capital allocations. The model generates a number of implications, which I
 test using a large sample of alliance transactions in conjunction with
 Compustat data.  , Oxford University Press.

Title: Tunnel-Proofing the Executive Suite: Transparency, Temptation, and the Design of Executive Compensation 
Abstract:
 This paper considers optimal compensation for a CEO who is entrusted with
 administering corporate assets honestly. Optimal compensation designs
 maximize integrity at minimum cost. These designs are very "low powered,"
 i.e., while specifying a lower bound for performance and increasing pay
 with performance, they increase compensation at a rapidly decreasing rate.
 Thus, integrity considerations engender optimal compensation packages that
 closely resemble the very pervasive 80/120 bonus plans, exactly the sort
 of compensation that Jensen (2003) argues should compromise integrity.
 Under optimal designs, expected compensation increases linearly with firm
 size, and increases in the market/book ratio. Moreover, given optimal
 compensation, CEO asset diversion is limited to high market-to-book firms
 that have received negative productivity shocks.  The Author 2009. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org, Oxford University Press.

Title: Persistence and Reversal in Herd Behavior: Theory and Application to the Decision to Go Public 
Abstract:
  We model rational herd behavior when the underlying value changes over
 time, with payoffs that are either dependent or independent of the
 underlying value. We show that herding does not last forever and is not
 monotone in signal quality. High correlation among agents' actions does
 not necessarily imply herding. This suggests alternative empirical methods
 are needed to detect herding. The model has many applications, including
 the IPO decision in which payoffs are state dependent. The model implies
 that the decision to go public is more likely associated with herding than
 the decision to delay an IPO.   Copyright 2002, Oxford University Press.

Title: Dividend Stickiness and Strategic Pooling 
Abstract:
 We argue that dividend stickiness, the tendency of managers to keep
 dividends unchanged, implies that managers use a partially pooling
 dividend policy. We offer a model that demonstrates how such a policy can
 evolve endogenously in equilibrium. An informed manager who cares about
 the firm's intrinsic value as well as short-term stock price allocates
 earnings between investments and dividends. We show that there is a
 continuum of equilibria in which the dividend is constant for a range of
 realized earnings. Compared with the standard separating equilibrium, this
 partial pooling behavior induces higher firm value and lower
 underinvestment. We offer new empirical implications relating the pooling
 nature of dividend stickiness to the information environment of the firm,
 dividend prediction models, managerial incentives, and investment.  The Author 2010. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title:   Litigation Risk, Intermediation, and the Underpricing of Initial Public Offerings.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 709-42
Issue: 4
Volume: 5
Year: 1992
Abstract:
  We formally examine the role of litigation risk in initial public
 offering (IPO) pricing. The underwriter's pricing decision trades off
 current revenue against expected future litigation costs, both of which
 are increasing in the IPO price. Given a time-consistency constraint and
 rational expectations on the part of investors, however, the "standard"
 litigation risk argument does not lead to equilibrium underpricing. We
 develop a richer model that provides sufficient conditions under which
 there is equilibrium underpricing. The issuer's choice of employing an
 underwriter versus floating the IPO on its own is examined, and various
 testable implications of the model are developed.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Which Firms Follow the Market? An Analysis of Corporate Investment Decisions 
Abstract:
 We test whether stock market mispricing or private investor information in
 stock prices affects corporate investment. We develop an econometric
 methodology that disentangles stock-price movements that are relevant for
 investment from those that are not. We combine this decomposition with
 proxies for private information and mispricing to devise unbiased tests
 for the effects of mispricing and information on investment. We depart
 from much of the literature by finding that stock market mispricing does
 not affect investment, especially that of large firms and firms subject to
 mispricing. In contrast, we confirm previous evidence that managers
 incorporate private investor information when making investment decisions.  The Author 2010. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title: Corporate Governance Transfer and Synergistic Gains from Mergers and Acquisitions 
Abstract:
 We present evidence on the benefits of changes in control from mergers and
 acquisitions. We find that the stronger the acquirer's shareholder rights
 relative to the target's, the higher the synergy created by an
 acquisition. This result supports the hypothesis that acquisitions of
 firms with poor corporate governance by firms with good corporate
 governance generate higher total gains. We also find that the synergy
 effect of corporate governance is shared by target shareholders and
 acquiring shareholders, in that both target returns and acquirer returns
 increase with the shareholder-rights difference between the acquirer and
 the target.  The Author 2008. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title: With a Little Help from My (Random) Friends: Success and Failure in Post-Business School Entrepreneurship 
Abstract:
 How do individuals decide to become entrepreneurs and learn to make
 optimal entrepreneurial decisions? The concentration of entrepreneurs in
 regions such as Silicon Valley has stimulated research and policy interest
 into the influence of peers, but the causal effect is hard to identify
 empirically. We exploit the exogenous assignment of students into
 business-school sections to identify the causal effect of entrepreneurial
 peers. We show that, in contrast to prior findings, a higher share of
 entrepreneurial peers decreases, rather than increases, entrepreneurship.
 The decrease is driven by a reduction in unsuccessful entrepreneurial
 ventures; the effect on successful ventures is significantly more
 positive.  The Author 2013. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: Production in Entrepreneurial Firms: The Effects of Financial Constraints on Labor and Capital 
Abstract:
 I model the contrasting capital-labor decisions of financially constrained
 and unconstrained firms. I show that financially restricted firms use
 relatively more labor than physical capital because informed employees
 provide more efficient financing than uninformed capital suppliers. I
 demonstrate that constrained firms cannot easily attract new employees to
 replace existing staff. Their greater employee retention aligns
 owner-worker incentives and encourages workers to make firm-specific
 investments. Constrained firms, however, gradually suffer from their
 inability to replace low-quality workers, such that their relative labor
 productivity decreases over time. Empirical tests utilizing instrumental
 variables confirm several implications of the theory.  The Author 2007. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org, Oxford University Press.

Title:   Managerial Conservatism, Project Choice, and Debt.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 437-70
Issue: 3
Volume: 5
Year: 1992
Abstract:
  The authors show that the incentive for managers to build their
 reputations distorts firms' investment policies in favor of relatively
 safe projects, thereby aligning managers' interests with those of
 bondholders, even though managers are hired and fired by shareholders.
 This effect opposes the familiar agency problem of risky debt that is
 imperfectly covenant-protected, wherein shareholders are tempted to favor
 excessively risky projects in order to expropriate bondholders.
 Consequently, when managerial concern for reputation results in
 conservatism, it can actually make shareholders better off ex ante by
 allowing the firm to issue more debt. They examine how the optimal choice
 of leverage from the shareholders' standpoint is influenced by takeover
 activity, and how the adoption of anti-takeover measures affects a firm's
 investment policy and leverage choice.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Corporate Diversification and Credit Constraints: Real Effects across the Business Cycle 
Abstract:
  We study whether differences in access to credit cause focused firms to
 perform differently from diversified firms in the product market. Prior
 work has identified binding credit constraints for bank-dependent firms
 during recessions. We assess whether corporate diversification alleviates
 these constraints. We find that during recessions sales growth rates drop
 more for bank-dependent focused firms than for rival segments of
 bank-dependent diversified firms. We also find that during recessions
 inventory growth rates drop more for bank-dependent focused firms than for
 bank-dependent diversified firms even after we control for contemporaneous
 sales growth. Consistent with a credit constraint explanation, we find no
 difference in the sensitivities to recessions of bank-independent focused
 and bank-independent diversified firms. (JEL G30, G31, G32)   Copyright 2006, Oxford University Press.

Title:   Insider Trading, Outside Search, and Resource Allocation: Why Firms and Society May Disagree on Insider Trading Restrictions.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 575-608
Issue: 3
Volume: 7
Year: 1994
Abstract:
  We show that entrepreneurs may prefer to allow insider trading even when
 it is not socially optimal. We examine a model in which an insider/manager
 allocates resources on the basis of his private information and outside
 information conveyed through the secondary-market price of the firm's
 shares. If the manager is allowed to trade, he will compete with informed
 outsiders, reducing the equilibrium quality of outside information. While
 the benefits to production of outside information are the same for society
 and entrepreneurs, we show that the social and private costs are
 different. Thus, entrepreneurs and society may disagree on the conditions
 under which insider trading restrictions should be imposed.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Demand Curves and the Pricing of Money Management 
Abstract:
  One reason why funds charge different prices to their investors is that
 they face different demand curves. One source of differentiation is asset
 retention: Performance-sensitive investors migrate from worse to better
 prospects, taking their performance sensitivity with them. In the
 cross-section we show that past attrition significantly influences the
 current pricing of retail but not institutional funds. In time-series we
 show that the repricing of retail funds after merging in new shareholders
 is predicted by the estimated effect on its demand curve. This result is
 robust to other influences on repricing, including asset and account-size
 changes.   Copyright 2002, Oxford University Press.

Title: Asset Pricing in the Dark: The Cross-Section of OTC Stocks 
Abstract:
 Over-the-counter (OTC) stocks are far less liquid, disclose less
 information, and exhibit lower institutional holdings than do listed
 stocks. We exploit these different market conditions to test theories of
 cross-sectional return premiums. Compared with premiums in listed markets,
 the OTC illiquidity premium is several times higher, the size, value, and
 volatility premiums are similar, and the momentum premium is three times
 lower. The OTC illiquidity, size, value, and volatility premiums are
 largest among stocks held predominantly by retail investors and those not
 disclosing financial information. Theories of differences in investors'
 opinions and limits on short sales help explain these return premiums.  The Authors 2013. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: Fund Families as Delegated Monitors of Money Managers 
Abstract:
  Because a money manager learns more about her skill from her management
 experience than outsiders can learn from her realized returns, she expects
 inefficiency in future contracts that condition exclusively on realized
 returns. A fund family that learns what the manager learns can reduce this
 inefficiency cost if the family is large enough. The family's incentive is
 to retain any given manager regardless of her skill but, when the family
 has enough managers, it adds value by boosting the credibility of its
 retentions through the firing of others. As the number of managers grows,
 the efficiency loss goes to zero.   Copyright 2005, Oxford University Press.

  While IPOs have been underpriced by more than 10% during the past two
 decades, we find that in a sample of more than 2,000 IPOs from 1980 to
 1997, the median IPO was significantly overvalued at the offer price
 relative to valuations based on industry peer price multiples. This
 overvaluation ranges from 14% to 50% depending on the peer matching
 criteria. Cross-sectional regressions show that "overvalued" IPOs provide
 high first-day returns, but low long-run risk-adjusted returns. These
 overvalued IPOs have lower profitability, higher accruals, and higher
 analyst growth forecasts than "undervalued" IPOs. Ex post, the projected
 high growth of overvalued IPOs fails to materialize, while their
 profitability declines from pre-IPO levels. These results suggest IPO
 investors are deceived by optimistic growth forecasts and pay insufficient
 attention to profitability in valuing IPOs.   Copyright 2004, Oxford University Press.

Title: Does Risk Seeking Drive Stock Prices? A Stochastic Dominance Analysis of Aggregate Investor Preferences and Beliefs 
Abstract:
  We use various stochastic dominance criteria that account for (local)
 risk seeking to analyze market portfolio efficiency relative to benchmark
 portfolios formed on market capitalization, book-to-market equity ratio
 and price momentum. Our results suggest that reverse S-shaped utility
 functions with risk aversion for losses and risk seeking for gains can
 explain stock returns. The results are also consistent with a reverse
 S-shaped pattern of subjective probability transformation. The low average
 yield on big caps, growth stocks, and past losers may reflect investors'
 twin desire for downside protection in bear markets and upside potential
 in bull markets.   Copyright 2005, Oxford University Press.

Title: IPOs with Buy- and Sell-Side Information Production: The Dark Side of Open Sales 
Abstract:
  The proposed model, by incorporating both (1) banker screening of new
 issues and (2) costly evaluation by investors, is the first to admit
 endogenous double-sided information production. It demonstrates a
 nontrivial link between these two sides: the banker wishes to structure a
 sale conducive to investor research because selling to an uninformed pool
 would result in his own shirking. One application of this paradigm
 indicates that, contrary to the findings of most IPO models, larger
 investor pools are not always better. This result resolves the
 "participation restriction puzzle" of why bankers do not open sales to all
 bidders even when doing so would maximize competition and reduce
 underpricing.   Copyright 2005, Oxford University Press.

Title: Promotion Tournaments and Capital Rationing 
Abstract:
 We analyze capital allocation in a conglomerate where divisional managers
 with uncertain abilities compete for promotion to CEO. A manager can
 sometimes gain by unobservably adding variance to divisional performance.
 Capital rationing can limit this distortion, increase productive
 efficiency, and allow the owner to make more accurate promotion decisions.
 Firms for which CEO talent is more important for firm performance are more
 likely to ration capital. A rationed manager is more likely to be promoted
 even though all managers are identical ex ante. When the tournament payoff
 is relatively small, offering an incentive wage can be more efficient than
 rationing capital; however, when tournament incentives are paramount,
 rationing is more efficient.  The Author 2008. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org, Oxford University Press.

Title: Mergers, Spinoffs, and Employee Incentives 
Abstract:
 This article studies mergers between competing firms and shows that while
 such mergers reduce the level of product market competition, they may have
 an adverse effect on employee incentives to innovate. In industries where
 value creation depends on innovation and development of new products,
 mergers are likely to be inefficient even though they increase the market
 power of the post-merger firm. In such industries, a stand-alone structure
 where independent firms compete both in the product market and in the
 market for employee human capital leads to a greater profitability.
 Furthermore, our analysis shows that multidivisional firms can improve
 employee incentives and increase firm value by reducing firm size through
 a spinoff transaction, although doing so eliminates the economies of scale
 advantage of being a larger firm and the benefits of operating an internal
 capital market within the firm. Finally, our article suggests that
 established firms can benefit from creating their own competition in the
 product and labor markets by accommodating new firm entry, and the desire
 to do so is greater at the intermediate stages of industry/product
 development.  The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: How Often to Sample a Continuous-Time Process in the Presence of Market Microstructure Noise 
Abstract:
  In theory, the sum of squares of log returns sampled at high frequency
 estimates their variance. When market microstructure noise is present but
 unaccounted for, however, we show that the optimal sampling frequency is
 finite and derives its closed-form expression. But even with optimal
 sampling, using say 5-min returns when transactions are recorded every
 second, a vast amount of data is discarded, in contradiction to basic
 statistical principles. We demonstrate that modeling the noise and using
 all the data is a better solution, even if one misspecifies the noise
 distribution. So the answer is: sample as often as possible.   Copyright 2005, Oxford University Press.

Title: Financial Development and Financing Constraints: International Evidence from the Structural Investment Model 
Abstract:
  This article provides evidence that financial development impacts growth
 by reducing financing constraints that would otherwise distort efficient
 allocation of investment. The financing constraints are inferred from the
 investment Euler equation by assuming that the firm's stochastic discount
 factor is a function of the firm's financial position (specifically, the
 stock of liquid assets). The magnitude of the changes in the cost of
 capital is twice as large in a country with a low level of financial
 development as in a country with an average level of financial
 development. The size effect, business cycles, and legal environment
 effects are also considered.   Copyright 2003, Oxford University Press.

Title: Motivating Entrepreneurial Activity in a Firm 
Abstract:
 We examine the problem of motivating privately informed managers to engage
 in entrepreneurial activity to improve the quality of the firm's
 investment opportunities. The firm's investment and compensation policy
 must balance the manager's incentives to provide entrepreneurial effort
 and to report private information truthfully. The optimal policy is to
 underinvest (compared to first-best) and provide weak incentive pay in
 low-quality projects and overinvest (compared to first-best) and provide
 strong incentive pay in high-quality projects.  The Author 2008. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org, Oxford University Press.

Title: The State of Corporate Governance Research 
Abstract:
 This article, which introduces the special issue on corporate governance
 cosponsored by the Review of Financial Studies and the National Bureau of
 Economic Research (NBER), reviews and comments on the state of corporate
 governance research. The special issue features seven articles on
 corporate governance that were presented in a meeting of the NBER's
 corporate governance project. Each of the articles represents
 state-of-the-art research in an important area of corporate governance
 research. For each of these areas, we discuss the importance of the area
 and the questions it focuses on, how the article in the special issue
 makes a significant contribution to this area, and what we do and do not
 know about the area. We discuss in turn work on shareholders and
 shareholder activism, directors, executives and their compensation,
 controlling shareholders, comparative corporate governance, cross-border
 investments in global capital markets, and the political economy of
 corporate governance.  The Author 2010. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title: The Supply of Corporate Directors and Board Independence 
Abstract:
 Empirical evidence on the relations between board independence and board
 decisions and firm performance is generally confounded by serious
 endogeneity issues. We circumvent these endogeneity problems by
 demonstrating the strong impact of the local director labor market on
 board composition. Specifically, we show that proximity to larger pools of
 local director talent leads to more independent boards for all but the
 largest quartile of S&P 1500. Using local director pools as an instrument
 for board independence, we document that board independence has a positive
 effect on firm value, operating performance, fraction of CEO
 incentive-based pay, and CEO turnover.  The Author 2013. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: Long-Run Risk through Consumption Smoothing 
Abstract:
 We examine how long-run consumption risk arises endogenously in a standard
 production economy model where the representative agent has Epstein--Zin
 preferences. We show that even when technology growth is i.i.d., optimal
 consumption smoothing induces long-run risk--highly persistent variation
 in expected consumption growth. As a consequence, the model can account
 for a high price of risk, although both consumption growth volatility and
 the coefficient of relative risk aversion are low. The asset pricing
 implications of endogenous long-run risk depend crucially on the
 persistence of technology shocks and investors' preference for the timing
 of resolution of uncertainty. (JEL&nbsp;E21, E23, E30, G12)  The Author 2010. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title:   Government Intervention and Adverse Selection Costs in Foreign Exchange Markets.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 453-77
Issue: 2
Volume: 13
Year: 2000
Abstract:
  An important group of traders in the foreign exchange market is
 governments who often adhere to a foreign exchange rate policy of
 occasional interventions with otherwise floating rates. In this article we
 provide a theoretical model and empirical evidence that government foreign
 exchange interventions create significant adverse selection problems for
 dealers. In particular, our model shows that the adverse selection
 component of the foreign exchange spread is positively related to the
 variance of unexpected intervention and that expected intervention has no
 impact on the spread. After controlling for inventory and order processing
 costs, we find that bid-ask spreads increase with U.S. dollar and German
 deutsche mark foreign exchange rate intervention during the period
 1976-94. Furthermore, when the intervention is decomposed into expected
 and unexpected components, we find a statistically and economically
 significant increase in spreads with the variance of unexpected
 intervention, while expected intervention has no significant impact on
 spreads.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Interim News and the Role of Proxy Voting Advice 
Abstract:
 This article examines the information content and consequences of
 third-party voting advice that arrives as news at an interim stage in
 corporate proxy contests. We first document significant stock returns
 around announcements of proxy vote recommendations. We then develop a
 multi-equation empirical procedure for disentangling the price impact of
 prediction effects (changes in contest outcome probabilities) from the
 price impact of certification effects (changes in outcome-contingent
 valuations). Both effects are present in the data: Voting advice is both
 predictive about contest outcomes and informative about the ability of
 dissidents to add value. Consequently, proxy advice plays a dual
 informational role.  , Oxford University Press.

Title: Investor Overconfidence and Trading Volume 
Abstract:
  The proposition that investors are overconfident about their valuation
 and trading skills can explain high observed trading volume. With biased
 self-attribution, the level of investor overconfidence and thus trading
 volume varies with past returns. We test the trading volume predictions of
 formal overconfidence models and find that share turnover is positively
 related to lagged returns for many months. The relationship holds for both
 market-wide and individual security turnover, which we interpret as
 evidence of investor overconfidence and the disposition effect,
 respectively. Security volume is more responsive to market return shocks
 than to security return shocks, and both relationships are more pronounced
 in small-cap stocks and in earlier periods where individual investors hold
 a greater proportion of shares. (JEL G11, G12)   Copyright 2006, Oxford University Press.

Title: When Are Analyst Recommendation Changes Influential? 
Abstract:
 The existing literature measures the contribution of analyst
 recommendation changes using average stock-price reactions. With such an
 approach, recommendation changes can have a significant impact even if no
 recommendation has a visible stock-price impact. Instead, we call a
 recommendation change influential only if it affects the stock price of
 the affected firm visibly. We show that only 12% of recommendation changes
 are influential. Recommendation changes are more likely to be influential
 if they are from leader, star, previously influential analysts, issued
 away from consensus, accompanied by earnings forecasts, and issued on
 growth, small, high institutional ownership, or high forecast dispersion

Title: The Effects and Unintended Consequences of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act on the Supply and Demand for Directors 
Abstract:
 Using eight thousand public companies, we study the impact of the
 Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) of 2002 and other contemporary reforms on
 directors and boards, guided by their impact on the supply and demand for
 directors. SOX increased directors' workload and risk (reducing the
 supply), and increased demand by mandating that firms have more outside
 directors. We find both broad-based changes and cross-sectional changes
 (by firm size). Board committees meet more often post-SOX and Director and
 Officer (D&O) insurance premiums have doubled. Directors post-SOX are more
 likely to be lawyers-consultants, financial experts, and retired
 executives, and less likely to be current executives. Post-SOX boards are
 larger and more independent. Finally, we find significant increases in
 director pay and overall director costs, particularly among smaller firms.  The Author 2008. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title: Evaluating an Alternative Risk Preference in Affine Term Structure Models 
Abstract:
  Dai and Singleton (2002) and Duffee (2002) show that there is a tension
 in affine term structure models between matching the mean and the
 volatility of interest rates. This article examines whether this tension
 can be solved by an alternative parametrization of the price of risk. The
 empirical evidence suggests that, first, the examined parametrization is
 not sufficient to solve the mean-volatility tension. Second, the usual
 result in the estimation of affine models, indicating that some of the
 state variables are extremely persistent, may have been caused by the lack
 of flexibility in the parametrization of the price of risk.   Copyright 2004, Oxford University Press.

Title:   Costly State Verification and Multiple Investors: The Role of Seniority.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 91-123
Issue: 1
Volume: 8
Year: 1995
Abstract:
  Many financial claims specify fixed maximum payments, varying seniority,
 and absolute priority for more senior investors. These features are
 motivated in a model where a firm's manager contracts with several
 investors and firm output can only be verified privately at a cost.
 Debt-like contracts of varying seniority generally dominate symmetric
 contracts, and, when investors are risk neutral, it is optimal to use debt
 like contracts where more senior claims have absolute priority over more
 junior claims. In addition to motivating several features of debt and
 preferred stock, the model offers an explanation for structures used in
 leveraged buyouts, asset backed securitizations, and reinsurance
 contracts.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 723-56
Issue: 3
Volume: 9
Year: 1996
Abstract:
  We present two ways in which trading in a replicatable option can affect
 the price process of the underlying asset. in the first situation, trading
 an option that each investor views as pay-off redundant breaks a non-fully
 revealing equilibrium that exists when the option market is absent. The
 second situation involves a market that is dynamically complete without
 options, but in which introducing an option market allows self-confirming
 conjectures of additional uncertainty about the future price of the
 underlying asset. Heterogeneous beliefs play important though different
 roles in both situations.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Pages: 527-66
Issue: 3
Volume: 6
Year: 1993
Abstract:
  We investigate predictability in national equity market returns and its
 relation to global economic risks. We show how to consistently estimate
 the fraction of the predictable variation that is captured by an asset
 pricing model for the expected returns. We use a model in which
 conditional betas of the national equity markets depend on local
 information variables, while global risk premia depend on global
 variables. We examine single- and multiple-beta models, using monthly data
 for 1970 to 1989. The models capture much of the predictability for many
 countries. Most of this is related to time variation in the global risk
 premia.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title:   Where Do Betas Come From? Asset Price Dynamics and the
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 567-92
Issue: 3
Volume: 6
Year: 1993
Abstract:
  In this article we break assets' betas with common factors into
 components attributable to news about future cash flows, real interest
 rates, and excess returns. To achieve this decomposition, we use a vector
 autoregressive time-series model and an approximate log-linear present
 value relation. The betas of industry and size portfolios with the market
 are largely attributed to changing expected returns. Betas with inflation
 and industrial production reflect opposing cash flow and expected return
 effects. We also show how asset pricing theory restricts the expected
 excess return components of betas.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Regulating Access to International Large-Value Payment Systems 
Abstract:
  This article studies access regulation to international large-value
 payment systems when banking supervision is national. We focus on the
 choice between net and real-time gross settlement. As a novel feature, the
 communication between the public authorities is endogenized. It is shown
 that the national authorities' incentives are not perfectly aligned
 concerning the settlement method. Therefore public regulation fails to
 implement the first-best access criteria. Banks prefer net settlement too
 often due to limited liability. Still, if banks have superior information
 about their counterparties, private involvement in access regulation is
 desirable as it reveals information to the public authorities.   Copyright 2002, Oxford University Press.

Title: What's In It for Me? CEOs Whose Firms Are Acquired 
Abstract:
  We study benefits received by target chief executive officers (CEOs) in
 completed mergers and acquisitions. Certain target CEOs negotiate large
 cash payments in the form of special bonuses or increased golden
 parachutes. These negotiated cash payments are positively associated with
 the CEO's prior excess compensation and negatively associated with the
 likelihood that the CEO becomes an executive of the acquiring company.
 Regression estimates suggest that target shareholders receive lower
 acquisition premia in transactions involving extraordinary personal
 treatment of the CEO. Target CEOs experience very high turnover rates both
 at the time of acquisition and, for those who remain employed, for several
 years thereafter.   Copyright 2004, Oxford University Press.

Title:   Risk Aversion, Liquidity, and Endogenous Short Horizons.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 691-722
Issue: 2
Volume: 9
Year: 1996
Abstract:
  We analyze a competitive model in which different information signals get
 reflected in value at different points in time. If investors are
 sufficiently risk averse, we obtain an equilibrium in which all investors
 focus exclusively on the short term. In addition, we show that increasing
 the variance of informationless trading increases market depth but causes
 a greater proportion of investors to focus on the short-term signal, which
 decreases the informativeness of prices about the long run. Finally, we
 also explore parameter spaces under which long-term informed agents wish
 to voluntarily disclose their information.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Understanding the Puzzling Risk-Return Relationship for Housing 
Abstract:
 Standard theory predicts a positive relationship between risk and return,
 yet recent data show that housing returns vary positively with risk in
 some markets but negatively in others. This paper rationalizes these
 cross-market differences in the risk-return relationship for housing, and
 in so doing, explains the puzzling negative relationship. The paper shows
 that when the current house provides a hedge against the risk associated
 with the future housing consumption, households are willing to accept a
 lower return to compensate for risk, thus weakening the positive
 risk-return relationship. Further, in markets with less elastic housing
 supply and a growing population, hedging incentives can be sufficiently
 strong to make the relationship negative. The empirical analysis confirms
 these predictions, suggesting that hedging incentives, housing supply, and
 urban growth are indeed central to understanding the risk-return
 relationship for housing.  The Author 2013. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: Nondiversification Traps in Catastrophe Insurance Markets 
Abstract:
 We develop a model for markets for catastrophic risk. The model explains
 why insurance providers may choose not to offer insurance for catastrophic
 risks and not to participate in reinsurance markets, even though there is
 a large enough market capacity to reach full risk sharing through
 diversification in a reinsurance market. This is a "nondiversification
 trap." We show that nondiversification traps may arise when risk
 distributions have heavy left tails and insurance providers have limited
 liability. When they are present, there may be a coordination role for a
 centralized agency to ensure that risk sharing takes place.  The Author 2008. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org, Oxford University Press.

Title: Realization Utility with Reference-Dependent Preferences 
Abstract:
 We develop a tractable model of realization utility that studies the role
 of reference-dependent S-shaped preferences in a dynamic investment
 setting with reinvestment. Our model generates both voluntarily realized
 gains and losses. It makes specific predictions about the volume of gains
 and losses, the holding periods, and the sizes of both realized and paper
 gains and losses that can be calibrated to a variety of statistics,
 including Odean's measure of the disposition effect. Our model also
 predicts several anomalies, including, among others, the flattening of the
 capital market line and a negative price for idiosyncratic risk.  The Author 2012. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: Learning from Prices and the Dispersion in Beliefs 
Abstract:
 The article develops a dynamic model that nests the rational expectations
 (RE) and differences of opinion (DO) approaches to study how investors use
 prices to update their valuations. When investors condition on prices
 (RE), investor disagreement is related positively to expected returns,
 return volatility, and market beta, but negatively to return
 autocorrelation. When investors do not use prices (DO), these relations
 are reversed. Tests of these predictions on the cross-section of stocks
 using analyst forecast dispersion and volume as proxies for disagreement
 provide empirical evidence that is consistent with investors using prices
 on average.  The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title:   The Design of Internal Control and Capital Structure.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 209-40
Issue: 1
Volume: 9
Year: 1996
Abstract:
  We study the design of internal control and capital structure. We pose
 the question, When is control allocated only to shareholders and when is
 it allocated to other stakeholders, such as debtholders, or the management
 team? We show that shareholders (debtholders) get control when the firm's
 cash flow is relatively sensitive (insensitive) to managerial effort. Our
 theory implies that the signs of the correlations between endogenous
 variables when shareholders have absolute control are reversed when
 debtholders have veto power. In particular, debt level and firm value are
 negatively (positively) correlated when debtholders have veto power
 (shareholders have absolute control).	 Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title:   Bank Equity Stakes in Borrowing Firms and Financial Distress.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 889-919
Issue: 3
Volume: 9
Year: 1996
Abstract:
  We derive the optimal financial claim for a bank when the borrowing
 firm's uninformed stake-holders depend on the bank to establish whether
 the firm is distressed and whether concessions by stakeholders are
 necessary. The bank's financial claim is designed to ensure that it cannot
 confide with a healthy firm's owners to seek unnecessary concessions or to
 collude with a distressed firm's owners to claim that the firm is healthy.
 To prove that a request for concessions has not come from a healthy
 firm/bank coalition, the bank must hold either a very small or a very
 large equity stake when the firm enters distress. To prove that a
 distressed firm and the bank have not colluded to claim that the firm is
 healthy, the bank may need to hold equity under routine financial
 conditions.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Why Do Firms Announce Open-Market Repurchase Programs? 
Abstract:
  Empirically, a price increase accompanies the announcement of an
 open-market stock repurchase program, even though the announcement is not
 a commitment. In fact, for many announced programs no shares are ever
 actually repurchased. This article explores this puzzle. In the
 single-firm-type version of the model, the option that a firm grants
 itself by announcing a program does not generate announcement returns. In
 equilibrium, long-run gains from the informed trading that the option
 creates are offset by short-run costs from the market's accounting for
 this adverse selection. Based on this trade-off, I construct a signaling
 (two-type) model that can deliver announcement returns. In the separating
 equilibrium, good firms do not incur any cost when they announce programs.
 Their gains from informed trading in the long run offset the cost of
 announcement incurred in the short run. Mimicry is costly, because a bad
 firm's long-run gains from informed trading cannot compensate for the
 short-run cost of announcing.   Copyright 2005, Oxford University Press.

Title: Treating Measurement Error in Tobin's q 
Abstract:
 We compare the ability of three measurement error remedies to deliver
 unbiased estimates of coefficients in investment regressions. We examine
 high-order moment estimators, dynamic panel estimators, and simple
 instrumental variables estimators that use lagged mismeasured regressors
 as instruments. We show that recent investigations of this question are
 largely uninformative. We find that all estimators can perform well under
 correct specification, all can be biased under misspecification, and
 misspecification is easiest to detect in the case of high-order moment
 estimators. We develop and demonstrate a minimum distance technique that
 extends the high-order moment estimators to be used on unbalanced panel
 data.  Published by Oxford University Press 2011., Oxford University Press.

Title: Measuring Abnormal Bond Performance 
Abstract:
 We analyze the empirical power and specification of test statistics
 designed to detect abnormal bond returns in corporate event studies, using
 monthly and daily data. We find that test statistics based on frequently
 used methods of calculating abnormal monthly bond returns are biased. Most
 methods implemented in monthly data also lack power to detect abnormal
 returns. We also consider unique issues arising when using the newly
 available daily bond data, and formulate and test methods to calculate
 daily abnormal bond returns. Using daily bond data significantly increases
 the power of the tests, relative to the monthly data. Weighting individual
 trades by size while eliminating noninstitutional trades from the TRACE
 data also increases the power of the tests to detect abnormal performance,
 relative to using all trades or the last price of the day. Further,
 value-weighted portfolio-matching approaches are better specified and more
 powerful than equal-weighted approaches. Finally, we examine abnormal bond
 returns to acquirers around mergers and acquisitions to demonstrate how
 the abnormal return model and use of daily versus monthly data can affect
 inferences.  The Author 2008. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title: The Attractions and Perils of Flexible Mortgage Lending 
Abstract:
 A mortgage program that offered borrowers greater flexibility in the
 timing of repayments increased a bank's volume by over 35%. Loans in the
 program exhibited superior performance. Despite this, a regression
 discontinuity analysis shows that the causal impact of offering
 flexibility was to attract borrowers to the bank who experienced quadruple
 the average delinquency rate. These contrasting findings are driven by the
 fact that the bank engaged in ex post sorting of stronger borrowers into
 the flexible program. This sorting masked the ex ante adverse selection
 effects that offering flexibility had on the entire borrowing pool.  The Author 2013. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: On Correlation and Default Clustering in Credit Markets 
Abstract:
 We establish Markovian models in the&nbsp;Heath, Jarrow, and
 Morton&nbsp;(1992) paradigm that permit an exponential affine
 representation of riskless and risky bond prices while offering
 significant flexibility in the choice of volatility structures. Estimating
 models in our family is typically no more difficult than in the workhorse
 affine family. Besides diffusive and jump-induced default correlations,
 defaults can impact the credit spreads of surviving firms, allowing for a
 greater clustering of defaults. Numerical implementations highlight the
 importance of incorporating interest rate--credit spread correlations,
 credit spread impact factors, and the full credit spread curve when
 building a unified framework for pricing credit derivatives.  The Author 2010. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

 We develop a tractable and flexible stochastic volatility multifactor
 model of the term structure of interest rates. It features unspanned
 stochastic volatility factors, correlation between innovations to forward
 rates and their volatilities, quasi-analytical prices of zero-coupon bond
 options, and dynamics of the forward rate curve, under both the actual and
 risk-neutral measures, in terms of a finite-dimensional affine state
 vector. The model has a very good fit to an extensive panel dataset of
 interest rates, swaptions, and caps. In particular, the model matches the
 implied cap skews and the dynamics of implied volatilities.  The Author 2008. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org, Oxford University Press.

Title: The Behavior of Interest Rates 
Abstract:
  The evidence in Fama and Bliss (1987) that forward interest rates
 forecast future spot interest rates for horizons beyond a year repeats in
 the out-of-sample 1986--2004 period. But the inference that this forecast
 power is due to mean reversion of the spot rate toward a constant expected
 value no longer seems valid. Instead, the predictability of the spot rate
 captured by forward rates seems to be due to mean reversion toward a
 time-varying expected value that is subject to a sequence of apparently
 permanent shocks that are on balance positive to mid-1981 and on balance
 negative thereafter.   Copyright 2006, Oxford University Press.

Abstract:
  This study uses laboratory experiments to determine the effects of trade
 and quote disclosure on market efficiency, bid-ask spreads, and trader
 welfare. We show that trade disclosure increases the informational
 efficiency of transaction prices, but also increases opening bid-ask
 spreads, apparently by reducing market-makers' incentives to compete for
 order flow. As a result, trade disclosure benefits market makers at the
 expense of liquidity traders and informed traders. We find that quote
 disclosure has no discernible effects on market performance. Overall our
 results demonstrate that the degree of market transparency has important
 effects of market equilibria and on trader and market-maker welfare.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Takeover Contests with Asymmetric Bidders 
Abstract:
  Target firms often face bidders that are not equally well informed, which
 reduces competition, because bidders with less information fear the
 winner's curse more. We analyze how targets should be sold in this
 situation. We show that a sequential procedure can extract the highest
 possible transaction price. The target first offers an exclusive deal to a
 better-informed bidder, without considering a less well-informed bidder.
 If rejected, the target offers either an exclusive deal to the less
 well-informed bidder, or a modified first-price auction. Deal protection
 devices can be used to enhance a target's commitment to the procedure.

Title: Bond Market Clienteles, the Yield Curve, and the Optimal Maturity Structure of Government Debt 
Abstract:
 We propose a clientele-based model of the yield curve and optimal maturity
 structure of government debt. Clienteles are generations of agents at
 different lifecycle stages in an overlapping-generations economy. An
 optimal maturity structure exists in the absence of distortionary taxes
 and induces efficient intergenerational risksharing. If agents are more

 optimal maturity structure, catering to clienteles is limited and
 long-term bonds earn negative expected excess returns.  The Author 2013. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: The Value of Bank Capital and the Structure of the Banking Industry 
Abstract:
 The critical role played by financial institutions in the recent financial
 crises has generated renewed interest on the corporate finance of the
 banking firm and the impact of the banking sector on the real economy.
 This paper introduces the special issue of the Review of Financial Studies
 dedicated to "The Value of Bank Capital and the Structure of the Banking
 Industry." The special issue combines papers presented at the conference
 on "Corporate Finance of Financial Intermediaries" in September 2006,
 which was jointly organized by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the
 Wharton Financial Institutions Center of the University of Pennsylvania,
 and the Review of Financial Studies, with other related papers.  The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: The Impact of Legal and Political Institutions on Equity Trading Costs: A Cross-Country Analysis 
Abstract:
  We conjecture that macro-level institutions affect equity trading costs
 through their impact on information risk and investor participation. In a
 study of trading costs for 412 NYSE-listed American Depository Receipts
 (ADRs) from 44 countries, we find that, after controlling for firm-level
 determinants of trading costs, effective spreads and price impact of
 trades are significantly lower for stocks from countries with better
 ratings for judicial efficiency, accounting standards, and political
 stability. Trading costs are significantly higher for stocks from French
 civil law countries than from common law countries. Overall, we conclude
 that improvements in legal and political institutions will lower the cost
 of liquidity in financial markets.   Copyright 2006, Oxford University Press.

Title: Information in Equity Markets with Ambiguity-Averse Investors 
Abstract:
 This paper shows that persistent mispricing is consistent with a market
 that includes ambiguity-averse investors. In particular, ambiguity-averse
 investors may prefer to trade based on aggregate signals that reduce
 ambiguity at the cost of a loss in information. Equilibrium prices may
 therefore fail to impound publicly available information. While this
 creates profit opportunities for ambiguity-neutral investors,
 ambiguity-averse investors perceive that the benefit of ambiguity
 reduction outweighs the cost of trading against investors who have
 superior information. The model can explain both underreaction, such as
 that evident in postearnings announcement drifts and momentum, and
 overreaction to accounting accruals.  The Author 2008. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org, Oxford University Press.

Title: Global Integration in Primary Equity Markets: The Role of U.S. Banks and U.S. Investors 
Abstract:
  We examine the costs and benefits of the global integration of initial
 public offering (IPO) markets associated with the diffusion of U.S.
 underwriting methods in the 1990s. Bookbuilding is becoming increasingly
 popular outside the United States and typically costs twice as much as a
 fixed-price offer. However, on its own, bookbuilding only leads to lower
 underpricing when conducted by U.S. banks and-or targeted at U.S.
 investors. For most issuers, the gains associated with lower underpricing
 outweighed the additional costs associated with hiring U.S. banks or
 marketing in the United States. This suggests a quality-price trade-off
 contrasting with the findings of Chen and Ritter, particularly since
 non-U.S. issuers raising US$20 million--US$80 million also typically pay a
 7% spread when U.S. banks and investors are involved.   Copyright 2003, Oxford University Press.

Title: Do Private Equity Fund Managers Earn Their Fees? Compensation, Ownership, and Cash Flow Performance 
Abstract:
 We study the relations between management contract terms and performance
 in private equity using new data for 837 funds from 1984--2010. We find no
 evidence that higher fees or lower managerial ownership are associated
 with lower net-of-fee performance. Nevertheless, compensation rises and
 shifts to performance-insensitive components during fundraising booms.
 Further, the behavior of distributions around contractual fee triggers is
 consistent with an underlying agency conflict between investors and fund
 managers. Our evidence suggests that managers with higher fees deliver
 higher gross performance, and highlights that agency costs are an
 inevitable consequence of the information frictions endemic to agency
 relationships.  The Author 2013. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: Bank Liquidity Creation 
Abstract:
 Although the modern theory of financial intermediation portrays liquidity
 creation as an essential role of banks, comprehensive measures of bank
 liquidity creation do not exist. We construct four measures and apply them
 to data on virtually all U.S. banks from 1993 to 2003. We find that bank
 liquidity creation increased every year and exceeded $2.8 trillion in
 2003. Large banks, multibank holding company members, retail banks, and
 recently merged banks created the most liquidity. Bank liquidity creation
 is positively correlated with bank value. Testing recent theories of the
 relationship between capital and liquidity creation, we find that the
 relationship is positive for large banks and negative for small banks.  The Author 2009. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title: Incentives to Innovate and the Decision to Go Public or Private 
Abstract:
 We model the impact of public and private ownership structures on firms'
 incentives to invest in innovative projects. We show that it is optimal to
 go public when exploiting existing ideas and optimal to go private when
 exploring new ideas. This result derives from the fact that private firms
 are less transparent to outside investors than are public firms. In
 private firms, insiders can time the market by choosing an early exit
 strategy if they receive bad news. This option makes insiders more
 tolerant of failures and thus more inclined to invest in innovative
 projects. In contrast, the prices of publicly traded securities react
 quickly to good news, providing insiders with incentives to choose
 conventional projects and cash in early.  The Author 2012. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title:   An Intertemporal Model of Asset Prices in a Markov Economy with a Limiting Stationary Distribution.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 85-104
Issue: 1
Volume: 5
Year: 1992
Abstract:
  A testable single-beta model of asset prices is presented. If state
 variables have a long-run stationary joint density function, then the rate
 return on a very long-term default-free discount bond will be perfectly
 correlated with the representative investor's marginal utility of
 consumption. Thus, the covariance of an asset's return with the return on
 such a bond will be an appropriate measure of the asset's riskiness. The
 model can be, therefore, applied.or tested even though the market
 portfolio or aggregate consumption may not be observable. It also is shown
 that the expected rate of return on a very long-term bond is equal to its
 variance. This proposition can be tested to determine whether state
 variables follow stationary processes.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: A Theory of Corporate Capital Structure and Investment 
Abstract:
  This article uses a general equilibrium framework to explore the origins
 and limitations of financial intermediaries. In the model, investors have
 a generic lending technology that they can improve at a cost. Those who
 upgrade become intermediaries to exploit their advantage. However,
 conflicts with depositors will limit the banks' market presence, and they
 will only lend to moderately endowed firms while bondholders will finance
 cash-rich corporations. The article also analyzes the extent to which
 investors adopt the superior lending technique, the nature of bank
 competition, and how corporate and bank conditions affect interest rates
 and investment.   Copyright 2004, Oxford University Press.

Title: Investor Activism and Financial Market Structure 
Abstract:
  This article investigates investor activism when there are a number of
 strategic investors that are capable of intervening in corporate
 governance. These strategic investors can monitor and-or trade in
 anonymous financial markets. In equilibrium, a core group of monitoring
 investors emerges endogenously to curtail managerial opportunism. These
 core activists both intervene and trade aggressively. Although the
 smallest investors are passive, there is no monotonic relationship between
 the size of preexisting shareholdings and activism. In fact, among those
 investors who choose activism, those with the smallest holdings are the
 most aggressive.   Copyright 2002, Oxford University Press.

Title:   Market Microstructure and Stock Return Predictions.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies

Volume: 7
Year: 1994
Abstract:
  To what extent are the empirical regularities implied by market
 microstructure theories useful in predicting the short-run behavior of
 stock returns A two-equation econometric model of quote revisions and
 transaction returns is developed and used to identify the relative
 importance of different microstructure theories and to make predictions.
 Microstructure variables and lagged stock index futures returns have
 in-sample and out-of-sample predictive power based on data observed at
 five-minute intervals. The most striking microstructure implication of the
 model, confirmed by the empirical results, specifies that the expected
 quote return is positively related to the deviation between the
 transaction price and the quote midpoint while the expected transaction
 return is negatively related to the same variable.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: A Flow-Based Explanation for Return Predictability 
Abstract:
 I propose and test a capital-flow-based explanation for some well-known
 empirical regularities concerning return predictability--the persistence
 of mutual fund performance, the "smart money" effect, and stock price
 momentum. First, I construct a measure of demand shocks to individual
 stocks by aggregating flow-induced trading across all mutual funds, and
 document a significant, temporary price impact of such uninformed trading.
 Next, given that mutual fund flows are highly predictable, I show that the
 expected part of flow-induced trading positively forecasts stock and
 mutual fund returns in the following year, which are then reversed in
 subsequent years. The main findings of the paper are that the flow-driven
 return effect can fully account for mutual fund performance persistence
 and the smart money effect, and can partially explain stock price
 momentum.  The Author 2012. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Volume: 10
Year: 1997
Abstract:
  This article develops theoretical insight into the threshold effect in
 expected volatility, which means that large shocks are less persistent in
 volatility than small shocks. The model uses the Kyle-Admati-Pfleiderer
 setup with liquidity traders, informed traders, and a market maker.
 Information is modeled as a GARCH process. It is shown that the GARCH
 process for information is transformed into a TARCH process (for
 "threshold GARCH") for the market price changes. Working with information
 flows allows one to derive implications for trading volume and market
 liquidity which provide the basis for a more complete test of the model.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Differences in Governance Practices between U.S. and Foreign Firms: Measurement, Causes, and Consequences 
Abstract:
 We construct a firm-level governance index that increases with minority
 shareholder protection. Compared with U.S. matching firms, only 12.68% of
 foreign firms have a higher index. The value of foreign firms falls as
 their index decreases relative to the index of matching U.S. firms. Our
 results suggest that lower country-level investor protection and other
 country characteristics make it suboptimal for foreign firms to invest as
 much in governance as U.S. firms do. Overall, we find that minority
 shareholders benefit from governance improvements and do so partly at the
 expense of controlling shareholders.  The Author 2008. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Abstract:
  This article develops a model for evaluating alternative hedging

 is the ability to capture the intertemporal effects of hedging on the
 firm's financial situation. We characterize the optimal hedge. A wide
 range of alternative hedging strategies can be specified and the model
 allows us to determine in each case if the hedging strategy raises or
 lowers firms value and by how much. We show that hedging firm value,
 hedging cash flow from operations and hedging sales revenue are not
 optimal. The article highlights the fact that every hedging strategy comes
 packaged with a borrowing strategy which requires careful consideration.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Market Liquidity and Flow-driven Risk 
Abstract:
 Using a unique dataset of trades and limit orders for S&P 500 futures, we
 decompose the aggregate risk into a component driven by the impact of net
 market orders and a component unrelated to net orders. The first
 component--flow-driven risk--is large, accounting for approximately 50% of
 market variance, and it is not transient. This risk represents the joint
 effect of net trade demand and the price impact of that demand--i.e.,
 illiquidity. We find that flows are largely unpredictable, and lagged
 flows have no price impact. Flow-driven risk is time varying because price
 impact is highly variable. Illiquidity rises with market volatility, but
 not with flow uncertainty. Net selling increases illiquidity, which
 amplifies downside flow-driven risk. The findings are consistent with
 flow-driven shocks resulting from fluctuations in aggregate risk-bearing
 capacity. Under this interpretation, investors with constant risk
 tolerance should trade against such shocks (i.e., "supply liquidity") to
 achieve substantial utility gains. Quantitatively accounting for the scale
 of flow-driven risk poses a major challenge for asset pricing theory.  The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: Strong-Form Efficiency with Monopolistic Insiders 
Abstract:
 We study market efficiency in an infinite-horizon model with a
 monopolistic insider. The insider can trade with competitive market makers
 and noise traders, and observes privately the expected growth rate of
 asset dividends. In the absence of the insider, this information would be
 reflected in prices only after a long series of dividend observations.
 Thus, the insider's information is 'long-lived.' Surprisingly, however,
 the monopolistic insider chooses to reveal her information very quickly,
 within a time converging to zero as the market approaches continuous
 trading. Although the market converges to strong-form efficiency, the
 insider's profits do not converge to zero.  , Oxford University Press.

Journal: Review of Financial Studies

Issue: 1
Volume: 9
Year: 1996
Abstract:
  This article offers a tractable monetary asset pricing model. In monetary
 economies, the price level, inflation, asset prices, and the real and
 nominal interest rates have to be determined simultaneously and in
 relation to each other. This link allows us to relate in closed form each
 of the dependent entities to the underlying real and monetary variables.
 Among other features of such economies, inflation can be partially
 nonmonetary and the real and nominal term structures can depend on
 fundamentally different risk factors. In one extreme, the process followed
 by the real term structure is independent of that followed by its nominal
 counterpart.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

  A model of trading in speculative markets is developed based on

 the empirical regularities that have been documented concerning the
 relationship between volume and price and the time-series properties of
 price and volume. We assume that traders share common prior beliefs and
 receive common information but differ in the way in which they interpret
 this information. Some results are that absolute price changes and volume
 are positively correlated, consecutive price changes exhibit negative
 serial correlation, and volume is positively autocorrelated.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Trading and Pricing in Upstairs and Downstairs Stock Markets 
Abstract:
  We provide empirical evidence on the economic benefits of negotiating
 trades in the upstairs trading room of brokerage firms relative to the
 downstairs market. Using Helsinki Stock Exchange data, we find that
 upstairs trades tend to have lower information content and lower price
 impacts than downstairs trades. This is consistent with the hypotheses
 that the upstairs market is better at pricing uninformed liquidity trades
 and that upstairs brokers can give better prices to their customers if
 they know the unexpressed demands of other customers. We find that these
 economic benefits depend on price discovery occurring in the downstairs
 market.   Copyright 2002, Oxford University Press.

Title: Reviewing Less--Progressing More 
Abstract:
 Editorial: Presumably, academic journals exist and publish articles to
 disseminate new ideas. Somehow that simple goal has been lost. Today,
 articles appear in print only after a referee is convinced that all other
 alternative explanations for its results have been ruled out. In reality,
 no article can exclude every possible alternative, so this is basically an
 exercise in futility. The criterion for publication should be that once an
 article crosses some threshold it is good enough to publish. The problem
 seemingly lies in our inability to say "good enough." But this is a
 problem we can fix.  The Author 2012. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: An Empirical Analysis of Stock and Bond Market Liquidity 
Abstract:
  This article explores cross-market liquidity dynamics by estimating a
 vector autoregressive model for liquidity (bid-ask spread and depth,
 returns, volatility, and order flow in the stock and Treasury bond
 markets). Innovations to stock and bond market liquidity and volatility
 are significantly correlated, implying that common factors drive liquidity
 and volatility in these markets. Volatility shocks are informative in
 predicting shifts in liquidity. During crisis periods, monetary expansions
 are associated with increased liquidity. Moreover, money flows to
 government bond funds forecast bond market liquidity. The results
 establish a link between "macro" liquidity, or money flows, and "micro" or
 transactions liquidity.   Copyright 2005, Oxford University Press.

Title: Informed and Uninformed Investment in Housing: The Downside of Diversification 
Abstract:
 Mortgage lenders that concentrate in a few markets invest more in
 information collection than diversified lenders. Concentrated lenders
 focus on the information-intensive jumbo market and on high-risk
 borrowers. They are better positioned to price risks and, thus, ration
 credit less. Adverse selection, however, leads to higher retention of
 mortgages relative to diversified lenders. Finally, concentrated lenders
 have higher profits than diversified lenders, their profits vary less
 systematically, and their stock prices fell less during the 2007--2008
 credit crisis. The results imply that geographic diversification led to a
 decline in screening by lenders, which likely played a role in the
 2007--2008 crisis.  The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: Simulation-Based Estimation of Contingent-Claims Prices 
Abstract:
 A new methodology is proposed to estimate theoretical prices of financial
 contingent claims whose values are dependent on some other underlying
 financial assets. In the literature, the preferred choice of estimator is
 usually maximum likelihood (ML). ML has strong asymptotic justification
 but is not necessarily the best method in finite samples. This paper
 proposes a simulation-based method. When it is used in connection with ML,
 it can improve the finite-sample performance of the ML estimator while
 maintaining its good asymptotic properties. The method is implemented and
 evaluated here in the Black-Scholes option pricing model and in the
 Vasicek bond and bond option pricing model. It is especially favored when
 the bias in ML is large due to strong persistence in the data or strong
 nonlinearity in pricing functions. Monte Carlo studies show that the
 proposed procedures achieve bias reductions over ML estimation in pricing
 contingent claims when ML is biased. The bias reductions are sometimes
 accompanied by reductions in variance. Empirical applications to U.S.
 Treasury bills highlight the differences between the bond prices implied
 by the simulation-based approach and those delivered by ML. Some
 consequences for the statistical testing of contingent-claim pricing
 models are discussed.  The Author 2009. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title: Corporate Governance Objectives of Labor Union Shareholders: Evidence from Proxy Voting 
Abstract:
 Labor union pension funds have become increasingly vocal in governance
 matters; however, their motives are subject to fierce debate. I examine
 the proxy votes of AFL-CIO union funds around an exogenous change in the
 union representation of workers across firms. AFL-CIO-affiliated
 shareholders become significantly less opposed to directors once the
 AFL-CIO labor organization no longer represents a firm's workers. Other
 institutional investors, including mutual funds and public pension funds,
 do not exhibit similar voting behavior. Union opposition is also
 associated with negative valuation effects. The data suggest that some
 investors pursue worker interests, rather than maximize shareholder value
 alone.  The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: The Role of Institutional Investors in Initial Public Offerings 
Abstract:
 In this article, we use a large sample of transaction-level institutional
 trading data to analyze the role of institutional investors in initial
 public offerings (IPOs). The theoretical literature on IPOs has long
 argued that institutional investors possess private information about IPOs
 and that underpricing is a mechanism for compensating them to reveal this
 private information. We study whether institutions indeed have private
 information about IPOs, retain their information advantage in post-IPO
 trading, and are able to realize significant profits from their
 participation in IPOs. We also study institutional IPO allocations and
 allocation sales to analyze whether institutions play an important role in
 supporting IPOs in the aftermarket and are rewarded by underwriters for
 playing such a role. We find that institutions sell 70.2% of their IPO
 allocations in the first year, fully realize the "money left on the
 table," and do not dissipate these profits in post-IPO trading. Further,
 institutions hold allocations in IPOs with weaker post-issue demand for a
 longer period, and they are rewarded for this by underwriters with more
 IPO allocations. Finally, institutional trading has predictive power for
 long-run IPO performance, especially in IPOs in which they received
 allocations; however, this predictive power decays over time. Overall, our
 results suggest that institutional investors possess significant private
 information about IPOs, play an important supportive role in the IPO
 aftermarket, and receive considerable compensation for their participation
 in IPOs.  The Author 2010. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title: International Asset Allocation With Regime Shifts 
Abstract:
  Correlations between international equity market returns tend to increase
 in highly volatile bear markets, which has led some to doubt the benefits
 of international diversification. This article solves the dynamic
 portfolio choice problem of a U.S. investor faced with a time-varying
 investment opportunity set modeled using a regime-switching process which
 may be characterized by correlations and volatilities that increase in bad
 times. International diversification is still valuable with regime changes
 and currency hedging imparts further benefit. The costs of ignoring the
 regimes are small for all-equity portfolios but increase when a
 conditionally risk-free asset can be held.   Copyright 2002, Oxford University Press.

Title: Housing Wealth and Consumption Growth: Evidence from a Large Panel of Households 
Abstract:
 This article uses a large panel dataset that tracks the housing wealth and
 credit card spending of 12,793 individuals in Hong Kong to study the
 relationship between housing wealth and household consumption. I identify
 a significant effect of housing wealth on consumption. A pure wealth
 effect can explain part of the sensitivity: households with multiple
 houses have much stronger consumption responses. Consistent with a
 relaxation of the credit constraints, mortgage refinancing significantly
 increases households' consumption sensitivities. However, for the majority
 of the households that do not refinance, consumption sensitivity appears
 to be due to a reduction in precautionary saving.  The Author 2010. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title: Dynamic Volume-Return Relation of Individual Stocks 
Abstract:
  We examine the dynamic relation between return and volume of individual
 stocks. Using a simple model in which investors trade to share risk or
 speculate on private information, we show that returns generated by
 risk-sharing trades tend to reverse themselves, while returns generated by
 speculative trades tend to continue themselves. We test this theoretical
 prediction by analyzing the relation between daily volume and first-order
 return autocorrelation for individual stocks listed on the NYSE and AMEX.
 We find that the cross-sectional variation in the relation between volume
 and return autocorrelation is related to the extent of informed trading in
 a manner consistent with the theoretical prediction.   Copyright 2002, Oxford University Press.

Issue: 5
Volume: 12
Year: 1999
Abstract:
  This article presents a dynamic, rational expectations equilibrium model
 of asset prices where the drift of fundamentals (dividends) shifts between
 two unobservable states at random times. I show that in equilibrium,
 investors' willingness to hedge against changes in their own "uncertainty"
 on the true state makes stock prices overreact to bad news in good times
 and underreact to good news in bad times. I then show that this model is
 better able than conventional models with no regime shifts to explain
 features of stock returns, including volatility clustering, "leverage
 effects," excess volatility, and time-varying expected returns.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: How Do Diversity of Opinion and Information Asymmetry Affect Acquirer Returns? 
Abstract:
 We examine the theoretical predictions that link acquirer returns to
 diversity of opinion and information asymmetry. Theory suggests that
 acquirer abnormal returns should be negatively related to information
 asymmetry and diversity-of-opinion proxies for equity offers but not cash
 offers. We find that this is the case and that, more strikingly, there is
 no difference in abnormal returns between cash offers for public firms,
 equity offers for public firms, and equity offers for private firms after
 controlling for one of these proxies, idiosyncratic volatility.  , Oxford University Press.

Title: Underwriter Certification and Japanese Seasoned Equity Issues 
Abstract:
  In sharp contrast to results in the United States, the average stock
 price response to an announcement of a seasoned equity issue in Japan is
 positive. Offer prices in Japan, unlike the United States, are announced
 several days before the beginning of the subscription period and
 incorporate a substantial discount. We suggest that the positive
 announcement effects in Japan are consistent with the underwriter's
 certification of the issuing firm's value. We characterize the
 underwriter's risk as a put option and find a positive association between
 the underwriter's risk and the announcement returns, as well as other
 results consistent with underwriter certification.   Copyright 2003, Oxford University Press.

Title: Collateral Values by Asset Class: Evidence from Primary Securities Dealers 
Abstract:
 Using data on repurchase agreements by primary securities dealers, we show
 that three classes of securities (Treasury securities, securities issued
 by government-sponsored agencies, and mortgage-backed securities) can be
 formally ranked in terms of their collateral values in the general
 collateral (GC) market. We then show that GC repurchase agreement (repo)
 spreads across asset classes display jumps and significant temporal
 variation, especially at times of predictable liquidity needs, consistent
 with the "safe haven" properties of Treasury securities: These jumps are
 driven almost entirely by the behavior of the GC repo rates of Treasury
 securities. Estimating the "collateral rents" earned by owners of these
 securities, we find such rents to be sizable for Treasury securities and
 nearly zero for agency and mortgage-backed securities. Finally, we link
 collateral values to asset prices in a simple no-arbitrage framework and
 show that variations in collateral values explain a significant fraction
 of changes in short-term yield spreads but not those of longer-term
 spreads. Our results point to securities' role as collateral as a
 promising direction of research to improve understanding of the pricing of
 money market securities and their spreads.  The Author 2010. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title: Taxable and Tax-Deferred Investing: A Tax-Arbitrage Approach 
Abstract:
 We analyze an intertemporal portfolio problem with both taxable and
 tax-deferred retirement accounts. Using a tax-arbitrage argument, we
 identify conditions under which the optimal location decision (where to
 place an asset) is separable from the allocation decision (how much to
 allocate to each asset). Investors place highly taxed assets in the
 tax-deferred account to maximize the tax benefit and adjust their taxable
 portfolios to achieve the optimal risk exposure. We show that the
 two-account problem can be reduced to a taxable-account-only problem. The
 results are robust to capital gains tax deferrals, consumption and
 contribution decisions, and stochastic tax rates.  The Author 2008. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org, Oxford University Press.

Title: How Important is Having Skin in the Game? Originator-Sponsor Affiliation and Losses on Mortgage-backed Securities 
Abstract:
 This article examines the relationship between a mortgage originator's
 affiliation with the sponsor of a securitization or the servicer of the
 securitized loans and the default rate on the securitized mortgages. We
 find that default rates are significantly lower for securitizations in
 which the originator is affiliated with the sponsor or servicer.
 Consistent with investors expecting performance to vary with affiliation,
 we find that the initial yields on mortgage-backed securities (MBS) are
 lower and the percentage of AAA-rated securities issued against the
 securitized pool of loans is higher when the originator is affiliated with
 either the sponsor or servicer.    The Author 2012. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: Institutional Portfolio Flows and International Investments 
Abstract:
 Using a new technique, and weekly data for 25 countries from 1994 to 1998,
 we analyze the relationship between institutional cross-border portfolio
 flows, and domestic and foreign equity returns. In emerging markets,
 institutional flows forecast statistically indistinguishable movements in
 country closed-end fund NAV returns and price returns. In contrast,
 closed-end fund flows forecast price returns, but not NAV returns.
 Furthermore, institutional flows display trend-following (trend-reversing)
 behavior in response to symmetric (asymmetric) movements in NAV and price
 returns. The results suggest that institutional cross-border flows are
 linked to fundamentals, while closed-end fund flows are a source of price
 pressure in the short run.  The Author 2008. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

 We compare the stability and timeliness of credit ratings produced by a

 volatility but are slower to identify default risk. We control for Moody's
 aversion to ratings volatility and still find its ratings lag Rapid
 Ratings'. More importantly, accuracy ratios indicate that Rapid Ratings
 provides a better ordinal ranking of credit risk. We quantify the loss
 avoidance associated with Rapid Ratings'signals to estimate costs
 associated with regulatory and contractual systems based on issuer-paid

Title: On the Growth Effect of Stock Market Liberalizations 
Abstract:
 We investigate the effect of a stock market liberalization on industry
 growth in emerging markets. Consistent with the view that liberalization
 reduces financing constraints, we find that industries that are more
 externally dependent and face better growth opportunities grew faster
 following liberalization. However, this growth increase appears to come
 from an expansion in the size of existing firms rather than through the
 entry of financially constrained new firms. We show that following
 liberalization, new firm growth occurs in countries and industries with
 lower entry barriers. Hence, liberalization has a more uniform growth
 impact if accompanied by competition-enhancing reforms.  The Author 2009. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title: Risk and Return Characteristics of Venture Capital-Backed Entrepreneurial Companies 
Abstract:
 Valuations of entrepreneurial companies are only observed occasionally,
 albeit more frequently for well-performing companies. Consequently,
 estimators of risk and return must correct for sample selection to obtain
 consistent estimates. We develop a general model of dynamic sample
 selection and estimate it using data from venture capital investments in
 entrepreneurial companies. Our selection correction leads to markedly
 lower intercepts and higher estimates of risks compared to previous
 studies. The methodology is generally applicable to estimating risk and
 return in illiquid markets with endogenous trading.  The Author 2010. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title: Cash Holdings and Credit Risk 
Abstract:
 Intuition suggests that firms with higher cash holdings should be "safer"
 and have lower credit spreads. Yet empirically, the correlation between
 cash and spreads is robustly positive. This puzzling finding can be
 explained by the precautionary motive for saving cash, which in our model
 causes riskier firms to accumulate higher cash reserves. In contrast,
 spreads are negatively related to the part of cash holdings that is not
 determined by credit risk factors. Similarly, although firms with higher
 cash reserves are less likely to default in the short term, endogenously
 determined liquidity may be related positively to the longer-term
 probability of default. Our empirical analysis confirms these predictions,
 suggesting that precautionary savings are central to understanding the
 effects of cash on credit risk.  The Author 2012. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: Liquidity and Asset Returns Under Asymmetric Information and Imperfect Competition 
Abstract:
 We analyze how asymmetric information and imperfect competition affect
 liquidity and asset prices. Our model has three periods: Agents are
 identical in the first, become heterogeneous and trade in the second, and
 consume asset payoffs in the third. We show that asymmetric information in
 the second period raises ex ante expected asset returns in the first,
 comparing both to the case where all private signals are made public and
 to that where private signals are not observed. Imperfect competition can
 instead lower expected returns. Each imperfection can move common measures
 of illiquidity in opposite directions.  The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: Generalized Disappointment Aversion, Long-run Volatility Risk, and Asset Prices 
Abstract:
 We propose an asset pricing model with generalized disappointment aversion
 preferences and long-run volatility risk. With Markov switching
 fundamentals, we derive closed-form solutions for all returns moments and
 predictability regressions. The model produces first and second moments of
 price-dividend ratios and asset returns as well as return predictability
 patterns in line with the data. Compared to Bansal and Yaron (2004), we
 generate (i) more predictability of excess returns by price-dividend
 ratios; (ii) less predictability of consumption growth rates by
 price-dividend ratios. Our results do not depend on a value of the
 elasticity of intertemporal substitution greater than one.  The Author 2010. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title: Advertising, Breadth of Ownership, and Liquidity 
Abstract:
  We provide empirical evidence that a firm's overall visibility with
 investors, as measured by its product market advertising, has important
 consequences for the stock market. Specifically we show that firms with
 greater advertising expenditures, ceteris paribus, have a larger number of
 both individual and institutional investors, and better liquidity of their
 common stock. Our findings are robust to a variety of methodological
 approaches and to various measures of liquidity. These results suggest
 that the investors' degree of familiarity with a firm may affect its cost
 of capital and consequently its value.   Copyright 2004, Oxford University Press.

Title: An Equilibrium Model of Asset Pricing and Moral Hazard 
Abstract:
  This article develops an integrated model of asset pricing and moral
 hazard. It is demonstrated that the expected dollar return of a stock is
 independent of managerial incentives and idiosyncratic risk, but the
 equilibrium price of the stock depends on them. Thus, the expected rate of
 return is affected by managerial incentives and idiosyncratic risk. It is
 shown, however, that managerial incentives and idiosyncratic risk affect
 the expected rate of return through their influence on systematic risk
 rather than serve as independent risk factors. It is also shown that the
 risk aversion of the principal in the model leads to less emphasis on
 relative performance evaluation than in a model with a risk-neutral
 principal.   Copyright 2005, Oxford University Press.

Title:   The Mandatory Disclosure of Trades and Market Liquidity.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 637-76
Issue: 3
Volume: 8
Year: 1995
Abstract:
  Financial market regulations require various "insiders" to disclose their
 trades after the trades are made. We show that such mandatory disclosure
 rules can increase insiders' expected trading profits. This is because
 disclosure leads to profitable trading opportunities for insiders even if
 they possess no private information on the asset's value. We also show
 that insiders will generally not voluntarily disclose their trades, so for
 disclosure to be forthcoming, it must be mandatory. Key to the analysis is
 that the market cannot observe whether an insider is trading on private
 information regarding asset value or is trading for personal portfolio
 reasons.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title:   Bank Reputation, Bank Commitment, and the Effects of Competition in Credit Markets.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 781-812
Issue: 3
Volume: 13
Year: 2000
Abstract:
  This article discusses the effects of credit market competition on a
 bank's incentive to keep its commitment to lend to a borrower when the
 borrower's credit quality deteriorates. It is shown that, unlike in the
 borrower's commitment problem to keep borrowing from the same bank in
 "good" times, the increased competition may strengthen a bank's incentive
 to keep its commitment. Banks offer loans with commitment to the highest
 quality borrowers but, when faced with competition from bond markets, they
 also give these loans to lower quality borrowers. An increase in the
 number of banks has a non-monotonic effect; new banks reinforce a bank's
 incentive only if there are a small number of banks.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Parametric Portfolio Policies: Exploiting Characteristics in the Cross-Section of Equity Returns 
Abstract:
 We propose a novel approach to optimizing portfolios with large numbers of
 assets. We model directly the portfolio weight in each asset as a function
 of the asset's characteristics. The coefficients of this function are
 found by optimizing the investor's average utility of the portfolio's
 return over the sample period. Our approach is computationally simple and
 easily modified and extended to capture the effect of transaction costs,
 for example, produces sensible portfolio weights, and offers robust
 performance in and out of sample. In contrast, the traditional approach of
 first modeling the joint distribution of returns and then solving for the
 corresponding optimal portfolio weights is not only difficult to implement
 for a large number of assets but also yields notoriously noisy and
 unstable results. We present an empirical implementation for the universe
 of all stocks in the CRSP--Compustat data set, exploiting the size, value,
 and momentum anomalies.  The Author 2009. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title: Dollars Dollars Everywhere, Nor Any Dime to Lend: Credit Limit Constraints on Financial Sector Absorptive Capacity 
Abstract:
 We exploit an unexpected inflow of liquidity in an emerging market to
 study how capital is intermediated to firms. We find that backward-looking
 credit limit constraints imposed by banks make it difficult for firms to
 borrow, despite readily available bank liquidity, healthy aggregate
 demand, and a sharply falling cost of capital. The resulting aggregate
 failure to extend and retain capital in the economy suggests that agency
 costs that force banks to rely on sticky balance-sheet-based credit limits
 prevent emerging economies from effectively intermediating capital.  The Author 2010. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title: Valuation and Return Dynamics of New Ventures 
Abstract:
  A dynamic model of a multistage investment project that captures many
 features of research and development (R&amp;D) ventures and start-up
 companies is developed. An important feature these problems share is that
 firms learn about the potential profitability of the project throughout
 its life, but that technical uncertainty about the R&amp;D effort is only
 resolved through additional investment. Consequently the risks associated
 with the ultimate cash flows have a systematic component even while the
 purely technical risks are idiosyncratic. Our model captures these
 different sources of risk and allows us to study their interaction in
 determining the value and risk premium of the venture.   Copyright 2004, Oxford University Press.

Title: Does Beta Move with News? Firm-Specific Information Flows and Learning about Profitability 
Abstract:
 We investigate whether stock betas vary with the release of firm-specific
 news. Using daily firm-level betas estimated from intraday prices, we find
 that betas increase on earnings announcement days and revert to their
 average levels two to five days later. The increase in betas is greater
 for earnings announcements that have larger positive or negative
 surprises, convey more information about other firms in the market, and
 resolve greater ex ante uncertainty. Our results are consistent with a
 learning model in which investors use information on announcing firms to
 revise their expectations about the profitability of the aggregate
 economy.  The Author 2012. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: Extreme Governance: An Analysis of Dual-Class Firms in the United States 
Abstract:
 We construct a comprehensive list of dual-class firms in the United States
 and use this list to analyze the relationship between insider ownership
 and firm value. Our data have two useful features. First, since dual-class
 stock separates cash-flow rights from voting rights, we can separately
 identify the impact of each. Second, we address endogeneity concerns by
 using exogenous predictors of dual-class status as instruments. In
 single-stage regressions, we find strong evidence that firm value is
 increasing in insiders' cash-flow rights and decreasing in insider voting
 rights. In instrumental variable regressions, the point estimates are
 similar but the significance levels are lower.  The Author 2009. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title: Equilibrium Asset Pricing and Portfolio Choice Under Asymmetric Information 
Abstract:
 We analyze theoretically and empirically the implications of information
 asymmetry for equilibrium asset pricing and portfolio choice. In our
 partially revealing dynamic rational expectations equilibrium, portfolio
 separation fails, and indexing is not optimal. We show how uninformed
 investors should structure their portfolios, using the information
 contained in prices to cope with winner's curse problems. We implement
 empirically this price- contingent portfolio strategy. Consistent with our
 theory, the strategy outperforms economically and statistically the index.
 While momentum can arise in the model, in the data, the momentum strategy
 does not outperform the price-contingent strategy, as predicted by the
 theory.  The Author 2010. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title: Stock Return Predictability and Asset Pricing Models 
Abstract:
  This article develops an asset allocation framework that incorporates
 prior beliefs about the extent of stock return predictability explained by
 asset pricing models. We find that when prior beliefs allow even minor
 deviations from pricing model implications, the resulting asset
 allocations depart considerably from and substantially outperform
 allocations dictated by either the underlying models or the sample
 evidence on return predictability. Under a wide range of beliefs about
 model pricing abilities, asset allocations based on conditional models
 outperform their unconditional counterparts that exclude return
 predictability.   Copyright 2004, Oxford University Press.

Title:   Insider Trading as a Signal of Private Information.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 79-119
Issue: 1
Volume: 6
Year: 1993
Abstract:
  There is substantial evidence that insider trading is present around
 corporate announcements and that this insider trading is motivated by
 private information. Using real estate investment trusts that choose to
 reappraise themselves as our sample, we establish that the appraisals
 contain information, but find no market response to the public
 announcement of this information in these appraisals. We consider two
 possible explanations for this inconsistency: the first that the appraisal
 information is not highlighted in earnings reports and hence remains
 unobserved; and the second that insiders trade on the appraisal
 information in the time that elapses between the appraisal and its public
 announcement. We find strong support for the second hypothesis, with
 insiders buying (selling) after they receive favorable (unfavorable)
 appraisal news, especially for negative appraisals. We also find that
 positive (negative) appraisals and net insider buying (selling) elicit
 significant positive (negative) abnormal returns during the appraisal
 period.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Stocks or Options? Moral Hazard, Firm Viability, and the Design of Compensation Contracts 
Abstract:
 We consider the choice between stocks and options to provide effort
 incentives to a risk-averse manager. We show that stocks can dominate
 options as a means of motivation only if nonviability risk is substantial,
 as in financially distressed firms or start-ups. Options dominate stocks
 for other firms. These results hold regardless of the existing portfolio
 of the manager. We provide empirical evidence that higher bankruptcy risk
 is indeed correlated with more use of stock.  The Author 2007. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org, Oxford University Press.

Title: Does Capital Account Liberalization Lead to&nbsp;Growth? 
Abstract:
 We test whether capital account liberalization led to higher economic
 growth using de jure measures of capital account and financial current
 account openness for 94 nations, from 1950 (or independence) onward. We
 argue that measurement error, differing time periods used, and
 collinearity among independent variables account for conflicting results
 in prior scholarship. We use pooled time-series, cross-sectional OLS and
 system GMM estimators to examine economic growth rates, 1955--2004.
 Capital account liberalization had a positive association with growth in
 both developed and emerging market nations. We confirm that equity market
 liberalization has an independent effect on economic growth.  The Author 2008. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org, Oxford University Press.

Title: Shareholder Diversification and the Decision to Go Public 
Abstract:
 We study the effects of the controlling shareholders' portfolio
 diversification on the initial public offering (IPO) process. Less
 diversified shareholders have more to gain from taking their firm public,
 and are more willing to accept a lower price for shares. We test these
 hypotheses using the data on all IPOs in Sweden between 1995 and 2001.
 Using detailed information on the portfolio composition of shareholders in
 private and public firms, we construct several proxies of their portfolio
 diversification and relate them to the probability of the IPO and the
 underpricing. We show that the less diversified individual shareholders,
 especially those with lower wealth, sell more of their shares at the IPO.
 Firms held by less diversified controlling shareholders are more likely to
 go public, and exhibit higher underpricing. These effects are economically
 and statistically significant, while the diversification of noncontrolling
 shareholders has no effect. Our findings suggest that diversification of
 controlling shareholders plays a prominent role in the IPO process.  The Author 2007. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Issue: 3
Volume: 8
Year: 1995
Abstract:
  Foreign exchange returns exhibit behavior difficult to reconcile with
 standard theoretical models. This article asks whether the recent findings
 of long swings in exchange rates between appreciating and depreciating
 periods affect estimates of the foreign exchange risk premium. We
 demonstrate how the "peso problem" introduced by expected shifts in
 exchange rate regimes can affect inferences about the risk premium in at
 least two ways: (1) it can make the foreign exchange risk premium appear
 to contain a permanent disturbance when it does not, and (2) it can induce
 bias in the foreign exchange return regressions such as in Fama (1984).   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Takeovers and the Cross-Section of Returns 
Abstract:
 This paper considers the impact of the takeover likelihood on firm
 valuation. If firms are more likely to acquire when there is more free
 cash or lower required rates of return, the targets become more sensitive
 to shocks to cash flows or the price of risk. Ceteris paribus, firms
 exposed to takeovers have different rates of return than protected firms.
 Using takeover likelihood estimates, we create a "takeover factor," buying
 (selling) firms with a high (low) takeover likelihood, which generates
 "abnormal" returns. Several tests confirm that the takeover factor helps
 explaining cross-sectional differences in equity returns and is related to
 takeover activity.  The Author 2008. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org, Oxford University Press.

Title: Cash-in-the-Market Pricing and Optimal Resolution of Bank Failures 
Abstract:
 As the number of bank failures increases, the set of assets available for
 acquisition by surviving banks enlarges but the total liquidity available
 with surviving banks falls. This results in "cash-in-the-market" pricing
 for liquidation of banking assets. At a sufficiently large number of bank
 failures, and in turn, at a sufficiently low level of asset prices, there
 are too many banks to liquidate and inefficient users of assets who are
 liquidity-endowed may end up owning the liquidated assets. In order to
 avoid this allocation inefficiency, it may be ex-post optimal for the
 regulator to bail out some failed banks. We show, however, that there
 exists a policy that involves granting liquidity to surviving banks in the
 purchase of failed banks, which is equivalent to the bailout policy from
 an ex-post standpoint. Crucially, this liquidity provision policy gives
 banks incentives to differentiate, rather than to herd, makes aggregate
 banking crises less likely, and thereby dominates the bailout policy from
 an ex-ante standpoint.  The Author 2007. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Abstract:
  Transaction costs are important for a host of empirical analyses from
 market efficiency to international market research. But transaction costs
 estimates are not always available, or where available, are cumbersome to
 use and expensive to purchase. We present a model that requires only the
 time series of daily security returns to endogenously estimate the
 effective transaction costs for any firm, exchange, or time period. The
 feature of the data that allows for the estimation of transaction costs is
 the incidence of zero returns. Incorporating zero returns in the
 return-generating process, the model provides continuous estimates of
 average round-trip transaction costs from 1963 to 1990 that are 1.2% and
 10.3% for large and small decile firms, respectively. These estimates are
 highly correlated (85%), with the most commonly used transaction cost
 estimators.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Securitization, Transparency, and Liquidity 
Abstract:
 We present a model in which issuers of asset-backed securities choose to
 release coarse information to enhance the liquidity of their primary
 market, at the cost of reducing secondary market liquidity. The degree of
 transparency is inefficiently low if the social value of secondary market
 liquidity exceeds its private value. We show that various types of public
 intervention (mandatory transparency standards, provision of liquidity to
 distressed banks, or secondary market price support) have quite different
 welfare implications. Finally, we extend the model by endogenizing the
 private and social value of liquidity and the proportion of sophisticated
 investors.  The Author 2012. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For permissions, please e-mail: <email>journals.permissions@oup.com</email>., Oxford University Press.

Title: Institutional Investors and Mutual Fund Governance: Evidence from Retail--Institutional Fund Twins 
Abstract:
 Advisors often manage multiple versions of a fund. These "twins" have the
 same manager and similar performance but are sold to different investors
 with differing abilities to select and monitor managers. Comparing
 investor flows in retail and institutional twins, we find that
 institutional investors are more sensitive to high fees and poor
 risk-adjusted performance. Consistent with the reduction of agency
 problems from greater monitoring, retail funds with an institutional twin
 outperform other retail funds by 1.5% per year. After the institutional
 twin is created, expenses decrease while measures of managerial effort at
 the retail fund increase.  The Author 2012. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title:   The Strategic Timing of Corporate Disclosures.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 665-90
Issue: 2
Volume: 9
Year: 1996
Abstract:
  An important element of a firm's disclosure strategy is the timing of its
 mandatory public announcements. In this article, two aspects of disclosure
 timing are examined. The first is the intraday timing of earnings
 accouncements. It is demonstrated here that, under reasonable conditions,
 market prices reflect better the valuation implications of an earnings
 announcement when it is made during trading hours rather than after the
 market has closed. This implies that managers should prefer to release
 earnings with positive (negative) implications for firm value during
 (after) trading hours. The second issue examined is the sequencing of
 multiple corporate disclosures. It is shown that if the announcements have
 positive (negative) implications for firm value, managers should prefer to
 make them separately (simultaneously), as market prices better reflect the
 valuation implications of multiple announcements when they are made at
 different times.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Liquidity and Manipulation of Executive Compensation Schemes 
Abstract:
 Compensation contracts have been criticized for encouraging managers to
 manipulate information. This includes bonus schemes that encourage
 earnings smoothing, and option packages that allow managers to cash out
 early when the firm is overvalued. We show that the intransparency induced
 by these contract features is critical for giving long-term incentives.
 Lack of transparency makes it harder for the owner to engage in ex post
 optimal but ex ante inefficient liquidity provision to the manager. For
 the same reason, it is often optimal to "pay for luck" (i.e., tie
 long-term compensation to variables that the manager has no influence
 over, but may have private information about, such as future profitability
 of the whole industry).  The Author 2008. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title: Volatility Dynamics for the S&P500: Evidence from Realized Volatility, Daily Returns, and Option Prices 
Abstract:
 Most recent empirical option valuation studies build on the affine square
 root (SQR) stochastic volatility model. The SQR model is a convenient
 choice, because it yields closed-form solutions for option prices. We
 investigate alternatives to the SQR model, by comparing its empirical
 performance with that of five different but equally parsimonious
 stochastic volatility models. We provide empirical evidence from three
 different sources: realized volatilities, S&P500 returns, and an extensive
 panel of option data. The three sources of data all point to the same
 conclusion: the best volatility specification is one with linear rather
 than square root diffusion for variance. This model captures the stylized
 facts in realized volatilities, it performs well in fitting various
 samples of index returns, andit has the lowest option implied volatility
 mean squared error in and out of sample.  The Author 2010. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Issue: 5
Volume: 12
Year: 1999
Abstract:
  This article presents a new definition of market completeness that is
 independent of the notions of no arbitrage and equivalent martingale
 measures. Our definition has many advantages, all shown herein. First, it
 preserves the Second Fundamental Theorem of Asset Pricing, even in complex
 economies. Second, under our definition, the market can be complete yet
 arbitrage opportunities exist. This is important in practice, and stands
 in contrast to the traditional definitions. Third, under the assumptions
 of no arbitrage and when used in the standard models, our definition is
 equivalent to the traditional one.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Unobserved Actions of Mutual Funds 
Abstract:
 Despite extensive disclosure requirements, mutual fund investors do not
 observe all actions of fund managers. We estimate the impact of unobserved
 actions on fund returns using the return gap--the difference between the
 reported fund return and the return on a portfolio that invests in the
 previously disclosed fund holdings. We document that unobserved actions of
 some funds persistently create value, while such actions of other funds
 destroy value. Our main result shows that the return gap predicts fund
 performance.  The Author 2007. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title: Losing Money on Arbitrage: Optimal Dynamic Portfolio Choice in Markets with Arbitrage Opportunities 
Abstract:
  We derive the optimal investment policy of a risk-averse investor in a
 market where there is a textbook arbitrage opportunity, but where
 liabilities must be secured by collateral. We find that it is often
 optimal to underinvest in the arbitrage by taking a smaller position than
 collateral constraints allow. Even when the optimal policy is followed,
 the arbitrage portfolio typically experiences losses before the final
 convergence date. In fact, its initial performance may be
 indistinguishable from that of a conventional portfolio with a poor track
 record. These results have important implications for the role of
 arbitrageurs in financial markets.   Copyright 2004, Oxford University Press.

Title: Whence GARCH? A Preference-Based Explanation for Conditional Volatility 
Abstract:
  We develop a preference-based equilibrium asset pricing model that
 explains low-frequency conditional volatility. Similar to Barberis, Huang,
 and Santos (2001), agents in our model care about wealth changes,
 experience loss aversion, and keep a mental scorecard that affects their
 level of risk aversion. A new feature of our model is that when perturbed
 by unexpected returns, investors become temporarily more sensitive to
 news. Gradually investors become accustomed to the new level of wealth,
 restoring prior levels of risk aversion and news sensitivity. The
 state-dependent sensitivity to news creates the type of volatility
 clustering found in low-frequency stock returns. We find empirical support
 for our model's predictions that relate the scorecard to conditional
 volatility and skewness.   Copyright 2004, Oxford University Press.

Title: Robustness and Pricing with Uncertain Growth 
Abstract:
  We study how decision-makers' concerns about robustness affect prices and
 quantities in a stochastic growth model. In the model economy, growth
 rates in technology are altered by infrequent large shocks and continuous
 small shocks. An investor observes movements in the technology level but
 cannot perfectly distinguish their sources. Instead the investor solves a
 signal extraction problem. We depart from most of the macroeconomics and
 finance literature by presuming that the investor treats the specification
 of technology evolution as an approximation. To promote a decision rule
 that is robust to model misspecification, an investor acts as if a
 malevolent player threatens to perturb the actual data-generating process
 relative to his approximating model. We study how a concern about
 robustness alters asset prices. We show that the dynamic evolution of the
 risk-return trade-off is dominated by movements in the growth-state
 probabilities and that the evolution of the dividend-price ratio is driven
 primarily by the capital-technology ratio.   Copyright 2002, Oxford University Press.

Title:   Equilibrium Asset Prices and No-Arbitrage with Portfolio Constraints.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 1133-74
Issue: 4
Volume: 10
Year: 1997
Abstract:
  We examine intertemporal asset pricing when short sales are constrained
 in proportion to the value of an investor's portfolio. All assets prices
 exceed every investor's marginal utility of consumption-based valuation of
 the associated dividends if every investor finds himself constrained in
 some asset in some state; we exhibit such an equilibrium. An asset's price
 decomposes into three (investor-specific) components: the consumption
 value of its dividends, a speculative value premium, and a collateral
 value premium. The validity of the no-arbitrage pricing approach is shown
 to depend critically on the difference between real securities and their
 synthetic counterparts.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title:   The Resolution of Financial Distress.

Issue: 1
Volume: 2
Year: 1989
Abstract:
  Most models of financial structure embody an assumption about financial
 distress that causes debt to be costly to the issuing firm. This approach
 has been criticized on the grounds that the assumed costs could be avoided
 by a costless financial reorganization. In this article we show that
 despite the possibility of costless reorganization, it may be rational for
 firms to incur significant costs in the resolution of financial distress.
 The main assumptions that give rise to our results are the existence of
 asymmetric courts to impose a reorganization on the claimants of a firm.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Incentive Contracts in Delegated Portfolio Management 
Abstract:
 This article analyzes optimal nonlinear portfolio management contracts. We
 consider a setting in which the investor faces moral hazard with respect
 to the effort and risk choices of the portfolio manager. The employment
 contract promises the manager: (i) a fixed payment, (ii) a proportional
 asset-based fee, (iii) a benchmark-linked fulcrum fee, and (iv) a
 benchmark-linked option-type "bonus" incentive fee. We show that the
 option-type incentive helps overcome the effort-underinvestment problem
 that undermines linear contracts. More generally, we find that for the set
 of contracts we consider, with the appropriate choice of benchmark it is
 always optimal to include a bonus incentive fee in the contract. We derive
 the conditions that such a benchmark must satisfy. Our results suggest
 that current regulatory restrictions on asymmetric performance-based fees
 in mutual fund advisory contracts may be costly.  The Author 2009. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title:   Predictable Risk and Returns in Emerging Markets.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 773-816
Issue: 3
Volume: 8
Year: 1995
Abstract:
  The emergence of new equity markets in Europe, Latin America, Asia, the
 Mideast and Africa provides a new menu of opportunities for investors.
 These markets exhibit high expected returns as well as high volatility.
 Importantly, the low correlations with developed countries' equity markets
 significantly reduces the unconditional portfolio risk of a world
 investor. However, standard global asset pricing models, which assume
 complete integration of capital markets, fail to explain the cross section
 of average returns in emerging countries. An analysis of the
 predictability of the returns reveals that emerging market returns are
 more likely than developed countries to be influenced by local
 information.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Bank Debt and Corporate Governance 
Abstract:
 In this paper, we investigate the disciplining role of banks and bank debt
 in the market for corporate control. We find that relationship bank
 lending intensity and bank client network have positive effects on the
 probability of a borrowing firm becoming a target. This effect is enhanced
 in cases where the target and acquirer have a relationship with the same
 bank. Moreover, we utilize an experiment to show that the effects of
 relationship bank lending intensity on takeover probability are not driven
 by endogeneity. Finally, we also investigate reasons motivating a bank's
 informational role in the market for corporate control.  The Author 2008. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org, Oxford University Press.

Title: The Declining Equity Premium: What Role Does Macroeconomic Risk Play? 
Abstract:
 Aggregate stock prices, relative to virtually any indicator of fundamental
 value, soared to unprecedented levels in the 1990s. Even today, after the
 market declines since 2000, they remain well above historical norms. Why?
 We consider one particular explanation: a fall in macroeconomic risk, or
 the volatility of the aggregate economy. Empirically, we find a strong
 correlation between low-frequency movements in macroeconomic volatility
 and low-frequency movements in the stock market. To model this phenomenon,
 we estimate a two-state regime switching model for the volatility and mean
 of consumption growth, and find evidence of a shift to substantially lower
 consumption volatility at the beginning of the 1990s. We then use these
 estimates from postwar data to calibrate a rational asset pricing model
 with regime switches in both the mean and standard deviation of
 consumption growth. Plausible parameterizations of the model are found to
 account for a significant portion of the run-up in asset valuation ratios
 observed in the late 1990s.  The Author 2007. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org, Oxford University Press.

Title: Generalized Transform Analysis of Affine Processes and Applications in Finance 
Abstract:
 Nonlinearity is an important consideration in many problems of finance and
 economics, such as pricing securities and solving equilibrium models. This
 article provides analytical treatment of a general class of nonlinear
 transforms for processes with tractable conditional characteristic
 functions. We extend existing results on characteristic function-based
 transforms to a substantially wider class of nonlinear functions while
 maintaining low dimensionality by avoiding the need to compute the density
 function. We illustrate the applications of the generalized transform in
 pricing defaultable bonds with stochastic recovery. We also use the method
 to analytically solve a class of general equilibrium models with multiple
 goods and apply this model to study the effects of time-varying labor
 income risk on the equity premium.  The Author 2012. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title:   Market Microstructure Effects of Government Intervention in the Foreign Exchange Market.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 513-41
Issue: 3
Volume: 4
Year: 1991
Abstract:
  An asymmetric information model of the bid-ask spread is developed for a
 foreign exchange market subject to occasional government interventions.
 Traditional tests of the unbiasedness of the forward rate as a predictor
 of the future spot rate are shown to be inconsistent when the rates are
 measured as the average of their respective bid and ask quotes. Larger
 bid-ask spreads on Fridays are documented. Reliable evidence of asymmetric
 bid-ask spreads for all days of the week, albeit more pronounced on
 Fridays, are presented. The null hypothesis that the forward rate is an
 unbiased predictor of the future spot rate continues to be rejected. The
 regression slope coefficients increase toward unity, however, indicating a
 less variable risk premium.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: The Limitations of Industry Concentration Measures Constructed with Compustat Data: Implications for Finance Research 
Abstract:
 Industry concentration measures calculated with Compustat data, which
 cover only the public firms in an industry, are poor proxies for actual
 industry concentration. These measures have correlations of only 13% with
 the corresponding U.S. Census measures, which are based on all public and
 private firms in an industry. Also, only when U.S. Census measures are
 used is there evidence consistent with theoretical predictions that
 more-concentrated industries, which should be more oligopolistic, are
 populated by larger and fewer firms with higher price-cost margins.
 Further, the significant relations of Compustat-based industry
 concentration measures with the dependent variables of several important
 prior studies are not obtained when U.S. Census measures are used. One of
 the reasons for this occurrence is that Compustat-based measures proxy for
 industry decline. Overall, our results indicate that product markets
 research that uses Compustat-based industry concentration measures may
 lead to incorrect conclusions.  The Author 2008. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title: The "Antidirector Rights Index" Revisited 
Abstract:
 The "antidirector rights index" has been used as a measure of shareholder
 protection in over a hundred articles since it was introduced by La Porta
 et al. ("Law and Finance." 1998, Journal of Political Economy
 106:1113--55). A thorough reexamination of the legal data, however, leads
 to corrections for thirty-three of the forty-six countries analyzed. The
 correlation between corrected and original values is only 0.53.
 Consequently, many empirical results established using the original index
 may not be replicable with corrected values. In particular, the corrected
 index fails to support three widely influential claims: that shareholder

Title: Informational Holdup and Performance Persistence in Venture Capital 
Abstract:
 Why don't VCs eliminate excess demand for follow-on funds by raising fees?
 We propose a model of learning that leads to informational holdup. Current
 investors learn about skill whereas outside investors observe only
 returns. This gives current investors holdup power when the VC raises his
 next fund: Without their backing, no-one will fund him, as outside
 investors interpret the lack of backing as a sign of low skill. Holdup
 power diminishes the VC's ability to increase fees in line with
 performance, leading to return persistence. Empirical evidence supports
 the model. We estimate that up to two-thirds of VC firms lack skill.  The Author 2013. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: Bond Illiquidity and Excess Volatility 
Abstract:
 We find that the empirical volatilities of corporate bond and CDS returns
 are higher than implied by equity return volatilities and the Merton
 model. This excess volatility may arise because structural models
 inadequately capture either fundamentals or illiquidity. Our evidence
 supports the latter explanation. We find little relation between excess
 volatility and measures of firm fundamentals and the volatility of firm
 fundamentals but some relation with variables proxying for time-varying
 illiquidity. Consistent with an illiquidity explanation, firm-level bond
 portfolio returns, which average out bond-specific effects, significantly
 decrease excess volatility.  The Author 2013. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title:   Are Insider Trades Informative?
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 79-111
Issue: 1
Volume: 14
Year: 2001
Abstract:
  We examine insider trading activities of all companies traded on the
 NYSE, AMEX, and Nasdaq during the 1975-95 period. In general, very little
 market movement is observed when insiders trade and when they report their
 trades to the SEC. Insiders in aggregate are contrarian investors.
 However, they predict market movements better than simple contrarian
 strategies. Insiders also seem to be able to predict cross-sectional stock
 returns. The result, however, is driven by insider's ability to predict
 returns in smaller firms. In addition, informativeness of insiders'
 activities is coming from purchases, while insider selling appears to have
 no predictive ability.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Managerial Incentives and the Role of Advisors in the Continuous-Time Agency Model 
Abstract:
 We explore a continuous-time agency model with double moral hazard. Using
 a venture capitalist (VC)--entrepreneur relationship where the VC both
 supplies costly effort and chooses the optimal timing of the initial
 public offering (IPO), we show that optimal IPO timing is earlier under
 double moral hazard than under single moral hazard. Our results also
 indicate that the manager's compensation tends to be paid earlier under
 double moral hazard. We derive several comparative static results, notably
 that IPO timing is earlier when the need for monitoring by the VC is
 smaller and when the volatility of cash flows is larger.  The Author 2013. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: Partial Adjustment or Stale Prices? Implications from Stock Index and Futures Return Autocorrelations 
Abstract:
  We investigate the relation between returns on stock indices and their
 corresponding futures contracts to evaluate potential explanations for the
 pervasive yet anomalous evidence of positive, short-horizon portfolio
 autocorrelations. Using a simple theoretical framework, we generate
 empirical implications for both microstructure and partial adjustment
 models. The major findings are (i) return autocorrelations of indices are
 generally positive even though futures contracts have autocorrelations
 close to zero, and (ii) these autocorrelation differences are maintained
 under conditions favorable for spot-futures arbitrage and are most
 prevalent during low-volume periods. These results point toward
 microstructure-based explanations and away from explanations based on
 behavioral models.   Copyright 2002, Oxford University Press.

Title:   Nondisclosure and Adverse Disclosure as Signals of Firm Value.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 283-313
Issue: 2
Volume: 4
Year: 1991
Abstract:
  We present a model in which some of the firm's information (" news") can
 be disclosed verifiably and some information (" type") cannot, to show
 that some firms may voluntarily withhold good news and disclose bad news.
 We describe an equilibrium in which high-type firms withhold good news and
 disclose bad news, whereas low-type firms disclose good news and withhold
 bad news. Under some parameter values, this equilibrium exists when other
 more traditional equilibria are ruled out be standard equilibrium
 refinements. The model explains some otherwise anomalous empirical
 evidence concerning stock price reactions to disclosure, provides some new
 empirical predictions, and suggests that mandatory disclosure requirements
 may have the undesirable consequence of making it more difficult for firms
 to reveal information that cannot be disclosed credibly.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Analytic Pricing of Employee Stock Options 
Abstract:
 We introduce a model that captures the main properties that characterize
 employee stock options (ESO). We discuss the likelihood of early voluntary
 ESO exercise, and the obligation to exercise immediately if the employee
 leaves the firm, except if this happens before options are vested, in
 which case the options are forfeited. We derive an analytic formula for
 the price of the ESO and in a case study compare it to alternative
 methods.  The Author 2007. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org, Oxford University Press.

Title: Growing Out of Trouble? Corporate Responses to Liability Risk 
Abstract:
 This article analyzes corporate responses to the liability risk arising
 from workers' exposure to newly identified carcinogens. We find that
 firms, especially those with weak balance sheets, tend to respond to such
 risks by acquiring large, unrelated businesses with relatively high
 operating cash flows. The diversifying growth appears to be primarily
 motivated by managers' personal exposure to their firms' risk in that the
 growth has negative announcement returns and is related to firms' external
 governance, managerial stockholdings, and institutional ownership. The
 results suggest that corporate governance is particularly important when
 firms are exposed to the risk of large, adverse shocks.  The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: Controlling for Fixed-Income Exposure in Portfolio Evaluation: Evidence from Hybrid Mutual Funds 
Abstract:
 We examine whether explicitly controlling for the fixed-income exposure of
 mutual funds affects conclusions drawn in performance assessment. We focus
 on daily return data from two hybrid mutual fund samples. Comparing
 abnormal performance estimates from the Carhart (1997) model to extensions
 designed to correct for bond holdings, we find that the estimates within
 one of our samples change from positive to significantly negative.
 Additional evidence indicates that cash flows to the funds are more
 closely correlated with the traditional Carhart measure, clearly
 indicating that the absence of bond indices misleads investors who use a
 fund's risk-adjusted performance as the basis for investment decisions.  The Author 2007. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title: Lending Relationships and Information Rents: Do Banks Exploit Their Information Advantages? 
Abstract:
 In the process of lending to a firm, a bank acquires proprietary
 firm-specific information that is unavailable to nonlenders. This
 asymmetric evolution of information between lenders and prospective
 lenders grants the former an information monopoly. This article
 empirically investigates whether relationship banks exploit this advantage
 by charging higher interest rates than those that would prevail were all
 banks symmetrically informed. My identification strategy hinges on the
 notion that large information shocks that level the playing field among
 banks erode the relationship bank's information monopoly. I use the
 borrower's initial public offering (IPO) as such an information-releasing
 event, and build a panel dataset in which the unit of observation is a
 firm's lending relationships before and after its IPO. Prior to a firm's
 IPO, I find a U-shaped relation between borrowing rates and relationship
 intensity. After the IPO, interest rates are decreasing in relationship
 intensity. Furthermore, mean interest rates drop after an IPO. The results
 are robust to firm and loan-year fixed effects, and to controls for firm
 leverage pre- and post-IPO. Thus, the reported interest rate pattern is
 clean of any confounding effects that might arise from changes in
 financial risk.  The Author 2009. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org, Oxford University Press.

Title: Returns to Shareholder Activism: Evidence from a Clinical Study of the Hermes UK Focus Fund 
Abstract:
 This article reports a unique analysis of private engagements by an
 activist fund. It is based on data made available to us by Hermes, the
 fund manager owned by the British Telecom Pension Scheme, on engagements
 with management in companies targeted by its UK Focus Fund. In contrast
 with most previous studies of activism, we report that the fund executes
 shareholder activism predominantly through private interventions that
 would be unobservable in studies purely relying on public information. The
 fund substantially outperforms benchmarks and we estimate that abnormal
 returns are largely associated with engagements rather than stock picking.  The Author 2008. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Volume: 13
Year: 2000
Abstract:
  Forward rate dynamics are modeled as a random field. In contrast to
 multifactor models, random field models offer a parsimonious description
 of term structure dynamics, while eliminating the self-inconsistent
 practice of recalibration. The form of the drift of the instantaneous
 forward rate process necessary to preclude arbitrage under the
 risk-neutral measure is obtained. Forward risk-adjusted measures are
 identified and used to price a bond option when the forward volatility
 structure depends on the square root of the current spot rate. Several
 classes of tractable random field models are presented.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Equity and Cash in Intercorporate Asset Sales: Theory and Evidence 
Abstract:
 We develop a two-sided asymmetric information model of asset sales that
 incorporates the key differences from mergers and allows the information
 held by each party to be impounded in the transaction. The buyer's
 information is conveyed through a first-stage competitive auction. A
 seller with unfavorable information about the asset accepts the cash offer
 of the highest bidder. A seller with favorable information proposes a
 take-it-or-leave-it counteroffer that entails buyer equity. Thus, the
 cash-equity decision reflects the seller's but not the buyer's information
 in contrast to the theoretical and empirical findings for mergers. The
 central prediction of our model is that there are large gains in wealth
 for both buyers and sellers in equity-based asset sales, whereas cash
 sales generate significantly smaller gains that typically accrue only to
 sellers. Our empirical results are consistent with the predictions of our
 theoretical model.  The Author 2008. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title: Asymmetries in Stock Returns: Statistical Tests and Economic Evaluation 
Abstract:
 We provide a model-free test for asymmetric correlations in which stocks
 move more often with the market when the market goes down than when it
 goes up, and also provide such tests for asymmetric betas and covariances.
 When stocks are sorted by size, book-to-market, and momentum, we find
 strong evidence of asymmetries for both size and momentum portfolios, but
 no evidence for book-to-market portfolios. Moreover, we evaluate the
 economic significance of incorporating asymmetries into investment
 decisions, and find that they can be of substantial economic importance
 for an investor with a disappointment aversion (DA) preference as
 described by Ang, Bekaert, and Liu (2005).  , Oxford University Press.

Title: Portfolio Performance and Agency 
Abstract:
 In this paper we analyze the optimal contract for a portfolio manager who
 can exert effort to improve the quality of a private signal about future
 market prices. We assume complete markets over states distinguished by
 asset payoffs and place no restrictions on the form of the contract. We
 show that trading restrictions are essential because they prevent the
 manager from undoing the incentive effects of performance-based fees. We
 provide conditions under which simple benchmarking emerges as optimal
 compensation. Additional incentives to take risk are necessary when
 information can be manipulated or else the manager will understate
 information to offset the benchmarking.  The Author 2009. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org, Oxford University Press.

Title: Do Peso Problems Explain the Returns to the Carry Trade? 
Abstract:
 We study the properties of the carry trade, a currency speculation
 strategy in which an investor borrows low-interest-rate currencies and
 lends high-interest-rate currencies. This strategy generates payoffs that
 are on average large and uncorrelated with traditional risk factors. We
 argue that these payoffs reflect a peso problem. The underlying peso event
 features high values of the stochastic discount factor rather than very
 large negative payoffs.  The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org, Oxford University Press.

Title: Ambiguous Volatility and Asset Pricing in Continuous Time 
Abstract:
 We formulate a model of utility for a continuous-time framework that
 captures aversion to ambiguity about both volatility and drift.
 Corresponding extensions of some basic results in asset pricing theory are
 presented. First, we derive arbitrage-free pricing rules based on hedging
 arguments. Because ambiguous volatility implies market incompleteness,
 hedging arguments determine prices only up to intervals. In order to
 obtain sharper predictions, we apply the model of utility to a
 representative agent endowment economy and study equilibrium asset
 returns. A version of the consumption capital asset pricing model is
 derived, and the effects of ambiguous volatility are described.  The Author 2013. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: Differences in Governance Practices between U.S. and Foreign Firms: Measurement, Causes, and Consequences 
Abstract:
 We construct a firm-level governance index that increases with minority
 shareholder protection. Compared with U.S. matching firms, only 12.68% of
 foreign firms have a higher index. The value of foreign firms falls as
 their index decreases relative to the index of matching U.S. firms. Our
 results suggest that lower country-level investor protection and other
 country characteristics make it suboptimal for foreign firms to invest as
 much in governance as U.S. firms do. Overall, we find that minority
 shareholders benefit from governance improvements and do so partly at the
 expense of controlling shareholders.  The Author 2008. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title: Financial Constraints Risk 
Abstract:
  We construct an index of firms' external finance constraints via
 generalized method of moments (GMM) estimation of an investment Euler
 equation. Unlike the commonly used KZ index, ours is consistent with firm
 characteristics associated with external finance constraints. Constrained
 firms' returns move together, suggesting the existence of a financial
 constraints factor. This factor earns a positive but insignificant average
 return. Much of the variation in this factor cannot be explained by the
 Fama--French and momentum factors. Cross-sectional regressions of returns
 on our index and other firm characteristics show that constrained firms
 earn higher returns and that the financial-constraints effect dominates
 the size effect.   Copyright 2006, Oxford University Press.

Title:   Minimum Price Variations, Discrete Bid-Ask Spreads, and Quotation Sizes.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 149-78
Issue: 1
Volume: 7
Year: 1994
Abstract:
  Exchange minimum price variation regulations create discrete bid-ask
 spreads. If the minimum quotable spread exceeds the spread that otherwise
 would be quoted, spreads will be wide and the number of shares offered at
 the bid and ask may be large. A cross-sectional discrete spread model is
 estimated by using intraday stock quotation spread frequencies. The
 results are used to project $1/16 spread usage frequencies given a $1/16
 tick. Projected changes in quotation sizes and in trade volumes are
 obtained from regression models. For stocks priced under $10, the models
 predict spreads would decrease 38 percent, quotation sizes would decrease
 16 percent, and daily volume would increase 34 percent.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title:   Dynamic Banking: A Reconsideration.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 1003-32
Issue: 3
Volume: 9
Year: 1996
Abstract:
  Financially intermediated and stock market consumption-investment
 avocations, with and without governmental interventions, are compared in a
 welfare sense in overlapping generation economies with (and without)
 shocks to agents' intertemporal preferences. We first show that, in
 economies with preference shocks, governmental interventions subject to
 the same informational requirements as those imposed on financial
 intermediaries, lead to stock market allocations that are not inferior to
 those attained under financial intermediation. Second, we argue that the
 necessary interventions are qualitatively no different from those required
 to implement stationary optimal allocations in OLG models without shocks
 to agents' intertemporal consumption preferences.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Temporary versus Permanent Shocks: Explaining Corporate Financial Policies 
Abstract:
 We investigate corporate financial policies in the presence of both
 temporary and permanent shocks to firms' cash flows. In our framework,
 cash flows can be negative and are imperfectly correlated with firm value,
 and earnings volatility differs from asset volatility. These results are
 consistent with empirical stylized facts. They are also contrary to the
 implications of existing dynamic capital structure models that allow only
 for permanent shocks to cash flows. Temporary shocks increase the
 importance of financial flexibility and may provide an intuitively simple
 and realistic explanation of empirically observed financial conservatism
 and low leverage phenomena. The theoretical framework developed in this
 article general enough to be used in various corporate finance
 applications.   The Author 2010. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title:   Econometric Evaluation of Asset Pricing Models.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 237-74
Issue: 2
Volume: 8
Year: 1995
Abstract:
  In this article we provide econometric tools for the evaluation of
 intertemporal asset pricing models using specification-error and
 volatility bounds. We formulate analog estimators of these bounds, give
 conditions for consistency, and derive the limiting distribution of these
 estimators. The analysis incorporates market frictions such as short-sale
 constraints and proportional transactions costs. Among several
 applications we show how to use the methods to assess specific asset
 pricing models and to provide nonparametric characterizations of asset
 pricing anomalies.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title:   Financial Policy and Reputation for Product Quality.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies

Issue: 1
Volume: 4
Year: 1991
Abstract:
  The effect of financial policy on a firm's incentives to maintain its
 reputation for producing a high-quality product is analyzed. It is
 demonstrated that in certain situations debt will reduce a firm's ability
 to credibly offer high-quality products and, as a consequence, will reduce
 its value. However, for firms with assets that have high salvage values in
 liquidation, debt may increase their ability to credibly offer
 high-quality products and, therefore, increase their values.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: The Consequences of Entrepreneurial Finance: Evidence from Angel Financings 
Abstract:
 This article documents the fact that ventures funded by two successful
 angel groups experience superior outcomes to rejected ventures: They have
 improved survival, exits, employment, patenting, Web traffic, and
 financing. We use strong discontinuities in angel- funding behavior over
 small changes in their collective interest levels to implement a
 regression discontinuity approach. We confirm the positive effects for
 venture operations, with qualitative support for a higher likelihood of
 successful exits. On the other hand, there is no difference in access to
 additional financing around the discontinuity. This might suggest that
 financing is not a central input of angel groups.  The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: The Impact of a Strong Bank-Firm Relationship on the Borrowing Firm 
Abstract:
 Commercial banks acquire inside information about the firms they lend to.
 We study the impact of this informationally privileged position on the
 borrowing firm using a broad panel of U.S. firms over the 1993--2004
 period. We measure the strength of the bank-firm relationship by bank-firm
 proximity, size of the loan, and the lender's insider potential. We show
 that a stronger relationship, by inducing better monitoring, improves the
 borrower's corporate governance. Simultaneously, it makes the bank a
 potentially more informed agent in the equity market. This information
 asymmetry increases adverse selection for the other market participants
 and lowers the firm's stock liquidity. This trade-off between improved
 corporate governance and greater information asymmetry affects the firm's
 value. Our results have normative implications for the role of banks in
 the development of financial markets.  The Author 2009. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title: A Supply Approach to Valuation 
Abstract:
 A new methodology for equity valuation arises from the perspective of
 managers' supply of capital assets. Under q-theory, managers optimally
 adjust the supply of assets to changes in their market value. The
 first-order condition of investment then provides a valuation equation
 that infers asset prices from managers' costs of supplying the assets.
 This equation fits well the Tobin's q levels across many testing assets,
 including portfolios formed on q. With current investment-to-capital as
 the only input, the supply approach does not require cash flow forecasts
 or discount rate estimates, both of which are notoriously difficult to
 obtain in practice.  The Author 2013. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: The Value of Voting Rights to Majority Shareholders: Evidence from Dual-Class Stock Unifications 
Abstract:
  We study 84 dual-class stock unifications, where superior vote
 shareholders gave up their superior voting status (all firm stocks became
 "one share one vote") and received (in most cases) compensation in the
 form of additional shares. Unifications are essentially intrafirm
 transactions of voting rights, and afford observation of the
 intrafirm-assessed price of vote. The price of vote in unifications (1)
 increases with the percentage vote lost by the majority shareholders, (2)
 is higher in family-controlled firms, (3) decreases with institutional
 investor holdings, and (4) is similar to the "outside" price of vote
 implicit in the market prices of stocks.   Copyright 2004, Oxford University Press.

Title: Securitization and Mortgage Renegotiation: Evidence from the Great Depression 
Abstract:
 We use loan-level data from the New York City metropolitan area to examine
 the extent to which lenders attempted to prevent foreclosures with
 concessionary modifications during the Great Depression. We find no
 principal forgiveness in the sample and only a handful of concessionary
 mortgage modifications of other types. Far more mortgages terminated
 through foreclosure than received any sort of concessionary modification.
 The results indicate that there are significant impediments to
 renegotiation of residential mortgages beyond securitization. As such,
 less renegotiation seems unlikely to be a major cost of securitization of
 residential mortgages.  The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title:   Repetition, Reputation, and Raiding.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 685-708
Issue: 4
Volume: 5
Year: 1992
Abstract:
  I develop a multitarget takeover model with bid revisions, in which
 bidders desire a reputation for having low valuations. Such a reputation
 increases the likelihood that future targets will accept low premium bids.
 Bidders develop reputation by using low take-it-or-leave-it offers.
 Consequently, tender premiums bid revision rates, and success rates are
 lower for continuing bidders than for those considering only a single
 target. Success rates vary within a series, and reputation building is
 more likely with highly correlated target valuations. I provide an
 exploratory empirical analysis consistent with lower premiums from
 continuing bidders and discuss some resulting implications regarding
 "raiders," conglomerates, and resistance strategies.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: CDS Auctions 
Abstract:
 We analyze auctions for the settlement of credit default swaps (CDS)
 theoretically and evaluate them empirically. The requirement to settle in
 cash with an option to settle physically leads to an unusual two-stage
 process. In the first stage, participants affect the amount of the bonds
 to be auctioned off in the second stage. Participants in the second stage
 may hold positions in derivatives on the assets being auctioned. We show
 that the final auction price might be either above or below the fair bond
 price because of strategic bidding on the part of participants holding
 CDS. Empirically, we observe both types of outcomes, with undervaluation
 occurring in most cases. We find that auctions undervalue bonds by an
 average of 6% on the auction day. Undervaluation is related positively to
 the amount of bonds exchanged in the second stage of the auction, as
 predicted by the theory. We suggest modifications of the settlement
 procedure to minimize the underpricing.  The Author 2012. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: The Geography of Hedge Funds 
Abstract:
 This article analyzes the relationship between the risk-adjusted
 performance of hedge funds and their proximity to investments using data
 on Asia-focused hedge funds. I find, relative to an augmented Fung and
 Hsieh (2004) factor model, that hedge funds with a physical presence (head
 or research office) in their investment region outperform other hedge
 funds by 3.72% per year. The local information advantage is pervasive
 across all major geographical regions, but is strongest for emerging
 market funds and funds holding illiquid securities. These results are
 robust to adjustments for fund fees, serial correlation, backfill bias,
 and incubation bias. I show also that distant funds, especially those
 based in the United States and the United Kingdom, are able to raise more
 capital, charge higher fees, and set longer redemption periods, despite
 their underperformance relative to nearby funds. It appears that distant
 funds trade investment performance for better access to capital.  The Author 2009. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 619-64
Issue: 2
Volume: 9
Year: 1996
Abstract:
  This article analyzes intraday patterns for U.K. and U.S. trading of
 British cross-listed stocks. For each market, the intraday patterns for
 these stocks closely resemble those of otherwise similar, non-cross-listed
 stocks. There is a 2-hour period each day when cross-listed stocks are
 traded both in New York and in London. This overlap is characterized by
 concentrated trading as private information, originating in New York, gets
 incorporated into prices in both markets. Cross-border competition for
 order flow tends to reduce already declining spreads in London. By
 contrast, New York specialists maintain high spreads during the overlap.
 Overall, the evidence indicates that order flow for cross-listed
 securities is segmented.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

  In this article, we study a well-known real option: the opening and

 decision whether to shut a mine is related to firm-specific managerial

Title: Are the Fama and French Factors Global or Country Specific? 
Abstract:
  This article examines whether country-specific or global versions of Fama
 and French's three-factor model better explain time-series variation in
 international stock returns. Regressions for portfolios and individual
 stocks indicate that domestic factor models explain much more time-series
 variation in returns and generally have lower pricing errors than the
 world factor model. In addition, decomposing the world factors into
 domestic and foreign components demonstrates that the addition of foreign
 factors to domestic models leads to less accurate in-sample and
 out-of-sample pricing. Practical applications of the three-factor model,
 such as cost of capital calculations and performance evaluations, are best
 performed on a country-specific basis.   Copyright 2002, Oxford University Press.

Year: 1996
Abstract:
  Mortgage originators offer borrowers various combinations of
 "points"--loan fees--and coupon: high points and low coupon or low points
 and high coupon. In this article points are interpreted as a device
 serving to separate borrowers with high prepayment probabilities from
 those with low prepayment probabilities. Borrowers and lenders are treated
 symmetrically: both are risk neutral and both have complete and
 frictionless access to credit markets (implying that borrowers can finance
 points if they wish), except that borrowers' prepayment speeds are private
 knowledge. Equilibria are derived, both when borrowers cannot prepay
 voluntarily and when they can.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Mutual Fund Fees Around the World 
Abstract:
 Using a new database, we study fees charged by 46,580 mutual fund classes
 offered for sale in 18 countries, which account for about 86% of the world
 fund industry in 2002. We examine management fees, total expense ratios,
 and total shareholder costs (including load charges). Fees vary
 substantially across funds and from country to country. To explain these
 differences, we consider fund, sponsor, and national characteristics. Fees
 differ by investment objectives: larger funds and fund complexes charge
 lower fees; fees are higher for funds distributed in more countries and
 funds domiciled in certain offshore locations (especially when selling
 into countries levying higher taxes). Substantial cross-country
 differences persist even after controlling for these variables. These
 remaining differences can be explained by a variety of factors, the most
 robust of which is that fund fees are lower in countries with stronger
 investor protection.  The Author 2008. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org, Oxford University Press.

Title: The Long-Term Performance of Corporate Bonds (and Stocks) Following Seasoned Equity Offerings 
Abstract:
  Previous studies document negative long-term abnormal stock returns
 following seasoned equity offering (SEO) issuances and conclude that
 markets are inefficient. Other studies, however, argue that these results
 are a manifestation of risk mismeasurement (i.e., the bad-model problem),
 not market inefficiency. We test the efficient market hypothesis (EMH) and
 avoid the bad-model problem by examining the long-term performance of our
 sample firms' bonds and stocks following their SEOs. Our results are
 inconsistent with the EMH. We also provide evidence that SEOs transfer
 wealth from shareholders to bondholders because SEOs reduce default risk.   Copyright 2002, Oxford University Press.

Title: Who Monitors the Monitor? The Effect of Board Independence on Executive Compensation and Firm Value 
Abstract:
 Recent corporate governance reforms focus on the board's independence and
 encourage equity ownership by directors. We analyze the efficacy of these
 reforms in a model in which both adverse selection and moral hazard exist
 at the level of the firm's management. Delegating governance to the board
 improves monitoring but creates another agency problem because directors
 themselves avoid effort and are dependent on the CEO. We show that as
 directors become less dependent on the CEO, their monitoring efficiency
 may decrease even as they improve the incentive efficiency of executive
 compensation contracts. Therefore, a board composed of directors that are
 more independent may actually perform worse. Moreover, higher equity
 incentives for the board may increase equity-based compensation awards to
 management.  The Author 2008. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title:   Data-Snooping Biases in Tests of Financial Asset Pricing Models.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 431-67
Issue: 3
Volume: 3
Year: 1990
Abstract:
  Tests of financial asset pricing models may yield misleading inferences
 when properties of the data are used to construct the test statistics. In
 particular, such tests are often based on returns to portfolios of common
 stock, where portfolios are constructed by sorting on some empirically
 motivated characteristic of the securities such as market value of equity.
 Analytical calculations, Monte Carlo simulations, and two empirical
 examples show that the effects of this type of data snooping can be
 substantial.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title:   Splitting Orders.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 69-101
Issue: 1
Volume: 10
Year: 1997
Abstract:
  A standard presumption of market microstructure models is that
 competition between risk-neutral market makers inevitably leads to price
 schedules that leave market makers zero expected profits conditional on
 the order flow. This article documents an important lack of robustness of
 this zero-profit result. In particular, we show that if traders can split
 orders between market makers, then market makers set less-competitive
 price schedules that earn them strictly positive profits and hence raise
 trading costs. Thus, this article can explain why somebody might willingly
 make a market for a stock when there are fixed costs to doing so. The
 analysis extends to a limit order book, which by its nature is split
 against incoming market orders: equilibrium limit order schedules
 necessarily yield those agents positive expected profits.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Do Investors Learn from Experience? Evidence from Frequent IPO Investors 
Abstract:
 We examine how experience affects the decisions of individual investors
 and institutions in IPO auctions to bid in subsequent auctions, and their
 bidding returns. We track bidding histories for all 31,476 individual
 investors and 1,232 institutional investors across all 84 IPO auctions
 during the period from 1995 to 2000 in Taiwan. For individual bidders, (1)
 high returns in previous IPO auctions increase the likelihood of
 participating in future auctions; (2) bidders' returns decrease as they
 participate in more auctions; (3) auction selection ability deteriorates
 with experience; and (4) those with greater experience bid more
 aggressively. These findings are consistent with naïve reinforcement
 learning wherein individuals become unduly optimistic after receiving good
 returns. In sharp contrast, there is little sign that institutional
 investors exhibit such behavior.  The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title:   Valuing American Options by Simulation: A Simple Least-Squares Approach.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 113-47
Issue: 1
Volume: 14
Year: 2001
Abstract:
  This article presents a simple yet powerful new approach for
 approximating the value of American options by simulation. The key to this
 approach is the use of least squares to estimate the conditional expected
 payoff to the optionholder from continuation. This makes this approach
 readily applicable in path-dependent and multifactor situations where
 traditional finite difference techniques cannot be used. We illustrate
 this technique with several realistic examples including valuing an option
 when the underlying asset follows a jump-diffusion process and valuing an
 American swaption in a 20-factor string model of the term structure.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Heterogeneous Expectations and Bond Markets 
Abstract:
 This paper presents a dynamic equilibrium model of bond markets in which
 two groups of agents hold heterogeneous expectations about future economic
 conditions. The heterogeneous expectations cause agents to take on
 speculative positions against each other and therefore generate endogenous
 relative wealth fluctuation. The relative wealth fluctuation amplifies
 asset price volatility and contributes to the time variation in bond
 premia. Our model shows that a modest amount of heterogeneous expectations
 can help explain several puzzling phenomena, including the "excessive
 volatility" of bond yields, the failure of the expectations hypothesis,
 and the ability of a tent-shaped linear combination of forward rates to
 predict bond returns.  The Author 2009. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org, Oxford University Press.

Title: Asset Prices and Exchange Rates 
Abstract:
 We study the implications of introducing demand shocks and trade in goods
 into an otherwise standard international asset pricing model. Trade in
 goods gives rise to an additional channel of international
 propagation&#x2014;through the terms of trade&#x2014;absent in traditional
 single-good models. The inclusion of demand shocks helps overturn many
 unrealistic implications of existing international finance models in which
 productivity shocks are the sole source of uncertainty. Our model
 generates a rich set of implications on how stock, bond, and foreign
 exchange markets co-move. We solve the model in closed-form, which yields
 a system of equations that can be readily estimated empirically. Our
 estimation validates the main predictions of the theory.  , Oxford University Press.

Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 609-29
Issue: 3
Volume: 7
Year: 1994
Abstract:
  Prior analyses of prices of the NYSE and other exchanges find that
 transitory price volatility is greater at the open of trading than at the
 close. We extend this line of research by using 40 years of hourly Dow
 Jones 65 Composite price index data to estimate transitory volatility
 throughout the trading day. Our results indicate that transitory
 volatility steadily declines during the trading day. We find a similar
 intraday decline in transitory volatility for a 2 1/2-year sample of the
 individual firms in the Dow Jones 30 Industrials Index. The results are
 consistent with the hypothesis that trading aids price formation and do
 not support the argument that particular trading mechanisms are the source
 of greater volatility at the open of trading.	 Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title:   On Portfolio Optimization: Forecasting Covariances and Choosing the Risk Model.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 937-74
Issue: 5
Volume: 12
Year: 1999
Abstract:
  We evaluate the performance of models for the covariance structure of
 stock returns, focusing on their use for optimal portfolio selection. We
 compare the models' forecasts of future covariances and the optimized
 portfolios' out-of-sample performance. A few factors capture the general
 covariance structure. Portfolio optimization helps for risk control, and a
 three-factor model is adequate for selecting the minimum-variance
 portfolio. Under a tracking error volatility criterion, which is widely
 used in practice, larger differences emerge across the models. In general
 more factors are necessary when the objective is to minimize tracking
 error volatility.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Governance Mechanisms and Bond Prices 
Abstract:
 We investigate the effects of shareholder governance mechanisms on
 bondholders and document two new findings. First, the impact of
 shareholder control (proxied by large institutional blockholders) on
 credit risk depends on takeover vulnerability. Shareholder control is
 associated with higher (lower) yields if the firm is exposed to (protected
 from) takeovers. In the presence of shareholder control, the difference in
 bond yields due to differences in takeover vulnerability can be as high as
 66 basis points. Second, event risk covenants reduce the credit risk
 associated with strong shareholder governance. Therefore, without bond
 covenants, shareholder governance, and bondholder interests diverge.  , Oxford University Press.

Title: Contractual Resolutions of Financial Distress 
Abstract:
 In a financial contracting model, we study the optimal debt structure to
 resolve financial distress. We show that a debt structure where two
 distinct debt classes coexist--one class fully concentrated and with
 control rights upon default, the other dispersed and without control
 rights--removes the controlling creditor's liquidation bias when investor
 protection is strong. These results rationalize the use and the
 performance of floating charge financing, which refers to debt financing
 where the controlling creditor takes the entire business as collateral, in
 countries with strong investor protection. Our theory predicts that the
 efficiency of contractual resolutions of financial distress should
 increase with investor protection.  The Author 2012. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: Universal Banks and Corporate Control: Evidence from the Global Syndicated Loan Market 
Abstract:
 We investigate the effects of bank control over borrower firms whether by
 representation on boards of directors or by the holding of shares through
 bank asset management divisions. Using a large sample of syndicated loans,
 we find that banks are more likely to act as lead arrangers in loans when
 they exert some control over the borrower firm. Bank-firm governance links
 are associated with higher loan spreads during the 2003--2006 credit boom
 but lower spreads during the 2007--2008 financial crisis. Additionally,
 these links mitigate credit rationing effects during the crisis. The
 results are robust to several methods to correct for the endogeneity of
 the bank-firm governance link. Our evidence, consistent with intertemporal
 smoothing of loan rates, suggests that there are costs and benefits from
 banks' involvement in firm governance.  The Author 2012. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: Wealth, Information Acquisition, and Portfolio Choice 
Abstract:
  I solve (with an approximation) a Grossman-Stiglitz economy under general
 preferences, thus allowing for wealth effects. Because information
 generates increasing returns, decreasing absolute risk aversion, in
 conjunction with the availability of costly information, is sufficient to
 explain why wealthier households invest a larger fraction of their wealth
 in risky assets. One no longer needs to resort to decreasing relative risk
 aversion, an empirically questionable assumption. Furthermore, I show how
 to distinguish empirically between these two explanations. Finally, I find
 that the availability of costly information exacerbates wealth
 inequalities.   Copyright 2004, Oxford University Press.

Title: Does Motivation Matter When Assessing Trade Performance? An Analysis of Mutual Funds 
Abstract:
  We relate the performance of mutual fund trades to their motivation. A
 fund manager who buys stocks when there are heavy investor outflows is
 likely to be motivated by the belief that the stocks are significantly
 undervalued. In contrast, when there are heavy inflows, the manager is
 likely to be motivated to work off excess liquidity by buying stocks. Our
 analysis reveals that managers making purely valuation-motivated purchases
 substantially beat the market but are unable to do so when compelled to
 invest excess cash from investor inflows. A similar, but weaker, pattern
 is found for stocks that are sold. (JEL G11, G29)   Copyright 2007, Oxford University Press.

Title:   The Role of Investment Banks in Acquisitions.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies

Issue: 3
Volume: 9
Year: 1996
Abstract:
  We compare acquisitions completed with and without investment bank advice
 over the 1981 to 1992 period. We find that the choice to use an investment
 bank depends on the complexity of the transaction, the type of transaction
 (takeovers versus acquisitions of assets), the acquiror's prior
 acquisition experience, and the degree of diversification of the target
 firm. Although acquisition announcement returns are lower for firms using
 investment banks, this difference can be explained by differences in
 transaction characteristics. These results suggest that transaction costs
 are the main determinant of investment banking choice, followed by
 contracting costs and asymmetric information costs.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Volume: 14
Year: 2001
Abstract:
  Bakshi and Chen (1996) suggest that the spirit of capitalism affects
 stock prices by increasing society's aversion to risk. In this article, I
 show that the way in which the spirit of capitalism impinges upon asset
 prices depends on the interaction of impatience, willingness to substitute
 over time, and ordinal preferences between consumption and status, in
 addition to risk aversion. I develop a general model that charts the
 channels through which the spirit of capitalism affects asset prices. An
 increase in the capitalist spirit may increase or decrease risk aversion,
 and may actually decrease the prices of risky assets.	 Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Volume: 4
Year: 1991
Abstract:
  A simple classical Walrasian framework is proposed for the study of
 manipulation among asymmetrically informed risk-averse traders in
 financial markets, and it is used to analyze the occurrence of a market
 breakdown in the trading system.  Such a phenomenon occurs when the
 outsiders refuse to trade with the insiders because the informational
 motive for trade of the insider outweighs her hedging motive. We
 demonstrate the robustness of our results by proving that the market
 collapse condition extends not only to the linear strategy function, but
 to the whole class of feasible nonlinear strategy function, but to the
 whole class of feasible nonlinear strategy functions. Implications for
 insider-trading regulation are sketched.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

  A simple time-series market microstructure model is constructed within

 occur. The empirical results support the presence of a large order
 processing component and smaller, albeit significant, adverse selection
 and inventory components The spread components differ significantly
 according to trade size and are also sensitive to assumptions about the
 relation between orders and trades.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: On Mutual Fund Investment Styles 
Abstract:
  Most mutual funds adopt investment styles that cluster around a broad
 market benchmark. Few funds take extreme positions away from the index,
 but those who do are more likely to favor growth stocks and past winners.
 The bias toward glamour and the tendency of poorly performing value funds
 to shift styles may reflect agency and behavioral considerations. After
 adjusting for style, there is evidence that growth managers on average
 outperform value managers. Though a fund's factor loadings and its
 portfolio characteristics generally yield similar conclusions about its
 style, an approach using portfolio characteristics predicts fund returns
 better.   Copyright 2002, Oxford University Press.

Title: Managerial Attributes and Executive Compensation 
Abstract:
 We study the role of firm- and manager-specific heterogeneities in
 executive compensation. We decompose the variation in executive
 compensation and find that time-invariant firm and, especially, manager
 fixed effects explain a majority of the variation in executive pay. We
 then show that in many settings, it is important to include fixed effects
 to mitigate potential omitted variable bias. Furthermore, we find that
 compensation fixed effects are significantly correlated with management
 styles (i.e., manager fixed effects in corporate policies). Finally, the
 method used in the article has a number of potential applications in
 financial economics.  The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Abstract:
  This article investigates the interaction between market entry, company

 which firms foreclose is determined not only by differences in
 firm-specific factors, but also by common economic factors, such as the
 interest rate and the market profit volatility. We extend the exit model
 by allowing financially distressed firms to renegotiate their debt
 contracts through a one-off debt exchange offer. We find that firms with
 high bankruptcy costs or with prospects of profit improvement can get
 bigger reductions on their debt repayments. Investigating market entry, we
 find that financial vulnerability of the incumbent induces earlier entry.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Pages: 301-32
Issue: 1
Volume: 9
Year: 1996
Abstract:
  We use a cost of carry model with nonzero transaction costs to motivate
 estimation of a nonlinear dynamic relationship between the S&P 500 futures
 and cash indexes. Discontinuous arbitrage suggests that a threshold error
 correction mechanism may characterize many aspects of the relationship
 between the futures and cash indexes. We use minute-by-minute data on the
 S&P 500 futures and cash indexes. The results indicate that nonlinear
 dynamics are important and related to arbitrage, and suggest that
 arbitrage is associated with more rapid convergence of the basis to the
 cost of carry than would be indicated by a linear model.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Confronting Information Asymmetries: Evidence from Real Estate Markets 
Abstract:
  There are relatively few direct tests of the economic effects of
 asymmetric information because of the difficulty in identifying exogenous
 information measures. We propose a novel exogenous measure of information
 based on the quality of property tax assessments in different regions and
 apply this to the U.S. commercial real estate market. We find strong
 evidence that information considerations are significant. Market
 participants resolve information asymmetries by purchasing nearby
 properties, trading properties with long income histories, and avoiding
 transactions with informed professional brokers. The evidence that the
 choice of financing is used to address information concerns is mixed and
 weak.   Copyright 2004, Oxford University Press.

Title: Powerful CEOs and Their Impact on Corporate Performance 
Abstract:
  Executives can only impact firm outcomes if they have influence over
 crucial decisions. On the basis of this idea, we develop and test the
 hypothesis that firms whose CEOs have more decision-making power should
 experience more variability in performance. Focusing primarily on the
 power the CEO has over the board and other top executives as a consequence
 of his formal position and titles, status as a founder, and status as the
 board's sole insider, we find that stock returns are more variable for
 firms run by powerful CEOs. Our findings suggest that the interaction
 between executive characteristics and organizational variables has
 important consequences for firm performance.   Copyright 2005, Oxford University Press.

Title: Asset Allocation with a High Dimensional Latent Factor Stochastic Volatility Model 
Abstract:
  We investigate the implications of time-varying expected return and
 volatility on asset allocation in a high dimensional setting. We propose a
 dynamic factor multivariate stochastic volatility (DFMSV) model that
 allows the first two moments of returns to vary over time for a large
 number of assets. We then evaluate the economic significance of the DFMSV
 model by examining the performance of various dynamic portfolio strategies
 chosen by mean-variance investors in a universe of 36 stocks. We find that
 the DFMSV dynamic strategies significantly outperform various benchmark
 strategies out of sample. This outperformance is robust to different
 performance measures, investor's objective functions, time periods, and
 assets.   Copyright 2006, Oxford University Press.

Title: The Good or the Bad? Which Mutual Fund Managers Join Hedge Funds? 
Abstract:
 Does the mutual fund industry lose its best managers to hedge funds? We
 find that mutual funds are able to retain managers with good performance
 in the face of competition from a growing hedge fund industry. On the
 other hand, poor performers are more likely to leave the mutual fund
 industry. A small fraction of these poor performers find jobs with smaller
 and younger hedge fund companies, especially when the hedge fund industry
 is growing rapidly. Analogously, a small fraction of the better-performing
 mutual fund managers are retained by allowing them to manage a hedge fund
 side-by-side.  The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: Does the Source of Capital Affect Capital Structure? 
Abstract:
  Prior work on leverage implicitly assumes capital availability depends
 solely on firm characteristics. However, market frictions that make
 capital structure relevant may also be associated with a firm's source of
 capital. Examining this intuition, we find firms that have access to the
 public bond markets, as measured by having a debt rating, have
 significantly more leverage. Although firms with a rating are
 fundamentally different, these differences do not explain our findings.
 Even after controlling for firm characteristics that determine observed
 capital structure, and instrumenting for the possible endogeneity of
 having a rating, firms with access have 35% more debt.   Copyright 2006, Oxford University Press.

Title: The Price of a CEO's Rolodex 
Abstract:
 CEOs with large networks earn more than those with small networks. An
 additional connection to an executive or director outside the firm
 increases compensation by about $17,000 on average, more so for
 "important" members, such as CEOs of big firms. Pay-for-connectivity is
 unrelated to several measures of corporate governance, evidence in favor
 of an efficient contracting explanation for CEO pay.  The Author 2012. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: Former CEO Directors: Lingering CEOs or Valuable Resources? 
Abstract:
 We investigate corporate governance experts' claim that it is detrimental
 to a firm to reappoint former CEOs as directors after they step down as
 CEOs. We find that more successful and more powerful former CEOs are more
 likely to be reappointed to the board multiple times after they step down
 as CEOs. Firms benefit, on average, from the presence of former CEOs on
 their boards. Firms with former CEO directors have better accounting
 performance, have higher relative turnover-performance sensitivity of the
 successor CEO, and can rehire their former CEO directors as CEOs after
 extremely poor firm performance under the successor CEOs.  The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title:   Inferring Future Volatility from the Information in Implied Volatility in Eurodollar Options: A New Approach.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 333-67
Issue: 2
Volume: 10
Year: 1997
Abstract:
  We study the information content of implied volatility from several
 volatility specifications of the Heath-Jarrow-Morton (1992) (HJM) models
 relative to popular historical volatility models in the Eurodollar options
 market. The implied volatility from the HJM models explains much of the
 variation of realized interest rate volatility over both daily and monthly
 horizons. The implied volatility dominates the GARCH terms, the Glosten et
 al. (1993) type asymmetric volatility terms, and the interest rate level.
 However, it cannot explain that the impact of interest rate shocks on the
 volatility is lower when interest rates are low than when they are high.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Strategic Ownership Structure and the Cost of Debt 
Abstract:
 We theoretically and empirically address the endogeneity of corporate
 ownership structure and the cost of debt, with a novel emphasis on the
 role of control concentration in post-default firm restructuring. Control
 concentration raises agency costs of debt, and dominant shareholders trade
 off private benefits of control against higher borrowing costs in choosing
 their ownership stakes. Based on our theoretical predictions, and using an
 international sample of syndicated loans and unique dynamic ownership
 structure data, we present new evidence on the firm- and macro-level
 determinants of corporate control concentration and the cost of debt.  The Author 2012. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Year: 1994
Abstract:
  I study the large premium (82 percent) attributed to voting shares on the
 Milan Stock Exchange. The premium varies according to the ownership
 structure and the concentration of the voting rights, and it can be
 rationalized in the presence of enormous private benefits of control. A
 case study seems to indicate that in Italy private benefits of control can
 easily be worth more than 60 percent of the value of nonvoting equity. A
 tentative explanation for these findings is provided.	 Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: The Design of Financial Policies in Corporate Spin-offs 
Abstract:
  We examine differences in financial leverage between parent and spun-off
 firms that emerge from corporate spin-offs. Our tests control for past
 financing choices and the costs of adjusting capital structure, factors
 that can obscure cross-sectional patterns among firms' target leverage
 ratios. We find that firms that emerge from spin-offs with more financial
 leverage have a higher cash flow return on assets, lower variability of
 industry operating income, and a greater proportion of fixed assets. The
 positive relation between profitability and the use of financial leverage,
 in a setting that is free of pecking order effects, is particularly
 important because it contrasts with existing evidence. Our results
 indicate that the ability to cover debt payments and default-related costs
 are important determinants of the use of financial leverage, as implied by
 the trade-off theory of capital structure. We find no evidence that
 managerial incentives or governance characteristics affect the difference
 in leverage ratios in firms that emerge from spin-offs.   Copyright 2003, Oxford University Press.

Title: Large Shareholder Diversification and Corporate Risk-Taking 
Abstract:
 Using new data for the universe of firms covered in Amadeus, we
 reconstruct the portfolios of shareholders who hold equity stakes in
 private- and publicly traded European firms. We find great heterogeneity
 in the degree of portfolio diversification across large shareholders.
 Exploiting this heterogeneity, we document that firms controlled by
 diversified large shareholders undertake riskier investments than firms
 controlled by nondiversified large shareholders. The impact of large
 shareholder diversification on corporate risk-taking is both economically
 and statistically significant. Our results have important implications at
 the policy level because they identify one channel through which policy
 changes can improve economic welfare.  The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: What Segments Equity Markets? 
Abstract:
 We propose a new, valuation-based measure of world equity market
 segmentation. While we observe decreased levels of segmentation in many
 countries, the level of segmentation remains significant in emerging
 markets. We characterize the factors that account for variation in market
 segmentation both through time as well as across countries. Both a
 country's regulation with respect to foreign capital flows and certain
 nonregulatory factors are important. In particular, we identify a
 country's political risk profile and its stock market development as two
 additional local segmentation factors as well as the U.S. corporate credit
 spread as a global segmentation factor.  The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: Corporate Dividend Policies: Lessons from Private Firms 
Abstract:
 We compare the dividend policies of publicly and privately held firms in
 order to help identify the forces shaping corporate dividends, and shed
 light on the behavior of privately held companies. We show that private
 firms smooth dividends significantly less than their public counterparts,
 suggesting that the scrutiny of public capital markets plays a central
 role in the propensity of firms to smooth dividends over time. Public
 firms pay relatively higher dividends that tend to be more sensitive to
 changes in investment opportunities than otherwise similar private firms.
 Ultimately, ownership structure and incentives play key roles in shaping
 dividend policies.  The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: Differences of Opinion, Short-Sales Constraints, and Market Crashes 
Abstract:
  We develop a theory of market crashes based on differences of opinion
 among investors. Because of short-sales constraints, bearish investors do
 not initially participate in the market and their information is not
 revealed in prices. However, if other previously bullish investors bail
 out of the market, the originally bearish group may become the marginal
 "support buyers," and more will be learned about their signals. Thus
 accumulated hidden information comes out during market declines. The model
 explains a variety of stylized facts about crashes and also makes a
 distinctive new prediction--that returns will be more negatively skewed
 conditional on high trading volume.   Copyright 2003, Oxford University Press.

Title:   The Dynamics of the Management-Shareholder Conflict.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 379-404
Issue: 2
Volume: 12
Year: 1999
Abstract:
  This article investigates the distribution of equity ownership between
 entrenched management and dispersed outsiders when management has the
 ability to manipulate the cash flows and when it is costly for equity
 holders to prove managerial wrongdoing in court. Management chooses the
 distribution of equity ownership so as to maximize private benefits
 against the risk of potential control challenges. When shareholders are
 long-term oriented, then outside shares trade at a premium over the value
 to management, and management is inclined to sell off its equity stake to
 dispersed outsiders. When shareholders are short-term oriented, then
 outside shares trade at a discount below their value to management, and
 disciplinary pressure can be substantially reduced via strategic share
 purchases. Changes in the cost of capital drive a wedge between entrenched
 management's and dispersed outsider's valuation of shares. Management
 exercises its option to buy (sell) shares when the option is in the money:
 when management values shares more (less) than outsiders do.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title:   On the Sensitivity of Mean-Variance-Efficient Portfolios to Changes in Asset Means: Some Analytical and Computational Results.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 315-42
Issue: 2
Volume: 4
Year: 1991
Abstract:
  This paper investigates the sensitivity of mean-variance(MV)-efficient
 portfolios to changes in the means of individual assets. When only a
 budget constraint is imposed on the investment problem, the analytical
 results indicate that an MV-efficient portfolio's weights, mean, and
 variance can be extremely sensitive to changes in asset means. When
 nonnegativity constraints are also imposed on the problem, the
 computational results confirm that a positively weighted MV-efficient
 portfolio's weights are extremely sensitive to changes in asset means, but
 the portfolio's returns are not. A surprisingly small increase in the mean
 of just one asset drives half the securities from the portfolio. Yet the
 portfolio's expected return and standard deviation are virtually
 unchanged.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Estimating Standard Errors in Finance Panel Data Sets: Comparing Approaches 
Abstract:
 In corporate finance and asset pricing empirical work, researchers are
 often confronted with panel data. In these data sets, the residuals may be
 correlated across firms or across time, and OLS standard errors can be
 biased. Historically, researchers in the two literatures have used
 different solutions to this problem. This paper examines the different
 methods used in the literature and explains when the different methods
 yield the same (and correct) standard errors and when they diverge. The
 intent is to provide intuition as to why the different approaches
 sometimes give different answers and give researchers guidance for their
 use.  The Author 2008. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org, Oxford University Press.

Title: Financing a Portfolio of Projects 
Abstract:
 This article shows that investors financing a portfolio of projects may
 use the depth of their financial pockets to overcome entrepreneurial
 incentive problems. Competition for scarce informed capital at the
 refinancing stage strengthens investors' bargaining positions. And yet,
 entrepreneurs' incentives may be improved, because projects funded by
 investors with &#x201C;shallow pockets&#x201D; must have not only a
 positive net present value at the refinancing stage, but one that is
 higher than that of competing portfolio projects. Our article may help
 understand provisions used in venture capital finance that limit a
 fund'sinitial capital and make it difficult to add more capital once the
 initial venture capital fund is raised.  , Oxford University Press.

Title: Long-Run Risk and the Persistence of Consumption Shocks 
Abstract:
 We propose a decomposition for time series in components classified by
 levels of persistence. Employing this decomposition, we provide empirical
 evidence that consumption growth contains predictable components highly
 correlated with well-known proxies of consumption variability. These
 components generate a term-structure of sizable risk premia. At low
 frequencies we identify a component correlated with long-run productivity
 growth and commanding a yearly premium of approximately 2%. At high
 frequencies we identify a component with yearly half-life, which
 contributes to the equity premium for another 2%. Accounting for
 persistence heterogeneity, we obtain an estimate of the IES strictly above
 one and robust across subsamples.  The Author 2013. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: Why Do Household Portfolio Shares Rise in Wealth? 
Abstract:
 We develop a life-cycle consumption and portfolio choice model in which
 households have nonhomothetic utility over two types of goods, basic and
 luxury. We calibrate the model to match the cross-sectional and life-cycle
 variation in the basic expenditure share in the Consumer Expenditure
 Survey. The model explains the degree to which the portfolio share in
 risky assets rises in wealth in the cross-section of households in the
 Survey of Consumer Finances. For a given household, the portfolio share
 can fall in response to an increase in wealth, even though the model
 implies decreasing relative risk aversion.  The Author 2010. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title: The Value of Control in Emerging Markets 
Abstract:
 When a developed-country multinational firm acquires majority control of a
 firm in an emerging market, there is an economically large and
 statistically significant increase in the acquiring firm's stock price. In
 1986--2006, developed-market acquirers experienced positive and
 significant abnormal returns of 1.16%, on average, over a three-day event
 window. Positive acquirer returns and dollar value gains appear unique to
 emerging-market mergers and acquisitions and are not replicated when the
 same developed-market acquirers take over firms in developed markets. The
 size of the stock price increase is more pronounced (a) the weaker the
 contracting environment in the emerging market and (b) for industries with
 high asset intangibility.  The Author 2009. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title: Forecasting the Equity Premium: Where We Stand Today 
Abstract:
 The Review of Financial Studies has among its missions the facilitation
 and promotion of a vigorous academic debate across unsettled questions in
 finance. This issue represents a cross section of views regarding one such
 debate: Can ourempirical models accurately forecast the equity premium any
 better than the historical mean? Or, is the forecast our empirical models
 give us any more accurate than what we would get by simply using the
 historical mean?  The Author 2008. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title: The Design of Corporate Debt Structure and Bankruptcy 
Abstract:
 This article integrates the problem of designing corporate bankruptcy
 rules into a theory of optimal debt structure. We show that, in an optimal
 contracting framework with imperfect renegotiation, having multiple
 creditors increases a firm's debt capacity while increasing its incentives
 to default strategically. The optimal debt contract gives creditors claims
 that are jointly inconsistent in case of default. Bankruptcy rules are
 therefore a necessary part of the overall financing contract, to make
 claims consistent and to prevent a value-reducing run for the assets of
 the firm. We characterize these rules, with predictions about the
 allocation of security rights, the right to trigger bankruptcy, and the
 symmetry of treatment of creditors in default.   The Author 2010. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title:   Information Flow and Pricing Errors: A Unified Approach to Estimation and Testing.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 979-1020
Issue: 4
Volume: 14
Year: 2001
Abstract:
  This study examines whether rates of information flow differ between
 trading and nontrading periods, and whether the variances of pricing
 errors differ at the open and close of trading. The approach improves on
 existing methods by allowing for correlation between pricing errors and
 information flow, and by conducting inferences at the individual security
 level. The daytime rate of information flow is about seven times the
 overnight rate, and the variances of pricing errors at the open are not
 different from those at the close of trading. This evidence differs from
 existing results based on return variance ratios.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title:   Estimating the Profits from Trading Strategies.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 1121-63
Issue: 4
Volume: 9
Year: 1996
Abstract:
  Price improvement is the difference between the execution price of an
 order and the quoted bid or ask when the order was submitted. We show that
 expected price improvement falls off dramatically as the size of the order
 approaches the quoted depth, and becomes negative for larger orders. This
 is particularly important for small firms because the quoted depths are
 low. Using quoted spreads and depths and our estimate of expected price
 improvement, we show that trading strategies that attempt to exploit the
 weekly predictability of small-firm returns would be swamped by
 transaction costs.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Volume: 11
Year: 1998
Abstract:
  This article presents a one-tick dynamic model of a limit order market.
 Agents choose to submit a limit order or a market order depending on the
 state of the limit order book. Each trader knows that her order will
 affect the order placement strategies of those who follow and the
 execution probability of her limit order is endogenous. All traders take
 this into account which, in equilibrium, generates systematic patterns in
 transaction prices and order placement strategies even with no asymmetric
 information.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Corporate Real Estate Holdings and the Cross-Section of Stock Returns 
Abstract:
 This article explores the link between the composition of firms' capital
 and stock returns. I develop a general equilibrium production economy
 where firms use two factors: real estate and other capital. Investment is
 subject to asymmetric adjustment costs. Because real estate depreciates
 slowly, firms with high real estate holdings are more vulnerable to bad
 productivity shocks and hence are riskier and have higher expected
 returns. This prediction is supported empirically. I find that the returns
 of firms with a high share of real estate capital exceed that of low real
 estate firms by 3--6% annually, adjusted for exposures to the market
 return, size, value, and momentum factors. Moreover, conditional beta
 estimates reveal that these firms indeed have higher market betas, and the
 spread between the betas of high and low real estate firms is
 countercyclical.  The Author 2010. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title: Pay (Be)for(e) Performance: The Signing Bonus as an Incentive Device 
Abstract:
 The signing bonus is one of the most common elements of compensation
 packages for white-collar employees but has received little theoretical
 and empirical attention. This article investigates the use of a signing
 bonus as a tool for firms to signal to prospective employees: when they
 are uncertain regarding their fit with the firm, the signing bonus can
 serve as a credible signal of the firm's belief of said fit. The theory
 suggests that we should expect signing bonuses to be more common and
 larger when the economy is stronger, when employees are less certain of
 how well they will fit at the firm, when the quality of fit (known to the
 firm) is higher, and when performance pay is present. Employees receiving
 a signing bonus work harder, so the signing bonus also serves as an
 incentive device. This article also presents the first broad empirical
 look at the use of the signing bonus across industries and time. Evidence
 is consistent with the theory.  The Author 2010. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title:   How Do Firms Choose Their Lenders? An Empirical Investigation.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 155-89
Issue: 1
Volume: 13
Year: 2000
Abstract:
  This article investigates which companies finance themselves through
 intermediaries and which borrow directly from arm's length investors. Our
 empirical results show that large companies with abundant cash and
 collateral tap credit markets directly; these markets cater to safe and
 profitable industries, and are most active when riskless rates or
 intermediary earnings are low. We show that determinants of lender
 selection sharpen during investment downturns and that there are
 substantial asymmetries in the way firms enter and exit capital markets.
 These results support a theoretical framework where intermediaries have
 better reorganizational skills but a higher opportunity cost of capital
 than bondholders.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: The Choice of Corporate Liquidity and Corporate Governance 
Abstract:
 In this paper, I study how corporate governance influences firms' choices
 between cash and lines of credit. Stakeholders may disagree about firms'
 liquidity choices because they differ in the allocation of ex-post control
 rights for the firms' liquidity reserves. Using state-level changes in
 takeover protection as exogenous shocks to corporate governance, I find
 that firms increase cash relative to lines of credit when the threat of
 takeover weakens. Consistent with the theory, this tendency is weaker for
 firms with good internal governance. Overall, my findings suggest the
 choice of corporate liquidity is a channel through which corporate
 governance works.  The Author 2008. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org, Oxford University Press.

Title: Price Formation and Market Quality When the Number and Presence of Insiders Is Unknown 
Abstract:
  In most models of market microstructure tractability requires that all
 market participants know the number (and presence) of competing insiders.
 I drop this assumption in experimental asset markets. Outcomes are
 qualitatively consistent with theoretical models when the number of
 insiders is disclosed prior to trade. When it is not, insiders use the
 timing and size of trades interactively to hide from the dealers and each
 other, dealers have difficulty identifying insider trades, and liquidity
 patterns do not differ as a function of the number of insiders. In
 general, insider behavior has strategic dimensions not admitted in Kyle
 (1985) and extensions.   Copyright 2002, Oxford University Press.

Title: Agency and Optimal Investment Dynamics 
Abstract:
  Agency problems limit firms' access to capital markets, curbing
 investment. Firms and investors seek contractual ways to mitigate these
 problems. What are the implications for investment? We present a theory of
 a firm's investment dynamics in the presence of agency problems and
 optimal long-term financial contracts. We derive results relating firms'
 investment decisions, current and past cash flows, firm size, capital
 structure, and dividends. Among the results, optimal investment is
 increasing in current and past cash flow; and optimal investment is
 positively serially correlated over time (after controlling for investment
 opportunities). These results hold for a range of agency problems. (JEL

Title: Open-Loop Equilibria and Perfect Competition in Option Exercise Games 
Abstract:
 The investment boundaries defined by Grenadier (2002) for an oligopoly
 investment game determine equilibria in open-loop strategies. As
 closed-loop strategies, they are not equilibria, because any firm by
 investing sooner can preempt the investments of other firms and
 expropriate the growth options. The perfectly competitive outcome is
 produced by closed-loop strategies that are mutually best responses. In
 this equilibrium, the option to delay investment has zero value, and the
 simple NPV rule is followed by all firms.  The Author 2009. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title: Bank Risk-taking, Securitization, Supervision, and Low Interest Rates: Evidence from the Euro-area and the U.S. Lending Standards 
Abstract:
 Using a unique dataset of the Euro-area and the U.S. bank lending
 standards, we find that low (monetary policy) short-term interest rates
 soften standards for household and corporate loans. This
 softening--especially for mortgages--is amplified by securitization
 activity, weak supervision for bank capital, and low monetary policy rates
 for an extended period. Conversely, low long-term interest rates do not
 soften lending standards. Finally, countries with softer lending standards
 before the crisis related to negative Taylor rule residuals experienced a
 worse economic performance afterward. These results help shed light on the
 origins of the crisis and have important policy implications.  The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: Contracts and Exits in Venture Capital Finance 
Abstract:
 Using a sample of European venture capital (VC) investments, I study the
 relation between VC contracts and exits. The data indicate that ex ante,
 stronger VC control rights increase the likelihood that an entrepreneurial
 firm will exit by an acquisition, rather than through a write-off or an
 IPO. My findings are robust to controls for a variety of factors,
 including endogeneity and cases in which the VC preplans the exit at the
 time of contract choice. My findings are consistent with control-based
 theories of financial contracting, such as Aghion and Bolton (1992).  The Author 2008. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org, Oxford University Press.

Title: Loan Sales and the Cost of Corporate Borrowing 
Abstract:
  When a loan is sold, it goes to a lower-cost financing source than its
 originator. Yet, lending markets are less than perfectly competitive.
 Despite the lower funding cost, therefore, the loan price is not
 necessarily more favorable to the borrower. However, corporate borrowers
 are averse to the participation of their loans to other lenders because of
 the complexity of dealing with multiple banks and the potential
 information costs of the sale announcement. Consequently, I conjecture
 that the borrower extracts a price concession in exchange for allowing the
 bank to sell participations in the loan. Using a hand-matched dataset of
 loans, borrowers, and lenders, I find that the average yield spread on
 loans originated by active loan sellers is about 20 basis points lower
 than the average spread on loans originated by moderate loan sellers.   Copyright 2006, Oxford University Press.

Title:   Corporate Incentives for Hedging and Hedge Accounting.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 743-71
Issue: 3
Volume: 8
Year: 1995
Abstract:
  This article explores the information effect of financial risk
 management. Financial hedging improves the informativeness of corporate
 earnings as a signal of management ability and project quality by
 eliminating extraneous noise. Managerial and shareholder incentives
 regarding information transmission may differ, however, leading to
 conflicts regarding an optimal hedging policy. We show that these
 incentives depend on the accounting information made available by the
 firm. Under some circumstances, if hedge transactions are not disclosed
 (i.e., firms report only aggregate earnings), managers hedge to achieve
 greater risk reduction than they would if full disclosure were required.
 In these cases, it is optimal for shareholders to request only aggregate
 accounting reports.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: When Does Extra Risk Strictly Increase an Option's Value? 
Abstract:
 It is well known that risk increases the value of options. This article
 makes that precise in a new way. The conventional theorem says that the
 value of an option does not fall if the underlying asset becomes riskier
 in the conventional sense of the mean-preserving spread. This article uses
 two new definitions of 'riskier' to show that the value of an option
 strictly increases (i) if the underlying asset becomes 'pointwise
 riskier,' and (ii) only if the underlying asset becomes 'extremum
 riskier.'  , Oxford University Press.

Title: What Do Independent Directors Know? Evidence from Their Trading 
Abstract:
 We compare the trading performance of independent directors and other
 executives. The findings reveal that independent directors earn positive
 substantial abnormal returns when they purchase their company stock, and
 that the difference from the same firm's executives is relatively small at
 most horizons. We also find that executives and independent directors make
 higher returns in firms with the weakest governance, the gap between these
 two widens in such firms, and that independent directors sitting on the
 audit committee earn higher returns than other independent directors at
 the same firm. Independent directors also earn significantly abnormal
 returns when they sell the company stock in a window before bad news and
 around earnings restatements.  The Author 2009. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Abstract:
 We develop an agency model of financial contracting. We derive long-term
 debt, a line of credit, and equity as optimal securities, capturing the
 debt coupon and maturity; the interest rate and limits on the credit line;
 inside versus outside equity; dividend policy; and capital structure
 dynamics. The optimal debt-equity ratio is history dependent, but debt and
 credit line terms are independent of the amount financed and, in some
 cases, the severity of the agency problem. In our model, the agent can
 divert cash flows; we also consider settings in which the agent undertakes
 hidden effort, or can control cash flow risk.  , Oxford University Press.

Title: The Performance of Private Equity Funds 
Abstract:
 The performance of private equity funds as reported by industry
 associations and previous research is overstated. A large part of
 performance is driven by inflated accounting valuation of ongoing
 investments and we find a bias toward better performing funds in the data.
 We find an average net-of-fees fund performance of 3% per year below that
 of the S&P 500. Adjusting for risk brings the underperformance to 6% per
 year. We estimate fees to be 6% per year. We discuss several misleading
 aspects of performance reporting and some side benefits as a first step
 toward an explanation.  The Author 2008. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title:   Multivariate Binomial Approximations for Asset Prices with Nonstationary Variance and Covariance Characteristics.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 1125-52
Issue: 4
Volume: 8
Year: 1995
Abstract:
  In this article, we suggest an efficient method of approximating a
 general, multivariate log-normal distribution by a multivariate binomial
 process. There are two important features of such multivariate
 distributions. First, the state variables may have volatilities that
 change over time. Second, the two or more relevant state variables
 involved may covary with each other in a specified manner, with a
 time-varying covariance structure. We discuss the asymptotic properties of
 the resulting processes and show how the methodology can be used to value
 a complex, multiple exercisable option whose payoff depends on the prices
 of two assets.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Liquidity and Expected Returns: Lessons from Emerging Markets 
Abstract:
 Given the cross-sectional and temporal variation in their liquidity,
 emerging equity markets provide an ideal setting to examine the impact of
 liquidity on expected returns. Our main liquidity measure is a
 transformation of the proportion of zero daily firm returns, averaged over
 the month. We find that it significantly predicts future returns, whereas
 alternative measures such as turnover do not. Consistent with liquidity
 being a priced factor, unexpected liquidity shocks are positively
 correlated with contemporaneous return shocks and negatively correlated
 with shocks to the dividend yield. We consider a simple asset-pricing
 model with liquidity and the market portfolio as risk factors and
 transaction costs that are proportional to liquidity. The model
 differentiates between integrated and segmented countries and time
 periods. Our results suggest that local market liquidity is an important
 driver of expected returns in emerging markets, and that the
 liberalization process has not fully eliminated its impact.  , Oxford University Press.

Title: IPO Underpricing and After-Market Liquidity 
Abstract:
  The underpricing of initial public offerings (IPOs) is generally
 explained with asymmetric information and risk. We complement these
 traditional explanations with a new theory where investors worry also
 about the after-market illiquidity that may result from asymmetric
 information after the IPO. The less liquid the aftermarket is expected to
 be, and the less predictable its liquidity, the larger will be the IPO
 underpricing. Our model blends such liquidity concerns with adverse
 selection and risk as motives for underpricing. The model's predictions
 are supported by evidence for 337 British IPOs effected between 1998 and
 2000. Using various measures of liquidity, we find that expected
 after-market liquidity and liquidity risk are important determinants of
 IPO underpricing.   Copyright 2006, Oxford University Press.

Title: Hedge Funds as Investors of Last Resort? 
Abstract:
 Hedge funds have become important investors in public companies raising
 equity privately. Hedge funds tend to finance companies that have poor
 fundamentals and pronounced information asymmetries. To compensate for
 these shortcomings, hedge funds protect themselves by requiring
 substantial discounts, negotiating repricing rights, and entering into
 short positions of the underlying stocks. We find that companies that
 obtain financing from hedge funds significantly underperform companies
 that obtain financing from other investors during the following two years.
 We argue that hedge funds are investors of last resort and provide funding
 for companies that are otherwise constrained from raising equity capital.  The Author 2006. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title: Predicting Excess Stock Returns Out of Sample: Can Anything Beat the Historical Average? 
Abstract:
 Goyal and Welch (2007) argue that the historical average excess stock
 return forecasts future excess stock returns better than regressions of
 excess returns on predictor variables. In this article, we show that many
 predictive regressions beat the historical average return, once weak
 restrictions are imposed on the signs of coefficients and return
 forecasts. The out-of-sample explanatory power is small, but nonetheless
 is economically meaningful for mean-variance investors. Even better
 results can be obtained by imposing the restrictions of steady-state
 valuation models, thereby removing the need to estimate the average from a
 short sample of volatile stock returns.  The Author 2007. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org, Oxford University Press.

Title: Managerial Agency and Bond Covenants 
Abstract:
 Based on an analysis of the agency risk for bondholders from managerial
 entrenchment and fraud, we derive and test refutable hypotheses about the
 influence of managerial agency risk on bond covenants, using a
 comprehensive database of corporate bonds from the 1993--2007 period.
 Managerial entrenchment and the risk of managerial fraud significantly
 influence the use of covenants, in the direction predicted by the
 agency-theoretic framework. Our analysis highlights the varied effects of
 entrenchment on different types of agency risks faced by bondholders:
 Entrenched managers aggravate investment risk, but ameliorate risk from
 shareholder opportunism. Covenant use also responds efficiently to the
 quality of information available regarding the risk of managerial fraud.  The Author 2009. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org, Oxford University Press.

Title:   When Are Contrarian Profits Due to Stock Market Overreaction?
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 175-205
Issue: 2
Volume: 3
Year: 1990
Abstract:
  If returns on some stocks systematically lead or lag those of others, a
 portfolio strategy that sells "winners" and buys "losers" can produce
 positive expected returns, even if no stock's returns are negatively
 autocorrelated as virtually all models of overreaction imply. Using a
 particular contrarian strategy, the authors show that, despite negative
 autocorrelation in individual stock returns, weekly portfolio returns are
 strongly positively autocorrelated and are the result of important
 cross-autocorrelations. The authors find that the returns of large stocks
 lead those of smaller stocks, and present evidence against overreaction as
 the only source of contrarian profits.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Testing Trade-Off and Pecking Order Predictions About Dividends and Debt 
Abstract:
  Confirming predictions shared by the trade-off and pecking order models,
 more profitable firms and firms with fewer investments have higher
 dividend payouts. Confirming the pecking order model but contradicting the
 trade-off model, more profitable firms are less levered. Firms with more
 investments have less market leverage, which is consistent with the
 trade-off model and a complex pecking order model. Firms with more
 investments have lower long-term dividend payouts, but dividends do not
 vary to accommodate short-term variation in investment. As the pecking
 order model predicts, short-term variation in [oplus ]investment and
 earnings is mostly absorbed by debt.   Copyright 2002, Oxford University Press.

Title:   Survivorship Bias and Mutual Fund Performance.

Pages: 1097-1120
Issue: 4
Volume: 9
Year: 1996
Abstract:
  Mutual fund attrition can create problems for a researcher because funds
 that disappear tend to do so due to poor performance. In this article we
 estimate the size of the bias by tracking all funds that existed at the
 end of 1976. When a fund merges we calculate the return, taking into
 account the merger terms. This allows a precise estimate of survivorship
 bias. In addition, we examine characteristics of both mutual funds that
 merge and their partner funds. Estimates of survivorship bias over
 different horizons and using different models to evaluate performance are
 provided.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title:   Liquidity Provision with Limit Orders and a Strategic Specialist.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 103-50
Issue: 1
Volume: 10
Year: 1997
Abstract:
  This article presents a microstructure model of liquidity provision in
 which a specialist with market power competes against a competitive limit
 order book. General solutions, comparative statics and examples are
 provided first with uninformative orders and then when order flows are
 informative. The model is also used to address two optimal market design
 issues. The first is the effect of "tick" size--for example, eighths
 versus decimal pricing--on market liquidity. Institutions trading large
 blocks have a larger optimal tick size than small retail investors, but
 both prefer a tick size strictly greater than zero. Second, a hybrid
 specialist/limit order market (like the NYSE) provides better liquidity to
 small retail and institutional trades, but a pure limit order market (like
 the Paris Bourse) may offer better liquidity on mid-size orders.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Strategic Flexibility and the Optimality of Pay for Sector Performance 
Abstract:
 While standard contract theory suggests that a Chief Executive Officer
 (CEO) should be paid relative to a benchmark that removes the effects of
 sector performance, there is evidence that CEO pay is strongly and
 positively related to such sector performance. In this article, we offer
 an explanation. We model a CEO charged with selecting the firm's strategy
 that determines the firm's exposure to sector performance. To incentivize
 the CEO to choose optimally, pay contracts will be positively and
 sometimes asymmetrically related to sector performance. Consistent with
 our predictions, the empirical analysis indicates that the observed
 sensitivity of pay to sector performance is almost fully confined to
 multisegment firms and is greater in firms that offer greater strategic
 flexibility to alter sector exposure, for more talented CEOs and for CEOs
 as compared to their subordinate executives. Our evidence is robust to
 alternate explanations such as CEO entrenchment.  The Author 2010. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title:   Assessing the Quality of a Security Market: A New Approach to Transaction-Cost Measurement.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 191-212
Issue: 1
Volume: 6
Year: 1993
Abstract:
  I discuss a new method for measuring the deviations between actual
 transaction prices and implicit efficient prices. The approach decomposes
 security transaction prices into random-walk and stationary components.
 The random-walk component may be identified with the efficient price. The
 stationary component, the difference between the efficient price and the
 actual transaction price, is termed the pricing error. Its dispersion is a
 natural measure of market quality. I describe practical strategies for
 estimating these quantities. For a sample of NYSE stocks, the average
 pricing error standard deviation estimate is roughly 0.33 percent of the
 stock price. If the pricing error is normally distributed.and if it is
 always a positive cost incurred by the transaction cost for these traders
 is 0.26 percent of the stock price. The dispersion of the pricing error is
 also found to be elevated at the beginning and end of the trading session.

Abstract:
  It is generally agreed that speculators can make profits from insider

 stock-price manipulation have now been made illegal. In this article, the
 authors ask whether it is possible to make profits from a different kind
 of manipulation, in which an uninformed speculator simply buys and sells
 shares. They show that in a rational expectations framework, where all
 agents maximize expected utility, it is possible for an uninformed
 manipulator to make a profit, provided investors attach a positive
 probability to the manipulator being an informed trader.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Do Investors Buy What They Know? Product Market Choices and Investment Decisions 
Abstract:
 This article shows that individuals' product market choices influence
 their investment decisions. Using microdata from the brokerage and
 automotive industries, we find a strong positive relation between customer
 relationship, ownership of a company, and size of the ownership stake.
 Investors are also more likely to purchase and less likely to sell shares
 of companies they frequent as customers. These effects are stronger for
 individuals with longer customer relationships. A merger-based natural
 experiment supports a causal interpretation of our results. We also find
 evidence of causality in the other direction: inheritances and gifts have
 an effect on individuals' patronage decisions. A setup in which
 customer-investors regard stocks as consumption goods, not just as
 investments, seems to best explain our results. (JEL G11, G24, D83)  The Author 2012. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: The Emergence and Persistence of the Anglo-Saxon and German Financial Systems 
Abstract:
  We use a moral hazard model to compare monitored (nontraded) bank loans
 and traded (nonmonitored) bonds as sources of external funds for industry.
 We contrast the theoretical conditions that favor each system with the
 historical conditions prevailing when these financial systems evolved
 during the British and German industrial revolutions. To study
 persistence, we consider an entry model where financiers take the
 industrial structure as given when they lend and firms take the financial
 system as given when they borrow. We show multiple equilibria can exist,
 compare equilibria in welfare terms, and discuss their robustness to
 coordination between lenders and borrowers.   Copyright 2004, Oxford University Press.

Year: 1997
Abstract:
  We analyze the ability of various market mechanisms to provide liquidity
 for large equity trades. Using data on 21,077 block transactions in Dow
 Jones stocks, we find that the "down-stairs" NYSE floor market is a
 significant source of liquidity. Although negotiation in the informal
 "upstairs" market provides better execution than the downstairs market for
 large trades, these differences are economically small. We find, however,
 that upstairs markets are used by traders who can credibly signal that
 their trades are liquidity motivated. Thus, upstairs markets allow trades
 that may not otherwise occur.	 Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: When Shareholders Are Creditors: Effects of the Simultaneous Holding of Equity and Debt by Non-commercial Banking Institutions 
Abstract:
 This article provides a comprehensive analysis of a new and increasingly
 important phenomenon: the simultaneous holding of both equity and debt
 claims of the same company by non-commercial banking institutions ("dual
 holders"). The presence of dual holders offers a unique opportunity to
 assess the existence and magnitude of shareholder-creditor conflicts. We
 find that syndicated loans with dual holder participation have loan yield
 spreads that are 18--32 bps lower than those without. The difference
 remains economically significant after controlling for the selection
 effect. Further investigation of dual holders' investment horizons and
 changes in borrowers' credit quality lends support to the hypothesis that
 incentive alignment between shareholders and creditors plays an important
 role in lowering loan yield spreads.  The Author 2010. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title: Empire-Building or Bridge-Building? Evidence from New CEOs' Internal Capital Allocation Decisions 
Abstract:
 This article investigates how the job histories of CEOs influence their
 capital allocation decisions when they preside over multidivisional firms.
 I find that, after CEO turnover, divisions not previously affiliated with
 the new CEO receive significantly more capital expenditures than divisions
 through which the new CEO has advanced. The pattern of reverse-favoritism
 in capital allocation is more pronounced if the new CEO has less authority
 or if the unaffiliated divisions have more bargaining power. I find
 evidence that having a specialist CEO negatively affects segment
 investment efficiency. The results suggest that new specialist CEOs use
 the capital budget as a bridge-building tool to elicit cooperation from
 powerful divisional managers in previously unaffiliated divisions.  The Author 2009. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title: Expected Stock Returns and Variance Risk Premia 
Abstract:
 Motivated by the implications from a stylized self-contained general
 equilibrium model incorporating the effects of time-varying economic
 uncertainty, we show that the difference between implied and realized
 variation, or the variance risk premium, is able to explain a nontrivial
 fraction of the time-series variation in post-1990 aggregate stock market
 returns, with high (low) premia predicting high (low) future returns. Our
 empirical results depend crucially on the use of "model-free," as opposed
 to Black--Scholes, options implied volatilities, along with accurate
 realized variation measures constructed from high-frequency intraday as
 opposed to daily data. The magnitude of the predictability is particularly
 strong at the intermediate quarterly return horizon, where it dominates
 that afforded by other popular predictor variables, such as the P/E ratio,
 the default spread, and the consumption--wealth ratio.  The Author 2009. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title:   Technological Innovation and Initial Public Offerings.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 459-94
Issue: 2
Volume: 14
Year: 2001
Abstract:
  This article shows how both technological and competitive risks affect
 the timing of private and initial public offerings in an emerging
 industry. Early private financing occurs in industries that are perceived
 to be risky, with high development costs and low probability of being
 displaced by technologically superior rivals. Early public financing
 occurs in industries perceived to be viable, with low development costs
 and low probability of displacement. Due to feedback effects between
 financial and product markets, the value of investors' proprietary
 information is greater in private than in initial public offerings. This
 has implications for underpricing.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Decision Processes, Agency Problems, and Information: An Economic Analysis of Capital Budgeting Procedures 
Abstract:
  Corporations use a variety of processes to allocate capital. This article
 studies the benefits and costs of several common budget procedures from
 the perspective of a model with agency and information problems. Processes
 that delegate aspects of the decision to the agent result in too many
 projects being approved, while processes in which the principal retains
 the right to reject projects cause the agent to strategically distort his
 information about project quality. We show how the choice of a decision
 process depends on these two costs, and specifically on severity of the
 agency problem, quality of information, and project risk.   Copyright 2005, Oxford University Press.

Title: Margin-based Asset Pricing and Deviations from the Law of One Price 
Abstract:
 In a model with heterogeneous-risk-aversion agents facing margin
 constraints, we show how securities' required returns increase in both
 their betas and their margin requirements. Negative shocks to fundamentals
 make margin constraints bind, lowering risk-free rates and raising Sharpe
 ratios of risky securities, especially for high-margin securities. Such a
 funding-liquidity crisis gives rise to "bases," that is, price gaps
 between securities with identical cash-flows but different margins. In the
 time series, bases depend on the shadow cost of capital, which can be
 captured through the interest-rate spread between collateralized and
 uncollateralized loans and, in the cross-section, they depend on relative
 margins. We test the model empirically using the credit default swap--bond
 bases and other deviations from the Law of One Price, and use it to
 evaluate central banks' lending facilities.  The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: The Aggregate Dynamics of Capital Structure and Macroeconomic Risk 
Abstract:
 We study the impact of time-varying macroeconomic conditions on optimal
 dynamic capital structure for a cross-section of firms. Our
 structural-equilibrium framework embeds a contingent-claim corporate
 financing model within a consumption-based asset-pricing model. We
 investigate the effect of macroeconomic conditions on asset valuation and
 optimal corporate policies, and of preferences on capital structure. While
 capital structure is pro-cyclical at dates when firms re-lever, it is
 counter-cyclical in aggregate dynamics, consistent with empirical
 evidence. We also find that financially constrained firms choose more
 pro-cyclical policies and that leverage accounts for most of the
 macroeconomic risk relevant for predicting defaults, but is a poor measure
 of how preferences impact capital structure.  The Author 2010. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title: Trade-offs in Staying Close: Corporate Decision Making and Geographic Dispersion 
Abstract:
 We investigate whether the geographic dispersion of a firm affects
 corporate decision making. Our findings suggest that social factors work
 alongside informational considerations to make geography important to
 corporate decisions. We show that (i) geographically dispersed firms are
 less employee friendly; (ii) dismissals of divisional employees are less
 common in divisions located closer to corporate headquarters; and (iii)
 firms appear to adopt a 'pecking order' and divest out-of-state entities
 before those in-state. To explain these findings, we consider both
 information and social factors. We find that firms are more likely to
 protect proximate employees in soft information industries (i.e., when
 information is difficult to transfer over long distances). However,
 employee protection holds only when the headquarters is located in a less
 populated county, suggesting a role for social factors. Additionally,
 stock markets respond favorably to divestitures of in-state divisions.  The Author 2007. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org, Oxford University Press.

Title: Rare Disasters and Risk Sharing with Heterogeneous Beliefs 
Abstract:
 Risks of rare economic disasters can have a large impact on asset prices.
 At the same time, difficulties in inference regarding both the likelihood
 and severity of disasters, as well as agency problems, can lead to
 significant disagreements among investors about disaster risk. We show
 that such disagreements generate strong risk-sharing motives, such that
 just a small number of optimists in the economy will significantly reduce
 the disaster risk premium. Our model highlights the "latent" nature of
 disaster risk. The disaster risk premium will likely be low and smooth
 during normal times but increases dramatically when the risk-sharing
 capacity of the optimists is reduced, e.g., following a disaster. The
 model also helps reconcile the difference in the amount of disaster risk
 implied by financial markets and international macroeconomic data, and
 provides caution to the approach of extracting disaster probabilities from
 asset prices, which will disproportionately reflect the beliefs of a small
 group of optimists. Finally, our model predicts an inverse U-shaped
 relation between the equity premium and the size of the disaster insurance
 market.  The Author 2012. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: Educational Networks, Mutual Fund Voting Patterns, and CEO Compensation 
Abstract:
 Mutual funds whose managers are in the same educational network as the
 firm's CEO are more likely to vote against shareholder-initiated proposals
 to limit executive compensation than out-of-network funds are. This voting
 propensity is stronger when voting among the funds in a family is not
 unanimous. Furthermore, CEOs of firms who have relatively high levels of
 educationally connected mutual fund ownership have higher levels of
 compensation than their unconnected counterparts. This aspect of executive
 compensation is related to both the abnormal trading performance of the
 connected investors in the firm and the perceived quality of firm
 management by the connected investors.  The Author 2012. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Volume: 11
Year: 1998
Abstract:
  Recent empirical evidence indicates that capital structure changes affect
 pricing strategies. In most cases, prices increase following the
 implementation of a leveraged buyout of a major firm in an industry, with
 the more leveraged firm in the industry charging higher prices on average.
 Notable exceptions exist, however, when the leverage increasing firm's
 rival is relatively unlevered. The first observation is consistent with a
 model where firms compete for market share on the basis of price. The
 second observation can be explained within the context of a Stackelberg
 model where the relatively unlevered rival acts as the Stackelberg price
 leader.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: The Information in Option Volume for Future Stock Prices 
Abstract:
  We present strong evidence that option trading volume contains
 information about future stock prices. Taking advantage of a unique data
 set, we construct put-call ratios from option volume initiated by buyers
 to open new positions. Stocks with low put-call ratios outperform stocks
 with high put-call ratios by more than 40 basis points on the next day and
 more than 1% over the next week. Partitioning our option signals into
 components that are publicly and nonpublicly observable, we find that the
 economic source of this predictability is nonpublic information possessed
 by option traders rather than market inefficiency. We also find greater
 predictability for stocks with higher concentrations of informed traders
 and from option contracts with greater leverage.   Copyright 2006, Oxford University Press.

Title: Managers with and without Style: Evidence Using Exogenous Variation 
Abstract:
 In a large panel of Compustat firms, we find that firm policy changes
 after exogenous CEO departures do not display abnormally high levels of
 variability, casting doubt on the presence of idiosyncratic-style effects
 in policy choices. After endogenous CEO departures, we do detect
 abnormally large policy changes. These changes are larger when the firm is
 likely to draw from a deeper pool of replacement CEO candidates,
 suggesting the presence of causal-style effects that are anticipated by
 the board. Our evidence suggests that managerial styles are not
 transferred across employers and that standard F-tests are inappropriate
 for identifying style effects.  The Author 2013. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title:   Are There Economies of Scale in Underwriting Fees? Evidence of Rising External Financing Costs.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 191-218
Issue: 1
Volume: 13
Year: 2000
Abstract:
  This study examines the behavior of spreads paid in firm underwritten
 seasoned common stock offerings and straight bond offerings. Estimates
 indicate that up to 85% of the spread is variable cost and that the
 marginal spread is rising. Further, offerings that are likely to require
 greater underwriting services encounter higher marginal spreads. These
 findings are consistent with there being a family of U-shaped spreads,
 with lower quality offerings priced on higher spreads, unlike the
 economies of scale view of spreads. They agree with the views that
 underwriters provide valuable services and that the marginal cost of
 external finance is rising.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Cross-Subsidies, External Financing Constraints, and the Contribution of the Internal Capital Market to Firm Value 
Abstract:
  We examine the link between the excess value of a diversified firm and
 the value of its internal capital market. Subsidies to small financially
 constrained segments with good relative investment opportunities
 significantly increase excess value, while transfers of resources from
 segments with good relative investment opportunities significantly
 decrease excess value. Of interest is that subsidies to small financially
 constrained segments with poor relative investment opportunities also
 significantly increase excess value. However, there is little evidence
 that this result depends on the diversity of a firm's investment
 opportunities. We conclude that financing constraints drive the
 relationship between the internal capital market and firm value.   Copyright 2003, Oxford University Press.

Title: Structural Models of Corporate Bond Pricing: An Empirical Analysis 
Abstract:
  This article empirically tests five structural models of corporate bond
 pricing: those of Merton (1974), Geske (1977), Longstaff and Schwartz
 (1995), Leland and Toft (1996), and Collin-Dufresne and Goldstein (2001).
 We implement the models using a sample of 182 bond prices from firms with
 simple capital structures during the period 1986--1997. The conventional
 wisdom is that structural models do not generate spreads as high as those
 seen in the bond market, and true to expectations, we find that the
 predicted spreads in our implementation of the Merton model are too low.
 However, most of the other structural models predict spreads that are too
 high on average. Nevertheless, accuracy is a problem, as the newer models
 tend to severely overstate the credit risk of firms with high leverage or
 volatility and yet suffer from a spread underprediction problem with safer
 bonds. The Leland and Toft model is an exception in that it overpredicts
 spreads on most bonds, particularly those with high coupons. More accurate
 structural models must avoid features that increase the credit risk on the
 riskier bonds while scarcely affecting the spreads of the safest bonds.   Copyright 2004, Oxford University Press.

Title: Optimal Life Cycle Portfolio Choice with Housing Market Cycles 
Abstract:
 In recent decades U.S. households have experienced residential house
 prices moving persistently, that is, returns being positively serially
 correlated. We set up a realistically calibrated life cycle model with
 slow-moving time variation in expected housing returns, showing that not
 only age, labor income, and pre-existing housing wealth but also the state
 of the housing market significantly affect household decisions.
 Consistently with the data, the model predicts that in good states of
 housing market cycles (1) homeownership rates increase, (2) households
 buying homes invest a larger share of their net worth in their home, and
 (3) these households lever up more.  The Author 2013. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Abstract:
  We present an economic mechanism and supportive empirical evidence for
 the transmission of information between equity securities first documented
 by Lo and MacKinlay (1990). It is argued that the past returns on stocks
 held by informed institutional traders will be positively correlated with
 the contemporaneous returns on stocks held by noninstitutional uninformed
 traders. Evidence consistent with this hypothesis is then presented. We
 document that the returns on the portfolio of stocks with the highest
 level of institutional ownership lead the returns on portfolios of stocks
 with lower levels of institutional ownership. This effect persists even
 after firm size is controlled for and is apparent at longer lags than the
 size-related lag effects documented in Lo and MacKinlay (1990).   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Conglomerates and Industry Distress 
Abstract:
 Focusing on economic distress episodes in an industry, we estimate the
 effect of conglomeration on resource allocation. Distressed segments have
 higher sales growth, higher cash flow, and higher expenditure on research
 and development than single-segment firms. This is especially true for
 segments with high past performance, for unrated firms, and in competitive
 industries. Single-segment firms increase cash holding, and the
 diversification discount reduces during industry distress. Firms with high
 past performance acquire their industry counterparts, and firms with low
 past performance exit the distressed industry. Industries more prone to
 distress have greater conglomeration. Overall, conglomeration enables
 segments to avoid financial constraints during industry distress.  The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Issue: 1
Volume: 6
Year: 1993
Abstract:
  We study firms signaling with cash disbursements and show that the choice
 of a deterministic or a stochastic disbursement depends on a property of
 the firm's production function that is analogous to absolute risk aversion
 for a utility function. With decreasing (increasing) absolute risk
 aversion, the high-quality firm prefers to distinguish itself from the
 low-quality firm with a stochastic (deterministic) outlay. We then study
 in detail two common forms of corporate cash distributions: dividends, a
 deterministic disbursement, and share repurchases, a stochastic
 disbursement.	 Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Is Nonlinear Drift Implied by the Short End of the Term Structure? 
Abstract:
 Nonlinear drift models of the short rate are estimated using data on the
 short end of the term structure, where the cross-sectional relation is
 obtained by an analytical approximation. The findings reveal that (i)
 nonlinear physical drift is not implied unless it is strongly affected by
 cross-sectional dimensions of the data; (ii) nonlinear risk-neutral drift
 that allows for fast mean reversion for high rates is desirable to explain
 and predict observed patterns of yield spreads; and (iii) for higher
 frequency data from which transitory shocks are removed, (ii) still
 remains valid although the nonlinearity is somewhat reduced.  The Author 2007. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org, Oxford University Press.

Title: The Euro and Corporate Valuations 
Abstract:
 In this paper, we study the changes in corporate valuations induced by the
 adoption of the euro as the common currency in Europe. We use
 corporate-level data from seventeen European countries, of which eleven
 adopted the euro. We show that the introduction of the euro has increased
 Tobin's Q-ratios by 17.1% in the {euro-area} countries that previously had
 weak currencies. Part of the increase in corporate valuations is explained
 by the decrease in interest rates and by the decrease in the cost of
 equity. The increases in Tobin's Q are larger for firms that would be
 harmed by currency devaluations.  The Author 2008. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title:   Estimation of the Bid-Ask Spread and Its Components: A New Approach.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 623-56
Issue: 4
Volume: 4
Year: 1991
Abstract:
  We show that time variation in expected returns and/or partial price
 adjustments lead to a downward bias in previous estimators of both the
 spread and its components. We introduce a new approach that provides
 unbiased and efficient estimators of the components of the spread. We find
 that between 77 and 97 percent of the downward bias in previous spread
 estimates is caused by time variation in expected returns. More
 importantly, the adverse-selection component, though significant, accounts
 for a much smaller proportion (8 to 13 percent) of the quoted spread, at
 least for small trades, than the proportion (over 40 percent) previously
 reported in the literature. Order processing costs are the predominant
 component of quoted spreads.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: The Forgone Gains of Incomplete Portfolios 
Abstract:
 This article proposes a test for the cost-based explanation of
 nonparticipation, by estimating a lower bound to the forgone gains of
 incomplete portfolios; these are in turn a lower bound to the costs that
 could rationalize nonparticipation in financial markets: high bounds would
 imply implausibly high costs. Assuming isoelastic utility and a relative
 risk aversion of three or less, for the stock market I estimate an average
 lower bound of between 0.7 and 3.3 percent of consumption. Since total
 annual (observable plus unobservable) participation costs are likely to
 exceed these bounds, the cost-based explanation is not rejected by this
 test.  , Oxford University Press.

Title: Do Country-level Investor Protections Affect Security-level Contract Design? Evidence from Foreign Bond Covenants 
Abstract:
 This article studies the ability of security-level contracts to substitute
 for poor country-level investor protections. Using a cross-country sample
 of restrictive covenants, we find that bond contacts are more likely to
 include covenants when creditor protection laws are weak. Further, the use
 of restrictive covenants in weak creditor protection countries is
 associated with a lower cost of debt. We also find that strong
 country-level shareholder rights are not necessarily harmful to
 bondholders. Overall, the findings suggest that issuers and investors can
 create international contracts that overcome some of the deficiencies of
 country-level investor protections and facilitate access to external
 finance.  The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: Household Portfolio Diversification: A Case for Rank-Dependent Preferences 
Abstract:
  The proliferation of novel preference theories in financial economics is
 hampered by a lack of non-experimental evidence and by the theories'
 additional complexity which has not been shown to be critical in
 applications. In this article I present arguments in support of
 preferences with rank dependency. Using the Survey of Consumer Finances
 data, I document two widespread patterns inconsistent with expected
 utility: (i) many households simultaneously invest in well-deversified
 funds and in poorly-diversified portfolios of stocks; and (ii) some
 households with substantial savings do not invest anything in equities. I
 show that portfolio choice models with rank-dependent preferences,
 plausibly parameterized and under fully rational assumptions, are
 quantitatively consistent with the observed diversification. These results
 call for further efforts to integrate the models of rank-dependent
 preferences in portfolio theory and asset pricing.   Copyright 2005, Oxford University Press.

Title: Valuation in Over-the-Counter Markets 
Abstract:
 We provide the impact on asset prices of search-and-bargaining frictions
 in over-the-counter markets. Under certain conditions, illiquidity
 discounts are higher when counterparties are harder to find, when sellers
 have less bargaining power, when the fraction of qualified owners is
 smaller, or when risk aversion, volatility, or hedging demand is larger.
 Supply shocks cause prices to jump, and then 'recover' over time, with a
 time signature that is exaggerated by search frictions: The price jump is
 larger and the recovery is slower in less liquid markets. We discuss a
 variety of empirical implications.  , Oxford University Press.

Title: Investor Sentiment and Option Prices 
Abstract:
 This paper examines whether investor sentiment about the stock market
 affects prices of the S&P 500 options. The findings reveal that the index
 option volatility smile is steeper (flatter) and the risk-neutral skewness
 of monthly index return is more (less) negative when market sentiment
 becomes more bearish (bullish). These significant relations are robust and
 become stronger when there are more impediments to arbitrage in index
 options. They cannot be explained by rational perfect-market-based option
 pricing models. Changes in investor sentiment help explain time variation
 in the slope of index option smile and risk-neutral skewness beyond
 factors suggested by the current models.  The Author 2007. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org, Oxford University Press.

Title:   The Demand for Stocks: An Analysis of IPO Auctions.

Volume: 12
Year: 1999
Abstract:
  We analyze a unique dataset that includes the full demand schedules of 27
 Israeli IPOs that were conducted as nondiscriminatory (uniform price)
 auctions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time the whole
 demand schedule for any asset is described. The demand schedules are
 relatively flat around the auction clearing price: The average elasticity
 is 27. The elasticity is low when the return distribution contains a large
 unique component. We also find a significant average abnormal return of
 4.5% on the first trading day and a positive correlation between the
 abnormal return and the elasticity of demand.	 Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Managerial Autonomy, Allocation of Control Rights, and Optimal Capital Structure 
Abstract:
 We examine the design of control rights of external financiers, and how
 these interact with the firm's security issuance and capital structure
 when the firm's initial owners and managers may disagree with new
 investors over project choice. The first main result is an ex ante
 managerial preference for "soft" financial claims that maximize managerial
 project-choice autonomy, which is in contrast to agency theory. Second, a
 dynamic "pecking order" of cash, equity, and debt emerges. Additional
 results explain equity issuance at high prices, the drifting of leverage
 ratios with stock returns, cash hoarding, and debt usage without taxes,
 agency, or signaling.  The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: The Effects of Marital Status and Children on Savings and Portfolio Choice 
Abstract:
 This paper investigates the impact of demographic shocks on optimal
 decisions about saving, life insurance, and, most centrally, asset
 allocation. The analysis indicates that marital-status transitions can
 have important effects on optimal household decisions, particularly in the
 cases of widowhood and divorce. Children also play a fundamental role in
 portfolio choice; in addition to leading to substantially different
 average allocations, they also have strong interaction effects with
 changes in marital status. Panel data evidence on stockholding suggests
 that changes in marital status and children matter empirically as well,
 but not always in the manner that the model predicts.  The Author 2009. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title: Just How Much Do Individual Investors Lose by Trading? 
Abstract:
 Individual investor trading results in systematic and economically large
 losses. Using a complete trading history of all investors in Taiwan, we
 document that the aggregate portfolio of individuals suffers an annual
 performance penalty of 3.8 percentage points. Individual investor losses
 are equivalent to 2.2% of Taiwan's gross domestic product or 2.8% of the
 total personal income. Virtually all individual trading losses can be
 traced to their aggressive orders. In contrast, institutions enjoy an
 annual performance boost of 1.5&nbsp;percentage points, and both the
 aggressive and passive trades of institutions are profitable. Foreign
 institutions garner nearly half of institutional profits.  The Author 2008. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title:   Payout Policy, Capital Structure, and Compensation Contracts When Managers Value Control.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 911-33
Issue: 4
Volume: 6
Year: 1993
Abstract:
  The optimal contract between managers and investors is endogenously
 derived when managers have preferences for both monetary compensation and
 corporate resources under their control. When the optimal payout is
 privately known to managers, they can be induced to make payouts by
 linking their compensation to the payout. Public equity is a claim on this
 discretionary payout. If investors can obtain new information about the
 firm's optimal payout level, it can be utilized by transferring the
 control from management to investors. The new information allows the firm
 to achieve a more efficient allocation through recontracting. We show that
 the new information will be obtained if and only if the payout falls below
 a promised level.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title:   Do Takeover Targets Overinvest?
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 253-77
Issue: 2
Volume: 7
Year: 1994
Abstract:
  I examine the capital expenditures of a sample of 700 takeover targets
 and firms that went private over the period 1972-1987. For the complete
 sample, I do not find evidence that takeover targets increase their
 capital expenditures over the four-year period before the acquisition or
 that they overinvest in capital expenditures relative to several
 benchmarks. Subsample results provide some evidence of overinvestment in
 oil and gas firms and large firms. There is no evidence of overinvestment,
 however, for firms acquired in a hostile takeover or firms that went
 private. In general, these results are not consistent with the conjecture
 that takeovers are motivated by the need to reduce excess investment in
 capital expenditures in target firms.	 Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title:   Investment Analysis and the Adjustment of Stock Prices to Common Information.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 799-824
Issue: 4
Volume: 6
Year: 1993
Abstract:
  In this article we are concerned with the effect of the number of
 investment analysts following a firm on the speed of adjustment of the
 firm's stock price to new information that has common effects across
 firms. It is found that returns on portfolios of firms that are followed
 by many analysts tend to lead those of firms that are followed by fewer
 analysts, even when the firms are of approximately the same size. Many
 analyst firms also tend to respond more rapidly to market returns than do
 few analyst firms, adjusting for firm size. This relation, however, is
 nonlinear, and the marginal effect of the number of analysts on the speed
 of price adjustment increases with the number of analysts.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: The Dog That Did Not Bark: A Defense of Return Predictability 
Abstract:
 If returns are not predictable, dividend growth must be predictable, to
 generate the observed variation in divided yields. I find that the absence
 of dividend growth predictability gives stronger evidence than does the
 presence of return predictability. Long-horizon return forecasts give the
 same strong evidence. These tests exploit the negative correlation of
 return forecasts with dividend-yield autocorrelation across samples,
 together with sensible upper bounds on dividend-yield autocorrelation, to
 deliver more powerful statistics. I reconcile my findings with the
 literature that finds poor power in long-horizon return forecasts, and
 with the literature that notes the poor out-of-sample R-super-2 of
 return-forecasting regressions.  The Author 2007. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org, Oxford University Press.

  Arguments for creating a market to allow trading the portfolio of all

Title: Financing Constraints and the Cost of Capital: Evidence from the Funding of Corporate Pension Plans 
Abstract:
 We investigate the relation between firms' weighted average cost of
 capital and internal financial resources, using mandatory pension
 contributions as a proxy for internal financial resources. Rauh (2006)
 documents a negative association between mandatory pension contributions
 and capital expenditures. We find that an increase in mandatory pension
 contributions increases the cost of capital, but only for firms facing
 greater external financing constraints. Our results suggest that firms'
 cost of capital is an intervening variable that can explain Rauh's finding
 that mandatory pension contributions (i.e., internal financing
 constraints) result in foregone investment. Overall, we provide evidence
 consistent with recent studies (Rauh 2006; Almeida and Campello 2007) that
 conclude that financial market frictions affect real economic activity
 and, in particular, corporate investment.  The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: The Effect of Leverage on Bidding Behavior: Theory and Evidence from the FCC Auctions 
Abstract:
  This is an exploration of how bidding behavior of firms in various
 auctions is affected by their capital structure. The theoretical model
 considers a first-price sealed bid and an English auction. We find that as
 debt levels increase, firms tend to reduce their bids. The lower bids give
 the competition incentives to reduce their bids as well. These results are
 investigated empirically using data from the 1994--1995 FCC spectrum
 auctions. Consistent with the theoretical model, higher debt levels of the
 bidding firm and of the competition tend to lead to lower bids. Additional
 determinants of bidding behavior in these auctions are also analyzed.   Copyright 2002, Oxford University Press.

Title: Anomalies 
Abstract:
 We take a simple q-theory model and ask how well it can explain external
 financing anomalies, both qualitatively and quantitatively. Our central
 insight is that optimal investment is an important driving force of these
 anomalies. The model simultaneously reproduces procyclical equity issuance
 waves, the negative relation between investment and average returns,
 long-term underperformance following equity issues, positive long-term
 drift following cash distributions, the mean-reverting operating
 performance of issuing and cash-distributing firms, and the failure of the
 CAPM in explaining the long-term stock-price drifts. However, the model
 cannot fully capture the magnitude of the positive drift following cash
 distributions observed in the data.  The Author 2009. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title: Why Do Firms Use Private Equity to Opt Out of Public Markets? 
Abstract:
 We investigate how firms weigh the costs and benefits of being public in
 the decision to opt out of the public market and go private. We draw on
 previous studies of going private and on the subsequent well-developed
 theoretical literature on why firms go public to develop our hypotheses.
 We employ a comprehensive sample of going-private transactions from 1980
 to 2004 in the United States and examine how these firms differ over their
 public life (from IPO to going private) relative to a sample of firms that
 went and remained public. Our results provide strong support for the
 importance of information and liquidity considerations in being a public
 firm. These factors are evident at the IPO, on average thirteen years
 before the going-private decision. Access to capital and control
 considerations become increasingly important in the choice of going
 private over the public life of the firm.  The Author 2010. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title:   Investment and Insider Trading.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 501-43
Issue: 2
Volume: 8
Year: 1995
Abstract:
  We study insider trading in a dynamic setting. Rational, but uninformed,
 traders choose between investment projects with different levels of
 insider trading Insider trading distorts investment toward assets with
 less private information. However, when investment is sufficiently
 information elastic, insider trading can be welfare-enhancing because of
 more informative prices. When insiders repeatedly receive information,
 they trade to reveal it when investment is information elastic because
 good news increases investment and hence future insider profits. Thus,
 more information is revealed and uninformed agents are exploited less
 frequently by insiders. Both effects are Pareto-improving. Finally, we
 consider various insider-trading regulations.	 Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: What Does Equity Sector Orderflow Tell Us About the Economy? 
Abstract:
 Investors rebalance their portfolios as their views about expected returns
 and risk change. We use empirical measures of portfolio rebalancing to
 back out investors' views, specifically, their views about the state of
 the economy. We show that aggregate portfolio rebalancing across equity
 sectors is consistent with sector rotation, an investment strategy that
 exploits perceived differences in the relative performance of sectors at
 different stages of the business cycle. The empirical footprint of sector
 rotation has predictive power for the evolution of the economy and future
 bond market returns, even after controlling for relative sector returns.
 Contrary to many theories of price formation, trading activity, therefore,
 contains information that is not entirely revealed by resulting relative
 price changes.  The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: Why Don't Issuers Get Upset About Leaving Money on the Table in IPOs? 
Abstract:
  One of the puzzles regarding initial public offerings (IPOs) is that
 issuers rarely get upset about leaving substantial amounts of money on the
 table, defined as the number of shares sold times the difference between
 the first-day closing market price and the offer price. The average IPO
 leaves $9.1 million on the table. This number is approximately twice as
 large as the fees paid to investment bankers and represents a substantial
 indirect cost to the issuing firm. We present a prospect theory model that
 focuses on the covariance of the money left on the table and wealth
 changes. Our reasoning also provides an explanation for a second puzzling
 pattern: much more money is left on the table following recent market
 rises than after market falls. This results in an explanation of hot issue
 markets. We also offer a new explanation for why IPOs are underpriced.   Copyright 2002, Oxford University Press.

Title: Dynamic Investment and Financing under Personal Taxation 
Abstract:
 In this paper we examine the effects of capital gains taxation on firms'
 investment and financing decisions. We develop a real-options model in
 which the timing of investment, the decision to default, and the firm's
 capital structure are endogenously and jointly determined. Our analysis
 demonstrates that the asymmetric taxation of capital gains and losses
 fosters investment by eroding the option value of waiting. It also shows
 that firms controlled by taxable investors employ more equity financing,
 the higher the firm's stock price and the worse the firm's historical
 performance. Using a large sample of U.S. industrial firms that are owned
 by taxable investors between 1970 and 2008, we present new evidence on
 corporate investment and financing policies, which is supportive of the
 model's predictions.  The Author 2009. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org, Oxford University Press.

Title: Shackling Short Sellers: The 2008 Shorting Ban 
Abstract:
 In September 2008, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)
 temporarily banned most short sales in nearly 1,000 financial stocks. We
 examine the ban's effect on market quality, shorting activity, the
 aggressiveness of short sellers, and stock prices. The ban's effects are
 concentrated in larger stocks; there is little effect on firms in the
 lower half of the size distribution. Although shorting activity drops by
 about 77% in large-cap stocks, stock prices appear unaffected by the ban.
 All but the smallest quartile of firms subject to the ban suffer a severe
 degradation in market quality.  The Author 2013. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: Entrepreneurial Learning, the IPO Decision, and the Post-IPO Drop in Firm Profitability 
Abstract:
 We develop a model of the optimal initial public offering (IPO) decision
 in the presence of learning about the average profitability of a private
 firm. The entrepreneur trades off diversification benefits of going public
 against benefits of private control. Going public is optimal when the
 firm's expected future profitability is sufficiently high. The model
 predicts that firm profitability should decline after the IPO, on average,
 and that this decline should be larger for firms with more volatile
 profitability and firms with less uncertain average profitability. These
 predictions are supported empirically in a sample of 7183 IPOs in the
 United States between 1975 and 2004.  The Author 2008. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org, Oxford University Press.

Title: How Law Affects Lending 
Abstract:
 The paper investigates the effect of legal change on the lending behavior
 of banks in twelve transition economies. First, we find that banks
 increase the supply of credit subsequent to legal change. Second, changes
 in collateral law matter more for increases in bank lending than do
 changes in bankruptcy law. We attribute this finding to the different
 functions of collateral and bankruptcy law. While the former enhances the
 likelihood that individual creditors can realize their claims against a
 debtor, the latter ensures an orderly process for resolving multiple, and
 often conflicting, claims after a debtor has become insolvent. Finally, we
 find that foreign-owned banks respond more strongly to legal change than
 incumbents.  The Author 2009. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org, Oxford University Press.

Title: Multiple-Predictor Regressions: Hypothesis Testing 
Abstract:
 We propose a new hypothesis-testing method for multipredictor regressions
 in small samples, where the dependent variable is regressed on lagged
 variables that are autoregressive. The new test is based on the augmented
 regression method (Amihud and Hurvich, 2004), which produces reduced-bias
 coefficients and is easy to implement. The method's usefulness is
 demonstrated by simulations and by testing a model where stock returns are
 predicted by two variables, income-to-consumption and dividend yield.  The Author 2008. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org, Oxford University Press.

Title:   A Transactions Data Analysis of Nonsynchronous Trading.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 609-30
Issue: 3
Volume: 12
Year: 1999
Abstract:
  Weekly returns of stock portfolios exhibit substantial autocorrelation.
 Analytical studies suggest that nonsynchronous trading is capable of
 explaining from 5% to 65% of the autocorrelation. The varying importance
 of nonsynchronous trading in these studies arises primarily from differing
 assumptions regarding nontrading periods of stocks. We simulate the
 effects of nonsynchronous trading by sampling stock returns from a return
 generating process using transactions data to obtain the precise time of
 each stock's last trade. We find that simulated weekly portfolio returns
 exhibit autocorrelations that are roughly 25% that of their observed
 (CRSP) weekly returns.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

  This theory can explain why bank debt is universally senior, consistent

 financial distress: better organized banks would more strongly contest
 priority in financial distress if they were junior. Because "deterrence
 can reduce creditors' total expenses in a priority contest, the ex post
 stronger lobbyist/litigant should be senior ex ante. For equivalent
 reasons, the theory can advise when public debt should be senior to trade
 credit and/or implicit contracts, and can even suggest one rationale for
 the absolute priority rule (APR). This article further shows that Chapter

Volume: 10
Year: 1997
Abstract:
  The probability of entry and exit of dealers on the NASDAQ National
 Market (NNM) is significantly affected by trading intensity, volatility
 and the quoted bid-ask spread. Entry and exit of market makers is a
 pervasive phenomenon. Large-scale entry (exit) is associated with
 substantial declines (increases) in quoted end-of-day inside spreads, even
 after controlling for the effects of changes in volume and volatility. The
 spread changes are larger in magnitude for issues with few market makers;
 however, even for issues with a large number of market makers, substantial
 changes in quoted spreads take place. The results are consistent with the
 competitive model of dealer pricing.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Option Backdating and Board Interlocks 
Abstract:
 We examine the role of board connections in explaining how the
 controversial practice of backdating employee stock options spread to a
 large number of firms across a wide range of industries. The increase in
 the likelihood that a firm begins to backdate stock options that can be
 explained by having a board member who is interlocked to a previously
 identified backdating firm is approximately one-third of the unconditional
 probability of backdating in our sample. Our analysis provides new insight
 into how boards function and the role that they play in providing
 managerial oversight and determining corporate strategy.  The Author 2009. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title: A Long-Run Risks Explanation of Predictability Puzzles in Bond and Currency Markets 
Abstract:
 We show that bond risk premia rise with uncertainty about expected
 inflation and fall with uncertainty about expected growth; the magnitude
 of return predictability using these uncertainty measures is similar to
 that by multiple yields. Motivated by this evidence, we develop and
 estimate a long-run risks model with timevarying volatilities of expected
 growth and inflation. The model simultaneously accounts for bond return
 predictability and violations of uncovered interest parity in currency
 markets. We find that preference for early resolution of uncertainty,
 time-varying volatilities, and non-neutral effects of inflation on growth
 are important to account for these aspects of asset markets.  The Author 2012. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: Rating Shopping or Catering? An Examination of the Response to Competitive Pressure for CDO Credit Ratings 
Abstract:
 We examine whether "rating shopping" or "rating catering" is a more
 accurate characterization of rating agency interactions regarding
 collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). Although investors paid a premium
 for dual ratings, AAA CDO tranches rated by both Moody's and S&P defaulted
 more frequently than tranches rated by only one of them, which is
 inconsistent with pure rating shopping. Rating agencies made upward
 adjustments beyond their model when their competitor had more lenient
 assumptions. Finally, consistent with rating catering, S&P's and Moody's
 adjustments and disagreements at security issuance were reflected in
 subsequent rating downgrades, suggesting that adjustments were harmful.  The Author 2013. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title:   A Theory of the Going-Public Decision.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 249-79
Issue: 2
Volume: 12
Year: 1999
Abstract:
  We address the question: At what stage in its life should a firm go
 public rather than undertake its projects using private equity financing?
 In our model a firm may raise external financing either by placing shares
 privately with a risk-averse venture capitalist or by selling shares in an
 IPO to numerous small investors. The entrepreneur has private information
 about his firm's value, but outsiders can reduce this informational
 disadvantage by evaluating the firm at a cost. The equilibrium timing of
 the going-public decision is determined by the firm's trade-off between
 minimizing the duplication in information production by outsiders
 (unavoidable in the IPO market, but mitigated by a publicly observable
 share price) and avoiding the risk-premium demanded by venture
 capitalists. Testable implications are developed for the cross-sectional
 variations in the age of going-public across industries and countries.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Institutional Herding 
Abstract:
  Institutional investors' demand for a security this quarter is positively
 correlated with their demand for the security last quarter. We attribute
 this to institutional investors following each other into and out of the
 same securities ("herding") and institutional investors following their
 own lag trades. Although institutional investors are "momentum" traders,
 little of their herding results from momentum trading. Moreover,
 institutional demand is more strongly related to lag institutional demand
 than lag returns. Results are most consistent with the hypothesis that
 institutions herd as a result of inferring information from each other's
 trades.   Copyright 2004, Oxford University Press.

Abstract:
  The optimal portfolio strategy is developed for an investor who has

 genuine rather than merely apparent. The analysis takes account of the
 fact that the parameters of both the underlying asset pricing model and
 the anomalous returns are estimated rather than known. The value that an
 investor would place on the ability to invest to exploit the apparent
 anomaly is also derived and illustrative calculations are presented for
 the Fama and French SMB and HML portfolios, whose returns are anomalous
 relative to the CAPM.	 Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title:   The Performance of Japanese Mutual Funds.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 237-73
Issue: 2
Volume: 10
Year: 1997
Abstract:
  We analyze the performance of Japanese opentype stock mutual funds for
 the 1981-1992 period. The results show that, regardless of the performance
 measures and benchmarks employed, most of the Japanese mutual funds
 underperform the benchmarks by between 3.6% and 10.8% per annum. These
 funds tend to invest more in large stocks with low book-to-market ratios.
 But this feature does not explain the underperformance. A potential
 explanation is the dilution effect caused by inflows offends. In Japan, a
 new investor of an open-type fund only pays in the after-tax value of the
 net asset value. We conduct a bootstrap experiment to assess the magnitude
 of this dilution effect.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: New Evidence on Measuring Financial Constraints: Moving Beyond the KZ Index 
Abstract:
 We collect detailed qualitative information from financial filings to
 categorize financial constraints for a random sample of firms from 1995 to
 2004. Using this categorization, we estimate ordered logit models
 predicting constraints as a function of different quantitative factors.
 Our findings cast serious doubt on the validity of the KZ index as a
 measure of financial constraints, while offering mixed evidence on the
 validity of other common measures of constraints. We find that firm size
 and age are particularly useful predictors of financial constraint levels,
 and we propose a measure of financial constraints that is based solely on
 these firm characteristics.  The Author 2010. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title: Privatization and Risk Sharing: Evidence from the Split Share Structure Reform in China 
Abstract:
 We study the share privatization process in China to investigate whether
 and how the removal of market frictions is associated with efficiency
 gains. Prior to the reform, domestic A-shares were divided into tradable
 and non-tradable shares. As a result of the reform, holders of
 non-tradable shares compensated holders of tradable shares in order to
 make their shares tradable. We show that size is positively associated
 with both the gain in risk sharing and the price impact of more shares
 coming on the market as a result of the reform. Our study highlights the
 role of risk sharing in China's share issue privatization process.  The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: Trade Credit Contracts 
Abstract:
 We employ a novel data set on almost 30,000 trade credit contracts to
 describe the broad characteristics of the parties that contract together
 and the key terms of these contracts. Whereas prior work has typically
 used information on only one side of the buyer-seller transaction, we
 utilize information on both, allowing for the first analysis of
 buyer-seller pairs. An equally important distinction is that we have
 multiple contracts for the same buyer or supplier firms, rather than a
 firm-average response, allowing for the correction of time-invariant firm
 characteristics that might determine the choice of credit terms. We find
 that the largest and most creditworthy buyers receive contracts with the
 longest maturities from smaller suppliers, and that discounts for early
 payment tend to be offered to riskier buyers.  The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

 interact to explain the equity risk dynamics of value versus growth
 stocks. During economic downturns, the asset betas and leverage of value
 firms increase, contributing to a sharp rise in equity betas. Asset betas
 of growth firms are much less sensitive to economic conditions, and,
 consistent with the tradeoff theory of capital structure, growth firms are
 also less levered, contributing to the relative stability of their equity
 betas. By incorporating instruments that better capture beta dynamics, I
 show that the interactions of conditional betas with the market risk
 premium and volatility explain approximately 40% of the unconditional
 value premium.  The Author 2013. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: Bank Capital and Value in the Cross-Section 
Abstract:
 We develop a dynamic model of bank capital structure in an acquisitions
 context which predicts: (i) total bank value and the bank's equity capital
 are positively correlated in the cross-section, and (ii) the various
 components of bank value are also positively cross-sectionally related to
 bank capital. Our empirical tests provide strong support for these
 predictions. The results are robust to a variety of alternative
 explanations--growth prospects, desire to acquire toe-hold positions,
 desire of capital-starved acquirers to buy capital-rich targets, market
 timing, pecking order, the effect of banks with binding capital
 requirements, Too Big To Fail, target profitability, risk, and mechanical
 effects.   The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title: Conditioning Information and Variance Bounds on Pricing Kernels 
Abstract:
  Gallant, Hansen, and Tauchen (1990) show how to use conditioning
 information optimally to construct a sharper unconditional variance bound
 (the GHT bound) on pricing kernels. The literature predominantly resorts
 to a simple but suboptimal procedure that scales returns with predictive
 instruments and computes standard bounds using the original and scaled
 returns. This article provides a formal bridge between the two approaches.
 We propose an optimally scaled bound that coincides with the GHT bound
 when the first and second conditional moments are known. When these
 moments are misspecified, our optimally scaled bound yields a valid lower
 bound for the standard deviation of pricing kernels, whereas the GHT bound
 does not. We illustrate the behavior of the bounds using a number of
 linear and nonlinear models for consumption growth and bond and stock
 returns. We also illustrate how the optimally scaled bound can be used as
 a diagnostic for the specification of the first two conditional moments of
 asset returns.   Copyright 2004, Oxford University Press.

Title: Does the Limit Order Routing Decision Matter? 
Abstract:
  We examine the impact deciding to route limit orders away from the New
 York Stock Exchange (NYSE) has on three dimensions of execution quality
 with methodologies controlling for market conditions and order submission
 strategies. Overall differences in limit order execution quality between
 regional stock exchanges and the NYSE are small, suggesting that the order
 routing decision may not affect retail limit order traders substantively.
 Conditioning on the distance between the limit order's price and
 prevailing quotes, however, reveals systematic differences in execution
 quality. This implies that brokers can strategically route limit orders to
 improve retail limit order execution quality.   Copyright 2002, Oxford University Press.

Title: Liquidity Biases and the Pricing of Cross-sectional Idiosyncratic Volatility 
Abstract:
 We model a microstructure effect on daily security returns, embodied by
 zero returns and the bid-ask spread, and derive a closed-form solution for
 the resulting bias in the estimated idiosyncratic volatility. Our
 empirical tests show that controlling for the bias eliminates the ability
 of idiosyncratic volatility estimates to predict future returns. We also
 find a significant reduction in the pricing ability of idiosyncratic
 volatility after exogenous shocks to liquidity evidenced in the 1997
 reduction in the quotes to sixteenths and the 2001 decimalization.
 Finally, minimizing liquidity's influence on the estimated idiosyncratic
 volatility, by orthogonalizing the percentage of zero-return and spread
 effects on the estimated idiosyncratic volatility, demonstrates that the
 resulting idiosyncratic volatility estimate has little pricing ability.  The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: Biases in Decomposing Holding-Period Portfolio Returns 
Abstract:
 A growing number of studies in finance decompose multiperiod portfolio
 returns into a series of single-period returns, using these to test asset
 pricing models or market efficiency or to evaluate the returns to
 investment strategies such as those based on momentum, size, and
 value--growth. We provide a formal analysis of the decomposition method.
 Crucially, we argue and present empirical evidence that some methods
 researchers use involve portfolios that nobody would seriously consider ex
 ante, that transactions costs associated with such portfolios make them
 poor investment vehicles, and that they can lead to spurious statistical
 inferences.  The Author 2006. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org, Oxford University Press.

Title: Delta-Hedged Gains and the Negative Market Volatility Risk Premium 
Abstract:
  We investigate whether the volatility risk premium is negative by
 examining the statistical properties of delta-hedged option portfolios
 (buy the option and hedge with stock). Within a stochastic volatility
 framework, we demonstrate a correspondence between the sign and magnitude
 of the volatility risk premium and the mean delta-hedged portfolio
 returns. Using a sample of S&amp;P 500 index options, we provide empirical
 tests that have the following general results. First, the delta-hedged
 strategy underperforms zero. Second, the documented underperformance is
 less for options away from the money. Third, the underperformance is
 greater at times of higher volatility. Fourth, the volatility risk premium
 significantly affects delta-hedged gains, even after accounting for jump
 fears. Our evidence is supportive of a negative market volatility risk
 premium.   Copyright 2003, Oxford University Press.

Title:   Ownership and Control of German Corporations.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 943-77
Issue: 4
Volume: 14
Year: 2001
Abstract:
  In a study of the ownership of German corporations, we find a strong
 relation between board turnover and corporate performance, little
 association of concentrations of ownership with managerial disciplining,
 and only limited evidence that pyramid structures can be used for control
 purposes. The static relationship of ownership to control in Germany is
 therefore similar to the United Kingdom and the United States. However,
 there are marked differences in dynamic relations involving transfers of
 ownership. There is an active market in share blocks giving rise to
 changes in control, but the gains are limited and accrue solely to the
 holders of large blocks, not to minority investors. We provide evidence of
 low overall benefits to control changes and the exploitation of private
 benefits of control.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title:   Measuring the Predictable Variation in Stock and Bond Returns.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 579-630
Issue: 3
Volume: 10
Year: 1997
Abstract:
  Recent studies show that when a regression model is used to forecast
 stock and bond returns, the sample R [superscript 2] increases
 dramatically with the length of the return horizon. These studies argue,
 therefore, that long-horizon returns are highly predictable. This article
 presents evidence that suggests otherwise. Long-horizon regressions can
 easily yield large values of the sample R [superscript 2], even if the
 population R [superscript 2] is small or zero. Moreover, long-horizon
 regressions with a small or zero population R [superscript 2] can produce
 t-ratios that might be interpreted as evidence of strong predictability.
 In general, the analysis provides little support for the view that
 long-horizon returns are highly predictable.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Asset Pricing Implications of Firms' Financing Constraints 
Abstract:
  We use a production-based asset pricing model to investigate whether
 financing constraints are quantitatively important for the cross-section
 of returns. Specifically, we use GMM to explore the stochastic Euler
 equation imposed on returns by optimal investment. Our methods can
 identify the impact of financial frictions on the stochastic discount
 factor with cyclical variations in cost of external funds. We find that
 financing frictions provide a common factor that improves the pricing of
 cross-sectional returns. Moreover, the shadow cost of external funds
 exhibits strong procyclical variation, so that financial frictions are
 more important in relatively good economic conditions. (JEL E22, E44, G12)   Copyright 2006, Oxford University Press.

Title: Indirect Costs of Financial Distress in Durable Goods Industries: The Case of Auto Manufacturers 
Abstract:
 Financial distress can disrupt a durable goods producer's provision of
 complementary goods and services such as warranties, spare parts and
 maintenance. This reduces consumers' demand for the core product, causing
 indirect costs of financial distress. We test this hypothesis in the
 market for used cars sold at wholesale auctions. An increase in a
 manufacturer's credit default swaps significantly decreases the prices of
 its cars at auction, especially cars with longer expected service lives.
 Our estimates imply substantial indirect costs of financial distress for
 car manufacturers. These costs have occasionally even exceeded the tax
 savings benefits for General Motors and Ford.  The Author 2013. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: 'O Sole Mio: An Experimental Analysis of Weather and Risk Attitudes in Financial Decisions 
Abstract:
 Although weather has been shown to affect financial markets and financial

 influence is exerted. By employing a multiple price list method, this
 paper provides direct experimental evidence that sunshine and good weather
 promote risk-taking behavior. This effect is present whether relying on
 objective measures of meteorological conditions or subjective weather
 assessments. Finally, employing a psychological test, we find evidence
 that weather may affect individual risk tolerance through its effect on

Title:   Taxes and Capital Structure: Evidence from Firms' Response to the Tax Reform Act of 1986.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 331-55
Issue: 2
Volume: 5
Year: 1992
Abstract:
  While the theoretical relation between taxes and capital structure has
 been extensively analyzed, the empirical evidence on this issue has thus
 far been inconclusive. One of the main difficulties confronting previous
 empirical studies of the cross-sectional relationship between taxes and
 leverage was the control of intervening variables. The Tax Reform Act of
 1986 (TRA), which drastically changed the tax regime, provides a unique
 opportunity to assess the interaction between taxes and leverage decisions
 in a controlled environment. The authors test the relationship between
 leverage and certain tax-related variables for a large sample of companies
 in the years surrounding the enactment of TRA. The results support the
 tax-based theories of capital structure. The findings indicate that there
 exists a substitution effect between debt and nondebt tax shields, and
 that both corporate and personal tax rates affect leverage decisions.

Title: Financial Leverage, Corporate Investment, and Stock Returns 
Abstract:
 This article rationalizes empirical patterns of market leverage, book
 leverage, book-to-market ratios, and stock returns across different
 book-to-market portfolios, using a model of firm financing and investment.
 The model analytically shows that tax deductibility of interest payments
 increases effective investment irreversibility and that investment
 irreversibility weakens the relation between book-to-market values and
 returns. This provides a clear and novel mechanism showing how financial
 leverage affects stock returns beyond the standard Modigliani-Miller
 paradigm. The article argues that market leverage, rather than operating
 leverage or investment irreversibility, explains a major portion of the
 value premium. Empirical evidence supports this argument.  The Author 2012. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: Investor Heterogeneity, Investor-Management Disagreement and Share Repurchases 
Abstract:
 This paper develops and tests a new theoretical explanation for stock
 repurchases. Investors may disagree with the manager about the firm's
 investment projects. A repurchase causes a change in the investor base as
 investors who are most likely to disagree with the manager tender their
 shares. Therefore, a firm is more likely to buy back shares when the level
 of investor-management agreement is lower, and agreement improves as a
 consequence. Moreover, dispersion of opinion among investors cannot
 explain repurchase activity once the stock price and investor-management
 agreement are controlled for. Overall, the evidence is consistent with
 firms strategically using repurchases to improve alignment between
 management and shareholders.  The Author 2013. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Abstract:
  This article shows (1) how entry and exit of firms in a competitive
 industry affect the valuation of securities and optimal capital structure,
 and (2) how, given a trade-off between tax advantages and agency costs, a
 firm will optimally adjust its leverage level after it is set up. We
 derive simple pricing expressions for corporate debt in which the price
 elasticity of demand for industry output plays a crucial role. When a firm
 optimally adjusts its leverage over time, we show that total firm value
 comprises the value of discounted cash flows assuming fixed capital
 structure, plus a continuum of options for marginal increases in debt.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Abstract:
  We investigate adaptive or evolutionary learning in a repeated version of

 that is a monotonic selection dynamic will converge to the rational
 expectations asset demands if the proportion of informed traders is fixed.
 We also show that these learning processes have a unique asymptotically
 stable fixed point at the Grossman-Stiglitz (GS) equilibrium. The
 robustness of learning to noisy experimentation is studied using Binmore
 and Samuelson's (1999) deterministic drift approximation. Conditions on
 economic and learning process parameters for adaptive learning to lead to
 the GS rational expectations equilibrium are presented.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Reward for Luck in a Dynamic Agency Model 
Abstract:
 This article studies a continuous time principal-agent problem of a firm
 whose cash flows are determined by the manager's unobserved effort. The
 firm's cash flows are further subject to persistent and publicly
 observable shocks that are beyond the manager's control. While standard
 contracting models predict that compensation should optimally filter out
 these shocks, empirical evidence suggests otherwise. In line with this
 evidence, our model predicts that the manager is "rewarded for luck."  The Author 2010. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title: Anticipation, Acquisitions, and Bidder Returns: Industry Shocks and the Transfer of Information across Rivals 
Abstract:
 We document market anticipation of merger bids and show that less
 anticipated bids earn significantly higher announcement returns.
 Subsequent bidders in the industry experience significant and positive
 abnormal returns around the time of initial industry bid announcements.
 These results suggest that announcement period returns underestimate the
 wealth effects of bidding. After accounting for anticipation, bidding
 activity is, on average, a significant wealth-creating event. Moreover,
 bidders pursuing public targets increase shareholder wealth and bidders in
 stock swaps do not lose. These results contradict conventional wisdom. Our
 results shed light on the correct magnitude of acquisition returns and on
 the transfer of information throughout an industry around the time of an
 economic shock.  The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: Do Sovereign Bonds Benefit Corporate Bonds in Emerging Markets? 
Abstract:
 We analyze the impact of emerging-market sovereign bonds on
 emerging-market corporate bonds by examining their spanning enhancement,
 price discovery, and issuance effects. We find that the effect of spanning
 enhancement is positive and large; over one-fifth of the information in
 corporate yield spreads is traced to innovations in sovereign bonds; and
 most of these effects are due to discovery and spanning of systematic
 risks. Further, issuance of sovereign bonds, controlling for endogeneity
 of market-timing decisions, lowers corporate yield and bid-ask spreads.
 Our results indicate that sovereign securities act as benchmarks and
 suggest they promote a vibrant corporate bond market.  The Author 2008. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org, Oxford University Press.

Abstract:
  We provide a price characterization of efficient contingent claims--that

 market frictions. Frictions include market incompleteness, transaction
 costs, short-selling, and borrowing costs. We characterize the
 inefficiency cost of a trading strategy--its required investment minus the
 largest amount necessary to obtain the same utility level--and we propose
 a measure of portfolio performance. We show that arbitrage bounds cannot
 be tightened based on efficiency without restricting preferences or
 endowments. We observe common investment strategies becoming inefficient
 with market frictions and others rationalized by them.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

 The surge in public debt triggered by the financial crisis has raised
 uncertainty about future tax pressure and economic activity. We examine
 the asset pricing effects of fiscal policies in a production-based general
 equilibrium model in which taxation affects corporate decisions by: (1)
 distorting profits and investment; (2) reducing the cost of debt through a
 tax shield; and (3) depressing productivity growth. In settings with
 recursive preferences, these three tax-based channels generate sizable
 risk premia, making tax uncertainty a first-order concern. We document
 further that corporate tax smoothing can substantially alter the effects
 of public expenditure shocks.  The Author 2012. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: Entangled Financial Systems 
Abstract:
 I model an entangled financial system in which banks hedge their portfolio
 risks using over-the-counter (OTC) contracts. However, banks choose not to
 hedge counterparty risk, and thus the idiosyncratic failure of a bank can
 lead to a systemic run of lenders. An inefficiency arises because banks
 engage in a version of risk shifting through the network externalities
 created by OTC contracts. Banks do not take into account that the costly
 hedging of low-probability counterparty risk also benefits other banks. In
 the model, it is welfare improving to tax OTC contracts to finance a
 bailout fund.  The Author 2013. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: Expected Returns and the Business Cycle: Heterogeneous Goods and Time-Varying Risk Aversion 
Abstract:
 This paper proposes a representative agent habit-formation model where
 preferences are defined for both luxury goods and basic goods. The model
 matches the equity risk premium, risk-free rate, and volatilities. From
 the intratemporal first-order condition, one can substitute out basic good
 consumption and the habit level, yielding a stochastic discount factor
 driven by two observable risk factors: luxury good consumption and the
 relative price of the two goods. I estimate these processes and find them
 to be heteroskedastic, implying time variation in the conditional
 volatility of the stochastic discount factor. These dynamics occur both at
 the business cycle frequency and at a lower, "generational" frequency. The
 findings reveal that the time variation in aggregate stock market and
 Treasury bond risk premiums are consistent with the predictions of the
 model.  The Author 2009. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org, Oxford University Press.

Title:   Trade Size and Components of the Bid-Ask Spread.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 1153-83
Issue: 4
Volume: 8
Year: 1995
Abstract:
  The relation between theorized components of the bid-ask spread and trade
 size for a sample of NYSE firms is examined. We find that the adverse
 selection component increases uniformly with trade size. Conversely, order
 processing costs decrease with increases in trade size for all but the
 largest trades. We find that order persistence decreases with trade size.
 The adverse selection component is highest at the beginning of the day and
 lowest at the end of the day for all but the largest trades. Trades of
 NYSE firms executed on regional exchanges or NASDAQ contain a large order
 processing cost component but no significant adverse information effect.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: An Economic Evaluation of Empirical Exchange Rate Models 
Abstract:
 This paper provides a comprehensive evaluation of the short-horizon
 predictive ability of economic fundamentals and forward premiums on
 monthly exchange-rate returns in a framework that allows for volatility
 timing. We implement Bayesian methods for estimation and ranking of a set
 of empirical exchange rate models, and construct combined forecasts based
 on Bayesian model averaging. More importantly, we assess the economic
 value of the in-sample and out-of-sample forecasting power of the
 empirical models, and find two key results: (1) a risk-averse investor
 will pay a high performance fee to switch from a dynamic portfolio
 strategy based on the random walk model to one that conditions on the
 forward premium with stochastic volatility innovations and (2) strategies
 based on combined forecasts yield large economic gains over the random
 walk benchmark. These two results are robust to reasonably high
 transaction costs.  The Author 2008. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org, Oxford University Press.

Title:   Tests of Financial Models in the Presence of Overlapping Observations.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 227-54
Issue: 2
Volume: 4
Year: 1991
Abstract:
  A general approach to testing serial dependence restrictions implied from
 financial models is developed. In particular, we discuss joint serial
 dependence restrictions imposed by random walk, market microstructure, and
 rational expectations models recently examined in the literature. This
 approach incorporates more information from the data by explicitly
 modeling dependencies induced by the use of overlapping observations.
 Because the estimation problem is sufficiently simple in this framework,
 the test statistics have simple representations in terms of only a few
 unknown parameters. As a result, relatively good size properties are
 attained in small samples. In addition, the benefit to overlapping
 observations and the advantage of examining multiperiod time series are
 explicitly quantified.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Pricing Credit Default Swaps with Observable Covariates 
Abstract:
 Observable covariates are useful for predicting default, but several
 studies question their value for explaining credit spreads. We introduce a
 discrete-time no-arbitrage model with observable covariates, which allows
 for a closed-form solution for the value of credit default swaps (CDS).
 The default intensity is a quadratic function of the covariates, specified
 such that it is always positive. The model yields economically plausible
 results in terms of fit, the economic impact of the covariates, and the
 prices of risk. Risk premiums are large and account for a smaller
 percentage of spreads for firms with lower credit quality. Macroeconomic
 and firm-specific information can explain most of the variation in CDS
 spreads over time and across firms, even with a parsimonious
 specification. These findings resolve the existing disconnect in the
 literature regarding the value of observable covariates for credit risk
 pricing and default prediction.  The Author 2013. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: Differences of Opinion of Public Information and Speculative Trading in Stocks and Options 
Abstract:
 We analyze the effects of differences of opinion on the dynamics of
 trading volume in stocks and options. We find that disagreements about the
 mean of the current- and next-period public information lead to trading in
 stocks in the current period but have no effect on options trading.
 Without options, we find that disagreements about the precision of all
 past and current public information affect trading in stocks in the
 current period. With options, only disagreements about the precisions of
 the next- and current-period information affect stocks and options trading
 in the current period. Our results suggest that options trading is
 concentrated around information events that are likely to cause
 disagreements among investors, whereas trading in stocks may be diffusive
 over many periods.  The Author 2008. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org, Oxford University Press.

Title: Auctions vs. Bookbuilding and the Control of Underpricing in Hot IPO Markets 
Abstract:
  Market returns before the offer price is set affect the amount and
 variability of initial public offering (IPO) underpricing. Thus an
 important question is "What IPO procedure is best adapted for controlling
 underpricing in "hot" versus "cold" market conditions?" The French stock
 market offers a unique arena for empirical research on this topic, since
 three substantially different issuing mechanisms (auctions, bookbuilding,
 and fixed price) are used there. Using 1992--1998 data, we find that the
 auction mechanism is associated with less underpricing and lower variance
 of underpricing. We show that the auction procedure's ability to
 incorporate more information from recent market conditions into the IPO
 price is an important reason.   Copyright 2003, Oxford University Press.

Title: Hidden and Displayed Liquidity in Securities Markets with Informed Liquidity Providers 
Abstract:
 We examine the impact on the quality of a securities market of hiding
 versus displaying orders that provide liquidity. Display expropriates
 informational rents from informed agents who trade as liquidity providers.
 The informed then exit liquidity provision in favor of demanding liquidity
 where they trade less aggressively. Trading costs to uninformed liquidity
 demanders are higher, bid-ask spreads are wider, and midquotes are less
 informationally efficient when orders that provide liquidity are
 displayed. Our analysis suggests that market innovations, which might seem
 to favor the informed over the uninformed, can enhance market quality by
 intensifying competition among the informed.  The Author 2013. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: The Road Less Traveled: Strategy Distinctiveness and Hedge Fund Performance 
Abstract:
 We investigate whether skilled hedge fund managers are more likely to
 pursue unique investment strategies that result in superior performance.
 We propose a measure of the distinctiveness of a fund's investment
 strategy based on historical fund return data. We call the measure the
 "Strategy Distinctiveness Index" (SDI). We document substantial
 cross-sectional variations as well as strong persistence in SDI. Our main
 result indicates that, on average, a higher SDI is associated with better
 subsequent performance. After adjusting for risk, funds in the highest SDI
 quintile outperform funds in the lowest quintile by 3.5% in the subsequent
 year.  The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Volume: 11
Year: 1998
Abstract:
  While the literature usually justifies informational efficiency in the
 context of rationality, this article shows informational efficiency by
 applying the evolutionary idea of natural selection. In a dynamic futures
 market, speculators are assumed to merely act upon their predetermined
 trading types (buyer or seller), their predetermined fractions of wealth
 allocated for speculation, and their inherent abilities to predict the
 spot price, reflected in their distributions of prediction errors with
 respect to the spot price. This article shows that the proportion of time
 that the futures price equals the spot price converges to one with
 probability 1.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: The Evolution of Corporate Ownership after IPO: The Impact of Investor Protection 
Abstract:
 Panel data on corporate ownership in thirty-four countries between 1995
 and 2006 reveal that newly public firms have concentrated ownership
 regardless of the level of investor protection. After listing, firms in
 countries with strong investor protection are more likely to experience
 decreases in ownership concentration; these decreases occur in response to
 growth opportunities, and they are associated with new share issuance. We
 conclude that ownership concentration falls after listing in countries
 with strong investor protection, because firms in these countries continue
 to raise capital and grow, diluting blockholders as a consequence.  The Author 2009. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title: Price Discovery and Trading After Hours 
Abstract:
  We examine the effects of trading after hours on the amount and timing of
 price discovery over the 24-hour day. A high volume of liquidity trade
 facilitates price discovery. Thus prices are more efficient and more
 information is revealed per hour during the trading day than after hours.
 However, the low trading volume after hours generates significant, albeit
 inefficient, price discovery. Individual trades contain more information
 after hours than during the day. Because information asymmetry declines
 over the day, price changes are larger, reflect more private information,
 and are less noisy before the open than after the close.   Copyright 2003, Oxford University Press.

Title: Hedging, Familiarity and Portfolio Choice 
Abstract:
  We exploit the restrictions of intertemporal portfolio choice in the
 presence of nonfinancial income risk to test hedging using the information
 contained in the actual portfolio of the investor. We use a unique data
 set of Swedish investors with information broken down at the investor
 level and into various components of investor wealth, income, and
 demographic characteristics. Portfolio holdings are identified at the
 stock level. We show that investors do not hedge but invest in stocks
 closely related to their nonfinancial income. We explain this with
 familiarity, that is, the tendency to concentrate holdings in stocks to
 which the investor is geographically or professionally close or that he
 has held for a long period. We show that familiarity is not a behavioral
 bias, but is information driven. Familiarity-based investment allows
 investors to earn higher returns than they would have otherwise earned if
 they had hedged.   Copyright 2006, Oxford University Press.

Title: Sidelined Investors, Trading-Generated News, and Security Returns 
Abstract:
  This article studies information blockages and the asymmetric release of
 information in a security market with fixed setup costs of trading. In
 this setting, "sidelined" investors may delay trading until price
 movements validate their private signals. Trading thereby internally
 generates the arrival of further news to the market. This leads to (1)
 negative skewness following price run-ups and positive skewness following
 price rundowns (even though the model is ex ante symmetric), (2) a lack of
 correspondence between large price changes and the arrival of external
 information, and (3) increases in volatility following large price
 changes.   Copyright 2002, Oxford University Press.

Title: Why Does Financial Strength Forecast Stock Returns? Evidence from Subsequent Demand by Institutional Investors 
Abstract:
 Using institutional investor demand as a proxy for revisions in
 sophisticated investors' expectations, we test whether financial strength
 information is gradually impounded over time. Consistent with the gradual
 incorporation of information, financial strength predicts both future
 returns and future institutional investor demand. Further consistent with
 the gradual incorporation of information, more sophisticated transient
 (high-turnover) institutions respond to financial strength signals prior
 to less sophisticated, nontransient institutions. A number of additional
 tests suggest that financial strength forecasts stock returns, at least in
 part, because it forecasts institutional demand, and institutional demand
 drives prices.  The Author 2012. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: Do Behavioral Biases Adversely Affect the Macro-economy? 
Abstract:
 We investigate whether the adverse effects of investors' behavioral biases
 extend beyond the domain of financial markets to the broad macro-economy.
 Focusing on the income risk-sharing role of financial markets, we find
 that risk sharing is higher (more than double) in U.S. states where
 investors are more sophisticated and exhibit weaker behavioral biases. The
 potential for risk sharing varies geographically, but states with better
 risk-sharing opportunities are able to achieve higher levels of risk
 sharing only when investors in those states are more sophisticated.
 Collectively, these results indicate that investors' aggregate behavioral
 biases and their lack of financial sophistication adversely affect the
 local macro-economy.  The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: A New Approach to Measuring Financial Contagion 
Abstract:
  This article proposes a new approach to evaluate contagion in financial
 markets. Our measure of contagion captures the coincidence of extreme
 return shocks across countries within a region and across regions. We
 characterize the extent of contagion, its economic significance, and its
 determinants using a multinomial logistic regression model. Applying our
 approach to daily returns of emerging markets during the 1990s, we find
 that contagion is predictable and depends on regional interest rates,
 exchange rate changes, and conditional stock return volatility. Evidence
 that contagion is stronger for extreme negative returns than for extreme
 positive returns is mixed.   Copyright 2003, Oxford University Press.

Title:   The Effect of Public Information and Competition on Trading Volume and Price Volatility.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 23-56
Issue: 1
Volume: 6
Year: 1993
Abstract:
  In a one-period model of market making with many exogenously informed
 traders, we first show that the variance of prices and expected.trading
 volume depend on the public information released at the start of trading.
 This is accomplished by representing beliefs with elliptically countoured
 distributions, for which the form of optimal decision rules does not
 depend on the specific distribution used. Second, if the model is altered
 so that the decision to become informed is made endogenous, then the
 decision rules of the market-maker and infomed traders depend on the
 public information. Third, in a multiperiod model with many informed
 traders and long-lived private information, recursion formulas similar to
 those of Kyle (1985) hold for all elliptically contoured distributions,
 trading volume is autocorrelated, and, unless per period liquidity trading
 is bounded.away from zero as new trading periods are added, informed
 traders' profits vanish.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Suspicious Patterns in Hedge Fund Returns and the Risk of Fraud 
Abstract:
 Recent cases of hedge fund fraud have caused large losses for investors
 and have fueled the debate regarding the ability of regulators to oversee
 the industry. This article proposes a set of performance flags, based on
 suspicious patterns in returns, as indicators of a heightened risk of
 fraud. We collect a sample of hedge funds charged with legal or regulatory
 violations and find that funds charged with misappropriation,
 overvaluation, misrepresentation, or Ponzi schemes trigger the performance
 flags at a higher frequency than other funds.  The Author 2012. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: Return Decomposition 
Abstract:
 A crucial issue in asset pricing is to understand the relative importance
 of discount rate (DR) news and cash flow (CF) news in driving the
 time-series and cross-sectional variations of stock returns. Many studies
 directly estimate the DR news but back out the CF news as the residual. We
 argue that this approach has a serious limitation because the DR news
 cannot be accurately measured due to the small predictive power, and the
 CF news, as the residual, inherits the large misspecification error of the
 DR news. We apply this residual-based decomposition approach to Treasury
 bonds and equities and find results that are either counterintuitive or
 unrobust. Potential solutions, including modeling both DR news and CF news
 directly, the Bayesian model averaging approach, and the principal
 component analysis, are explored.  The Author 2009. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org, Oxford University Press.

Title:   Stock Price Distributions with Stochastic Volatility: An Analytic Approach.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 727-52
Issue: 4
Volume: 4
Year: 1991
Abstract:
  We study the stock price distributions that arise when prices follow a
 diffusion process with a stochastically varying volatility parameter. We
 use analytic techniques to derive an explicit closed-form solution for the
 case where volatility is driven by an arithmetic Ornstein-Ublenbeck (or
 AR1) process. We then apply our results to two related problems in the
 finance literature: (1) options pricing in a world of stochastic
 volatility, and (2) the relationship between stochastic volatility and the
 nature of "fat tailes" in stock price distributions.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title:   Information, Trade, and Derivative Securities.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 163-208
Issue: 1
Volume: 9
Year: 1996
Abstract:
  Hellwig's (1980) model is used to analyze the value of improving trading
 opportunities by more frequent trading in the underlying asset, or by
 trading in a derivative asset. With multiple trading sessions, uninformed
 investors behave as rational trend followers, while more informed
 investors follow a contrarian strategy. As trading becomes continuous,
 Pareto efficiency is achieved. With trading in an appropriate derivative
 security, Pareto efficiency may be achieved in only a single round of
 trading. All derivative claims are then priced on Black and Scholes (1973)
 principles and, in the absence of further supply shocks, no trading will
 take place in subsequent trading rounds.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Excess Comovement in International Equity Markets: Evidence from Cross-border Mergers 
Abstract:
 Using a large sample of cross-border mergers, we measure the effect of a
 change in location on systematic risk. When a target firm's location
 moves, a large part of its systematic risk switches from being related to
 its home equity market to that of the acquirer. On average, the change in
 betas is equivalent to an excess shift of about 0.5 in the target's beta
 from its home market to that of the acquirer. We test whether the change
 in systematic risk can be explained by fundamental factors related to
 changes in the operations of the firm or merger synergy and find that it
 cannot.  The Author 2009. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org, Oxford University Press.

Title: Investors' Horizons and the Amplification of Market Shocks 
Abstract:
 This paper shows that during episodes of market turmoil, 13F institutional
 investors with short trading horizons sell their stockholdings to a larger
 extent than 13F institutional investors with longer trading horizons. This
 creates price pressure for stocks held mostly by short-horizon investors,
 which, as a consequence, experience larger price drops, and subsequent
 reversals, than stocks held mostly by long-horizon investors. These
 findings, obtained after controlling for the withdrawals experienced by
 the investors, are not driven by other institutional investors' and firms'
 characteristics. Overall, the evidence indicates that investors with short
 horizons amplify the effects of market-wide negative shocks by demanding
 liquidity at times when other potential buyers'capital is scarce.  The Author 2013. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title:   Consistent Estimation of Cross-Sectional Models in Event Studies.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 343-65
Issue: 3
Volume: 3
Year: 1990
Abstract:
  Event studies often include cross-sectional regressions of announcement
 effects on exogenous variables. If the event is voluntary and investors
 are rational, then standard OLS and GLS estimators are inconsistent.
 Consistent ML estimators are constructed for a cross-sectional model of
 horizontal mergers relating announcement effects to exgeneous
 characteristics of firms and industries. The OLS and ML estimates differ
 dramatically for bidders but not for targets. The evidence suggests that
 managers of bidders, but not targets, have valuable private information
 about the potential synergies from proposed mergers.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title:   When Do Banks Take Equity in Debt Restructurings?
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 1209-34
Issue: 4
Volume: 8
Year: 1995
Abstract:
  This article examines the conditions under which bank lenders make
 concessions by taking equity in financially distressed firms. I show that
 the role banks play in debt restructurings depends on the financial
 condition of the firm, the existence of public debt in the firm's capital
 structure and the ability of public debt to be restructured. Empirically,
 I find that for firms with public debt outstanding, banks never make
 concessions unless public debtholders also restructure their claims. When
 banks do take equity, on average they obtain a substantial proportion of
 the firm's stock, and they maintain their position for over two years.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Crisis Resolution and Bank Liquidity 
Abstract:
 What is the effect of financial crises and their resolution on banks'
 choice of liquidity? When banks have relative expertise in employing risky
 assets, the market for these assets clears only at fire-sale prices
 following a large number of bank failures. The gains from acquiring assets
 at fire-sale prices make it attractive for banks to hold liquid assets.
 The resulting choice of bank liquidity is countercyclical, inefficiently
 low during economic booms but excessively high during crises. We present
 evidence consistent with these predictions. While interventions to resolve
 banking crises may be desirable ex post, they affect bank liquidity in
 subtle ways: Liquidity support to failed banks or unconditional support to
 surviving banks reduces incentives to hold liquidity, whereas support to
 surviving banks conditional on their liquid asset holdings has the
 opposite effect.  The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: International Evidence on Cash Holdings and Expected Managerial Agency Problems 
Abstract:
 This article uses managerial control rights data for over 5000 firms from
 31 countries to examine the net costs and benefits of cash holdings. We
 find that when external country-level shareholder protection is weak, firm
 values are lower when controlling managers hold more cash. Further, when
 external shareholder protection is weak we find that firm values are
 higher when controlling managers pay dividends. Only when external
 shareholder protection is strong do we find that cash held by controlling
 managers is unrelated to firm value, consistent with generally prevailing
 U.S. and international evidence.  , Oxford University Press.

Title:   The Role of Games in Security Design.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 327-67
Issue: 2
Volume: 8
Year: 1995
Abstract:
  We contend that security design should be approached as a problem of game
 design. That is, contracts should specify the procedures that govern the
 behavior of contract participants in determining outcomes as well as the
 allocations resulting from those outcomes. We characterize optimal
 contracts in two nested classes: all contracts including those that depend
 on the state) and state-independent contracts. We demonstrate that, in
 situations in which the dependence of contracts on the state is limited,
 contracts designed as games can improve the allocation of resources
 relative to nonstrategic allocation rules.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title:   Short-Term Interest Rates as Subordinated Diffusions.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 525-77
Issue: 3
Volume: 10
Year: 1997
Abstract:
  In this article we characterize and estimate the process for short-term
 interest rates using federal funds interest rate data. We presume that we
 are observing a discrete-time sample of a stationary scalar diffusion. We
 concentrate on a class of models in which the local volatility elasticity
 is constant and the drift has a flexible specification. To accommodate
 missing observations and to break the link between "economic time" and
 calendar time, we model the sampling scheme as an increasing process that
 is not directly observed. We propose and implement two new methods for
 estimation. We find evidence for a volatility elasticity between one and
 one-half and two. When interest rates are high, local mean reversion is
 small and the mechanism for inducing stationarity is the increased
 volatility of the diffusion process. Coauthors are Lars Peter Hansen, Erzo
 G. J. Luttmer, and Jose A. Scheinkman.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Internal Governance Mechanisms and Operational Performance: Evidence from Index Mutual Funds 
Abstract:
 We provide new evidence linking board characteristics and performance.
 Using manually collected governance data from the mutual fund industry, we
 find an inverse relation between board size and fund performance. We also
 find evidence that organizational form plays an important role in
 determining operational performance. Overall, the results are consistent
 with the notion that there may not be a single optimal board structure
 that is applicable to all funds, that attempts to regulate board
 attributes should be considered with caution, and that sponsor-level
 factors are important board structure considerations.  The Author 2009. Published by Oxford University Press [on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies]. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title: Option Coskewness and Capital Asset Pricing 
Abstract:
  This article shows how the market coskewness model of Rubinstein (1973)
 and Kraus and Litzenberger (1976) is altered when a nonredundant call
 option is optimally traded. Owing to the option's nonredundancy, the
 economy's stochastic discount factor (SDF) depends not only on the market
 return and the square of the market return but also on the option return,
 the square of the option return, and the product of the market and option
 returns. This leads to an asset pricing model in which the expected return
 on any risky asset depends explicitly on the asset's coskewness with
 option returns. The empirical results show that the option coskewness
 model outperforms several competing benchmark models. Furthermore, option
 coskewness captures some of the same risks as the Fama--French factors
 small minus big (SMB) and high minus low (HML). These results suggest that
 the factors that drive the pricing of nonredundant options are also
 important for pricing risky equities.(JEL G11, G12, D61)   Copyright 2006, Oxford University Press.

Title: Do Analysts Herd? An Analysis of Recommendations and Market Reactions 
Abstract:
 This article develops and implements a new test to investigate whether
 sell-side analysts herd around the consensus when they make stock
 recommendations. Our empirical results support the herding hypothesis.
 Stock price reactions following recommendation revisions are stronger when
 the new recommendation is away from the consensus than when it is closer
 to it, indicating that the market recognizes analysts' tendency to herd.
 We find that analysts from larger brokerages, analysts following stocks
 with smaller dispersion across recommendations, and analysts who make less
 frequent revisions are more likely to herd.  The Author 2009. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title: Out-of-Sample Equity Premium Prediction: Combination Forecasts and Links to the Real Economy 
Abstract:
 Welch and Goyal (2008) find that numerous economic variables with
 in-sample predictive ability for the equity premium fail to deliver
 consistent out-of-sample forecasting gains relative to the historical
 average. Arguing that model uncertainty and instability seriously impair
 the forecasting ability of individual predictive regression models, we
 recommend combining individual forecasts. Combining delivers statistically
 and economically significant out-of-sample gains relative to the
 historical average consistently over time. We provide two empirical
 explanations for the benefits of forecast combination: (i) combining
 forecasts incorporates information from numerous economic variables while
 substantially reducing forecast volatility; (ii) combination forecasts are
 linked to the real economy.  The Author 2009. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org, Oxford University Press.

Title: Are "Market Neutral" Hedge Funds Really Market Neutral? 
Abstract:
 Using a variety of different definitions of "neutrality," this study
 presents significant evidence against the neutrality to market risk of
 hedge funds in a range of style categories. I generalize standard
 definitions of "market neutrality," and propose five different neutrality
 concepts. I suggest statistical tests for each neutrality concept, and
 apply these tests to a database of monthly returns on 1423 hedge funds
 from five style categories. For the "market neutral" style, approximately
 one-quarter of the funds exhibit significant exposure to market risk; this
 proportion is statistically significantly different from zero, but less
 than the proportion of significant exposures for other hedge fund styles.  The Author 2008. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org, Oxford University Press.

Title: Out of the Dark: Hedge Fund Reporting Biases and Commercial Databases 
Abstract:
 We examine the potential for selection bias in voluntarily reported hedge
 fund performance data. We construct a set of hedge fund returns that have
 never been reported to a commercial hedge fund database. These returns
 allow a direct comparison of performance between funds that choose to
 report to commercial databases and funds that do not. We find that funds
 that report their performance to commercial databases significantly
 outperform nonreporting funds. Our results suggest that the voluntarily
 reported performance in commercial databases suffers from a selection bias
 that may exaggerate the average skill of the universe of hedge fund
 managers.  The Author 2012. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please <email>e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com.</email>, Oxford University Press.

Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 1203-18
Issue: 5
Volume: 12
Year: 1999
Abstract:
  We account for the relation between stock returns and inflation with two
 independent disturbances: supply shocks and demand shocks. Supply shocks
 reflect real output shocks and cause a negative relation between stock
 returns and inflation, while demand shocks are mainly due to monetary
 shocks and generate a positive relation between stock returns and
 inflation. We show, both theoretically and empirically, that the stock
 return-inflation relation varies over time and across countries, depending
 on the relative importance of the two types of shocks. Our empirical
 evidence is based on pre- and postwar periods in the United States, as
 well as the postwar period in the United Kingdom, Japan, Germany.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Price Drift as an Outcome of Differences in Higher-Order Beliefs 
Abstract:
 Motivated by the insight of Keynes (1936) on the importance of
 higher-order beliefs in financial markets, we examine the role of such
 beliefs in generating drift in asset prices. We show that in a dynamic
 setting, a higher-order difference of opinions is necessary for
 heterogeneous beliefs to generate price drift. Such drift does not arise
 in standard difference of opinion models, since investors' beliefs are
 assumed to be common knowledge. Our results stand in contrast to those of
 Allen, Morris, and Shin (2006) and others, as we argue that in rational
 expectation equilibria, heterogeneous beliefs do not lead to price drift.  The Author 2009. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org, Oxford University Press.

Title:   Pricing Mortgage-Backed Securities in a Multifactor Interest Rate Environment: A Multivariate Density Estimation Approach.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 405-46
Issue: 2
Volume: 10
Year: 1997
Abstract:
  Multivariate density estimation (MDE) suggests that mortgage-backed
 security (MBS) prices can be well described as a function of the level and
 slope of the term structure. We analyze bow this function varies across
 MBSs with different coupons. An important finding is that the interest
 rate level proxies for the moneyness of the option, the expected level of
 prepayments, and the average life of the cash flows, while the term
 structure slope controls for the average rate at which these cash flows
 should be discounted. Though the origination and prepayment behavior of
 mortgages differ substantially across coupons, there remains an
 unexplained common factor in MBS prices. This factor does not seem to be
 related to the usual suspects and therefore presents a puzzle to financial

Title: No Place Like Home: Familiarity in Mutual Fund Manager Portfolio Choice 
Abstract:
 We show that familiarity affects the portfolio decisions of mutual fund
 managers. Controlling for fund location, funds overweight stocks from
 their managers' home states by 12% compared with their peers. In
 team-managed funds, home-state overweighting is 37% larger than the fund
 location effect. The home-state bias is stronger if the manager is
 inexperienced, is resource-constrained, or spent more time in his home
 state. Home-state stocks do not outperform other holdings, confirming that
 home-state investments are not informed. The overweighting also leads to
 excessively risky portfolios.  The Author 2012. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: Trading Restrictions and Stock Prices 
Abstract:
 I examine a series of stock splits in Japan in which firms restrict the
 ability of their investors to sell their shares for a period of
 approximately 2 months. By removing potential sellers from the market, the
 restrictions have the effect of increasing the impact of trading on
 prices. The greater the desire of investors to trade, and the greater the
 restrictions, the larger the impact of the restrictions. In the data,
 particularly severe restrictions are associated with returns of over 30%
 around the ex-date, most of which are reversed when investors are allowed
 to sell again. Firms are more likely to issue equity or redeem convertible
 debt during the restricted period, suggesting strong incentives for
 manipulation.  The Author 2008. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org, Oxford University Press.

Title:   Option Pricing and the Martingale Restriction.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 1091-1124
Issue: 4
Volume: 8
Year: 1995
Abstract:
  In the absence of frictions, the value of the underlying asset implied by
 option prices must equal its actual market value. With frictions, however,
 this requirement need not hold. Using S&P 100 index options data, I find
 that the implied cost of the index is significantly higher in the options
 market than in the stock market, and is directly related to measures of
 transaction costs and liquidity. I show that the Black-Scholes model has
 strong bid-ask spread, trading volume, and open interest biases. Option
 pricing models that relax the martingale restriction perform significantly
 better.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title:   Trade Credit and Credit Rationing.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 903-37
Issue: 4
Volume: 10
Year: 1997
Abstract:
  Asymmetric information between banks and firms can preclude financing of
 valuable projects. Trade credit alleviates this problem by incorporating
 in the lending relation the private information held by suppliers about
 their customers. Incentive compatibility conditions prevent collusion
 between two of the agents (e.g., the buyer and the seller) against the
 third (e.g., the bank). Consistent with the empirical findings of Petersen
 and Rajan (1995), firms without relationships with banks resort more to
 trade credit, and sellers with greater ability to generate cash lows
 provide more trade credit. Finally, small firms react to monetary
 contractions by using trade credit, consistent with the empirical results
 of Nilsen (1994).   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: An Isomorphism Between Asset Pricing Models With and Without Linear Habit Formation 
Abstract:
  We show an isomorphism between optimal portfolio selection or competitive
 equilibrium models with utilities incorporating linear habit formation,
 and corresponding models without habit formation. The isomorphism can be
 used to mechanically transform known solutions not involving habit
 formation to corresponding solutions with habit formation. For example,
 the Constantinides (1990) and Ingersoll (1992) solutions are mechanically
 obtained from the familiar Merton solutions for the additive utility case,
 without recourse to a Bellman equation or first-order conditions. More
 generally, recent solutions to portfolio selection problems with recursive
 utility and a stochastic investment opportunity set are readily
 transformed to novel solutions of corresponding problems with utility that
 combines recursivity with habit formation. The methodology also applies in
 the context of Hindy--Huang--Kreps (1992) preferences, where our
 isomorphism shows that the solution obtained by Hindy and Huang (1993) can
 be mechanically transformed to Dybvig's (1995) solution to the optimal
 consumption-investment problem with consumption ratcheting.   Copyright 2002, Oxford University Press.

Title:   The Interaction between Product Market and Financing Strategy: The Role of Venture Capital.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 959-84
Issue: 4
Volume: 13
Year: 2000
Abstract:
  Venture capital financing is widely believed to be influential for new
 innovative companies. We provide empirical evidence that venture capital
 financing is related to product market strategies and outcomes of
 start-ups. Using a unique hand-collected database of Silicon Valley
 high-tech start-ups we find that innovator firms are more likely to obtain
 venture capital than imitator firms. Venture capital is also associated
 with a significant reduction in the time to bring a product to market,
 especially for innovators. Our results suggest significant interrelations
 between investor types and product market dimensions, and a role of
 venture capital for innovative companies.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title:   Systematic Risk, Hedging Pressure, and Risk Premiums in Futures Markets.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 637-67
Issue: 4
Volume: 5
Year: 1992
Abstract:
  I examine the uniformity of risk pricing in futures and asset markets.
 Tests against a general alternative do not reject complete integration of
 futures and asset markets. As predicted, estimates of the "zero-beta" rate
 for futures are close to zero, and premiums for systematic risk do not
 differ significantly across assets and futures. There is, however,
 evidence consistent with a specific alternative model presented by
 Hirshleifer (1988). Returns in foreign currency and agricultural futures
 vary with the net holdings of hedgers, after controlling for systematic
 risk. These results imply a degree of market segmentation and support
 hedging pressure as a determinant of futures premiums.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Information Leakage and Market Efficiency 
Abstract:
  This article analyzes the effects of information leakage on trading
 behavior and market efficiency. A trader who receives a noisy signal about
 a forthcoming public announcement can exploit it twice. First, when he
 receives it, and second, after the public announcement since he knows best
 the extent to which his information is already reflected in the
 pre-announcement price. Given his information he expects the price to
 overshoot and intends to partially revert his trade. While information
 leakage makes the price process more informative in the short-run, it
 reduces its informativeness in the long-run. The analysis supports
 Securities and Exchange Commission's Regulation Fair Disclosure.   Copyright 2005, Oxford University Press.

Title: The Nature and Persistence of Buyback Anomalies 
Abstract:
 Using recent data, we reject the hypothesis that the buyback anomalies
 first reported by Lakonishok and Vermaelen (1990, Journal of Finance
 45:455--77) and Ikenberry, Lakonishok, and Vermaelen (1995, Journal of
 Financial Economics 39:181--208) have disappeared over time. We find
 evidence consistent with the hypothesis that open market repurchases are a
 response to a market overreaction to bad news: significant analyst
 downgrades, combined with overly pessimistic forecasts of long-term
 earnings. Stock prices after tender offers are set as if all investors
 tender their shares, but empirically they do not. Thus, the arbitrage
 opportunity persists because the market sets prices as if the average, not
 the marginal investor, determines the stock price.  The Author 2008. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org, Oxford University Press.

Title: Does Family Control Matter? International Evidence from the 2008--2009 Financial Crisis 
Abstract:
 We study whether and how family control affects valuation and corporate
 decisions during the 2008--2009 financial crisis using a sample of more
 than 8,500 firms from 35 countries. We find that family-controlled firms
 underperform significantly, they cut investment more relative to other
 firms, and these investment cuts are associated with greater
 underperformance. Further, we find that within family groups liquidity
 shocks are passed on through investment cuts across the group. Our
 evidence is consistent with families taking actions to increase the
 likelihood that the firms under their control and their control benefits
 survive the crisis, at the expense of outside shareholders.  The Author 2013. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title:   Recovering Risk Aversion from Option Prices and Realized Returns.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 433-51
Issue: 2
Volume: 13
Year: 2000
Abstract:
  A relationship exists between aggregate risk-neutral and subjective
 probability distributions and risk aversion functions. We empirically
 derive risk aversion functions implied by option prices and realized
 returns on the S&P 500 index simultaneously. These risk aversion functions
 dramatically change shapes around the 1987 crash: Precrash, they are
 positive and decreasing in wealth and largely consistent with standard
 assumptions made in economic theory. Postcrash, they are partially
 negative and partially increasing and irreconcilable with those
 assumptions. Mispricing in the option market is the most likely cause.
 Simulated trading strategies exploiting this mispricing show excess
 returns, even after accounting for the possibility of further crashes,
 transaction costs, and hedges against the downside risk.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title:   Nontraded Asset Valuation with Portfolio Constraints: A Binomial Approach.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 835-72
Issue: 4
Volume: 12
Year: 1999
Abstract:
  We provide a simple binomial framework to value American-style
 derivatives subject to trading restrictions. The optimal investment of
 liquid wealth is solved simultaneously with the early exercise decision of
 the nontraded derivative. No-short-sales constraints on the underlying
 asset manifest themselves in the form of an implicit dividend yield in the
 risk-neutralized process for the underlying asset. One consequence is that
 American call options may be optimally exercised prior to maturity even
 when the underlying asset pays no dividends. Applications to executive
 stock options (ESO) are presented: it is shown that the value of an ESO
 could be substantially lower than that computed using the Black-Scholes
 model. We also analyze nontraded payoffs based on a price that is
 imperfectly correlated with the price of a traded asset.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title:   Unconditional and Conditional Takeover Offers: Experimental Evidence.

Volume: 10
Year: 1997
Abstract:
  This article compares the predictions of finite-shareholder models of
 conditional and unconditional takeover offers with the outcomes of
 laboratory experiments. In addition to differentiating between types of
 offers, the experimental designs span small and large firms as well as
 different levels of offer premiums. It is found that in unconditional
 offers to large groups of subjects (28-40), the symmetric Nash equilibrium
 predicts observed tendering frequencies quite accurately. For other
 experimental designs, the results are mixed. The analysis of shareholder
 tendering strategies from the experiment yields insight into (i) the
 effects of takeover offer designs, (ii) the appropriateness of
 finite-shareholder models for research, and (iii) the costs of free riding
 when shareholders are nonatomistic.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Asset Pricing Models and Financial Market Anomalies 
Abstract:
  This article develops a framework that applies to single securities to
 test whether asset pricing models can explain the size, value, and
 momentum anomalies. Stock level beta is allowed to vary with firm-level
 size and book-to-market as well as with macroeconomic variables. With
 constant beta, none of the models examined capture any of the market
 anomalies. When beta is allowed to vary, the size and value effects are
 often explained, but the explanatory power of past return remains robust.
 The past return effect is captured by model mispricing that varies with
 macroeconomic variables.   Copyright 2006, Oxford University Press.

Title: Using Option Prices to Infer Overpayments and Synergies in M&A Transactions 
Abstract:
 In this paper, we use call option prices to identify synergies and news
 from merger and acquisition (M&A) transaction announcements. We find that
 M&A announcements result in large and approximately equal gains to the
 bidder and the target on average, with the combined gains being large
 enough to justify the premium paid to target shareholders. On average, M&A
 announcements release good news about targets, but bad news about bidders.
 This suggests that market prices understate true synergy gains, and helps
 reconcile the generally negative market-based evidence on value-creation
 in takeovers with their continued prominence in everyday business
 strategy.  The Author 2012. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Year: 1990
Abstract:
  This article is a reexamination of the clearing and settlement process in
 financial markets (particularly the futures market) and its performance
 during the 1987 stock market crash. It provides both some institutional
 background and some conceptual perspective on the problems faced by the
 system during the week of October 19. Much of the discussion is based on
 the useful analogies that can be drawn between the clearinghouse and other
 financial intermediaries, such as banks and insurance companies. A major
 conclusion is that the Federal Reserve played a vital role in protecting
 the integrity of the clearing and settlements system during the crash.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: If at First You Don't Succeed: The Effect of the Option to Resolicit on Corporate Takeovers 
Abstract:
  This article models, and experimentally simulates, the free-rider problem
 in a takeover when the raider has the option to "resolicit," that is, to
 make a new offer after an offer has been rejected. In theory, the option
 to resolicit, by lowering offer credibility, increases the dissipative
 losses associated with free riding. The outcomes of our experiment support
 this prediction and produce losses from free riding even higher than
 theoretically predicted. These dissipation losses reduce raider gains to
 less than 3% of synergy value of the acquisition   Copyright 2006, Oxford University Press.

Title: Economic Linkages, Relative Scarcity, and Commodity Futures Returns 
Abstract:
 This paper shows that economic linkages among commodities create a source
 of long-term correlation between futures returns. We extend the theory of
 storage to a multi-commodity level and find that the convenience yield of
 a commodity depends on its relative scarcity with respect to other related
 commodities. This implies a feedback effect between commodities that is
 necessary to replicate the upward-sloping correlation term structure of
 futures returns observed for related commodities. We present a
 multi-commodity affine model that validates our theoretical predictions
 and considerably reduces the pricing errors in out-of-sample crack spread
 options.  The Author 2012. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title:   Risk Aversion, Market Liquidity, and Price Efficiency.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 416-41
Issue: 3
Volume: 4
Year: 1991
Abstract:
  A model of a noncompetitive speculative market is analyzed in which
 privately informed traders and market makers are risk averse. Market
 liquidity is found to be nonmonotonic in the number of informed traders,
 their degree of risk aversion, and the precision of their information. It
 is also shown that increased liquidity trading leads to reduced price
 efficiency, and that, under endogenous information acquisition, market
 liquidity may also be nonmonotonic in the variance of liquidity trades.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title:   A Theory of Bank Regulation and Management Compensation.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 95-125
Issue: 1
Volume: 13
Year: 2000
Abstract:
  We show that concentrating bank regulation on bank capital ratios may be
 ineffective in controlling risk taking. We propose, instead, a more direct
 mechanism of influencing bank risk-taking incentives, in which the FDIC
 insurance premium scheme incorporates incentive features of top-management
 compensation. With this scheme, we show that bank owners choose an optimal
 management compensation structure that induces first-best value-maximizing
 investment choices by a bank's management. We explicitly characterize the
 parameters of the optimal management compensation structure and the fairly
 priced FDIC insurance premium in the presence of a single or multiple
 sources of agency problems.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title:   A Closed-Form Solution for Options with Stochastic Volatility with Applications to Bond and Currency Options.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 327-43
Issue: 2
Volume: 6
Year: 1993
Abstract:
  I use a new technique to derive a closed-form solution for the price of a
 European call option on an asset with stochastic volatility. The model
 allows arbitrary correlation between volatility and spot-asset returns. I
 introduce stochastic interest rates and show how to apply the model to
 bond options and foreign currency options. Simulations show that
 correlation between volatility and the spot asset's price is important for
 explaining return skewness and strike-price biases in the Black-Scholes
 (1973) model. The solution technique is based on characteristic functions
 and can be applied to other problems.	 Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Conditioning Information and Variance Bounds on Pricing Kernels with Higher- Order Moments: Theory and Evidence 
Abstract:
 We develop a strategy for utilizing higher moments, variance risk premia,
 and conditioning information efficiently, and hence improve on the
 variance bounds computed by Hansen and Jagannathan (1991); Gallant,
 Hansen, and Tauchen (1990); and Bekaert and Liu (2004). Our bounds reach
 existing bounds when nonlinearities in returns are not priced. We also use
 higher moments, variance risk premia, and conditioning information to
 provide distance measures that improve on the Hansen and Jagannathan
 (1997) distance measure. Empirical results indicate that when accounting
 for the impact of higher moments and variance risk premia, the existing
 pricing kernels have difficulty in explaining returns on the assets and
 derivatives.  The Author 2007. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org, Oxford University Press.

Title: What's Vol Got to Do with It 
Abstract:
 Uncertainty plays a key role in economics, finance, and decision sciences.
 Financial markets, in particular derivative markets, provide fertile
 ground for understanding how perceptions of economic uncertainty and
 cash-flow risk manifest themselves in asset prices. We demonstrate that
 the variance premium, defined as the difference between the squared VIX
 index and expected realized variance, captures attitudes toward
 uncertainty. We show conditions under which the variance premium displays
 significant time variation and return predictability. A calibrated,
 generalized long-run risks model generates a variance premium with time
 variation and return predictability that is consistent with the data,
 while simultaneously matching the levels and volatilities of the market
 return and risk-free rate. Our evidence indicates an important role for
 transient non-Gaussian shocks to fundamentals that affect agents' views of
 economic uncertainty and prices.  The Author 2010. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title: The Informational Role of Stock and Option Volume 
Abstract:
  This article analyzes the intraday interdependence of order flows and
 price movements for actively traded NYSE stocks and their Chicago Board
 Options Exchange (CBOE)-traded options. Stock net trade volume
 (buyer-initiated volume minus seller-initiated volume) has strong
 predictive ability for stock and option quote revisions, but option net
 trade volume has no incremental predictive ability. This suggests that
 informed investors initiate trades in the stock market but not in the
 option market. On the other hand, both stock and option quote revisions
 have predictive ability for each other. Thus, while information in the
 stock market is contained in both quote revisions and trades, information
 in the option market is contained only in quote revisions.   Copyright 2002, Oxford University Press.

Title: Measuring Equity Risk with Option-implied Correlations 
Abstract:
 We use forward-looking information from option prices to estimate
 option-implied correlations and to construct an option-implied predictor
 of factor betas. With our implied market betas, we find a monotonically
 increasing risk-return relation, not detectable with standard
 rolling-window betas, with the slope close to the market excess return.
 Our implied betas confirm a risk-return relation consistent with linear
 factor models because, when compared to other beta approaches: (i) they
 are better predictors of realized betas, and (ii) they exhibit smaller and
 less systematic prediction errors. The predictive power of our betas is
 not related to known relations between option-implied characteristics and
 returns.  The Author 2012. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title:   Pooling, Separating, and Semiseparating Equilibria in Financial Markets: Some Experimental Evidence.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 315-42
Issue: 3
Volume: 3
Year: 1990
Abstract:
  This study investigates experimental financial markets in which firms
 possess more information than do potential investors. Firms were given
 opportunities to undertake positive net present value projects which they
 could either forgo or finance by selling equity. Auctions were conducted
 among the investors for the right to finance the projects. When the
 theoretical equilibrium was unique, theory predicted well. When theory
 permitted pooling, separation, and semiseparation, only the more efficient
 pooling equilibrium was observed. The domination of the pooling
 equilibrium was robust to different experimental experiences by
 participants. When available, signals were used by good firms to
 distinguish themselves from bad.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Volume: 10
Year: 1997
Abstract:
  This article examines debt securities underwritten by Section 20
 subsidiaries of bank holding companies relative to those underwritten by
 investment houses. Consistent with a net certification effects for banks,
 bank underwriting of lower credit rated firms to whom the bank lends
 results in relatively higher prices (lower yields). We find no evidence of
 conflicts of interest even when an issue is used to repay bank debt.
 Further, banks bring a relatively larger proportion of small issues to the
 market. Contrary to the contention that universal banking stunts
 availability of finance to small firms, bank underwritings appear to
 benefit small firms.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: The Sensitivity of Corporate Cash Holdings to Corporate Governance 
Abstract:
 The average cash holdings of Chinese-listed firms decreased significantly
 after the split share structure reform in China, which specified a process
 that allowed previously nontradable shares held by controlling
 shareholders to be freely tradable on the exchanges. The reduction in cash
 holdings is greater for firms with weaker governance and firms facing more
 financial constraints prior to the reform. The reform also significantly
 reduced the average corporate savings rate, as measured by
 cash-to-cash-flow sensitivity. These findings are consistent with the
 premise that the reform removed a significant market friction, which led
 to better incentive alignment between controlling shareholders and
 minority shareholders and relaxed financial constraints. Additional
 analyses show that the reform affects firms' cash management policies,
 investment decisions, dividend payout policies, and financing choices
 differently in private firms than in state-owned enterprises.  The Author 2012. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title:   The Valuation of Nonsystematic Risks and the Pricing of Swedish Lottery Bonds.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 447-80
Issue: 2
Volume: 10
Year: 1997
Abstract:
  Swedish government lottery bonds have coupon payments determined by
 lottery. They offer a unique opportunity to study a security with
 uncertain payoffs having a known, observable distribution. The risk
 associated with the lotteries is idiosyncratic by construction and should
 not command a risk premium in equilibrium. The bonds are traded in two
 forms, allowing us to evaluate the rewards to bearing extra lottery risk.
 Despite its idiosyncratic nature, we find prices appear to reflect
 aversion to this risk. We evaluate the empirical determinants of this
 differential pricing and possible explanations for it.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Year: 1990
Abstract:
  This article analyzes the behavior of stock return volatility using daily
 data from 1885 through 1988. The October 1987 stock market crash was
 unusual in many ways. October 19 was the largest percentage change in
 market value in over 29,000 days. Stock volatility jumped dramatically
 during and after the crash. Nevertheless, it returned to lower, more
 normal levels more quickly than past experience predicted. The author uses
 data on implied volatilities from call option prices and estimates of
 volatility from futures contracts on stock indexes to confirm this result.

Title: Creditor Control Rights, Corporate Governance, and Firm Value 
Abstract:
 We provide evidence that creditors play an active role in the governance
 of corporations well outside of payment default states. By examining the
 Securities and Exchange Commission's filings of all U.S. nonfinancial
 firms from 1996 through 2008, we document that, in any given year, between
 10% and 20% of firms report being in violation of a financial covenant in
 a credit agreement. We show that violations are followed immediately by a
 decline in acquisitions and capital expenditures, a sharp reduction in
 leverage and shareholder payouts, and an increase in CEO turnover. The
 changes in the investment and financing behavior of violating firms
 coincide with amended credit agreements that contain stronger restrictions
 on firm decision-making; changes in the management of violating firms
 suggest that creditors also exert informal influence on corporate
 governance. Finally, we show that firm operating and stock price
 performance improve post-violation. We conclude that actions taken by
 creditors increase the value of the average violating firm.  The Author 2012. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: Bank Competition and Credit Standards 
Abstract:
  This article offers an explanation for the substantial variation of
 credit standards and price competition among banks over the business
 cycle. As the economic outlook improves, the average default probabilities
 of borrowers decline. This affects the profitability of screening and
 causes bank screening intensity to display an inverse U-shape as a
 function of economic prospects. Low screening activity in expansions
 creates intense price competition among lenders and loans are extended to
 lower-quality borrowers. As the economic outlook worsens, price
 competition diminishes, and credit standards tighten significantly.
 Deposit insurance may contribute to the countercyclical variation of
 credit standards.   Copyright 2004, Oxford University Press.

Title: Risk Shifting and Mutual Fund Performance 
Abstract:
 Mutual funds change their risk levels significantly over time. Risk
 shifting might be caused by ill-motivated trades of unskilled or
 agency-prone fund managers who trade to increase their personal
 compensation. Alternatively, risk shifting might occur when skilled fund
 managers trade to take advantage of their stock selection and timing
 abilities. This article investigates the performance consequences of risk
 shifting and sheds light on the mechanisms and the economic motivations
 behind risk-shifting behavior. Using a holdings-based measure of risk
 shifting, we find that funds that increase risk perform worse than funds
 that keep stable risk levels over time, suggesting that risk shifting
 either is an indication of inferior ability or is motivated by agency
 issues.  The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: Dividend Policies in an Unregulated Market: The London Stock Exchange, 1895--1905 
Abstract:
 Miller and Modigliani (1961) show that in perfect and complete financial
 markets a firm's value is unaffected by its dividend policy. Much of the
 more recent research has demonstrated that dividend policy becomes
 important in the presence of taxation, asymmetric information, incomplete
 contracts, institutional constraints, and transaction costs. By examining
 the effects of dividend policies on 475 British firms existing between
 1895 and 1905, and consequently operating in an environment of very low
 taxation with an absence of institutional constraints, we find strong
 support for asymmetric information theories of dividend policy, and little
 support for agency models.  The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 579-603
Issue: 3
Volume: 8
Year: 1995
Abstract:
  It is commonly believed that fragmented security markets have a natural
 tendency to consolidate. This article examines this belief focusing on the
 effect of disclosing trading information to market participants. We show
 that large traders who place multiple trades can benefit from the absence
 of trade disclosure in a fragmented market, as can dealers who face less
 price competition than in a unified market. Consequently, a fragmented
 market need not coalesce into a single market unless trade disclosure is
 mandatory. We also compare and contrast fragmented and consolidated
 markets. Fragmentation results in higher price volatility and violations
 of price efficiency.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Takeover Bidding with Signaling Incentives 
Abstract:
 This study examines takeover bidding contests in which privately informed
 bidders have incentives to signal high values to uninformed investors
 through their bids. Such incentives could arise in a large number of
 situations from financing and managerial concerns. The findings show that
 the dynamic nature of the takeover contests plays a critical role in the
 signaling process, allowing bidders to signal high values in two ways.
 Such signaling bears important consequences on the bids, the allocative
 efficiency, the target's and bidders' profits, as well as the winner's
 post-takeover stock price performance and volatility.  The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: Theory-Based Illiquidity and Asset Pricing 
Abstract:
 Many proxies of illiquidity have been used in the literature that relates
 illiquidity to asset prices. These proxies have been motivated from an
 empirical standpoint. In this study, we approach liquidity estimation from
 a theoretical perspective. Our method explicitly recognizes the analytic
 dependence of illiquidity on more primitive drivers such as trading
 activity and information asymmetry. More specifically, we estimate
 illiquidity using structural formulae in line with Kyle's (1985) lambda
 for a comprehensive sample of stocks. The empirical results provide
 evidence that theory-based estimates of illiquidity are priced in the
 cross-section of expected stock returns, even after accounting for risk
 factors, firm characteristics known to influence returns, and other
 illiquidity proxies prevalent in the literature.  The Author 2009. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org, Oxford University Press.

Title: The Role of Trading Halts in Monitoring a Specialist Market 
Abstract:
  When a collection of specialists organize as an exchange, each can reap
 net private benefits at the expense of the exchange by quoting a privately
 optimal pricing schedule. Coordination makes all specialists and customers
 better off, but requires a system of monitoring and punishment that breaks
 down when information asymmetries between the exchange and a specialist
 are high. The specialist may then seek a temporary trading halt to
 alleviate unjustified punishment, or the exchange may halt trading to
 prevent the quoting of damaging privately optimal pricing schedules. We
 test this theory on a sample of NYSE halts. As predicted, we find a
 significant increase in estimated information asymmetry immediately
 preceding trading halts.   Copyright 2003, Oxford University Press.

Title: Analysts' Weighting of Private and Public Information 
Abstract:
  Using both a linear regression method and a probability-based method, we
 find that on average, analysts place larger than efficient weights on
 (i.e., they overweight) their private information when they forecast
 corporate earnings. We also find that analysts overweight more when
 issuing forecasts more favorable than the consensus, and overweight less,
 and may even underweight, private information when issuing forecasts less
 favorable than the consensus. Further, the deviation from efficient
 weighting increases when the benefits from doing so are high or when the
 costs of doing so are low. These results suggest that analysts' incentives
 play a larger role in misweighting than their behavioral biases.   Copyright 2006, Oxford University Press.

Title:   Financial System Architecture.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 693-733
Issue: 3
Volume: 10
Year: 1997
Abstract:
  This article builds a theory of financial system architecture. We ask:
 what is a financial market, what is a bank, and what determines the
 economic role of each? Starting with basic assumptions about
 primitives--the types of agents and the nature of the informational
 asymmetries--we provide a theory that explains which agents coalesce to
 form banks and which trade in the capital market. It is shown that
 borrowers of higher observable qualities access the financial market.
 Moreover, a financial system in its infancy will be bank-dominated, and
 increased financial market sophistication diminishes bank lending.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title:   Trading Volume with Private Valuation: Evidence from the Ex-dividend Day.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 471-509
Issue: 2
Volume: 9
Year: 1996
Abstract:
  We test a theory of the interaction between investors' heterogeneity,
 risk, transaction costs, and trading volume. We take advantage of the
 specific nature of trading motives around the distribution of cash
 dividends, namely the costly trading of tax shields. Consistent with the
 theory, we show that when trades occur because of differential valuation
 of cash flows, an increase in risk or transaction costs reduces volume. We
 also show that the nonsystematic risk plays a significant role in
 determining the volume of trade. Finally, we demonstrate that trading
 volume is positively related to the degree of heterogeneity and the
 incentives of the various groups to engage in trading.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title:   Returns on Initial Public Offerings of Closed-End Funds.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 695-708
Issue: 4
Volume: 3
Year: 1990
Abstract:
  Examination of 41 closed-end fund intial public offerings (IPOs) during
 the period from January 1986 to June 1987 reveals that the mean intial
 day's return is not significantly different from zero in contrast to
 previous findings for nonfund IPOs. New funds also show significant
 negative after- market returns unlike other new issues. Despite the
 disparity between our findings and previous results, our results are
 consistent with existing models.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title:   Trade Credit: Theories and Evidence.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 661-91
Issue: 3
Volume: 10
Year: 1997
Abstract:
  Firms may be financed by their suppliers rather than by financial
 institutions. There are many theories of trade credit, but few
 comprehensive empirical tests. This article attempts to fill the gap. We
 focus on small firms whose access to capital markets may be limited and
 find evidence suggesting that firms use more trade credit when credit from
 financial institutions is unavailable. Suppliers lend to constrained firms
 because they have a comparative advantage in getting information about
 buyers, they can liquidate assets more efficiently, and they have an
 implicit equity stake in the firms. Finally, firms with better access to
 credit offer more trade credit.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Asset-Backed Securities: Costs and Benefits of "Bankruptcy Remoteness" 
Abstract:
 This article focuses on a key property of asset-backed securities (ABS);
 namely, that ABS are designed to achieve "bankruptcy remoteness" of
 securitized assets from the borrowing firm. This provides lenders with
 protection from dilution that is not available with contracts such as
 secured debt. ABS allows firms to commit to more efficient investment
 decisions in bankruptcy. Securitization of replaceable assets (such as
 receivables) prevents inefficient continuation, but securitization of
 necessary assets can produce ex-post inefficiency, which favors secured
 debt. We test a prediction of our model using the LTV Steel bankruptcy, in
 which bankruptcy remoteness was successfully challenged. We find that ABS
 spreads for Chapter 11--eligible securitizers increased significantly more
 than spreads for Chapter 11--ineligible securitizers following LTV.  The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title: Lack of Anonymity and the Inference from Order Flow 
Abstract:
 This article investigates the information content of signals about the
 identity of investors and their role in price formation. Whereas we
 document that investors use multiple brokers, broker identity is
 nevertheless a powerful signal about the identity of investors who
 initiate trades. The market also correctly processes this signal: the
 permanent price impact of orders coming from different brokers fits the
 information profile of the investors associated with these brokers. Our
 results suggest that an increase in the degree of anonymity may render
 order flow less informative, which could explain why the literature has
 documented liquidity improvements in exchanges that reduce transparency.  The Author 2012. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Issue: 5
Volume: 12
Year: 1999
Abstract:
  For a sample of 1163 mutual funds started over the period 1979-1992, we
 find that fund initiations are positively related to the level of assets
 invested in and the capital gains embedded in other funds with the same
 objective, the fund family's prior performance, the fraction of funds in
 the family in the low range of fees, and the decision by large families to
 open similar funds in the prior year. In addition, consistent with the
 presence of scale and scope economies in fund openings, we find that large
 families and families that have more experience in opening funds in the
 past are more likely to open new funds.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title:   Equilibrium Dominance in Experimental Financial Markets.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 189-232
Issue: 1
Volume: 11
Year: 1998
Abstract:
  We examine the predictive power of equilibrium dominance in experimental
 markets where firms with investment opportunities have an informational
 advantage over potential investors and are permitted to purchase a
 money-burning signal. Equilibrium dominance often fails to predict well
 when a Pareto-superior sequential equilibrium is also available. Instead,
 equilibrium selection appears to be related to the potential earnings of a
 more valuable firm that can signal its type successfully by defecting from
 the sequential equilibrium. Potential investors formulate their bids for
 firm equity based primarily on expectations formed adaptively in response
 to signaling choices made by firms.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title:   A Markov Model for the Term Structure of Credit Risk Spreads.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 481-523

Abstract:
  This article provides a Markov model for the term structure of credit
 risk spreads. The model is based on Jarrow and Turnbull (1995), with the
 bankruptcy process following a discrete state space Markov chain in credit
 ratings. The parameters of this process are easily estimated using
 observable data This model is useful for pricing and hedging corporate
 debt with imbedded options, for pricing and hedging OTC derivatives with
 counterparts risk, for pricing and hedging (foreign) government bonds
 subject to default risk (e.g., municipal bonds), for pricing and hedging
 credit derivatives, and for risk management.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Finding a Good Price in Opaque Over-the-Counter Markets 
Abstract:
 This article offers a dynamic model of opaque over-the-counter markets. A
 seller searches for an attractive price by visiting multiple buyers, one
 at a time. The buyers do not observe contacts, quotes, or trades elsewhere
 in the market. A repeat contact with a buyer reveals the seller's reduced
 outside options and worsens the price offered by the revisited buyer. When
 the asset value is uncertain and common to all buyers, a visit by the
 seller suggests that other buyers could have quoted unattractive prices
 and thus worsens the visited buyer's inference regarding the asset value.  The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: Technical Analysis and Liquidity Provision 
Abstract:
  The apparent conflict between the level of resources dedicated to
 technical analysis by practitioners and academic theories of market
 efficiency is a long-standing puzzle. We explore a previously unexamined
 feature of technical analysis -- namely its relation to liquidity
 provision. We demonstrate that support and resistance levels coincide with
 peaks in depth on the limit order book and moving average forecasts reveal
 information about the relative position of depth on the book. Furthermore,
 we show that these relationships stem from technical rules locating depth
 already in place on the limit order book.   Copyright 2004, Oxford University Press.

Title: Disappearing Dividends, Catering, and Risk 
Abstract:
 Fama and French (2001a) show that the propensity to pay dividends declines
 significantly between 1978 and 1999. We examine this "disappearing
 dividends" puzzle through the lens of risk and report two main findings:
 (i) Risk is a significant determinant of the propensity to pay dividends,
 and it explains roughly 40% of disappearing dividends; (ii) We find little
 support for the view that disappearing dividends reflects firms' catering
 to transient fads for dividends. Absent risk controls, proxies for fads
 matter, but these proxies are insignificant once we control for risk. Our
 results are robust to an extensive battery of robustness tests that vary
 samples, time periods, proxies for fads, the types of empirical tests, and
 the nature of payout decisions made by firms.  The Author 2008. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org, Oxford University Press.

Title:   Strategic Responses of Incumbents to New Entry: The Effect of Ownership Structure, Capital Structure, and Focus.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 749-79
Issue: 3
Volume: 13
Year: 2000
Abstract:
  We examine how certain firm- and market-specific characteristics affect
 incumbent firms' responses to new entry into their local markets. Data
 comes from the discount department store industry where Wal-Mart entered a
 large number of markets in a short period of time. Consistent with
 existing research, larger and more profitable incumbents respond more
 aggressively to Wal-Mart's entry, while more highly levered incumbents
 respond less aggressively. Also, there is evidence that incumbent managers
 fight harder (possibly overinvest) when their job is at greater risk and
 high managerial ownership appears to reduce this agency problem. Incumbent
 firms behave differently in markets under attack by Wal-Mart than in
 markets not yet threatened, suggesting that some of the documented
 responses are specific to WalMart's entry.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Flow Toxicity and Liquidity in a High-frequency World 
Abstract:
 Order flow is toxic when it adversely selects market makers, who may be
 unaware they are providing liquidity at a loss. We present a new procedure
 to estimate flow toxicity based on volume imbalance and trade intensity
 (the VPIN toxicity metric). VPIN is updated in volume time, making it
 applicable to the high-frequency world, and it does not require the
 intermediate estimation of non-observable parameters or the application of
 numerical methods. It does require trades classified as buys or sells, and
 we develop a new bulk volume classification procedure that we argue is
 more useful in high-frequency markets than standard classification
 procedures. We show that the VPIN metric is a useful indicator of
 short-term, toxicity-induced volatility.  The Author 2012. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: The Real Consequences of Market Segmentation 
Abstract:
 We study the real effects of market segmentation due to credit ratings by
 using a matched sample of firms just above and just below the
 investment-grade cutoff. These firms have similar observables, including
 average investment rates. However, flows into high-yield mutual funds have
 an economically significant effect on the issuance and investment of the
 speculative-grade firms relative to their matches, especially for firms
 likely to be financially constrained. The effect is associated with the
 discrete change in label from investment- to speculative-grade, not with
 changes in continuous measures of credit quality. We do not find similar
 effects at other rating boundaries.  The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: Outstanding Debt and the Household Portfolio 
Abstract:
 This article examines the effect of household debt on investment
 decisions. We alter a simple portfolio choice model to allow households to
 retire outstanding debt and realize a risk-free rate of return equal to
 the interest rate on that debt. Using the Survey of Consumer Finances, we
 find that households with mortgage debt are 10% less likely to own stocks
 and 37% less likely to own bonds compared to similar households with no
 mortgage debt. We calculate the costs of nonoptimal investment in the
 presence of various forms of household debt. We find that 26% of
 households should forgo equity market participation&nbsp;on account of the
 high interest rates they pay on their debt.   The Author 2010. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title: Price Efficiency and Short Selling 
Abstract:
 This article presents a study of how stock price efficiency and return
 distributions are affected by short-sale constraints. The study is based
 on a global dataset, from 2005 to 2008, that includes more than 12,600
 stocks from 26 countries. We present two main findings. First, lending
 supply has a significant impact on efficiency. Stocks with higher
 short-sale constraints, measured as low lending supply, have lower price
 efficiency. Second, relaxing short-sales constraints is not associated
 with an increase in either price instability or the occurrence of extreme
 negative returns.  The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title: Design and Renegotiation of Debt Covenants 
Abstract:
 We analyze the design and renegotiation of covenants in debt contracts as
 a specific example of the contractual assignment of property rights under
 asymmetric information. Specifically, we consider a setting where managers
 are better informed than lenders regarding potential transfers from debt
 to equity associated with future investments. This simple
 adverse-selection problem leads to the allocation of greater ex ante
 decision rights to the creditor (the uninformed party), i.e., tighter
 covenants, than would follow under symmetric information. This corresponds
 well to empirical evidence indicating that covenants are very tight upon
 inception and are frequently waived (and never tightened) upon
 renegotiation.  The Author 2008. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title: Dynamic Equilibrium with Liquidity Constraints 
Abstract:
  This article studies an intertemporal economy with liquidity constrained
 and unconstrained individuals. We use a stopping time approach to solve
 the finite horizonconstrained consumption portfolio problem with constant
 relative risk aversion and to examine the structure of equilibrium. The
 impact of the constraint on the optimal consumption and the financing
 portfolio is assessed. The equilibrium state price density is related to
 the exercise boundary of an American-style contingent claim with nonlinear
 payoff. This stopping time characterization enables us to prove the
 existence of an equilibrium and can be implemented numerically. Properties
 of equilibrium bond and stock returns are examined.   Copyright 2003, Oxford University Press.

Title: What Matters in Corporate Governance? 
Abstract:
 We investigate the relative importance of the twenty-four provisions
 followed by the Investor Responsibility Research Center (IRRC) and
 included in the Gompers, Ishii, and Metrick governance index (Gompers,
 Ishii, and Metrick 2003). We put forward an entrenchment index based on
 six provisions: staggered boards, limits to shareholder bylaw amendments,
 poison pills, golden parachutes, and supermajority requirements for
 mergers and charter amendments. We find that increases in the index level
 are monotonically associated with economically significant reductions in
 firm valuation as well as large negative abnormal returns during the

Title: Tolerance for Failure and Corporate Innovation 
Abstract:
 Based on a sample of venture capital (VC)-backed IPO firms, we examine
 whether tolerance for failure spurs corporate innovation. We develop a
 novel measure of VC investors' failure tolerance by examining their
 willingness to continue investing in underperforming ventures. We find
 that IPO firms backed by more failure-tolerant VC investors are
 significantly more innovative and VC failure tolerance is particularly
 important for ventures that are subject to high failure risk. We show that
 these results are not driven by endogenous matching between
 failure-tolerant VC firms and start-ups with high ex ante innovative
 potential. We also examine the determinants of the cross-sectional
 heterogeneity in a VC firm's failure tolerance. We find that both capital
 constraints and career concerns can negatively distort a VC firm's failure
 tolerance. Less experienced VC firms are more exposed to these
 distortions, making them less failure tolerant than are more established
 VC firms.  The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title:   Understanding the Nature of the Risks and the
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 29-78
Issue: 1
Volume: 14
Year: 2001
Abstract:
  Buying recent winners and shorting recent losers guarantees time-varying
 factor exposures in accordance with the performance of common risk factors
 during the ranking period. Adjusted for this dynamic risk exposure,
 momentum profits are remarkably stable across subperiods of the entire
 post-1926 era. Factor models can explain 95% of winner or loser return
 variability, but cannot explain their mean return components are more
 profitable than those based on total returns. Neither industry effects nor
 cross-sectional differences in expected returns are the primary cause of
 the momentum phenomenon.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Asymmetric Information, Portfolio Managers, and Home Bias 
Abstract:
 We propose a model of delegated asset management that can explain the
 following empirical regularities in international markets: the presence of
 home bias, the lower proportion of mutual funds investing domestically,
 and the higher market value of mutual funds investing domestically. In the
 model, fund managers choose whether to specialize in domestic or foreign
 assets. Individual investors are uncertain about managers' abilities, and
 they are more informed about domestic markets. This makes domestic
 investments less risky and generates home bias. Home bias is magnified
 because higher-ability managers specialize in domestic assets, making them
 even more attractive to the investors.  The Author 2012. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Title:   Overreaction, Delayed Reaction, and Contrarian Profits.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 973-93
Issue: 4
Volume: 8
Year: 1995
Abstract:
  This article examines the contribution of stock price overreaction and
 delayed reaction to the profitability of contrarian strategies. The
 evidence indicates that stock prices overreact to firm-specific
 information, but react with a delay to common factors. Delayed reactions
 to common factors give rise to a size-related lead-lag effect in stock
 returns. In sharp contrast with the conclusions in the extant literature,
 however, this article finds that most of the contrarian profit is due to
 stock price overreaction and a very small fraction of the profit can be
 attributed to the lead-lag effect.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title:   An Analysis of Default Correlations and Multiple Defaults.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies

Issue: 2
Volume: 14
Year: 2001
Abstract:
  Evaluating default correlations or the probabilities of default by more
 than one firm is an important task in credit analysis, derivatives
 pricing, and risk management. However, default correlations cannot be
 measured directly, multiple-default modeling is technically difficult, and
 most existing credit models cannot be applied to analyze multiple
 defaults. This article develops a first-passage-time model, providing an
 analytical formula for calculating default correlations that is easily
 implemented and conveniently used for a variety of financial applications.
 The model also provides a theoretical justification for several empirical
 regularities in the credit risk literature.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title:   Testing Continuous-Time Models of the Spot Interest Rate.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 385-426
Issue: 2
Volume: 9
Year: 1996
Abstract:
  Different continuous-time models for interest rates coexist in the
 literature. We test parametric models by comparing their implied
 parametric density to the same density estimated nonparametrically. We do
 not replace the continuous-time model by discrete approximations, even
 though the data are recorded at discrete intervals. The principal source
 of rejection of existing models is the strong nonlinearity of the drift.
 Around its mean, where the drift is essentially zero, the spot rate
 behaves like a random walk. The drift then mean-reverts strongly when far
 away from the mean. the volatility is higher when away from the mean.	 Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title:   American Option Valuation: New Bounds, Approximations, and a Comparison of Existing Methods.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 1211-50

Year: 1996
Abstract:
  We develop lower and upper bounds on the prices of American call and put
 options written on a dividend-paying asset. We provide two option price
 approximations, one based on the lower bound (termed LBA) and one based on
 both bounds (termed LUBA). The LUBA approximation has an average accuracy
 comparable to a 1,000-step binomial tree with a computation speed
 comparable to a 50-step binomial tree. We introduce a modification of the
 binomial method (termed BBSR) that is very simple to implement and
 performs remarkable well. We also conduct a careful large-scale evaluation
 of many recent methods for computing American option prices.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Leasing, Ability to Repossess, and Debt Capacity 
Abstract:
 This paper studies the financing role of leasing and secured lending. We
 argue that the benefit of leasing is that repossession of a leased asset
 is easier than foreclosure on the collateral of a secured loan, which
 implies that leasing has higher debt capacity than secured lending.
 However, leasing involves agency costs due to the separation of ownership
 and control. More financially constrained firms value the additional debt
 capacity more and hence lease more of their capital than less constrained
 firms. We provide empirical evidence consistent with this prediction. Our
 theory is consistent with the explanation of leasing by practitioners,
 namely that leasing "preserves capital," which the academic literature
 considers a fallacy.  The Author 2008. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org, Oxford University Press.

Title:   The Risk in Hedge Fund Strategies: Theory and Evidence from Trend Followers.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 313-41
Issue: 2
Volume: 14
Year: 2001
Abstract:
  Hedge fund strategies typically generate option-like returns.
 Linear-factor models using benchmark asset indices have difficulty
 explaining them. Following the suggestions in Glosten and Jagannathan
 (1994), this article shows how to model hedge fund returns by focusing on
 the popular "trend-following" strategy. We use lookback straddles to model
 trend-following strategies, and show that they can explain trend-following
 funds' returns better than standard asset indices. Though standard
 straddles lead to similar empirical results, lookback straddles are
 theoretically closer to the concept of trend following. Our model should
 be useful in the design of performance benchmarks for trend-following
 funds.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: Model Uncertainty, Limited Market Participation, and Asset Prices 
Abstract:
  We demonstrate that limited participation can arise endogenously in the
 presence of model uncertainty and heterogeneous uncertainty-averse
 investors. When uncertainty dispersion among investors is small, full
 participation prevails in equilibrium. Equity premium is related to the
 average uncertainty among investors and a conglomerate trades at a price
 equal to the sum of its single-segment components. When uncertainty
 dispersion is large, investors with high uncertainty choose not to
 participate in the stock market, resulting in limited market
 participation. When limited participation occurs, participation rate and
 equity premium can decrease in uncertainty dispersion and a conglomerate
 trades at a discount.   Copyright 2005, Oxford University Press.

Title: Wall Street and Main Street: What Contributes to the Rise in the Highest Incomes? 
Abstract:
 We study how much of the top end of the income distribution is represented
 by four sectors--non-financial-firm top executives (Main Street);
 investment bankers and hedge, private equity, and mutual fund investors
 (Wall Street); corporate lawyers; and athletes and celebrities. Wall
 Street individuals comprise a higher percentage of the top income brackets
 than nonfinancial executives of public companies. While top executives'
 representation in the top brackets has increased from 1994 to 2004, Wall
 Street's representation has likely increased even more. We discuss the
 implications of our findings for different explanations for the increased
 skewness at the highest income levels.  The Author 2009. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title: Insider Trading Laws and Stock Price Informativeness 
Abstract:
 We investigate the relation between a country's first-time enforcement of
 insider trading laws and stock price informativeness using data from 48
 countries over 1980--2003. Enforcement of insider trading laws improves
 price informativeness, as measured by firm-specific stock return
 variation, but this increase is concentrated in developed markets. In
 emerging market countries, price informativeness changes insignificantly
 after the enforcement, as the important contribution of insiders in
 impounding information into stock prices largely disappears. The
 enforcement does not achieve the goal of improving price informativeness
 in countries with poor legal institutions. It does turn some private
 information into public information, thereby reducing the cost of equity
 in emerging markets.  The Author 2008. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org, Oxford University Press.

Title: Disagreement and Learning in a Dynamic Contracting Model 
Abstract:
 We present a dynamic contracting model in which the principal and agent
 disagree about the resolution of uncertainty, and we illustrate the
 contract design in an application with Bayesian learning. The disagreement
 creates gains from trade that the principal realizes by transferring
 payment to states that the agent considers relatively more likely,
 changing incentives. The interaction between incentive provision and
 learning creates an intertemporal source of "disagreement risk" that
 alters optimal risk sharing. There is an endogenous regime shift between
 economies with small and large belief differences, and an early shock to
 beliefs can lead to large persistent differences in variable pay even
 after beliefs have converged. Under risk-neutrality, "selling the firm" to
 the agent does not implement the first-best because it precludes
 state-contingent trades.  The Author 2009. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org, Oxford University Press.

Title: Ex-dividend Arbitrage in Option Markets 
Abstract:
 We examine the behavior of call options surrounding the underlying stock's
 ex-dividend date. The evidence is inconsistent with the predictions of a
 rational exercise policy; a significant fraction of the open interest
 remains unexercised, resulting in a windfall gain to option writers. This
 triggers a sophisticated trading scheme that enables short-term traders to
 receive a significant fraction of the gains. The trading scheme inflates
 reported volume and distorts its traditional relations to liquidity. The
 dramatic increases in the volume of trade on the last cum-dividend day are
 facilitated by limitations on transaction costs passed by the various
 option exchanges.  The Author 2009. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oxfordjournals.org., Oxford University Press.

Title: Optimal Corporate Governance in the Presence of an Activist Investor 
Abstract:
 We provide a model of governance in which a board arbitrates between an
 activist investor and a manager facing reputational concerns. The optimal
 level of internal board governance depends on both the severity of the
 agency conflict and the strength of external governance. Internal
 governance creates a certification effect, so greater intervention by the
 board can lead to worse managerial behavior. Internal and external
 governance are substitutes when external governance is weak (the board
 commits to an interventionist policy to induce participation from the
 activist) and complements when external governance is strong (the board
 relies to a greater extent on the activist's information).  The Author 2013. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.

Volume: 6
Year: 1993
Abstract:
  We explore the dynamics of a takeover bid. In contrast to preceding
 models, if the initial takeover bid is unsuccessful a raider is allowed to
 make a new tender offer in order to try and secure the remaining shares.
 Numerical analysis shows that the raider's tender offer rises over time as
 he accumulates more shares. The anticipation of a higher tender offer in
 the future makes shareholders more inclined to bold their shares and
 forces the raider to offer a higher premium than is predicted by static
 theories. As the time between tender offers goes to zero, we show
 analytically that the expected profit from engaging in a takeover goes to
 zero.	 Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title:   The Price of a Smile: Hedging and Spanning in Option Markets.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 495-527
Issue: 2
Volume: 14
Year: 2001
Abstract:
  The volatility smile changed drastically around the crash of 1987, and
 new option pricing models have been proposed to accommodate that change.
 Deterministic volatility models allow for more flexible volatility
 surfaces but refrain from introducing additional risk factors. Thus,
 options are still redundant securities. Alternatively, stochastic models
 introduce additional risk factors, and options are then needed for
 spanning of the pricing kernel. We develop a statistical test based on
 this difference in spanning. Using daily S&P 500 index options data from
 1986-95, our tests suggest that both in- and out-of-the-money options are
 needed for spanning. The findings are inconsistent with deterministic
 volatility models but are consistent with stochastic models that
 incorporate additional priced risk factors, such as stochastic volatility,
 interest rates, or jumps.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Abstract:
  The authors examine an adverse selection model of trading in which both
 informed and uninformed traders are rational, maximizing agents. Replacing
 the price inelastic "noise" or "liquidity" traders with strategic,
 utility-maximizing hedgers permits an explicit analysis of the uninformed
 traders' welfare, and demonstrates that several comparative statics
 obtained from the standard paradigm of Kyle (1984, 1985) are altered
 significantly upon endogenizing the trading motives of these agents. In
 contrast to extant models, market liquidity and price efficiency are both
 nonmonotonic in the number of uninformed hedgers in the market. Also, the
 welfare of hedgers monotonically decreases with the number of informed
 traders, despite greater competition between the informed.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Year: 1991
Abstract:
  It is demonstrated that markets in stock index futures or, more
 generally, in baskets of securities, provide a preferred trading medium
 for uninformed liquidity traders who wish to trade portfolios, because
 adverse selection costs are typically lower in these markets than in
 markets for individual securities. Thus, an explanation is provided for
 the immense liquidity and popularity of markets in stock index futures.
 Implications are also developed for the effect of the introduction of a
 basket on market liquidity and the informativeness and variability of
 component security prices, and for the price relationship between the
 basket and its underlying portfolio.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title:   An Examination of Changes in Specialists' Posted Price Schedules.
Journal: Review of Financial Studies
Pages: 681-704

Volume: 14
Year: 2001
Abstract:
  New York Stock Exchange specialists disseminate information to market
 participants by displaying price schedules consisting of bid prices, ask
 prices, bid depths, and ask depths. We examine how specialists update
 these price schedules in a simultaneous equations model. We find that
 changes in the best prices and depths on the limit order book have a
 significant impact on the posted price schedule, while the effects of
 transactions and order activity are secondary. Furthermore, we show that
 specialists revise prices and depths differently, but find no evidence
 that they revise the price schedule in response to changes in inventory.   Article published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Financial Studies

Title: The Flip Side of Financial Synergies: Coinsurance Versus Risk Contamination 
Abstract:
 This paper characterizes when joint financing of two projects through debt
 increases expected default costs, contrary to conventional wisdom.
 Separate financing dominates joint financing when risk-contamination
 losses--that are associated with the contagious default of a
 well-performing project that is dragged down by the other project's poor
 performance--outweigh standard coinsurance gains. Separate financing
 becomes more attractive than joint financing when the fraction of returns
 lost under default increases and when projects have lower mean returns,
 higher variability, more positive correlation, and more negative skewness.
 These predictions are broadly consistent with evidence on conglomerate
 mergers, spinoffs, project finance, and securitization.  The Author 2013. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com., Oxford University Press.
