Abstract: The sourcing policy of a multinational firm is the result of the firm&apos;s decisions as to which of its production facilities shall service its various final markets. There is an international network linking production to markets. Critical determinants of this policy are the firm&apos;s size, industry characteristics, and influences deriving from firm&apos;s natioanality of ownership. We suggest that the research intensity is an important influence on sourcing policy, particularly through its effect on the firm&apos;s internal exports.&copy; 1979 JIBS.

Abstract: Working capital literature is rather limited and the process of managing short&dash;term resources is not understood well by he academicians. In contrast the corporate managers are continuously involved in the working capital decision-making process, but their perspective is limited to the practice of their firm. In order to fill this gap in the working capital literature, a study of management perceptions of the working capital process was undertaken. A survey was used to collect the information from the sample of marketing, production, and financial executives in large corporations in Belgium, France, India and United States. The study intercepts management ranking of working capital objectives and indicates the need to improve finacial planning models to include explicitly short&ndash;run objectives; further, predictability of cash inflows and outflows is examined and the potential factors affecting the predictability are evaluated. Finally, this study examines the management perceptions of long-range objectives in order to provide a proper perspective to the short-run financial planning.&copy; 1979 JIBS.

Abstract: The yield levels and yield movements of Eurodollar rates are compared to yield level and yield movements of securities. Contrary to the previous studies, we could find no consistent and meaningful lead&ndash;lag relationship between U.S rates and Eurodollar rates. Additionally, we found that long&dash;term Eurodollar rates are not determined by long distributed lag of short&ndash;term rates. With and without capital controls and despite increased liquidity and more information there exist difference in yield levels and yield movements.&copy; 1979 JIBS.

Abstract: The central question that is examined empirically is the in this paper is: Do MNC stocks perform better than average market?Data for thirty U.S.-based multinational obtained from the CRSP files of the University of Chicago are analysed at two levels: return and risk-return. Jensen&apos;s risk-adjusted measure of performance is the analytical tool employed.Findings at both levels of analysis  strongly suggest that the MNC stocks do outperform the average market. This report is a part of an ongoing project and hence the findings are at best tentative. An attempt is now being made to differentiate on the basis of their business segmentation, scope of international asset mix, and other relevant dimensions that would shed additional light on the question.&copy; 1979 JIBS.

Abstract: This paper has three objectives: First to review the literature dealing with the assessment and evaluation of political risk by managers in international firms. Second, to build upon this literature by extending and more precisely defining the concept in a manner that facilitates integration into the planning or decision&ndash;making process. Last, the paper attempts to suggest fruitful directions for future research.&copy; 1979 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (1979) 10, 39&ndash;52

Abstract: This study reports the findings of a research project which focused on the stereotypes of United States purchasing managers have about industrial products manufactured in England, France, Italy and West Germany, as well as the United States. The objective of the research was to determine what stereotypes, if any, exist in the minds of industrial buyers as they consider industrial products from these Western European nations. The findings suggest that stereotypes do exist for industrial products being traded by these nations. Managerial implications for marketing managers are discussed.&copy; 1979 JIBS.

Abstract: Export profiles are combinations of objectives characteristics associated with exporting or  with not exporting. This note presents empirically derived exporters profiles and evidence regarding their correspondence with firms&apos; actual export behavior. An exploratory path model of export behavior is developed also from the profile data.&copy; 1979 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (1979) 10, 91&ndash;104

Abstract: Multinational corporations, for three decades the leading actors in an emerging global industrial system, are threatened by rising nationalism. If they are to continue to grow and develop, they must respond to both host and home country nationalism. The major driving force behind the growth of multinational companies to date has been the efficiency and effectiveness advantage which we call the leverage of multinational &ldquo;vertical&rdquo; system over the smaller national &ldquo;horizontal&rdquo; systems. Unless multinational articulate better both the gains of large vertical systems and the equitable distribution of these gains among the nations that are a part of their global system, their continued growth and role in the world economy are in jeopardy. Specifically, five scenarios for MNCs are envisaged in five different political-economic regions of the world.&copy; 1979 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (1979) 10, 98&ndash;104

Abstract: There is ample evidence that the number of divestments by multinational firms has been increasing. The explanation is mainly financial&mdash;namely, poor performance. However, a strategic dimension is becoming more apparent as some firms divest themselves of subsidiaries that do not &ldquo;fit&rdquo; even if they are profitable. Finally, organizational and personal factors definitely affect the decision-making process leading to divestment. In conclusion, divestment is becoming part of the repertory of multinationals, but we still lack comparative data about U.S.-based divestments.&copy; 1979 JIBS.
