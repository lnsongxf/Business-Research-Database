Abstract: The aim of this paper is to explain why government&ndash;controlled enterprises do or do not have international activities (essentially in the sense of foreign direct investments) and to explain the international operations of such enterprises&mdash; which of their major operating policy decisions are distinctive in any way and why. The paper arises from 304 interviews with leading executives, government officials,  union leaders, etc, throughout the nine EEC countries.&copy;1979 JIBS.

Abstract: The nature of coordination of practices between the headquarters and field operations has long been a matter of considerable importance to the management of research and development (R&amp;D). When the firm performs R&amp;D aboard, in foreign locations, the issue of coordination increases in significance. This article reports on interviews with 35 American and 18 European transnational corporations regarding the coordination of their foreign R&amp;D activities. Coordination practices are shown to affect the nature of R&amp;D performed aboard, the means of establishing R&amp;D aboard, the communication and control systems employed, and the patterns of invention and innovation.&copy; 1979 JIBS.

Abstract: The usefulness of profit maximization hypothesis in explaining the multinationalization of the industrial corporate entity has been validated time and again through various empirical tests. This study uses the profit maximization hypothesis as a basis for a model to explain the multinationalization of the banking firm. A testable equation is derived, and tests using OLS are conducted. Empirical results are presented that support the hypothesis.&copy; 1979 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (1979) 10, 36&ndash;52

Abstract: The basic question addressed here is: how did the 1971 changes in the exchange rate system affect investor perceptions of the risk and return characteristics of securities of national as opposed to multinational companies? Effects of exchange rates were tested by analyzing security returns for two large samples of firms, one national and the other multinational. The study concludes that international economic events differentially affected national firms and MNCs. Investor perceptions of MNC riskiness appear to have increased relative to national firms while MNC relative returns also adjusted upward.&copy; 1979 JIBS.

Abstract: Previous studies have analyzed the comovement of international stock returns during periods of fixed exchange rates[11,15]. Results of these studies have indicated an increasing correlation between U.S stocks and foreign stock returns. This paper explores the weekly comovement of international equity and long&ndash;term bond returns for nine industrialized countries&mdash;United Kingdom, United States, West Germany, Netherlands, Belgium, France, Switzerland, Italy, and Japan&mdash;during the period of floating exchange rates, 1973&ndash;1977. Results of this indicate (1) low correlations between U.S and foreign stock and long-term bond returns.(2) The necessity for adjusting for exchange rate movement before analyzing relative between countries; and (3) the importance of percentage changes in money supply, prices levels, and real gross national products are in determining the unadjusted asset returns and exchange rate movement.&copy; 1979 JIBS.

Abstract: The salient attributes of direct and indirect exporting methods of distribution were identified. Attitudes of three groups of executives (executives using direct exporting methods, executives using indirect exporting methods and nonexporting executives), were assessed towards the attributes. Attitudes were analyzed using ANOVA. The findings suggest that the three groups of executives hold significantly different attitudes about the attributes. The findings (1) Imply that executives using indirect exporting methods and nonexporitng methods are most alike in their attitudes; (2) offer an explaination for the tendency of executives to begin exporting with indirect methods and to switch to direct methods as exporting experience increases, and (3) identify the attitudes that each group of executives is most likely to hold.&copy; 1979 JIBS.

Abstract: The subject of foreign investments in U.S remains of high interest from both an academic and real world prospective. Since the 1970&apos;s, the flow of foreign investments has accelerated, and particularly since 1975.In 1975, the authors of this paper complied a directory of foreign manufacturing firms in U.S.11Arpan and Ricks, Directory of foreign manufacturers in the U.S., Georgia State University, 1975. The directory was the result of pulling together the known data available on foreign investors in U.S. as of 1974. So much has happened since then, however, that the authors have completed a 1979 edition. This note compares the two directories in order to make several rather interesting observations as to recent trends of foreign direct investments in the U.S.&copy; 1979 JIBS.

Abstract: State-owned enterprises are growing in relative importance both within various national economies and in international economic relations. Some facts concerning the practices of such enterprises and the consequences of their operations can be asserted with confidence. However, some major questions of fact and policy have yet to be resolved. Both areas are explored in the discussion below.&copy; 1979 JIBS.
