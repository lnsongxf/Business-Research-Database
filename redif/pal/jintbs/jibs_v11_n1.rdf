Abstract: This paper first sets out the main features of the eclectic theory of international production and then seeks to evaluate its significance of ownership- and location- specific variables in explaining the industrial pattern and geographical distribution of the sales of U.S. affiliates in fourteen manufacturing industries in seven countries in 1970.&copy; 1980 JIBS.

Abstract: This paper reports preliminary results of a study of how relatively large U.S. international firms asses noneconomic environment, how the resulting evaluations are integrated into decision making or planning, and how the process affects managerial strategy. A mailed survey of 455 firms was followed up by personal interviews with approximately 113 managers in 37 firms selected via a stratified quota sample of respondents. Findings support a conclusion that assessment and evaluation of nonmarket environments is emerging as a new managerial function in relatively large international firms. Over half of the respondents indicated that they have a group or groups which have been assigned formal assessment responsibility, both the survey results and interview data suggest a number of problems with current practice. Assessments appear to be reactive rather than active; the most important sources of information about environments are internal to the firm; assessments are typically not conducted independently of an investment or planning proposal; and resulting evaluations serve as a context in which decisions are taken rather than as input to a decision-making process.&copy; 1980 JIBS.

Abstract: This article complements a previous article on government-controlled enterprises. It examines the struggles, bargains, compromises and foul-ups between those influential players who determine these companies&apos; decisions and actions. The strategy of such firms is seen as a political resultant: to understand corporate behavior one must explain key individuals&apos; motivations, their stakes and stands and one must analyze their relative power and the pulling and hauling that occurs between them.&copy; 1980 JIBS.

Abstract: Multinational enterprises may choose to invest internationally through a newly formed subsidiary or by acquiring an existing company. In an attempt to isolate factors which might indicate a propensity to acquire rather than form subsidiaries, this study examined the characteristics of firms which have invested abroad. The results showed that firms with a higher percentage of investments through acquisitions did have some common characteristics. In addition, the nationality of the parent was found to be related to the propensity to acquire.&copy; 1980 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (1980) 11, 59&ndash;64

Abstract: The objectives of this paper were: 1) to determine if there exists an underlying dimensionality of opinion leadership across different cultural groups, and 2) to determine if this underlying structure can be used to identify opinion leaders for the purpose of targeting communications by multinational businesses to assist them in the diffusion of innovations and ideas. Opinion leaders were rated by students representing five different cultural backgrounds. Results tended to show that there is a set of common dimensions by which opinion leaders are evaluated, but that different cultures assign different weights to the dimensions.&copy; 1980 JIBS.

Title: Tax Incentive to Exports: Some Implications for Policy Makers

Abstract: The major research question of this study is: Do American manufactures view DISC (the tax incentive to export) as assisting them in becoming more competitive in export markets? The importance of this question was recognized by Secretary of Treasury Michael Blumenthal who included an earlier version of this study in the April 1979 Treasury Report titled &ldquo;The Operation and Effect of the Domestic International Sales Corporation (DISC).&rdquo; As such the study has received recognition at the highest level of policy making. This study is unique in two respects: 1) it examines the impact of the tax incentive on the firm&apos;s total marketing and promotional efforts. Other studies have examined only the relationship between the tax incentive and change in export prices, and 2) this study expands the investigation of sample firms to include small businesses as well as multinationals. The conclusions of this study (surveying 125 multinationals and 125 small exporting firms) suggest that DISC stimulated some marketing activities for small companies and was used as a tax shelter for large multinationals. The main policy implication is that as a tax incentive DISC is helpful in attracting small firms into export marketing.&copy; 1980 JIBS.

Abstract: This note shows that the explanation of Direct Foreign Investment based on the existence of a currency premium implies a bias in the home capital market of the multinational firm. An alternative and complementary explanation of the choice between Licensing and Direct Foreign Investment may be found in &ldquo;disagreements&rdquo; in the negotiations for a license.&copy; 1980 JIBS.

Abstract: This paper examines family decision-making roles among samples of consumers from the United States and Venezuela. The findings suggest considerable differences between the manner in which family purchasing decisions are made in the two countries for a wide variety of products and services. In general, the results indicate the dominance of the husband within the Venezuelan sample, whereas the U.S. sample is characterized by more joint husband/wife decisions.&copy; 1980 JIBS.

Abstract: The major objective of this paper is to provide a short review of the literature regarding investor evaluation of foreign operations of U.S.-based multinational companies. While U.S.-based multinational companies continue to expand overseas, this paper addresses the question: Do investor-owners recognize the advantages of international diversification of real assets provided by their investment in the shares of a multinational company as opposed to international portfolio diversification directly by these investors?This paper concludes that there seems to be a substantial body of evidence to indicate that an increasing proportion of internationality is associated with decreasing dependence on the domestic capital markets, decreasing systematic risk, and an increasing price/earnings ratio. Thus, U.S. investors are found to like and reward international operations of U.S. companies possibly because of the advantages of international diversification of real assets, the higher profitability and growth rates of foreign operations, or some other advantages enjoyed by multinational companies. These results imply that the risk-return characteristics of each foreign investment be used to determine an appropriate hurdle rate which may even be lower than the hurdle rate of a comparable domestic project.&copy; 1980 JIBS.

Abstract: In a comment [2] on our recent article [1] dealing with the stock market performance of a sample of U.S.-based multinational firms, the author reviews some interesting conceptual and empirical issues regarding the benefits of international diversification of real assets. While the author agrees generally with our findings, he contends that our results may somewhat understate the benefits of international diversification. He adds further that there exists enough evidence to suggest that investors do recognize the benefits of international diversification through investing in multinational firms.&copy; 1980 JIBS.
