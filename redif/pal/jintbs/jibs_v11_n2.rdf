Abstract: This article reviews the role of host country characteristics as determinants of foreign direct investment location patterns. It then analyzes the effects of corporate experience on location decisions. Prior experience in a host country is found to increase the firm&apos;s priority for projects in that country relative to other investment options. In addition, the experience level of the firm influences the relative importance of different country characteristics in determining location patterns. Inexperienced firms exhibit greater preference for near, similar markets than firms with broader international operating experience.&copy; 1980 JIBS.

Abstract: This paper provides information about the effect 14 variables have on transfer pricing decisions on 62 MNCs. Questionnaire data is factor analyzed and evaluated to determine whether significant differences exists when respondents are grouped alternately into five dichotomous categories: (1) those assessed compared with those not assessed additional U.S. federal income taxes because of transfer pricing methods, (2) those among the first 150 compared with those among the remaining 500 largest U.S. industrial firms, (3) those whose export sales exceed $25 million compared with those whose export sales do not, (4) those whose export sales to subsidiaries exceed 50 percent of total exports compared with those whose export sales to subsidiaries do not, and (5) those unable to use a market-based transfer price compared with those who are able to do so. By means of Student&apos;s t-test and 10 level of significance, it is determined that some variables and factors do have greater influence on transfer pricing decisions for some types of companies.&copy; 1980 JIBS.

Abstract: The fees or compensation charged by technology licensing companies to recipient firms overseas have long been subject to debate. Opinion has ranged from a cost-related pricing to a monopolistic pricing model where the price or compensation is considerably higher than the variable costs of effecting a transfer. The empirical study covering 102 technology licenses shows that whereas compensation levels greatly exceed transfer costs, statistically they are strongly related. Compensation levels are influenced by the extent of services rendered to the licensee and by his scale of production. Important differences were manifest between industrialized nations and LDCs, between product types, and between patented and unpatented technologies.&copy; 1980 JIBS.

Abstract: Relative to market size, would one expect advertising expenditures to be higher or lower in the developing countries as compared with the more developed countries? This paper discusses some features of the marketing environment in the developing countries in order to clarify some of the conceptual issues which advertising raises for optimizing marketing and public policy decisions in the LDCs. In addition, new measures of advertising intensity in less developed and more developed countries are presented. These provide an empirical basis for international comparisons of advertising-sales ratios as between more developed and less developed countries.&copy; 1980 JIBS.

Abstract: This paper present a model for appraising currencies that is based on an operational variant of purchasing power parity doctrine. The behavior of currencies under different exchange regimes&mdash;floating rates, strictly managed rates, crawling peg rates, and fixed exchange rates&mdash;is analyzed in detail. The results support this doctrine, provided the parity exchange rate is derived from an interrelationship of differentials in inflation rates and changes in exchange rates of trading partners, both appropriately weighted by trade shares. A discussion of forecasting implications concludes the paper.&copy; 1980 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (1980) 11, 80&ndash;90

Abstract: This paper makes a case that accounting is a professional function in which activities depend on the needs of those business groups it serves. As the information needs of these separate national business groups converge, there will be precipitated a parallel growth of an internationalized accounting community. This study investigates two hypotheses about the international linkage between accounting practices and the information needs of the financial community.&copy; 1980 JIBS.

Abstract: International diffusion of production technologies, along with their creation, is increasingly recognized to cause dynamic changes in the pattern of international trade and investment. This paper seeks to develop a link between innovations, diffusions, and international competitiveness in electronic calculators in order to provide a greater understanding of this dynamic process. The major findings of the study is that changes in factor intensities were responsible for international migrations of electric calculator technology between the U.S. and Japan. Another significant finding is that there is indeed an association between technology transfers and international trade.&copy; 1980 JIBS.

Abstract: Are U.S. manufacturers are losing their advantage in the production of high technology products? The study reported in this article investigates this question with regard to three U.S. industries. The export/import patterns of these industries are examined for the period 1963 to 1974 in order to determine the extent to which export losses were associated with import gains. Japanese export/import performance is examined for the three industries during the same period to provide a point of reference. The findings indicate that for two of the industries U.S. export market losses are not associated with comparable gains in imports, as might be expected if export market losses indicate a shift in competitive advantage. It may thus be necessary to consider other factors when attempting to explain the long-term contraction of the U.S. share of world export markets which has been occurring in some industries.&copy; 1980 JIBS.

Abstract: This paper describes a relatively simple algorithm to estimate the effective after-tax cost of different short term debt or time deposit options available to foreign affiliates of multinational companies. Cost or return is measured from the parent company&apos;s point of view taking into account nominal interest rates, exchange rates, relative taxes, and the accounting rules for computing translation gains and losses. Because these variables, with the exception of future exchange rates, can be known with almost complete certainty at the time of the decision, it is argued that a risk-adverse corporate treasurer should eliminate the remaining currency risk by systematically covering foreign currency loans or deposits.&copy; 1980 JIBS.

Abstract: It is almost always possible to find some fault with any published article. It might be argued, for example, that Donald Sternitzke&apos;s article, &ldquo;The Great American Competitive Disadvantage: Fact or Fiction&rdquo; (JIBS, Fall 1979, pp. 25&ndash;36) could be improved by performing sensitivity tests on various definitions given to the overall region and on the degree of aggregation employed in the establishment of commodity classes. Tests by others have shown that such variations in definitions have yielded significantly different results.11David J. Richardson, &ldquo;Some Sensitivity Tests for a &lsquo;Constant Market Shares&rsquo; Analysis of Export Growth,&rdquo; The Review of Economics and Statistics, August 1971, pp. 300&ndash;304.&copy; 1980 JIBS.

Abstract: In their comment on &ldquo;The Great American Competitive Disadvantage: Fact or Fiction?&rdquo;, D. Ricks, M. Czinkota, and G. DeJesus point out several criticisms of share analysis, especially those made by Houston [2] and Richardson [3, 4], and suggest that perhaps share analysis may be too suspect to be of much use. Because these issues&mdash;together with several other caveats on the use of share analysis&mdash;may have an influence on the results obtained, they are discussed in my article for the benefit of readers who are not familiar with the share-analysis technique. However, in their note, Ricks, Czinkota, and DeJesus fail to consider the reply made by Ashby [1] to the issues raised by Houston nor do they recognize that Richardson concludes his article by suggesting several ways to improve the results of share analysis rather than advocating that the method should not be used at all [3].&copy; 1980 JIBS.
