Abstract: The economic exposure of financial assets and liabilities of a foreign subsidiary depends mainly on the currency denomination and the commodity composition of future transactions. Country of residency of shareholders and parent corporations are of secondary interest. Accordingly, management of exposure presumes information about the denomination of future cash flows and future purchases. The decision on whether to centralize or decentralize exposure management must take into account the costs of collecting relevant information of this kind at different degrees of centralization.&copy; 1980 JIBS.

Abstract: This research traces, from 1900 to 1975, the rise of Tokyo to prominence as an international financial center in Asia by examining the evolution and development of seventeen Asian international financial centers. Cluster analysis is used to show the hierarchical structure of the international centers, over time. Stepwise multiple discriminant analysis is then used to verify the cluster analysis groupings, determine what factors caused the particular groupings, and rank the centers. The findings show clearly that Tokyo became Asia&apos;s preeminent &ldquo;banking&rdquo; center in 1960 and the preeminent &ldquo;financial&rdquo; center in 1965, but these results are at odds with the commonly held view that Singapore and Hong Kong are the region&apos;s top centers; in fact, Asia&apos;s second most prominent center is Osaka. The future implication and significance of Tokyo&apos;s (and Osaka&apos;s) financial leadership in Asia is discussed.&copy; 1980 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (1980) 11, 19&ndash;35

Abstract: The purpose of this article is to analyze the current offshore banking operations in the Caribbean by major U.S. commercial banks and to assess their problems and prospects in the future. Specifically, the study examines the aggregate sources and uses of offshore funds in the Caribbean, analyzes the national regulations and incentives applying to offshore banking, assesses the impact of this market on the economic development of the Southern Hemisphere, explores the factors that will shape the future of Caribbean offshore banking (including the internal dynamics of Eurocurrency operations, the regulatory environment of the market, and the recent proposals to permit offshore banking operations in the United States), and suggests ways for gaining greater economic benefits for the domestic economics of the Caribbean offshore centers.&copy; 1980 JIBS.

Abstract: The idea that the composition and organizational mode of a technology transfer between firms is a function of the recipient company&apos;s &ldquo;technical absorptive capacity&rdquo; and of the recipient nation&apos;s level of development has appeared in the literature without enunciation or testing. These hypotheses are tested using data for 33 countries.&copy; 1980 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (1980) 11, 47&ndash;62

Abstract: This article analyzes the changing pattern of advertisement strategy by Japanese business firms in the U.S. market. Taking the advertisement activities of four major industrial sectors that appeared in both Business Week and Newsweek during the 1965&ndash;1977 period as samples, this article has found that the Japanese advertisement strategy in the U.S. market has passed sequentially through the following four stages: (1) Nationality-Supportive, (2) Product-Attributes, (3) Challenge and Responses, and (4) World Market-oriented advertisement.&copy; 1980 JIBS.

Abstract: Experimental combinations of promotions and offers of free samples of a weaning food and a contraceptive were sent by mail to a sample of Sri Lankan households with recently born children. Based on responses to an initial mailing and a follow-up, promotions and offers significantly affected behavior, with impact greater for the weaning food than for the contraceptive. No significant gain in response resulted from joint promotions, but cost savings made joint promotion of both products to the same target group cost effective.&copy; 1980 JIBS.

Abstract: Research on international marketing effectiveness was done by interviewing 34 senior executives in U.S. and Canadian firms, mainly in the electronics, machinery, and autoparts industry sectors. The study concentrated on small&ndash; and medium-sized firms. The findings indicate the relative importance of an information and control reporting system, organization of the international division, involvement of top management, R &amp; D, technology, competitive pricing policy, marketing mix, and production function variables for international marketing effectiveness.&copy; 1980 JIBS.
