Abstract: Since World War II international business has moved through three general episodes and now stands on the threshold of a fourth. These episodes are defined by the number of actors relevant to corporation decision making. The immediate postwar decade is characterized as a two-actor era &ndash; the firm itself and its overseas commercial associates. During the so-called growth years, of 1955 to 1970, increasingly the political impact of, and the political response to, corporate strategy entered the decision-making calculus. During the 1970s, the &ldquo;time of trouble,&rdquo; the parent governments became increasingly active. The new international order which began appearing around 1980 introduced the multi-actor era in which a wide variety of international organizations and interest groups became relevant to corporate decision making, thereby introducing a new degree of uncertainty. Generally, academic research and teaching have lagged the reality. Even now, much attention is focused on the multinational corporation, a special form of international business organization which appeared during the 1950s and 60s and which now may be giving way to the international service and trading companies. The conclusion is that little research is being done on the internal dynamics of international business.&copy; 1981 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (1981) 12, 13&ndash;21

Abstract: The combined production of conventional energy sources &ndash; oil, natural gas, coal, and nuclear &ndash; in the United States is unlikely to increase substantially over the next 10 years. Thus, the United States must use its energy more efficiently in order to achieve its goal of maintaining satisfactory economic growth while reducing oil imports. But regardless of the U.S. picture, international trade in energy will continue to dominate the international business picture. Over the past 10 years, energy trade and resulting indirect trade effects have grown to account for about half of world trade; in turn, world trade has passed foreign direct investment in value. In the future, energy trade will be even more heavily influenced by government involvement. These trends have significance for the direction of international business research.&copy; 1981 JIBS.

Abstract: This essay assesses the forces and factors which are currently structuring international industry, focusing specifically on the impacts of government policies, the market orientations of TNCs, the nature of different markets around the world, and the effects of different technologies. These forces being uncoordinated are seen as shaping an international industrial order that is not consonant with the objectives of the New International Economic Order (NIEO); consequently, what is expected for the near term is a nationally oriented disintegration of the international economy resulting from struggles over the location of specific industries around the world that will not be resolved cooperatively. The most likely moves toward international industrial integration will occur within key sectors among members of a regional association. At present, it appears unlikely that significant moves will be made toward a new international industrial order in line with the objectives of the NIEO; yet, the TNCs would be effective means of achieving this goal if greater cooperation could be achieved between them and governments.&copy; 1981 JIBS.

Abstract: This paper first presents a taxonomy of the foreign direct investment theories following the market imperfections paradigm. It them focuses on recent developments pertaining to the theory of the multinational firm, specifically the appropriabillity, internalization, and diversification theories. Subsequently, the multinational phenomenon is seen as the result of an international differentiation of activities and an intrafirm integration across national borders &ndash; all this within a markets and hierarchies approach. Last, the paper points to areas for future research.&copy; 1981 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (1981) 12, 43&ndash;59

Abstract: This paper reviews the literature on Foreign Exchange Risk Management (FERM) which has burgeoned during the last decade. Scholars&apos; and practioners&apos; emerging interest in Foreign Exchange Risk Management was spurred by the advent of fluctuating exchange rates in the early seventies as well as by the pronouncement of the infamous FASB Statement No. 8 in 1976 which laid down unambiguous guidelines for consolidating financial statements of multinational corporations. A normative (rather than a market) view of Foreign Exchange Risk Management is taken and accordingly the author reviews first the two key informational inputs necessary for any Foreign Exchange Risk Management program: forecasting exchange rates and measuring exposure to exchange risk. Available decision models for handling transaction and translation exposures are reviewed next. A concluding section identifies gaps in the existing literature and suggests directions for future research.&copy; 1981 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (1981) 12, 81&ndash;101

Abstract: This paper reviews recent developments in models dealing with capital structure and cost of capital for the multinational firm. A number of issues which bear upon the financing decisions of the multinational corporation are addressed, and related to underlying theoretical and empirical questions with regard to the degree of segmentation or integration of international money and capital markets and the efficiency of the foreign exchange market. Data problems, areas of conflict, and topics for future research are identified. The paper concludes with a summary of financial policy prescribed for the firm by the present state of knowledge.&copy; 1981 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (1981) 12, 103&ndash;120

Abstract: The power of MNCs and corresponding pressures, especially from governments and trade unions, for higher levels of accountability has brought into focus the need for more information about MNCs as a basis for policy making at national and international levels. However, the problem of developing accounting standards of disclosure and measurement for MNCs is complex, multidimensional, and dynamic. This paper attempts to clarify some of the issues involved and to identify significant trends. The analysis centers on quired by the standards? Who should set the standards?&copy; 1981 JIBS.
