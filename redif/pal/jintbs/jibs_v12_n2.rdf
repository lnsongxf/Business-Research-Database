Abstract: This paper is part survey, part essay. The survey consists of a partial review of the literature on the subject of foreign direct investment in developing countries, with particular emphasis on conflict and its resolution through negotiation. After a brief discussion of the objective functions guiding the strategies of both main actors, the paper turns to a review of the substantive and institutional context surrounding the negotiation process between multinational firms and host countries. Next follow some general principles, common to most negotiations, drawn from the experience obtained in other fields, and a discussion of the relevant literature on international business negotiations. Last, the essay integrates the various threads of analysis into a series of normative conclusions which, while not pretending to be imperial, are offered as challenges for further study.&copy; 1981 JIBS.

Abstract: New financial techniques and instruments are created when both the demand for and the supply of those instruments become sufficiently large. New financial instruments appear almost always to represent new combinations or packages of a relatively small number of financial services. In the international context these packages are designed to cope with controls on international financial transactions and with the peculiar interest and exchange risks faced by international firms and banks. This approach, when applied to a wide range of new international instruments, seems to explain why some have failed and others have succeeded.&copy; 1981 JIBS.

Abstract: This essay reviews briefly the nature and forms of East-West industrial cooperation, its evolution during the 1970s, and then assesses the outlook for the 1980s. In particular, the analysis seeks to determine what effects the worsening economic and political climate for cooperation may have had on its development in the latter half of the 1970s. The analysis draws on the author&apos;s own research as well as on the work of others in America and Europe.&copy; 1981 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (1981) 12, 53&ndash;67

Abstract: This paper suggests an operational approach to strategic planning for international marketing using a portfolio perspective. The need for such a perspective is discussed, followed by an examination of current approaches to international business portfolio analysis and strategic planning. A new approach to international portfolios, based on a combined stochastic dominance and analytic hierarchy process approaches, is suggested. The data requirements and analysis of this approach are outlined and the issues and challenges in the design and implementation of an international business portfolio system are discussed.&copy; 1981 JIBS.

Abstract: This article is designed as a survey of international accounting for accountants and others, describing its development and scope, problems, and current attempts at international standardization. Because standardization has not progressed very far, discrepancies cause financial and managerial accounting problems for multinational enterprise &ndash; such as, the need to keep several sets of records. Selected issues &ndash; such as, translation, inflationary adjustments, and segment reporting &ndash; are examined briefly, and the need to develop managerial accounting and information systems appropriate for MNE decision making is outlined. This approach, it is hoped, will provide an overview and also allow the identification of research needs and possibilities. The article concentrates on selected issues of Western industrialized countries, in which most MNEs operate, and attempts to identify major practical and theoretical dimensions of international accounting.&copy; 1981 JIBS.

Abstract: This paper examines the varied empirical findings of the relationship between firm, individual characteristics, and foreign entry expansion behavior. The results support the view that activity is neither exclusively determined by structural or managerial factors and is really the result of interaction between both types of variables. The paper proposes that foreign entry and expansion can best be understood as an adoption of innovation-type behavior.&copy; 1981 JIBS.

Abstract: International Technology Transfer emerged as a separate field of inquiry in the 1970s and has since inspired a large literature. This paper identifies and reviews the major aspects of the field. Policy responses of technology supplying firms and nations and of recipient countries are examined. Directions for further research are indicated.&copy; 1981 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (1981) 12, 113&ndash;135

Abstract: This paper explores the potential role of subculture (religious) and personality (Rockeach Dogmatism Scale) characteristics in explaining differences in the extent of consumer acculturation. The survey results suggest that for a complex and heterogeneous nation like Nigeria, there are significant within-nation differences that may influence consumer acculturation. Implications and suggestions for future cross-cultural consumer research taking an acculturation perspective are indicated.&copy; 1981 JIBS.
