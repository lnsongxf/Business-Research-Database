Abstract: Foreign investment in the United States has been expanding at a rapid rate during recent years. For a variety of reasons it is probable that such investment will play an increasingly important role in the U.S. economy in the future. The purpose of this study is to determine the impact of such foreign ownership on an important aspect of labor relations &ndash; specifically, NLRB representation elections. Tests of whether foreign majority ownership is associated with decreased union success are conducted through multiple discriminant and regression analysis of election results. Both analyses control for foreign ownership, right-to-work legislation, industry effects, and size of election unit. The results indicate a moderately inverse associate between foreign majority ownership and union success in elections.&copy; 1981 JIBS.

Abstract: Non-American firms have recently begun investing larger sums of money in the U.S. Such increased activity has created a great deal of interest and concern. The growth in foreign direct investment and findings of a mailed questionnaire will be reviewed in this article. Factor analysis was utilized to help isolate the salient motives for these investment activities. Although the size of the U.S. market and the attractiveness of a new market or the desire to preserve the existing U.S. market were the most frequently cited reasons for new investment in the U.S., factor analysis reveals that these reasons merely reinforce the primary motive: namely, the desire to benefit from a higher level of U.S. technology and innovation.&copy; 1981 JIBS.

Abstract: This article summarizes the impact on the U.S. apparel industry of international trade flows from 1972 to 1976 and discusses several of the underlying reasons behind the continued decline in its international competitiveness. The article also describes the even larger competitive toll on the major European countries&apos; apparel industries during the period and what polices their governments followed. The basic conclusion of the study this article summarizes is that without major changes in policy and strategy at both government and industry levels, the international competitive position of the U.S. apparel industry will continue to deteriorate.&copy; 1981 JIBS.

Abstract: Relying on the properties of integrated markets, this paper analyzes price changes in commodity futures markets in 2 countries to test whether these markets are integrated. Statistical analysis shows that markets are integrated only imperfectly. The results shed considerable doubt on the use of the integrated markets assumption of economic analysis which deals in differentiable real goods.&copy; 1981 JIBS.

Abstract: Forecasts for rapidly growing urban consumer markets of dual economies are badly needs. The marketing forecasting task is complicated by a lack of resources and data. This article explores a possibility to overcome these constraints by using projections based on income elasitcites. Estimation and projection regression models are constructed and applied, using cross-sectional household income and expenditure data for various urban South African population groups. Based on relatively favorable comparisons with some alternative extrapolations and the actual data, replication in other similar markets seems possible. The development of more comprehensive and realistic models should be undertaken as additional data become available.&copy; 1981 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (1981) 12, 89&ndash;98

Abstract: This paper reports on the management of export physical distribution in the United Kingdom. The approaches that are used by exporters can be categorized into 3 types depending upon the exporter&apos;s relationship with his forwarder. One approach, labeled the traditional approach, is being superseded by two other approaches where a logistics-type system has been introduced. The change from the traditional to the more widely adapted of the two evolved approaches is explained by a life cycle model. The changes identified have significant implications especially for the forwarding industry.&copy; 1981 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (1981) 12, 99&ndash;108

Abstract: Many factors contribute to the trade surplus enjoyed by the United States in its foreign trade with the communist countries of Europe and Asia. Most studies of East-West Trade have focused on the problems of entering communist markets and/or the potential market in these countries. This paper focuses on one of the factors that may be a long-term inhibiter (or stimulant) to increased U.S. imports of goods from communists countries; that is, consumer perceptions of products from Eastern Europe and the People&apos;s Republic of China. Our results indicate that there is a market in the United States for goods from communist countries and that there are identifiable segments of the population that are willing to purchase from these countries and would support increased trade relations.&copy; 1981 JIBS.

Abstract: The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, enacted by the U.S. Congress in 1977, was intended to improve international confidence in U.S. businesses and institutions. This paper presents the results of a questionnaire submitted to members of the Academy of International Business to determine whether the Act has achieved its goal. The opinions of knowledgeable academicians should add another dimensions to this debatable issue.&copy; 1981 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (1981) 12, 123&ndash;126
