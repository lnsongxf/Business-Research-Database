Abstract: It is a fact of international business that governments intervene in the operations of foreign direct investors. These government actions create a high level of uncertainty in international planning and are very costly to the foreign investors. It appears, however, that not all firms experience the same degree of intervention. Within almost all nations, the government appears to intervene in some foreign companies more than in others. At one extreme some firms are forced out of the nation, while at the other extreme firms tend to grow and prosper. The purpose of this paper is first, to explain these different experiences of foreign firms, and then to address the question: How can foreign firms reduce the amount of intervention they experience? The conclusions are based on the intervention histories of more than 100 firms.&copy; 1982 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (1982) 13, 9&ndash;25

Abstract: This paper addresses the following questions: What role does the board of directors play in wholly and partly owned foreign subsidiaries in MNCs? What is the composition and responsibility of the subsidiary boards? What are the potential determinants of the role of effectiveness of the board? Three different roles are identified. The research indicates that certain strategic, structural, and environmental variables may explain differences in board functioning in different MNCs. The paper also discusses some factors which influences the functioning of the subsidiary board within an MNC.&copy; 1982 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (1982) 13, 27&ndash;38

Abstract: This investigation provides data about West German expatriate managers&apos; leadership attitudes. The results indicate that the managers&apos; perceptions about their subordinates&apos; qualifications are an important variable influencing participative management. In addition, regional location appears to influence the managers&apos; attitudes concerning their subordinates.&copy; 1982 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (1982) 13, 39&ndash;50

Abstract: This study examines the transferability and applicability of selected measures of individual differences, job, and organizational climate factors across two cultures. Questionnaires were administered to a sample of 267 white-collar bank employees in the U.S. and 307 bank employees in India. The individual difference dimensions examined were four manifest needs, sense of competence, and locus of control. The job factors included variety, autonomy, identity, and feedback. The organizational climate factors related to communication, stress, participation in decision making, and self-esteem from the workplace. The data were analyzed for internal consistency, dimensionality, and criterion-related validity. The results showed that the job and organizational climate measures were more reliable and were related more consistently to the criterion measures than the individual difference measures both within and across cultures. The results suggested that psychometrically sound measures may be transferable to other cultures.&copy; 1982 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (1982) 13, 51&ndash;65

Abstract: This article reviews the literature regarding the effect of country of origin on buyer evaluations of products. The issue is important for countries (especially resource-poor, developing countries) that need to increase manufactured exports and for firms that source products in countries different from where sold. Marketing inferences are drawn, and implications for future research are developed.&copy; 1982 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (1982) 13, 89&ndash;100

Abstract: This paper presents time-series forecasts for end-use categories for U.S. merchandise exports. Both the basic principles of end-use accounting and the fundamental methods of Box-Jenkins time-series techniques are explained. The result is a set of predicted values of U.S. merchandise exports which may be used to analyze and evaluate other exports forecasting models.&copy; 1982 JIBS.

Abstract: In recent years, European countries have faced an ever increasing levels of activities by consumerists. Much of this activity is aimed at regulating and controlling advertising. This article examines the views of advertising industry and corporate advertising executives toward this movement in two neighboring European countries: West Germany and Switzerland. Results show that even though these countries have different levels of advertising regulation, the executives in both countries hold generally similar attitudes toward most advertising issues. Additionally, the Swiss respondents, more so than the West Germans, feel consumer organizations have more influence on advertising regulation. West German respondents, on the other hand, more strongly favor self-control as a means of advertising regulation. Finally, the Swiss respondents show a more favorable view toward corrective advertising as a method of controlling misleading advertisements.&copy; 1982 JIBS.

Abstract: A recent article by D. J. Fowler in this journal considers the use of transfer pricing by multinational enterprises (MNEs) as a mechanism for increasing global after-tax profits.111 D. J. Fowler, &ldquo;Transfer Prices and Profit Maximaization in Multinational Enterprise Operations,&rdquo; Journal of International Business Studies, Winter 1978, pp. 9&ndash;26. Fowler focuses on the operation of a Canadian subsidiary by a U.S. MNE. This comment observes several mathematical errors in Fowler&apos;s study; in addition the authors argue that the variation in tariff rates deserves more emphasis than it receives in Fowler&apos;s study, and that the variation in levels of foreign ownership deserves less emphasis. Based upon these changes, Fowler&apos;s key table is recomputed and the empirical results for all but one industry are shown to be consistent with theoretical predictions.&copy; 1982 JIBS.

Abstract: The comment by Pugel and Ugelow consists of two parts. In the first part the commentators correct an error in the formulation of the global after-tax profits earned by the MNE from resale operations. In the second part, the authors take issue with the use of the variable &ldquo;Foreign Ownership&rdquo; and suggest that a value of unity is appropriate. These two issues will be dealt with separately.&copy; 1982 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (1982) 13, 121&ndash;124

Abstract: The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between the adoption of capital-intensive technologies and export commitment of Peruvian textile firms. The results suggested a positive relationship. One possible reason is that exporters must be more concerned with product quality perceptions and delivery reliability which may be higher through the use of labor-saving innovations. Another is that lower production costs may be more important in external markets which are more competitive. The study elaborates on the complex factors affecting technology choice, emphasizing that there are country, industry, product, and innovation specific variables which affect the use of so-called appropriate technology.&copy; 1982 JIBS.
