Abstract: One of the outcomes of negotiation between multinationals and host governments in developing countries&mdash;the extent of foreign ownership of subsidiaries&mdash;is influenced by the bargaining power of the two parties. Foreign ownership, measured in various ways, appears to be affected by the level of technology of the multinational, the degree to which a multinational attempts to differentiate its products, the extent to which a subsidiary&apos;s output is exported to other parts of the multinational, the diversity of products offered by the multinational, and the extent of competition by other multinationals. The relationship between some of these variables and ownership is not a simple one. One variable that others have mentioned as probably affecting bargaining power&mdash;size of the investment in question&mdash;appears not to play a significant role in government policies toward ownership, but many large projects tend to be located in countries that have lenient ownership policies.&copy; 1982 JIBS.

Abstract: This study sought to examine and identify (1) the mechanics of U.S.-China trade negotiations; (2) how a company prepares for such negotiations; (3) the factors that contribute to the success or failure of such negotiations; and (4) the outcomes of such negotiations. Data pertaining to these characteristics were collected from 138 U.S. firms engaged in China trade. Relationships between certain variables, such as extent of preparation for the negotiations, type of programs used, and incidences of success were examined. Based on these results, implications for management were drawn.&copy; 1982 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (1982) 13, 25&ndash;38

Abstract: This study is an analysis of variables associated with the profitability of exporting. Such information is useful both for export management and for government agencies that wish to promote business commitment of exporting. The methodology utilizes a multiple regression analysis of data in questionnaire responses from 168 Wisconsin manufacturing firms in 1979. It provides a means for evaluating difficult-to-measure export marketing considerations (such as, export marketing channels, export methods, and foreign dealers support) from the supply-side of the demand-supply equation which can be conceptualized as export marketing analysis from the supply-side.&copy; 1982 JIBS.

Abstract: The export arrangement which makes use of overseas distributors is examined in this article. Although this method is important for many manufactures operating in foreign markets there are reservations about the performance levels that are achieved under such arrangements. It is suggested that there is an important link between the performance level achieved and the very nature of the relationship that exists between the manufacturer and overseas distributor. The authors assert also that the nature of the manufacture-overseas distributor relationship is associated with certain characteristics of the participating companies; namely, their stake in the relationship, their experience, and their uncertainty surrounding the relationship. These propositions are tested and largely corroborated through analysis of data collected from 41 companies in Canada and the UK.&copy; 1982 JIBS.

Abstract: In the decision-making process, strategic market and product policy planning systems usually concentrate on market size, market growth rate, market share, and relative product quality. These factors emerge from studies involving relatively large firms that operate in the national market place. This study attempts to extend the findings to industries composed of much smaller firms that operate in international markets. Analysis of empirical data shows that market share, market size, and quality (in that order) retain their significance, while market growth rate becomes less important. These findings are highly important for small- and moderate-sized firms that are planning international market strategies.&copy; 1982 JIBS.

Abstract: International business, as compared with domestic business, is usually characterized by increased uncertainty. A study of 10 multinational companies uncovered several methods of coping with uncertainty. This paper focuses on 2 methods which may not be apparent control and flexibility. A framework of analysis suggesting appropriate methods for coping with uncertainty is also developed.&copy; 1982 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (1982) 13, 87&ndash;98

Abstract: The analysis of the distribution of foreign exchange rate changes provides a description of the behavior of foreign exchange rates and its determining underlying process. The application of empirical methodologies or further theoretical developments is limited by the nature of this distribution. In this paper, the empirical analysis of major currencies during the flexible exchange rate period suggests that there is no unique distribution representing the behavior of the foreign exchange rate. This, however, is determined both by foreign exchange management policies and the fundamental economic forces.&copy; 1982 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (1982) 13, 99&ndash;111

Abstract: This article discusses the relative merits of different capital budgeting techniques used by MNCs. The purpose is to show that the APV method, which has recently gained popularity, can cause incorrect choices to be made between competing projects unless the NPV is already determined. The author suggests that complicated cost of capital adjustments may be the only route to calculating a project&apos;s NPV correctly.&copy; 1982 JIBS.
