Abstract: A large sample of U.S.-based manufacturing multinational companies were surveyed regarding their investment valuation practices. It was found that: (a) Foreign Direct Manufacturing Investment (FDMI) is motivated primarily by profit rather than the recently proposed behavioral considerations; (b) the majority of companies practice project-by-project analysis of the simple accept/reject type, rather than the comparative project analysis advocated by financial analysts; (c) most of the companies utilized criteria for single investments, cash-flows, and cost of capital that were in general agreement with the analytical literature; (d) companies were concerned more with business risk than currency and political risks&mdash;moreover, all three types of risk were evaluated subjectively and accounted through adjustments in the required rates of return rather than the cash flows of the FDMI, as specified in financial research; (e) analysis of demographic and behavioral variables for possible relationships to FDMI evaluation practices yielded interesting but variable specific results. The questionnaires were mailed in May 1979 and the personal interviews were conducted during December 1979 and the first six months of 1980.&copy; 1982 JIBS.

Abstract: This paper presents a methodology for analyzing the financing problems raised by uncertain exchange rates and the various barriers to free capital flows. The stochastic goal programming model developed allows a way to improve the efficiency with which alternative combinations of corporate strategies, various environmental assumptions and financing mechanisms can be evaluated.&copy; 1982 JIBS.

Abstract: This paper examines the impact of the presence of a forward exchange market on the financial and operational decisions of a multinational firm. The study concentrates especially on the effects of increased uncertainly and increased risk aversion on the part of the multinational firm. It is shown that the presence of the forward market allows the firm to respond to changes in uncertainly and risk aversion by adjusting its transactions in the forward market while leaving its production and sales decisions unchanged. The forward market, thus, promotes stability with respect to the operational as opposed to the financial variables; and its also makes it possible to adopt decentralized decision making.&copy; 1982 JIBS.

Abstract: This paper examines the ability of forward rates that are implicit in the term structure of Eurocurrency interest rates to predict future interest rates and to incorporate the information in past interest rates. The findings suggest that forward rates are unbiased estimators of future interest rates but are not optimal predictors of future interest rates. Further evidence does not provide support for the presence of a systematic risk premium on forward rates. The findings of this study suggest also that the Eurocurrency market is efficient in incorporating information contained in the history of interest rates into the forward rate. In addition, this paper shows that, in conformity with the efficient market hypothesis, errors of prediction based on forward rates are not related to past changes of interest rates.&copy; 1982 JIBS.

Abstract: This paper develops guidelines for comparing financial accounting data from different countries. Groups of countries that have similar accounting practices are identified as a basis for making valid comparisons. The distinction between measurement and disclosure practices is recognized and separate groupings are identified for each of these 2 subsets of accounting practices. The data come from the Price Waterhouse &amp; Co. survey of 267 accounting practices in 64 countries in 1979. This study confirms the findings of earlier studies that the groupings on the basis of disclosure practice exhibit greater diversity and are less stable over time than such groupings on the basis of measurement practices.&copy; 1982 JIBS.

Abstract: The extent of international purchasing in industrial firms is herein considered to be influenced by not only the market conditions but also attitudes toward buying from abroad and the firm&apos;s competence for international transactions. The explore this possibility a subset of data from an international research project is used. Five cases encompassing relations to suppliers in 35 international supply markets are analyzed, and it is concluded that, in these cases, attitudes and competence requirements enable firms to use foreign suppliers adequately with respect to the market conditions.&copy; 1982 JIBS.

Abstract: The controversial nature of the subject of foreign investment in recent years has called for more empirical research. One of the issues which have attracted the attention of scientists and policy markers is the question of efficiency of foreign firms versus local firms. This survey examines the comparative efficiencies of Iranian (IR) firms versus Iranian-American joint venture (IAJV) firms during the pre-revolutionary 1971&ndash;1976 period.To compare the relative performance of IR firms and IAJV firms, the study presents an interfirm efficiency comparison of 11 matched firms. The comparison is based on 3 indexes of efficiency&mdash;labor productivity, capital productivity, and total factor productivity.With minor exceptions the study concludes that IAJV firms have been more efficient than the IR firms&apos; counterparts.&copy; 1982 JIBS.

Abstract: Cross-cultural studies of the perceptions of countries of origin by industrial users have been few, but they are important because of their managerial implications for multinational firms. This study uses data obtained from American and French Directors of Purchasing of major industrial firms concerning their perceptions of 5 major &ldquo;made in&rdquo; concepts. After the data were corrected for response bias, results show both how the respondents perceive the &ldquo;made in&rdquo; concepts and the differences between the American and French perceptions.&copy; 1982 JIBS.

Abstract: The concept of interdependence between countries is analyzed from the viewpoint of a profit-making firm. The author shows how the level of interdependence becomes important for risk-avoiding, international sourcing and marketing decisions. By implication, the manager&apos;s most useful option is one which includes not only varying degrees of but also positive and negative types of interdependence.&copy; 1982 JIBS.
