Abstract: This study analyzed the determinants of the performance of a sample of 153 TNCs in 6 light manufacturing industries in the 5 ASEAN countries. Firm profitability increased as the firm&rsquo;s market share, advertising, and R&amp;D intensity increased and as the market shares of the 2 largest firms in the industry and tariffs increased. Profitability decreased as the market share of the third largest firm in the industry increased, as import penetration increased, as the growth in the firm&apos;s sales increased, and as the number of home countries of the TNCs in the industry increased.&copy; 1983 JIBS.

Abstract: Explanatory concepts of managerial strategic behavior in SOEs&mdash;based on the areas of government control, management orientation, and market environment&mdash; are explained. Three explanatory variables are proposed based on these concepts. The paper discusses the behavioral explanations which are associated with each variable and concepts. The paper discusses the behavioral explanations which are associated with each variable and reports the results of an exploratory survey of 50 managers of state-owned enterprises in 14 countries. The explanatory contributions are analyzed and compared based on the empirical findings.&copy; 1983 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (1983) 14, 35&ndash;46

Abstract: The determinants of the outcomes of business negotiations in 3 cultures are investigated in a laboratory experiment. The outcomes of negotiations between Japanese businessmen result primarily from situational constraint&mdash;the role of the negotiator (buyer or seller). Representational (problem-solving oriented) bargaining strategies, a measure of the process of the interaction, is the most important variable in American negotiations. In negotiations between Brazilian business people, deceptive bargaining strategies&mdash;also a process measure&mdash;is the key variable affecting outcomes.&copy; 1983 JIBS.

Abstract: This article reports on major study which is part of ongoing international research into the use and usefulness of financial statements for investment decisions. The survey reported covered 4,000 individual investors, 900 institutional investors and 900 financial analysts, in 3 countries. It was found that the 3 groups in all 3 countries revealed a strong belief in the importance of financial statements for investment decisions whether &ldquo;buy&rdquo; or &ldquo;hold/sell.&rdquo; It was also found that the individual investor group was far less homogeneous than previous research has assumed, and that cultural or social differences between countries do exist in this field.&copy; 1983 JIBS.

Abstract: The paper analyzes decision making in a specific subset of the energy sector&mdash;international coal trade&mdash;in order to contribute to the understanding of the problems faced by the actors involved. The actors in this global stage are the producers, consumers, and intermediaries in coal trade play. The decisions or the lack of decisions of these actors will ultimately influence the comprehensive scenarios and forecasts shaping the future of this specific area within the energy field. The clarification of the operational problems should also make a contribution toward the improvement of decision making in this area.&copy; 1983 JIBS.

Abstract: This study Investigated the effect that FASB No.8 has had on the Internal performance evaluation practice of 70 U.S.-based MNCs. Questionnaire data were gathered and analyzed while additional information was obtained through personal interviews. The results indicated that FABS No. 8 caused changes in corporate managerial reporting policies. Thirty-one participants (44.2 percent) changed to the temporal method of translating financial information for internal reporting purposes. Twenty-seven (38.6 percent) began using an income figure that had been adjusted for translation gains and losses to evaluate foreign subsidiary managers. Forty-six (65.7 percent) stated that financial statements presented in local currency provide better information that U.S. dollar statements for the internal evaluation of foreign operations. The author argues that MNCs need performance evaluation systems that are developed independently of FASB external reporting standards and that advocate a local perspective relative to foreign operating environments.&copy; 1983 JIBS.

Abstract: Financial ratios, which may be appropriate measures of financial risk and return, are often misused when applied to foreign companies. This is due partly to explainable differences on international accounting principles. A more serious problem, however, is that even when ratios are based on U.S. GAAP, they are misinterpreted because the U.S. investor does not understand a particular foreign environment that influences all financial ratios in that environment. Using Japan and Korea as country examples, this paper analyzes the problem of misuse of international ratio analysis with the hope that investors, security analysts, regulatory authorities, and international business researchers will become more aware of the pitfalls.&copy; 1983 JIBS.

Abstract: A mean-variances framework is employed in a partial-equilibrium context to determine both the preferred tool for foreign exchange rate exposure management and the optimal degree of maintained exposure. It is demonstrated that when portfolio considerations are unimportant, unambiguous solutions can be attained for most states of the world, independently of precise knowledge of utility functions and of confidence intervals around the point forecast of the future exchange rate.&copy; 1983 JIBS.

Abstract: Recent pioneering studies of &ldquo;political risk&rdquo; in international money markets are likely to prompt further interest and empirical analysis. This article recommends that future work be attentive to certain fundamental conceptual, methodological, and substantive issues. In particular, it suggests: 1. that the pertinent risks need to be defined and measured more precisely; 2. that analytically useful variables derivable from models of politics should be included in attempts to develop explanatory/predictive models of variations in risk; and 3. that the analysis of political sources of risk has significant implications for an understanding of market efficiency.&copy; 1983 JIBS.

Abstract: With the volume of world trade over $2 trillion and the sales of foreign affiliates of U.S. companies over $500 billion, international marketing is a very large and complex activity. Yet, existing research in international marketing does not do justice to the size and complexity of the subject. In this note, 3 major areas of research in international marketing are sketched out: export marketing; international marketing by multinationals; and other topics. The outline will be suggestive rather than comprehensive. It does, however, indicate many areas where research is needed to expand our understanding of international marketing.&copy; 1983 JIBS.
