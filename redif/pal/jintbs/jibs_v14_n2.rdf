Abstract: As a methodological review, this paper delineates 6 approaches to researching cross-cultural management issues: parochial, ethnocentric, polycentric, comparative, geocentric, and synergistic. For each approach, assumptions are discussed concerning the similarity and difference across cultures and the extent to which management phenomena are or are not universal. The primary types of management questions which can be addressed using each approach are clarified. Main methodological issues which must be addressed are listed.&copy; 1983 JIBS.

Abstract: This article demonstrates one methodological approach to aid in the complex process of making inferences about the meaning and usefulness of observed national differences. By using data from an international study of &ldquo;The Meaning of Working,&rdquo; 3 points are made: 1) it is important to use multiple methods of measurement for conceptual ideas or domains; 2) it is important to use intra-country reference group comparisons; and 3) it is important to use some form of relative position analysis in addition to score analysis.&copy; 1983 JIBS.

Abstract: This paper summarizes the issues and concerns of critics of cross-cultural research, and discusses how they are being addressed by researchers. Given the state of the art and the complexity of this field of research, the author recommends more inductive research and the pursuit of appropriate, but not overambitious sampling designs, so as to increase our understanding of cultures and encourage the building of richer theory bases. Taking an optimistic view of the field, the author predicts useful contributions by researchers which will enrich the art and science of cross-cultural management.&copy; 1983 JIBS.

Abstract: Organizational control has traditionally been described within the framework of the ideal type of Weberian bureaucracy, in which rules and regulations specify desired behavior, and rewards are based on explicit performance measures. This paper describes an alternative organizational ideal type that relies on an organizational culture for control. In this type of system, behavior is specified by the organizational culture, and performance is maintained via mechanisms of social pressure. An example of this letter type of control is found in the Type Z organization, an American organizational form similar in many ways to the Japanese form. Particularly interesting is the way in which a Type Z organization manages overseas subsidiaries: by establishing the organizational culture in the subsidiary. The process by which this is accomplished and by which control is maintained are described in a comparative empirical study of the headquarters and subsidiary of a firm representative of each control type. The implications of this approach for management of the multinational firm and for the host country are also discussed.&copy; 1983 JIBS.

Abstract: Effective managerial performance is influenced by the types of rewards which managers seek in their work environment and by their perceptions of the degree to which their job expectations are being satisfied. This research provides empirical evidence on the nature of job-related values and outcomes in 4 countries: Canada, France, Japan, and the UK. The survey data reveal that the types of job outcomes sought by managers differ significantly from one culture to another. The results should be of practical value to companies seeking to develop more effective management motivational devices in the countries studied. Moreover, the approach and methodology may provide a useful model for further cross-cultural studies.&copy; 1983 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (1983) 14, 115&ndash;129

Abstract: This article analyzes studies comparing Japanese and American managers, workers, and societies in order to consider questions raised by William Ouchi&apos;s book, Theory Z: How American Business Can Meet the Japanese Challenge. The analysis results in 2 general observations: 1) Theory Z management is not likely to become the accepted norm in American companies to the extent that it has in Japan, and 2) the major conceptual or theoretical lesson we can learn from the Japanese is the potential values of developing a management system that is internally consistent, that fits societal norms and expectations and that obtains support from the major institutional actors in the world of work.&copy; 1983 JIBS.

Abstract: This study determined the management system [Likert and Likert 1976] operating in 10 organizations in the Arabian Gulf region and correlated the system with the resultant effectiveness of these organizations. Managers in the region operated in a Management System 3 mode, but at a lower participatory level than desired by managers and at a lower level than their American counterparts. Effectiveness was found to be related to the operative management system; organization climate was the most potent determinant of effectiveness.&copy; 1983 JIBS.

Abstract: International finance has emerged as one of the most active and exciting areas of management for positive and normative research in recent years. The international economic environment has changed radically, raising new questions but also providing fascinating observations of the interaction of the various elements of the world financial system. At the same time, financial theory has progressed subsequently in its ability to treat rigorously the complexities of interactional finance. Further, empirical evidence regarding the efficiency of markets has significantly altered traditional perspectives on foreign exchange markets and international financial transactions.&copy; 1983 JIBS.

Abstract: Early in 1982, the Editor-in-Chief of JIBS decided to publish a special issue on cross-cultural management at the suggestion of Professor Nancy Adler of McGill University, following her successful organization of the symposium at her university. Professor Anant R. Negandhi was approached and agreed to be a guest editor. Papers included in this issue are the result of this endeavor.&copy; 1983 JIBS.

Abstract: This paper summarizes the author&apos;s recently published findings about differences in people&apos;s work-related values among 50 countries. In view of these differences, ethnocentric management theories (those based on the value system of one particular country) have become untenable. This concept is illustrated for the fields of leadership, organization, and motivation.&copy; 1983 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (1983) 14, 75&ndash;89
