Abstract: This paper shows the distorting effects of different tax regulations on the effective absolute and relative costs of long-term borrowing in different currencies. In particular, if expected borrowing costs are equal before tax, then the process of minimizing expected after-tax borrowing costs generally involves borrowing the weakest currency.&copy; 1984 JIBS.

Abstract: As the bargaining power of the transnational corporations (TNCs) in the sample increased relative to the bargaining power of the host country, and as the desire of the TNCs for a high level of equity ownership increased, the percent equity ownership of the TNCs in their subsidiaries increased. The relationship between percent equity ownership and subsidiary success from the TNCs&apos; viewpoint, however, was J-shaped. High and low levels of equity ownership wee associated with high levels of success. Control of critical operational variables by the TNC was directly related to success.&copy; 1984 JIBS.

Abstract: As an extensive of the export-led growth of national economy overseas, direct investment by Korean multinationals has been rapidly increased. This article explores the development of the overseas manufacturing direct investment by Korean firms and the relationship between parent firms and overseas affiliates. Three main issues are discussed: the ownership-specific assets, location-specific factors, and government policies are the important sets of variables that help to explain the internationalization of the Korean firms in the manufacturing sector, the nature of technology transfer by Korean multinationals to their subsidiaries, and the benefits as a result of its overseas investment to Korean. The data for this study were gathered through structured interviews with the parent companies of 18 out of 21 manufacturing overseas subsidiaries and joint ventures formed by Korean forms.&copy; 1984 JIBS.

Abstract: Although industrial cooperation is an important means for the East to acquire western technology, most of the Swedish companies interviewed are rather reluctant to engage in such cooperation. They often cooperate in order to protect a market or to promote exports of their products, and partners seldom strive towards a common goal. This increased the risk of problems during the implementation of the agreements; problems of quality, delivery failures from the East, and management and coordination are especially frequent; the latter 2 are strongly associated with unsuccessful results. Complicated agreements involving several partners have a tendency to fail. The differences between the 2 economic and political systems manifest themselves in management styles, freedom to act, and so on, and make it difficult to integrate operations. East-West industrial cooperation, therefore, seldom leads to an intensive integration where the partners specialize and supplement each other.&copy; 1984 JIBS.

Abstract: In 9 of the years between 1961 and 1978, Venezuelan regimes took actions adverse to the profitability of l U.S oil companies&rsquo; local production operations. In this study 2 time-series discriminant models were developed for classifying each of the 18 years according to the occurrence of such action. In the first model, adverse government action was found more likely to occur following years of economic decline and periods when U.S. companies earned high profits from petroleum investments in Venezuela. In the second model, government action tended to occur after periods of relative deprivation experienced by Venezuelans. To illustrate the use of discriminant models in forecasting political risks, hypothetical scenarios were formulated from which projections were made through 1985 of the likelihood of government action against those US oil companies&rsquo; operations remaining since the nationalization of petroleum.&copy; 1984 JIBS.

Abstract: The article examines the use and measurement of certain concepts from the literature of industrial organization when applied to the study of international industries. It is argued that considerable care needs to be taken in defining markets and in evaluating information concerning concentration. This issue is examined in the context of the international bauxite-aluminum industry. The factors leading to overstating and understating levels of concentration are discussed.&copy; 1984 JIBS.

Abstract: This paper explores the importance of comparative productivity accounting and productivity-based analysis in export decisions at the firm level. The structure of the relationships between productivity ratios, input prices, scale effects, demand patterns, and exchange rates is developed within the context of a simple macroeconomic model. This framework is extended to encompass comparative productivity and cost analysis across international markets, and to derive conditions for export profitability under different market structures. Subsequently, the role of relative productivities in relation to other market and monetary variables is explored in detail using retrospective case study illustrations. Finally, the managerial implications of a productivity-based approach to export decisions are discussed.&copy; 1984 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (1984) 15, 105&ndash;118

Abstract: Since its inception, Canada&rsquo;s Foreign Investment Review Agency (FIRA) has been criticized for applying its criteria for screening reviewable foreign direct investments in an inconsistent manner. This paper evaluates the consistency of FIRA&rsquo;s review process over time, using published data on the disposition of reviewable proposals. The critical notion underlying the test is that discrete and significant changes in acceptance rates for reviewable proposals may indicate unanticipated changes in FIRA&rsquo;s de facto screening criteria. Significant discrete changes can be identified in the acceptance rates for reviewable proposals over the period 1974-1982. These changes appear to be tied to cyclical conditions in the Canadian economy, which suggests that foreign investors can improve their assessments of FIRA&rsquo;s de facto criteria by incorporating macroeconomic information and into their legal analysis.&copy; 1984 JIBS.

Abstract: The monetarist model of the exchange rate includes expectations of the future exchange rate as a determinant of the current exchange rate. This paper investigates whether expectations are a significant determinant of the exchange rate. An expectations process that is consistent with a basic monetarist exchange rate model is considered. Alternative measures of expectations are generated using this process. In the empirical tests, while the standard forward exchange premium measure of expectations is statistically insignificant, some of the alternative measures are observed to be statistically significant.&copy; 1984 JIBS.

Abstract: This article examines the implications of transnational data flow constraints for international business. The need for a free flow of information across national boundaries&mdash;facilitating international business and reducing costs for multinational corporations&mdash;is discussed. Although both large and small firms are affected by transnational data constraints, companies that are managed in a decentralized fashion are affected to a lesser degree. Economic protectionism has emerged as a major reason for regulating transnational data flow by nation states.&copy; 1984 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (1984) 15, 141&ndash;150

Abstract: This study reports on the feasibility of adding international business to the business core by using a multinational business simulation game in the capstone policy course. The simulation game is not intended to replace an introductory course or substitute for other approaches. It is intended to provide a minimal introduction where none currently exists and perhaps to aid in overcoming the inertia with regard to relevant curriculum changes that are needed to comply with American Assembly of Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB) guidelines.&copy; 1984 JIBS.

Abstract: The Academy of International Business members were polled to elicit their opinions of the relative quality of international business programs in American schools. They were also asked for their criteria.The ranked results by school names are in the article. The most mentioned criteria were faculty quality and research and the number and range of international business courses.Responses to the survey permitted correlations between the respondents&rsquo; places of employment, the sources of their degrees and the schools they named. These correlations are significant.&copy; 1984 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (1984) 15, 161&ndash;174
