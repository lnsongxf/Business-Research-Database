Abstract: This article reviews and synthesizes the emergency and growth of U.S., Western European, and Japanese MNCs in the postwar environment, the growing role of state enterprises, and the recent emergence of Third World MNCs. While U.S. foreign direct investments have expanded and continue to be highly significant, some important recent developments are the more rapid growth of Western European and Japanese MNCs, the increased role of the U.S. as a host country for investments, the emergence of multibusiness by MNCs, the more numerous actors involved in global business, and the dramatic, more rapid changes in the world environment. This article explores developments in host- and home-country policies, some of the other major actors in international business, &ldquo;newer&rdquo; forms of international participation along with some hypotheses, and concludes by analyzing a few major changes in global environments and multinational management.&copy; 1984 JIBS.

Abstract: This paper provides a theoretical framework to evaluate the currency swap transactions initiated by the World Bank in 1981 to obtain long-term funds in low-interest German marks and Swiss francs in exchange for high-interest dollar loans. Unique in its concept as a combination of a traditional currency swap and a debt swap, this new technique is found to provide different sets of financial incentives to the swap participants. On one side, a participant can minimize his &ldquo;effective&rdquo; long-term borrowing cost while avoiding the risk of potential market saturation. On the other side, his counterpart can lock up the accumulated book value gain resulting from the favorable exchange rate and interest rate changes since his earlier foreign currency borrowing and at the same time can accomplish long-term exposure coverage not commonly available in the foreign exchange market.&copy; 1984 JIBS.

Abstract: This paper shows how differences across countries of 1) inflation rates, 2) consumption baskets of investors, and 3) investment opportunity sets of investors matter when one applies capital asset pricing models in an international setting. In particular, the fact that countries differ is shown to affect the portfolio held by investors, the equilibrium expected returns of risky assets, and the financial policies of firms.&copy; 1984 JIBS.

Abstract: A comparison of the balance sheet structure of the largest U.S. and Japanese firms for 1979 shows that Japanese firms significantly differ from U.S. firms in their greater reliance on bank-funded short-term debt, low levels and composition of net working capital, parsimonious use of stockholder&apos;s equity, and greater commitment to long-term investments in other corporations.&copy; 1984 JIBS.

Abstract: Many companies have recently adopted global manufacturing rationalization programs. In order to realize the full benefit of these internationally integrated manufacturing strategies, however, companies need to overcome the problem of coordinating operations where interdependence exists among subsidiaries. This article, which is based on a field study of 25 multinational companies, provides insights on how manufacturing interdependence among country subsidiaries is coordinated. Specifically, the study examined the relationship between increasing manufacturing interdependence with the use of 4 coordination modes&mdash;impersonal methods, use of organization members who have a system sensitive outlook, executive compensation systems based on a subsidiary&apos;s performance, and personal communication&mdash;and with the use of 3 communication patterns&mdash;communication between managers of different country subsidiaries, communication with top management, and communication with a central manufacturing staff group. Findings suggest that although there is an extensive use of impersonal methods of coordination, with increasing interdependence there is a change in coordination mix towards greater use of system-sensitive members and personal communication. Increasing interdependence is also significantly associated with greater communication among country-subsidiary managers and greater communication with a central manufacturing staff group. Although the relationship between increasing interdependence and communication with top management through the formal hierarchy was not found to be statistically significant, interviews with managers suggested the importance of this channel when communication among country-subsidiary managers and communication with the central manufacturing staff group are inadequate for managing the manufacturing interdependence. Implications are drawn for companies planning to increase the international integration of their manufacturing operations.&copy; 1984 JIBS.

Abstract: The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) was found to have no negative effect on the export performance of American industry. Market share of U.S. industry in countries where the FCPA is reported to be an important trade disincentive was compared with U.S. market share in other countries. No differences were discovered.&copy; 1984 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (1984) 15, 107&ndash;121

Abstract: One of the fastest growing areas of research in international business has been political risk assessment. Concerned primarily with the identification, analysis, and management of sociopolitical and governmental restraints on foreign investment, the discipline has flourished in the wake of the international turmoil of recent years. An integral stage in the development of any new field is the establishment of a theoretical base upon which further research can build. This paper thus addresses itself to theoretical and conceptual issues in political risk assessment, focusing on the interrelationship of strategies, goals, and capabilities of key actors, as well as the impact of different environments on the formation of political risk. In order to demonstrate the feasibility of the approach set forth in this paper, political risk in the Republic of South Africa is examined.&copy; 1984 JIBS.

Abstract: This article reports on the strategic adjustments undertaken by the larger firms of 5 European, 3 Asian Pacific, and the U.S. textile mill products companies during the 1960s and 1970s, and examines several of the underlying reasons for the gradual decline in the U.S. industry&apos;s international competitiveness. The study&apos;s basic conclusions are that the majority of the foreign textile industries view customer markets differently than the U.S. industry; that they place different emphasis on technology, production, marketing, and strategic planning; and that they have different relationships with their governments than U.S. firms do. The implications of these findings are discussed, and corporate strategy recommendations that are designed to enhance the future international competitiveness of the U.S. industry are presented.&copy; 1984 JIBS.

Abstract: This paper focuses on the conditions under which an international firm would expand overseas via the transfer of technology and rights to its own controlled equity affiliates, as opposed to resorting to the &ldquo;market&rdquo; by selling its technology to independent foreign licensees. The relative propensity of U.S. firms to use licensing versus equity investment is then examined statistically in regression models using data of the Department of Commerce. A second paper in this series (forthcoming in the Summer 1985 issue) will examine strategic and negotiation issues involved in combining equity investment, licensing and intra-firm trade into one agreement.&copy; 1984 JIBS.

Abstract: The Japanese success in international competition has attracted much attention. To date, little of this attention has addressed the role of marketing in the Japanese success. This note focuses on the Japanese approach to strategic market planning and its role in contributing to the competitive strength of Japanese enterprise.The author identifies the major elements of the Japanese approach and concludes that there is nothing new in Japanese marketing. The Japanese advantage is not in secret or esoteric knowledge or techniques, but rather in simply practicing what is known and avoiding the seduction attraction of simplistic solutions or &ldquo;fixes.&rdquo; The author concludes that it is important for Western companies to get back to the basics: thorough application of known principles and procedures, action, and hard work. The Japanese approach also raises the issue of appropriate national policy in the area of government/business relations and &ldquo;industrial policy.&rdquo;&copy; 1984 JIBS.

Abstract: A number of recent studies have concluded that the foreign language fluency of the general population of the United States is very low. The purpose of the present study is to identify language requirements for business students in U.S. colleges and universities that offer a major, minor, or co-major in international business and a functional area at the graduate and/or undergraduate levels, and to determine approximate levels of fluency in foreign languages of these students.&copy; 1984 JIBS.

Abstract: With the Winter 1984 issue of JIBS, Rutgers Graduate School of Management completes 2 terms or 10 years of publication of JIBS. This has been a challenging but rewarding experience for me and my staff at Rutgers. We take pride in the progress we have achieved after starting with meager and inadequate resources to make the Journal of International Business Studies the outstanding refereed professional journal in the field. This achievement was possible only through the dedicated efforts and cooperation of several score of individuals - more than we can mention in this note - including our small staff, members of the Editorial Board, Seciton and other Editors, other reviewers, many officers of the Academy of International Business, authors who submitted manuscripts, and various scholars who advised us ont he editorial policies and thrust of the Journal.&copy; 1984 JIBS.
