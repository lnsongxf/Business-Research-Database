Abstract: This paper examines the effect of political events on the manufacturing direct foreign investment (MDFI) decisions of U.S. multinational corporations. The relationship between political events (and nonpolitical factors) and MDFI is investigated through regression analysis of pooled time-series (21 years) and cross-sectional (24 countries) data and through various tests of the homogeneity of the relationship across groups of countries. The study finds that the relationship between political events in MDFI is different for less developed countries as opposed to developed countries. For the less developed countries, both inter-nation and intra-nation conflict and cooperation affect MDFI. In contrast, U.S. MDFI in developed countries appears to be affected only by inter-nation conflict and cooperation.&copy; 1985 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (1985) 16, 1&ndash;17

Abstract: The country-risk assessment function in U.S. banks has risen in importance with the recent growth in international lending. This paper, which is based on a field study of 50 U.S. banks, identifies 4 common organizational types of country-risk assessment, probes their strengths and weakness, examines their determinants, and analyzes the importance of organizational and technical development to various dimensions of system performance.The findings of the study suggest that banks move to more organizationally sophisticated country-risk assessment systems 1) with time as they accumulate experience in the assessment function, 2) with the increasing absolute size of their foreign loan portfolio, and 3) with the growth in relative importance of their international activities to the activities of the firm as a whole. Systems with an independent staff pre-investment audit were found to have a better performance than those where only the line country-manager made the assessment. It is important, however, that the independent staff assessment unit be integrated with the organization.&copy; 1985 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (1985) 16, 19&ndash;35

Abstract: Export sales are an important route to growth for the small-to-medium sized firm. This article reports the results of an extensive empirical study of the export strategies of a large sample of high technology electronics firms, and the performance results of adopting alternate export strategies. Six strategy scenarios were identified. The results show that the types of foreign markets selected, segmentation strategies and product strategies all have a pronounced impact on export sales and export growth. The best performers&mdash;a group of firms called the &ldquo;world marketers&rdquo; and representing 13.5% of the sample&mdash;achieved a dramatic 188% annual growth in exports and exported 52.5% of their output. The profiles of firms that elected each strategy scenario were determined also.&copy; 1985 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (1985) 16, 37&ndash;55

Abstract: The multinational firm, as the central actor in international business, has been studied extensively across countries and intensively within companies. No single theoretical structure can deal with all important aspects of these firms. Nonetheless, some powerful explanatory tools such as the international product cycle and the transactions cost/internalization theory have shed substantial light on MNE activities. The imperfect competition theory presented here explains 6 major MNE decisions (for example, production location and market servicing methods) with a simple model, which can be extended to explore other important issues.&copy; 1985 JIBS.

Abstract: The processes of business negotiations in three countries, the United States, Japan, and Brazil, are composed and contrasted. Three dyads from each country were videotaped during a buyer-seller negotiation simulation. Both verbal behaviors and nonverbal behaviors were observed and recorded. Observed differences provide the basis for hypothesized differences which might be tested in future work.&copy; 1985 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (1985) 16, 81&ndash;96

Abstract: Financial structure and the nature of financial risk in Japanese companies differ substantially from those of U.S. firms. As a result, the application of U.S. standards is likely to produce misleading conclusions for creditors, investors and competitors. This article examines the unique institutional relationships and the nature of debt and equity claims that are central to understanding financial risk in Japan. It reports the results of empirical testing of the types of measures that more accurately reflect bankruptcy risk in large Japanese firms. The findings indicate that measures of a company&apos;s social importance and the strength of its bank relationship may be more important at financially crucial moments than accounting information. The results are of practical value to foreign creditors and analysts, as well as to researchers.&copy; 1985 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (1985) 16, 97&ndash;110

Abstract: Yugoslavia&apos;s post-1965 economic policies have been directed towards opening the economy to foreign trade and encouraging inward investment in Joint Ventures. This research examines the opportunities and constraints facing Western multinational companies which invest in Joint Ventures in Yugoslav industry. The empirical evidence drawn from a sample of 42 West European and North American companies addresses itself to the formation and success of Joint Ventures, the route to foreign direct investment in Yugoslavia and motives and preferences for Joint Ventures to other forms of industrial cooperation.&copy; 1985 JIBS.

Abstract: The Zambian government&apos; 51% nationalization of the country&apos;s copper mines in 1969 was motivated partly for economic purposes&mdash;a kind of learning-by-doing was anticipated&mdash;and partly for political reasons. It appears that the Zambians did obtain a semblance of managerial control and &ldquo;national ownership,&rdquo; but at a very high financial price. The article estimates that the direct revenue loss was over $1 billion through 1981, not counting various disguised costs. The findings are based primarily on an in-depth analysis of the mining companies&apos; annual reports from 1964 through 1981.&copy; 1985 JIBS.

Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to show that a portfolio theoretic model which directly incorporates the effect of interdependence among national markets can be useful in the analysis of an MNF&apos;s explicit location decisions. A numerical mean-variance portfolio model is developed and applied to the case of geographical expansion of the MNF. While international diversification may not be considered a necessary and sufficient cause for FDI, its effect on firm earnings should not be ignored in the MNF&apos;s location decisions.&copy; 1985 JIBS.
