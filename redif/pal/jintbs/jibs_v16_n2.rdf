Abstract: The choice between licensing and direct investment as a vehicle for international technology transfer is hypothesized to be related to characteristics of the individual technology, parent corporation, and the host country involved in the transfer. A set of hypotheses regarding these relationships are developed and tested in a logit statistical model for a sample of 1,226 technology transfers. We find that hypotheses regarding the effects of technology and parents characteristics are strongly supported by this analysis; hypotheses regarding the effect of host country characteristics on transfer patterns receive mixed support.&copy; 1985 JIBS.

Abstract: Traditional theory has viewed direct investment, licensing and trade mainly as foreign market-entry alternatives. However, a growing number of overseas ventures are being formed as a mix of the 3 methods, where a joint venture partner may be compensated by a package involving some return on equity investment, plus royalties, plus margins on components or finished product traded with the joint venture corporation. This paper presents an algebraic model for the negotiations position of each partner in a prospective venture. The trade-offs between the 3 compensation types are complex as they involve non-zero-sum games. The methodology is extended to enable a host government to calculate for each alternative arrangement, the foreign exchange cost, tax revenues, or other national costs and benefits. The model makes some unconventional recommendations for corporate strategy and government policy.&copy; 1985 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (1985) 16, 23&ndash;50

Abstract: What explains the multinational conglomerate, diversified across both product and geographic boundaries? From a sample of diversifying foreign acquisitions by U.S. firms, we conclude that the choice between related and unrelated acquisitions bears little relation to the acquire&apos;s base activity in the U.S., but it is somewhat affected by transaction costs and the firm&apos;s previous experience in the host country. The motive of risk-spreading encourages unrelated overseas acquisitions.&copy; 1985 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (1985) 16, 51&ndash;64

Abstract: The association between contractual arrangement and the marketing practices of export intermediaries and domestic supplies is examined. Based on data collected from a national sample of export management companies, the effect of structuring the export arrangement as a contractual, administrative, or conventional channel is analyzed. Prior research suggests that contractual form establishes the framework within which all the economic and sociopolitical interactions between the supplier and export middleman take place. Hypothesized relationship between export practices and channel structure are empirically tested, and the central role of structure in the operation of export channels is largely confirmed.&copy; 1985 JIBS.

Abstract: The paper describes a model of foreign exchange exposure. This is defined as the sensitivity of a specific investment&apos;s value in reference currency to changes in exchange rate forecasts. This sensitivity may result because some share of the investment cash flows are denominated in foreign currency. Alternatively, a share of cash flows denominated in reference currency which are affected by future exchange rates can also generate sensitivity.The model integrates a general corporate valuation framework with a theory of expectations and a general model of corporate macro-economic relationships. Its contribution is in generalizing previous models of these relationships. It also provides a link between empirical work, theoretical descriptions of the exchange rate/relative price relationship, and corporate valuation theory.The model implies a fairly rich description of the corporate and economic characteristics which determine exposure. These descriptors may be used to explain differences in the responses to exchange rate changes of different companies, product lines, or industries.&copy; 1985 JIBS.

Abstract: Analysis of Japanese trading companies suggests that would-be U.S. trading companies could be emulate Japan&apos;s special, rather than general, trading companies. Factors likely to lead to success are: offering narrow high-margin product lines in geographically diversified markets; integration with manufacturing operations having strong domestic markets; well capitalized finances with access to ample credit, perhaps achieved through partnership with large international banks; efficient working capital management consisting of liberal but controlled trade credit and tight inventories; management experienced in international markets and capable of heeding national interest considerations in many countries; and patience and a long-term outlook, since during client relationships are necessary to achieve profitability.&copy; 1985 JIBS.

Abstract: This paper examines empirically the scale of transnational corporation (TNC) involvement in the area of economic cooperation between Poland and developed market economy countries. Data were collected on TNC involvement in commodity turnover, technology transfers and industrial cooperation, and on the establishment of representation offices. The findings strongly underline the importance of TNCs as trading partners in key areas in the acquisition of high technology and equipment and in industrial cooperation. The popular view, however, that the flow of East-West trade is dominated by a handful of large TNCs was found to be overemphasized.&copy; 1985 JIBS.

Abstract: As exports become an increasing part of industry sales, the determinants of a firm&apos;s international position become increasingly important. Tests have supported single factors, such as, product life cycle [Lutz and Green 1983] as well as multi-factor models, to explain the determinants of industry imports and exports [Stern and Maskus 1981; Harkness and Kyle 1975; Baldwin 1971]. This study also presents a multi-factor analysis of the determinants of U.S. trade patterns. This study utilized the SPI (Strategic Planning Institute) data set which allows research at the business unit (product line) level. Results indicate that productivity and product development are the principal characteristics of high export percentage business units. These findings are especially true for nonconsumer industries. Thus to the degree that business are concerned over the short-term costs of product development, direct or indirect (for example, insurance) government aid may be required to promote U.S. export industries.&copy; 1985 JIBS.

Abstract: The Editors of the Journal of International Business Studies (JIBS) always try to publish the best international business research. Unfortunately, there will probably never be a simple response to the question, What constitutes excellent international business research? We might make some progress, however, if we first attempt to define international business research and then identify several noteworthy examples.&copy; 1985 JIBS.
