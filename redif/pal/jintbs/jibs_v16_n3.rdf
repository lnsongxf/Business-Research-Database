Abstract: This paper examines the reaction of the foreign exchange market to the announcement of changes in the business environment of a country. Our results suggest that sampled political risk news conveys important information about a country&apos;s investment climate and causes its currency&apos;s exchange rate to vary. It appears, however, that the reaction of the foreign exchange market is more dramatic for unfavorable events than for favorable events. The evidence presented is also consisted with the hypothesis that the foreign exchange market is efficient in interpreting the type of event considered in this study.&copy; 1985 JIBS.

Abstract: One of the cornerstones of a firm&apos;s marketing strategy in any market is the development of an appropriate product positioning plan. This paper argues that may of the same considerations that go into the positioning strategy in the home country are directly relevant for international markets. There is an added elements of complexity in that the country-of-origin of the imported product will often be a salient factor in the buyer evaluation process. The effect of country stereotype will be to shift the position of the product in the perceptual space and alter the overall evaluation of its merits. The competitive strength of the product will thus be affected by country biases. The paper shows how these factors can be dealt with in the management of the &ldquo;international product positioning&rdquo; task.&copy; 1985 JIBS.

Abstract: The research focuses on the export expansion process of small and middle-sized manufacturing firms and some of its correlates: diversification and geographical market distribution, means of acquiring information and modes of international distribution. The study reveals the overwhelming influence on export expansion of information acquired from business transactions as opposed to reliance on private or public information services. The impact of market diversification and its nature is confirmed. Policy implications are suggested.&copy; 1985 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (1985) 16, 77&ndash;89

Abstract: Recently researchers have begun to investigate issues of differences in the use of managerial accounting tools across differing national environments. Much of this research is of the case study approach documenting actual practices for a small group of firms, or a distillation from numerous observations but using anecdotal evidence to support various conjectures.The study uses a survey of attitudes toward various aspects of budgeting and control systems to gain insight into the existence of differences for a large sample of Japanese and United States controllers and line managers. Respondents were drawn from the 500 largest industrial firms in these two countries. The major findings suggest that the Japanese controllers and managers 1) prefer less participation, 2) have a more long-term planning horizon, 3) view budgets as more of a communication device, and 4) prefer more budget slack than their American counterparts.&copy; 1985 JIBS.

Abstract: The paper presents statistical evidence supporting the proposition that the kind of monopolistic advantage possessed by the firm is decisive as to which form of involvement it will choose to penetrate into foreign markets: exporting versus producing abroad. A decomposition of export flows into exports to affiliates (intra-company trade) and exports to unaffiliated buyers proves to be a crucial element in the empirical test of this proposition.&copy; 1985 JIBS.

Abstract: The main objective of this paper is to develop a leading indicator of external debt servicing vulnerability that would serve as an advance signal of payments interruption. The traditional and widely used ratios of debt servicing capacity, such as the ratio of the balance on current account of debt service payment, and the ratio of external debt to exports among others, primarily measure a country&rsquo;s current capacity to handle its international obligations. However, they fail to test the vulnerability to debtor countries to oncoming debt servicing problems, or to signal in advance an imminent situation of payments interruption.The proposed index combines a number of variables which have preceded payments interruption by a number of countries in recent years. These situations have been preceded with a varying time lead by all or most of the following developments:1. A significant erosion in the international liquidity position.2. A sharply faster growth rate of external debt than the rate of growth in export earnings.3. An acceleration in the inflation rate experienced by the country.4. A shortfall in exports or a deterioration in export performance.5. Adverse internal political developments.The complied index is a weighted average of sub-indices or ratios which measure recent changes in the variables listed above. The index was applied to 20 developing countries (LDCs) accounting for about 80 percent of total external debt. Depending on their score, these countries were grouped in five categories ranging from those signaling significant improvement in their debt servicing capacity to those signaling an imminent payments interruption.&copy; 1985 JIBS.

Abstract: This paper examines the currency-of-denomination decision for long-term debt financing in the presence of corporate income taxes and flotation costs. The numerical analysis provides convincing evidence that the &ldquo;tax effect&rdquo; dominates the &ldquo;flotation cost effect&rdquo; unless the firm operates in tax haven countries. Hence, the conventional decision rule still applies to the choice of currency in which to borrow or to lend: Borrow in the weakest currency and lend in the strongest.&copy; 1985 JIBS.

Abstract: Global-scale MNEs require a network of managers to direct and control operations around the world. Managerial resources for these jobs can be managers from the headquarters country, host and third countries. International transfers can be for specific staffing needs, for management development and for organization development. The general hypothesis examined in this paper was the global scale MNEs would operate in a regio-or geocentric fashion with full integration of the world pool of managerial resources for all international transfers. Case studies were done on two North American and two European MNEs in the chemical and electronics industries. World-wide transfers and consequent career opportunities were found in all cases for managers from headquarters countries. Regional transfers and careers were possible for host and third-country managers in regio-centric MNEs, but only national careers were possible in a poly-centric MNE. Temporary transfers to world or regional headquarters for management development were found for host and third-country managers, but transfers for organization development were for headquarters nationals. No consistent differences in use of transfer or international careers were found between North American and European MNEs.&copy; 1985 JIBS.

Abstract: This paper identifies five factors that cluster belief about the importance of barriers to export held by executives in strategic business units involved in export of paper products or contemplating such export. These factors were evaluated in respect to the international business literature and labeled as national export policy, comparative marketing distance, lack of export commitment, exogenous economic constraints, and competitive rivalry. This analysis revealed a minor appreciation of the importance of competitive rivalry and a high appreciation of the barrier provided by exogenous economic constraints. The other three factors assumed intermediate positions of importance among the five factors.&copy; 1985 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (1985) 16, 111&ndash;123
