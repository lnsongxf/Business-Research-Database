Abstract: Rationalization of global production and operations by multinational corporations have created a large volume of international company funds flows. By a process of netting interaffiliate payments, significant savings in cost can be realized. Shapiro formulated the multinational payment netting problem using linear programming. This paper presents a network optimization approach that is both computationally efficient and intuitively appealing. Further, the proposed approach recognizes the need to integrate the netting system with the MNC&apos;s overall cash management systems as well as by explicitly accounting for cash outflows on account of transfer costs. Additionally, the paper provides insight into actual corporate netting practices.&copy; 1986 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (1986) 17, 1&ndash;20

Abstract: This study develops equilibrium yield relationships between otherwise similar dollar denominated Eurobonds and U.S. bonds with the use of supply and demand conditions and the standard arbitrage argument. It them empirically tests the hypothesis that no yield differentials exist between similar securities in these two markets. A matched pair sample of these bonds is obtained on the basis of five criteria: (a) same parent; (b) same rating; (c) similar coupon rates; (d) similar time to maturity; and (e) yield observations from the same month. Empirical results obtained during 1975 to 1983 shows that dollar Eurobond yields do not differ from domestic bond yields for comparable securities. This implies that these two markets are either devoid of systematic and material imperfections or if any such imperfection do exist, their pricing influence is similar in both markets. It is also observed that issue size, issuer&apos;s rating and the market&apos;s familiarity with the issuer do not uniquely influence Eurobond pricing any differently than domestic U.S. bond pricing.&copy; 1986 JIBS.

Abstract: This paper presents logit and discriminant models of debt rescheduling. The models incorporated new short-term debt data and variables representing economic shocks. The 30-country database covered the period from 1975 to 1982 and contained the largest number of debt rescheduling observations of any previous database. Because of the new indicators and more recent data, the models captured the effects of the changes that have occurred in the world economy since the oil price shocks and the period of rapid debt accumulation by the developing countries. Compared to the earlier research models, the models have proven to be efficient in forecasting debt reschedulings.&copy; 1986 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (1986) 17, 37&ndash;54

Abstract: A fundamental question in international marketing concerns the desirability and feasibility of standardizing marketing programs and procedures internationally. The primary objective of this paper is to present an overview and evaluation of the standardization debate. Central issues of interest include a discussion of the standardization construct and an evaluation of the evidence regarding corporate implementation of standardization strategies.&copy; 1986 JIBS.

Abstract: Research to date on centralization in MNCs has produced many inconsistent findings. The present study attempts to add clarity to the situation by re-testing many of the existing hypotheses with data from a recent study of centralization in 50 large US, UK and European MNCs. It examines how the degree of centralization inherent in the head quarters-foreign subsidiary relationship varies in response to a variety of company-wide and subsidiary level conditions. The influence of company-wide conditions on centralization appears to be much clearer than the influence of subsidiary-level conditions. The study also identifies several new contingency patterns that appear to be at work in MNCs today.&copy; 1986 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (1986) 17, 71&ndash;92

Abstract: This paper reports the development and testing of a normative model for determining how firms should select the countries to be used in the information search for foreign direct investment. After a subset of countries is selected in the first stage of the decision process, a final selection process chooses the country with the best score within the subset: A &ldquo;percentile method of subset selection&rdquo; for singling out clusters of countries for information search and for identifying the best of the subset is presented that performs better than maximum country rankings (&ldquo;top means&rdquo;) and maximum uncertainty (&ldquo;top variance&rdquo;) techniques of subset selection. As an illustration, the percentile selection method is applied empirically.&copy; 1986 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (1986) 17, 93&ndash;116

Abstract: The Purpose of the present study are: (1) to extend Kim and Kim&apos;s [1984] original study of transnational product sharing (TPS) of the newly Industrializing Countries (NICs) of Asia with Japan from an aggregate-flow analysis to a product sectoral analysis; and (2) to provide additional empirical evidence for the macro economic approach to trade.The results obtained from a time-serious multiple regression analysis of trade data of four product groups confirm that the hypothesized TPS is most robust in the unskilled-labor intensive and human capital intensive product groups and not significant in the natural resources intensive group. In the technology intensive group, both Japan and the rest of the world are found play an almost equally important role. The implications for U.S. firms, government, and other countries are discussed.&copy; 1986 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (1986) 17, 117&ndash;130

Abstract: While Lamont (1979) and Monsen and Walters (1983) have taken a strong stance that foreign state enterprises are a threat to U.S. business, the question of how the senior level business executives in the U.S. firms view these companies in the 1980s remains unexplored. Executive perception of elements and events in the external environment are as important as facts and their interpretations. This research note reports the findings of a survey (questionnaire and telephone interviews) of 111 senior executives of U.S. firms and interprets the findings against the backdrop of the model of post-industrial organization expounded by Huber. The main finding of the survey is that in the mid-1980s the threat that loomed large in the minds of executives was rather &lsquo;foreign imports&rsquo; than foreign state enterprises.&copy; 1986 JIBS.

Abstract: As Pacific Asia becomes increasingly important in the world economy, business programs are needed for preparing students who want to specialize in this region. This study develops a comprehensive listing of Pacific Asian business programs currently available in the U.S. It is found that the programs vary significantly in terms of length, structure and regional focus. Although there are a few programs of this kind available, the number may still be insufficient. The American business schools may need to do more in response to the Pacific challenge.&copy; 1986 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (1986) 17, 161&ndash;172
