Abstract: The objectives of this study are to assess the costs to American companies of U.S. export controls, and to suggest business policies to minimize their adverse effects. The 1982 Soviet gas pipeline case is used as a concrete example. Original field research among business people and government officials in Europe and the U.S. is the main data source. The main findings of the study are that the costs of export controls to American business that can be measured are very high, and much above government estimates. The optimum strategy for business to follow is to influence the executive branch of government rather than to press for compensation schemes or legislative changes.&copy; 1987 JIBS.

Abstract: Recent research has investigated the internationalization process of the firm. This study provides insight into the role that foreign trade zones play in that process. It investigates differences between users and non-users of foreign trade zones in terms of (1) firm characteristics, (2) the awareness of zone benefits, and (3) the importance of the benefits to the firms surveyed. Zone users were found to import significantly more than non-users and exported more as well. Users tended to be smaller in size (sales and number of employees) than non-users. Users were more aware of the benefits of foreign trade zones and, for the most part, rated the benefits as being more important in facilitating their global marketing and logistics functions.&copy; 1987 JIBS.

Abstract: The impact of three factors that affect the psychometric rigor of cross-national consumer research comparisons is measured in this study. Conclusions are also drawn about the interactions among these factors and the resultant deterioration in the psychometric quality of the data.The cross-national consumer research instrument is sensitive to the nature of the attitudinal constructs, the nationality of the respondents, and the country-of-origin effects examined in the research. The instrument is also sensitive to lower-order interactions between these factors. The authors conclude by discussing ways to facilitate more rigorous cross-national comparisons.&copy; 1987 JIBS.

Abstract: An analysis of the environments of leading manufacturing firms operating in the United States and in Australia produced a series of hypothesized differences in the strategies, organization structures, and market environments of firms in the two countries. Parallel hypotheses about differences between domestic Australian firms and subsidiaries of foreign multinationals operating in Australia were also developed.The hypotheses were by and large supported when tested on data obtained from leading corporations in the two countries. The United States sample, drawn from the Fortune &ldquo;500&rdquo;, contained no foreign subsidiaries, whereas about half of the Australian sample, drawn from the 100 largest Australian manufacturers, were subsidiaries of foreign-based multinational firms. Overall, the U.S. firms face faster-growing and more competitive markets, are more international and invest more in R&amp;D, particularly for new products. Domestic Australian firms are active acquires and resemble United States firms in terms of product diversity, divestiture activity and organization, but they are not international in focus and their limited investment in R&amp;D is process-oriented. Australian subsidiaries of foreign multinationals are even less international than domestic firms, narrower in product scope and have simpler organizations.&copy; 1987 JIBS.

Abstract: This study investigates minimum risk-hedging ratios and the hedging effectiveness of forward foreign exchange markets for the British pound and the German mark during the period January 4, 1982&mdash;April 30, 1984. These currencies are selected because of their importance in foreign exchange markets and their use as international currencies. Evidence is strong that the presence of autocorrelation not only overstates optimal hedge ratios but also overstates hedging effectiveness for these two currencies. The lower optimal hedging ratios found in this study than in earlier works is thus largely attributed to the adjustment for autocorrelation.&copy; 1987 JIBS.

Abstract: This note reviews the results of four surveys related to the efforts of the AACSB to internationalize the curriculum of the business schools. The first, a survey of the 1071 participants in the 30 workshop/seminars which have been organized by the AACSB, showed that the workshops have been very beneficial for the participants and effected the courses they teach. The second survey, of all AACSB member schools, showed that most of them plan to internationalize their curriculums by introducing an international dimension into the core courses. But this raises the question of whether the faculty members are trained or prepared to do this. The third survey found that only 64 out of 564 AACSB member schools have one or more exchange programs with foreign business schools, and that only about 125 professors go overseas each year under the aegis of these programs. Finally, a fourth survey, of the 53 largest doctoral programs, indicated that only 17% of the graduates of our doctoral programs study any international courses during their graduate (masters and doctoral) studies. Thus, the next generation of faculty members will have difficulty in introducing any international content into the courses they teach.&copy; 1987 JIBS.

Abstract: The study analyzes the responses of 411 AACSB member schools with respect to their offerings in international business. The findings of this study are that international business material is often incorporated into functional courses, and that among AACSB schools the accredited ones are not significantly different from the non accredited ones in terms of curricula composition.&copy; 1987 JIBS.
