Abstract: This paper extends the internalization approach to the theory of the multinational enterprise (MNE) to include an expanded role for equity joint ventures. Using the transaction cost paradigm of Williamson, this paper explains why joint ventures may sometimes be preferred over wholly owned subsidiaries. Also presented is empirical work on joint-venture performance in developing countries which demonstrates that under certain conditions joint ventures can be the optimal mode of foreign direct investment.&copy; 1987 JIBS.

Abstract: Cross-cultural studies are inherently difficult because the typical research design fails to differentiate cultural from other environmental influences. The present study uses a research design that attempts to isolate the influence of culture. Japanese, Chinese and Mexican managers, their ethnic-American counterparts, and Anglo-Americans are used to test the model. Results indicate unique persistent cultural characteristics with the cultural effect varying among the three groups of managers.&copy; 1987 JIBS.

Abstract: Many financial managers think that foreign exchange hedging decisions are mainly a choice between to hedge or not to hedge. Nevertheless, previous researchers applied Ederington&apos;s portfolio approach and found that even for risk minimization, a complete hedge does not lead to the lowest risk. Instead, there exists an optimal hedging ratio which yields the lowest variance. However, the discussions of these former studies were concentrated on a single foreign currency cash flow. In the real world, financial managers are more likely to expect multiple cash flows arriving at different times even for the same foreign currency. This paper therefore discusses whether financial managers should hedge these cash flows independently or combine them under one integrative hedging scheme. It is shown that, while the independent approach does not lead to the lowest risk, its hedging effectiveness is close to that of the integrative approach. Given the time and resource constraints of financial managers, the simpler independent approach appears to be a better choice.&copy; 1987 JIBS.

Abstract: This paper investigates empirically whether industrial organization-oriented FDI theories explain the recent phenomenon of reverse foreign direct investment in the U.S. Based on the distribution of FDI in two-digit SIC manufacturing industries, we find that capital and advertising intensities act as entry barriers to foreign investments in the U.S. We also observe that foreign multinationals are attracted by the U.S. market size, and that they invest heavily in industries with intensive R&amp;D combined with marketing efforts.&copy; 1987 JIBS.

Abstract: We assess the viability of bank&apos;s strategy of entering into retail banking worldwide, wherever regulations permit, via a review of literature and evidence on foreign direct investment in banking. Issues we discuss include the roles of regulation, the costs of operating at a distance and in an unfamiliar environment, and the advantages of offsetting factors which foreign banks may possess relative to their local competitors. The factors the paper examines are uncompetitive host markets, product differentiation, economies of scale, management and technology, cost of capital, government support, and vertical integration.&copy; 1987 JIBS.

Abstract: The AACSB accreditation guidelines of 1974, and the subsequent growth in international business education, add considerably to the need for a clearer understanding of the academic qualifications and research activities of those who are called upon to teach international business subjects. This paper presents information on the educational backgrounds, institutional affiliations, and research interests of the Academy of International Business (AIB) membership. Where appropriate, a distinction is made between members affiliated with U.S. institutions and members affiliated with non-U.S. institutions.&copy; 1987 JIBS.
