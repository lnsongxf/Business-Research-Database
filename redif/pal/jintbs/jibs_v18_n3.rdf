Abstract: The relevance of paradigms focusing on rational and sociopolitical power in strategic decision-making is explored among three country clusters. The predictive validity of a model incorporating political and rational sources of power is established across the clusters. Moreover, country clusters appear to moderate the power relationships.&copy; 1987 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (1987) 18, 1&ndash;14

Abstract: This study tested for the extent of similarity between 1708 American senior vice-presidents and those 418 British counterparts. The sample was drawn from the Fortune 500 and the Times 500, being representative of the top management teams of the largest national companies dominating domestic economies.Results show substantial differences between American and British top management in terms of corporate &ldquo;grooming,&rdquo; educational and domestic experiences, and in self-concept with regard to aspiration levels and executive success traits.The findings of this research should have significance to scholars of overseas investment patterns; to US and UK companies considering acquisitions in each other&apos;s countries; to top management evaluating managerial compatibility in potential US/UK joint ventures; and to those companies seeking competitive advantage in each other&apos;s domestic markets.&copy; 1987 JIBS.

Abstract: This paper provides an empirical assessment comparing board composition (proportion of outside/nonmanagement board members) and CEO duality (role of CEO and chairperson held simultaneously) between samples (n=150) of Japanese, United Kingdom, and United States industrial firms. Results indicate marked differences in these corporate governance dimensions. Implications regarding board independence, and differences in corporate governance internationally are discussed.&copy; 1987 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (1987) 18, 33&ndash;42

Abstract: This study was designed to examine whether several situation variables serve as moderators of the effects of leader reward and punishment behaviors for Taiwanese workers. Contrary to what would be expected from Kerr and Jermier&apos;s (1978) substitutes for leadership model, none of the situational variables was found to reverse (1) the positive relationship between leader contingent reward behavior and subordinate performance or satisfaction, or (2) the generally negative relationship between leader noncontingent punishment behavior and these subordinate criterion variables. Potential limitations of these findings, and their implications for the study of leadership effectiveness across cultures are then discussed.&copy; 1987 JIBS.

Abstract: One hundred and fifty-two Brazilian companies that were exporting in 1978 were interviewed again six years later in 1984 to determine the factors that were correlated with the continuance of exporting. Firm characteristics, export management practices and manager perceptions were each found to be correlated with exporting success thus supporting the basic contention that it is possible to predict export performance. Firms that discontinued exporting relied more on the Brazilian government export incentives, possibly to be competitive in international markets without making the necessary structural changes, thereby raising important questions about the long-run of the Brazilian export programs.&copy; 1987 JIBS.

Abstract: Over the period 1972-84, profitability among 304 large, British manufacturing companies was positively related to their degree of multinationality. Moreover, increases in overseas production were strongly associated with increases in sales and profitability. The profitability of multinational growth over the whole period was independent of its destination, supporting the view that the primary source of the superior performance of multinationals was competitive advantage rather than the higher rate of profit in the industries of other countries.&copy; 1987 JIBS.

Abstract: Several years ago Donald Ball and Wendell McCulloch carried out an opinion survey of members of the Academy of International Business as to the ranking of international programs in U.S. business schools (JIBS, Spring/Summer 1984). It included 79 schools in the results.This author carried out a survey of the leading 47 schools (plus 5 others) to gather factual data about the masters programs I.B. in those schools, about the students and about the faculty who teach the I.B. courses.Usable responses were received from 42 schools, of which it was found that 12 did not offer a major or concentration in I.B. Using 18 criteria, the I.B. programs of the remaining 30 schools were ranked, assuming an equal weight to each criterion.The major purpose of the survey was to rank the programs based on data furnished by an AIB member at each school. In addition, the data gathered informs the reader as to the facts about the leading masters programs in I.B., beyond what one can gain from the official AIB Curriculum Survey.&copy; 1987 JIBS.
