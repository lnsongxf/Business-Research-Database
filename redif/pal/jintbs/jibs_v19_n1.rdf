Abstract: This article reviews some of the criticisms directed towards the eclectic paradigm of international production over the past decade, and restates its main tenets. The second part of the article considers a number of possible extensions of the paradigm and concludes by asserting that it remains &ldquo;a robust general framework for explaining and analysing not only the economic rationale of economic production but many organisational and impact issues in relation to MNE activity as well.&rdquo;&copy; 1988 JIBS.

Abstract: This paper investigates the impact of several factors on the foreign investment of U.S. advertising agencies by using the theories on the determinants of foreign direct investment by manufacturing firms. For the two years examined, the hypotheses about the impact of host country market size, host country geographic proximity, firm size, firm&apos;s international operations experience, oligopolistic reaction, and presence of home country customers abroad are all confirmed. This paper also investigates the impact of oligopolistic reaction among the top ten and the second ten largest agencies and finds a stronger impact for the former.&copy; 1988 JIBS.

Abstract: Empirical research is scarce to answer the concerns of governments, unions and public opinion at large, concerning how multinationals make decisions to restructure their international strategic portfolio or close plants overseas to ensure long-run competitiveness. Based on three in-depth analyses of different types of restructing decisions, the author concludes that the foreign subsidiaries seem to carry most of the decisionmaking effort for their own plant closures, while for strategic portfolio readjustments during which they change owners, they are not consulted.&copy; 1988 JIBS.

Abstract: This paper reports some of the findings of a study on environmental scanning practices in six large Korean firms and compares the results with those of previous studies on scanning conducted in the United States. Such comparisons are made for both the scanning behaviors of individual managers and the structures, roles, and systems of formal environmental scanning units. The overall conclusion that emerges is that while scanning behaviors of American and Korean firms are quite similar, on average, they differ significantly in the extents of inter-organizational variances in the two societies. Scanning practices of U.S. firms are diverse, While those of Korean firms are remarkably similar.Such uniformity in the way Korean firms scan their environments, it is argued, arise from mimetic and normative isomorphism (DiMaggio and Powell 1983) and is an illustration of how inter-organizational influences affect firm behavior. The causes and consequences of such inter-organizational homogeneity have important theoretical, methodological, and practical implications, some of which are briefly discussed in the paper.&copy; 1988 JIBS.

Abstract: Many studies have been conducted on the impact of various factors on international capital structure. The literature still reveals disagreement on the significance of the industry and country effects in determining capital structure, and the basis of country differences. This paper presents the results of a study of the debt structure of 677 firms in 9 industries headquartered in 23 countries. The results of this study tend to agree with the hypothesis that cultural differences are correlated with the significant country and minimal industry influences which are found. Further, there appear to be some intercountry influences caused by underlying cultural patterns among groups of countries.&copy; 1988 JIBS.

Abstract: The growing internationalization of capital markets suggests that an increasing number of firms perceive the benefits of listing their stocks on foreign exchanges as outweighing the related costs. Many other firms, however, still limit listing their securities to their domestic exchanges. This study investigates the motives for listing aboard. The empirical analyses, based on data on 481 multinationals, indicate significant association between the likelihood of listing abroad and 1) the relative size of a firm in its domestic capital market, 2) the ratio of foreign to total sales.&copy; 1988 JIBS.
