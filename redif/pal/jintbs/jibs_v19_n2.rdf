Abstract: This paper examines the extent of foreign currency and/or parent company currency financial measures used by 105 U.K.-based MNCs in the process of evaluting foreign subsidiary operations and their managers&apos; performance.The results of the empirical study indicate a preference towards the use of local currency measures and the extent of this preference tends to be greater than those found in recent similar studies of U.s.-based MNCs.&copy; 1988 JIBS.

Abstract: This study examines the effects of country-of-origin and brand name cues on consumer evaluations of uni-national and bi-national products and estimates of the perceived values of such cues. From personal interviews with a regional quota sample of household residents, the study found the salience of country-of-origin in product evaluations under within-subject experimental design. Finally, managerial implications are discussed in regards to international branding and sourcing strategies.&copy; 1988 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (1988) 19, 235&ndash;255

Abstract: The Academy of International Business members were polled to elicit their opinions of the relative quality of graduate international business programs in American schools. A second part of the questionnaire asked their opinions about business schools in other countries.A similar survey was made in 1983, so that an additional feature of this 1986 study is the ability to compare rankings of American schools and observe some changes over the intervening years. The 1983 survey did not request opinions about non-American schools.&copy; 1988 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (1988) 19, 295&ndash;299

Abstract: This paper examines whether or not U.S.-based multinational corporations (MNCs) have different capital structures than U.S. domestic corporations (DCs) and if so, what causes the differences. In explaining the difference between the capital structures of MNCs and DCs, previous studies tended to directly discuss the relationships between international environmental factors (e.g., political risk, foreign exchange risk) and the capital structure. A framework of analysis is proposed in this paper that examines the influence of environmental factors on the firm-related capital structure determinants (e.g., agency costs, bankruptcy costs) that in turn affect the capital structure of the MNC. Among the determinants that are examined, more emphasis is placed on the discussion of agency costs since no previous studies have applied this concept in the international arena. Empirical tests were conducted to investigate whether MNCs are significantly different from DCs regarding agency costs of dept, bankruptcy costs, and capital structure. Contrary to conventional wisdom, the empirical findings show that MNCs do not have lower bankruptcy costs and that they tend to have lower debt ratios than DCs.&copy; 1988 JIBS.

Abstract: The paper explores the difficulties of testing the internalization approach in the modern theory of the multinational enterprises. The structure of the theory is elaborated and the conclusion drawn that testing cannot occur at the most general theoretical level but that the theory requires careful restricting assumptions to be placed on it to allow rigorous testing. Several empirical circumstances would constitute refutation if they could be shown to hold. However, the use of unconventional cases or outliers does not constitute disproof. More rigour is required in formulating and testing the theory but the current verdict on the theory must be &ldquo;not disproven&rdquo;.&copy; 1988 JIBS.

Abstract: Throughout the course of a career, an individual must make numerous role transitions, instigated through such events as overseas transfers, domestic transfers, promotions, company reorganizations, and inter-company job changes. This paper examines the relationships between several variables and work role transition in the case of an overseas assignment to Japan. Role ambiguity and role discretion were found to influence work adjustment, while predeparture knowledge, association with local nationals, and family&apos;s adjustment were found to correlate with general adjustment of American expatriate managers in Japan.&copy; 1988 JIBS.

Abstract: This study investigates the proposition that home country political risk factors influence outward foreign direct investment. Investment data from the U.S. Department of Commerce is used to model investment activity in the United States from various industrialized source countries. Foreign direct investment is regressed on home country domestic and international economic and political risk measures for the Western industrial countries. Results indicate that investment activity from the ICs in the U.S. is dependent on home country economic and political conditions.&copy; 1988 JIBS.
