Abstract: International counterfeiting of products covered by intellectual property laws is major issue in international business. The Unites States government in particular has threatened to invoke trade legislation to retaliate against countries that fail to attack domestic piracy activities. This paper briefly reviews the economic consequences of international product counterfeiting. It cautions that while such piracy has net costs, widespread retaliation through trade protectionism could also prove costly. It recommends a policy approach that facilitates &ldquo;private&rdquo; protection of property rights.&copy; 1988 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (1988) 19, 497&ndash;504

Abstract: For assessing the determinants of MNBs&apos; expansion into LDCs, a model that incorporates both supply and demand factors is constructed. A reduced form of the model is tested by using pooled data over the period 1975&ndash;1982 for a sample of twenty-three LDCs. The results of the study indicate that market size, the presence of multinational corporations from the home country, the extent of economic development, and the balance of payments are all significant determinants of the growth of MNBs in LDCs.&copy; 1988 JIBS.

Abstract: This study investigates the effects of foreign and domestic source manipulations on cross-national response rates of business people in two countries: the United States and Britain. The hypothesis that managers from the U.S.A. are more likely to respond than those from Britain is also tested. Results suggest that foreign source effects do not raise response rates. For British managers, findings suggest that higher compliance results from the &lsquo;domestic&rsquo; source. Responses from USA managers were no higher than from their British counterparts. The implications of these findings for cross-national mail surveys are discussed.&copy; 1988 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (1988) 19, 483&ndash;489

Abstract: Mail surveys are one alternative for satisfying information needs about international markets. To date, minimal empirical research is available to inform academicians or practitioners of expected response rates, or of the efficacy of incentives when undertaking mail surveys across disparate cultures. The results from a study conducted in six countries suggests that an inexpensive and perhaps symbolic incentive, such as a commemorative stamp, can significantly increase response rates. For academicians conducting cross-cultural research, the mail survey may be the most cost-effective data collection method.&copy; 1988 JIBS.

Abstract: This paper reports some of the findings of a multi-phased, multi-method study on the organizational attributes that facilitate creation, adoption, and diffusion of innovations by subsidiaries of multinational companies. Comparison of results obtained through case research in nine companies, multiple-respondent questionnaire surveys in three companies, and a single-respondent survey in 66 North American and European multinationals reveal unambiguous and positive impacts of normative integration through organizational socialization and dense intra- and inter-unit communication on an MNC subsidiary&apos;s ability to contribute to the different innovation tasks. The findings are less consistent with regard to the effects of local resources and autonomy and it appears that the influences of these two attributes are strongly mediated by the levels of normative integration and organizational communication.&copy; 1988 JIBS.

Abstract: Two major controversies exist in the translation of foreign currency financial statements: (1) which translation method should be used, and (2) how should the resulting translation gain or loss be reported. This paper proposes and implements two criteria for resolving these issues in which the appropriate combination is determined by examining the behavior of exchange rates. Application of these criteria would yield translation policy substantially different from that required under current accounting rules.&copy; 1988 JIBS.

Abstract: Data processing and telecommunications have become more sophisticated. More data can be analyzed and moved faster than ever before. This is potentially helpful for international business, but has raised concern among governmental officials and has resulted in a host of regulations pertaining to transnational data flow.Previous authors have raised concerns that these regulations will hinder international business, but this study indicates that most U.S.-based multinationals do not consider current regulations to be a problem.&copy; 1988 JIBS.

Abstract: This paper empirically tests the impact of oligopolistic reaction and some firm&ndash;related and host country&ndash;related factors on FDI activities in the U.S. tire and textile industries. The results reveal that in an oligopolistic industry, firms&apos; motivation of FDI is based on the behavior of rivals as well as host country&ndash;related and firm&ndash;related factors, while in a more competitively structured industry, firms do not actively counter the competitors&apos; FDI activities.&copy; 1988 JIBS.

Abstract: In developing entry marketing strategies for new product markets companies might be advised to target product markets where significant market shares are likely to be achieved. The literature on market share change is reviewed to identify situational and marketing strategy factors associated with market share achievement. Certain hypotheses suggested by this and related literatures were then tested using a database of products introduced into the Japanese market. The results of this analysis indicate that a few key situational and marketing strategy variables account for a large proportion of the variation in achieved market share in Japan.&copy; 1988 JIBS.

Abstract: Characteristics of national cultures have frequently been claimed to influence the selection of entry modes. This article investigates this claim by developing a theoretical argument for why culture should influence the choice of entry. Two hypotheses are derived which relate culture to entry mode choice, one focusing on the cultural distance between countries, the other on attitudes towards uncertainty avoidance. Using a multinomial logit model and controlling for other effects, the hypotheses are tested by analysing data on 228 entries into the United States market by acquisition, wholly owned greenfield, and joint venture. Empirical support for the effect of national culture on entry choice is found.&copy; 1988 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (1988) 19, 411&ndash;432
