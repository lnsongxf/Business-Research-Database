Abstract: The growing involvement of American business in international production and marketing has caused both practicing managers and professors of business administration to ask themselves whether international management really differs from the management of domestic operations. It is tempting to argue that the principles of good management surely are not culture-bound, and that the sensitive and perceptive professional can readily transport his managerial skills to another environment and operate successfully. On the other hand, anyone familiar with the experience of major firms in foreign operations is aware of the many stories of decisions, which viewed ex post, were clearly cases of bad judgment or miscalculation. Although domestic operations are by no means free of unfortunate managerial decisions, one does have the impression that any attempt to construct a box score of successes and failures at home and abroad would show that management decision making is more hazardous in the out-of-country operations. Some firms have been operating abroad for so long that they can be as sure-footed in their international as in their domestic operations (perhaps even more so in some local markets where competition might be less intense or of a different character than at home); but especially for the corporation relatively new at the international game, the pitfalls in the path to profitable operations can be particularly troublesome.&copy; 1970 JIBS.

Abstract: In the conduct of the financial function the manager of a multinational enterprise ordinarily has a more complex undertaking than his domestic counterpart. This greater complexity arises in part because he is faced with the same problems but they are aggravated; for example, the multinational enterprise is likely to have more subsidiaries located greater distances from the parent. Then again, added complexity occurs because the manager must cope with problems that are unique to multinationality. Thus, he must deal in a number of currencies, understand the intricacies of different money markets, and cope with the laws of various foreign governments. Both types of problems&mdash;those similar to the domestic situation but aggravated and those unique to multinationality&mdash;are embraced in the financing of foreign subsidiaries. To illustrate the underlying difficulties, typical financing patterns are sketched in Exhibit I , in order of increasing complexity, although even the last one shown is still highly simplified. Exhibit t A portrays the case of a domestic corporation obtaining dollars from local financial sources.&copy; 1970 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (1970) 1, 43&ndash;64

Abstract: The availability of more alternatives in the decision making process is one of the most important distinguishing characteristics between the management function in an international business enterprise111 The terms international business enterprise, international corporation, multinational company, etc. will be used synonymously. They denote a business firm which operates simultaneously in different political, legal, social, and cultural environments. and the management of a firm which operates strictly within national confines. The choice among additional alternatives permits the firm to achieve a greater degree of maximization. It is true, the road to the realization of such alternatives is marred by obstacles and pitfalls, the study of which is a major concern of our academic specialty, International Business. However, while one recognizes the importance of analyzing these difficulties, at the same time one must not overlook the tremendous opportunities which the choice of alternatives presents for the multinational company.&copy; 1970 JIBS.

Abstract: The program yesterday, and this gathering this morning of those who are concerned with education for international business are impressive evidence of an emerging professional orientation. There are some questions, however, that need clarification. These are some professional questions which 1 believe we all have faced and have answered perhaps to our own satisfaction, but without realizing that others have answered them quite differently. Such differences may be quite proper for personal questions, but to the extent that our Association is moving toward a profession, is it not timely that we at least consider wherein we agree and disagree, or do we only speak in different tongues?&copy; 1970 JIBS.

Abstract: The study of direct investment movements has become increasingly important in recent years due to the impact that these movements have on development, balance of payments, and domestic control of the domestic economy. From 1954 through 1967, the value of foreign direct investment in the United States grew from &dollar;4.6 billion to &dollar;9.9 billion. Concomitant with this growth has been an increase in interest in the United States to attract foreign investment. At the national level the interest has evolved because of balance of payments problems; whereas, at the state and local level, interest is due to industrial development objectives.&copy; 1970 JIBS.

Abstract: Late in 1963, Bechtel Corporation Began Exploring with the Government of India a Crash Program to Produce one Million tons of fertilizer in India by Constructing five standardized plants of 200,000 tons each annual capacity.111 The case summary is based on my article &ldquo;A Consortium that Never Was,&rdquo; Columbia Journal of World Business, September-October, 1969, pp. 63-65. In August 1964, a committee of senior officials from the ministries of finance, Petroleum and Chemicals, and food and Agriculture authorized Bechtel to submit by late December 1964 a detailed feasibility study on the production and distribution of approximately one million tons per annum of nitrogen in urea and complex fertilizers. The Schedule for project Development was: submission of a Specific Proposal by early January 1965 Approval in principle by March 1965, final approval of specific terms of investment by July 1, 1965.&copy; 1970 JIBS.
