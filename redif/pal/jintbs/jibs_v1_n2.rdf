Abstract: Overthrow of the Argentine dictatorship of Juan Peron in September of 1955 was followed by over a decade of political upheaval, high inflation, sporadic balance of payments crises, and periodic devaluation of the Argentine peso. In this seemingly inauspicious environment, surprisingly, the manufacturing capacity and output of Argentine owned industrial companies increased significantly.&copy; 1970 JIBS.

Abstract: The basic disciplines of business schools&mdash;accounting, finance, management, marketing, and production&mdash;generally do not emphasize the environmental warp of firms operating abroad, with the consequence that students are often inadequately prepared for the subtle differences which foreign environmental features may have upon a given business decision. We believe that these special problems of multinational business can be presented to novices most effectively by simulation techniques.&copy; 1970 JIBS.

Abstract: Probably no aspect of direct private foreign investment and the &ldquo;climate&rdquo;for foreign investment is so thoroughly permeated with Myth, mystery and misunderstanding as the issue of expropriation of private foreign investment. Emotions run strong and run deep on this issue and the possibility of expropriation is a pervasive and persistant element in most foreign investment decision matrices:&copy; 1970 JIBS.

Abstract: Most less developed countries (LDC&apos;s) encounter a shortage of foreign exchange when they attempt to accelerate their rate of economic growth.111 The basic support for this assertion is from H. Chenery and A. Strout, &ldquo;Foreign Assistance and Economic Development.&rdquo; American Economic Review (September, 1966), pp. 679-731. Harry Johnson has disputed the significance of foreign exchange as a separate factor in development. See Economic Politics Toward Less Developed Countries (Washington: Brooking Institution, 1967). pp. 52-64. In response to such a shortage, many countries interfere with the market allocations of foreign exchange to assure that &ldquo;priority&rdquo; demands for exchange will be met. The service of private foreign capital usually does not have a priority. Consequently, dividends on private foreign direct investment are often limited in one way or another by LDC's.&copy; 1970 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (1970) 1, 35&ndash;53
