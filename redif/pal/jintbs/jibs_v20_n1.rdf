Abstract: There does not appear to be consensus concerning what is the conceptual domain of international business. This paper argues that this is due in part to an emphasis on the firm as the unit of analysis. It is further argued that a comprehensive, generative and theoretically integrative definition of international business could be established if exchange were made the unit of analysis. By using the political economy paradigm and the various concepts of exchange adopted by the social sciences, nine characteristics are identified and developed which uniquely define the conceptual domain in international business.&copy; 1989 JIBS.

Title: Use of Minority and 50&ndash;50 Joint Ventures by United States Multinationals During the 1970s: The Interaction of Host Country Policies Corporate Strategies

Abstract:  This article examines geographical, sectoral, and corporate trends in the use of minority and 50-50 joint ventures by U.S. multinational manufacturing and mining firms in less developed countries (LDCs) during the 1970s. It is based primarily on data found in the Harvard Multinational Enterprise Data Base, as updated through the mid-1970s, and supplemented with corporate performance data for the 1975-1980 period from a new international Competitive Analysis (ICA) database developed with support from the General Electric Foundation.During the 1970s, there was a clear move toward U.S. Corporate acceptance of minority ownership positions in manufacturing operations in LDCs. This move toward minority joint ventures by American MNEs was, however, concentrated in a handful of specific countries that had activist government policies promoting local ownership. These countries are not now thought to be among the more successful LDC economies.Viewed from the perspective of MNE strategy and performance, our findings confirm Wells&apos;s earlier results that the firms most willing to accept minority or 50-50 joint ventures tend to be smaller, &ldquo;second-rank oligopolists&rdquo; in their industries. The hypothesis that &ldquo;second-rank&rdquo; meant &ldquo;second rate&rdquo; in terms of MNE growth and financial performance in their worldwide industry was also examined. Although there was some suggestion that LDC prominority-joint venture policies may have been &lsquo;screening in&rdquo; less successful firms in the computer and tire industries, there was no evidence of a systematic tendency across industries of a negative relationship between MNE acceptance of minority positions and company under-performance.&copy; 1989 JIBS.

Abstract: Countertrade success was found to be higher for large firms that were experienced in exporting and in countertrade operations, could accommodate countertrade takebacks and valued vertical integration, exposed high value, high visibility, complex products, had a low reputation for quality and had excess capacity. Success was also higher if the importer valued quality, had low technical proficiency, was inexperienced in exporting, faced barriers in export markets, had a high cost of forward contracts, foreign exchange constraints, and faced a disequilibrium exchange rate.&copy; 1989 JIBS.

Abstract: Choosing a methodology determines what we can study as well as the range of possible results and conclusions. This study took an instrument that had been developed in the west and used extensively in Europe and North America to investigate managerial behavior in the people&apos;s Republic of China. For a number of reasons, it failed to produce a valid and reliable description of Chinese managerial behavior. This paper investigates some of the methodogical issues involved in extending western organizational knowledge to the East. It raises some fundamental questions about being &ldquo;outside, looking in&rdquo;.&copy; 1989 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (1989) 20, 61&ndash;74

Abstract: Multinational companies in newly industrialized countries face a dilemma of whether and when they should engage in U.S. manufacturing. This study investigates consumer evaluations of product quality and purchase intent of two electronic products currently imported into the U.S. from a company in a newly industrialized country and one electronic product currently not manufactured by the same company. The results suggest that reverse investment in the U.S. may be a viable strategic alternative for companies in newly industrialized country traditionally engaged only in export activities if they pay careful attention to price and retail distribution in the U.S.&copy; 1989 JIBS.

Abstract: This paper reviews popular and academic literature in order to describe several relationships which appear to exist between liberalization in LDCs and imports of consumer goods. Based on this review, the parameters of a life-cycle model are developed for consumer product exports to liberalizing LDCs. such exports are hypothesized to: (1) be minimal prior to liberalization, and (2) rise rapidly in the early stages of liberalization, and (3) decline, sometimes precipitously, several years later. These hypotheses are tested using consumer import data from three unique LDCs: Chile, Egypt and China. Finally, the implications of the model for LDC governments, exporters and foreign investors are explored.&copy; 1989 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (1989) 20, 93&ndash;112

Abstract: Based on a typology of sourcing strategies, this study identifies various sourcing patterns adopted by European and Japanese multinational manufacturing firms in serving the U.S. market, The study has found that the product&apos;s market performance is not at all related to its life&ndash;Cycle stage in world trade or to production location, but is positively related to the internal components sourcing and negatively related to the product adaptation. The findings strongly support Levitt&apos;s call for a global product.&copy; 1989 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (1989) 20, 113&ndash;130

Abstract: The effective management of corporate executives returning from foreign assignments has received little attention from academic researchers. This study is based on questionnaires completed by members of the American Society of Personnel Administration: International (ASPI). The focus of the study was directed at problems that occurred in repatriating executives, programs used by corporations to repatriate returning executives, and examines why programs have not been instituted by multinational corporations.&copy; 1989 JIBS.

Abstract: All international investments inevitably have some diversification consequences. Yet the literature on foreign direct investment accords only a limited role to diversification or financial variables. This paper develops a theory of corporate international investment from the standpoint of finance in an environment where the segmentation of international capital markets for individuals or the presence of agency costs provide some independence to corporate decisions separate from shareholders. The model does not depend on any particular advantage of multinational firms, and is specifies the stochastic properties of domestic and foreign output and input prices. It is found that real exchange risk and diversification gains affect corporate international investment in a significant way. It is also shown that the model embodies several existing explanations based on behavioral and economic variables.&copy; 1989 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (1989) 20, 145&ndash;155
