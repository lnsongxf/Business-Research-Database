Abstract: Control is a critical concept for successful management and performance of international joint ventures (IJVs). This paper reviews and synthesizes prior studies addressing the conceptualization and operationalization of control within IJVs, as well as the IJV control-performance relationship. The paper also presents a new conceptualization of IJV control, as well as a conceptual frame work for studying control of IJVs.&copy; 1989 JIBS.

Abstract: We examine the effects of firm-specific strategic advantages on the FDI behavior of Japanese semiconductor firms. We investigate the strategic advantages necessary for undertaking FDI in this industry, and show that these advantages are systematically associated with the variation in FDI behavior. We identify technological innovation, a broad product line, and vertical linkages with down stream businesses as sources of such strategic advantages. We also show that size of the firm influences its decision to go international.&copy; 1989 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (1989) 20, 296&ndash;314

Abstract: It is widely believed that a country&apos;s foreign policy can influence the behavior of economic agents. We examine that extent to which political relationships between a bank&apos;s home country and a borrowing country affect the lending behavior of banks. Analysis of cooperative as well as conflictive events shows that banks consider mostly the former in their decision making process. The study points to a need for an interdisciplinary approach for explaining the international behavior of economic entities.&copy; 1989 JIBS.

Abstract: This article analyses the provisions of the new E.E.C. directive on product liability and examines the complex evolution of such liability in Western Europe. Interpretations and criticisms are offered. All twelve members must revise their laws and meet the Directive&apos;s standards and spirit. The Directive is important not only because of the highly significant changes it presents to multinational companies operating in Western Europe but because it is an outstanding example of the trend towards more supranational business law and it represents a considerable accomplishment of the consumer movements.&copy; 1989 JIBS.

Abstract: This paper reports the result of a survey of central banks aimed at assessing the existence of multiple classes of central banks of sufficiently different character to protect against the potentially devastating effects of risk transmission initiated by major financial shocks in one or more banking systems. Using cluster analysis as the analytical technique, evidence is found to support the existence of multiple classes of central banks that may insulate the international banking system from externally generated shocks.&copy; 1989 JIBS.

Abstract: This study investigates the informational efficiency of the syndicated Euro-credit market by analyzing the adjustment of spreads to &ldquo;news&rdquo; characterizing the state of sovereign borrowers&apos; creditworthiness. In addition, the potential for an interlinked crisis (contagion effects) between three major borrowing countries is examined. That is, contagion tests are conducted to see how &ldquo;news&rdquo; for one borrower affects the spreads charged to the others. The evidence suggests that the Euro-Credit pricing process has been informationally efficient. However, with respect to the contagion effects it was found that noncountry-specific  risk factors systematically influence country-specific spreads.&copy; 1989 JIBS.

Abstract: Host country interventions in goods markets (e.g., tariffs and quotas) and factor markets (e.g., tax holidays and training grants for workers) are recognized as having substantial effects on the profitability of foreign direct investments. This study proposes two new comprehensive measures&mdash;total protection and an internationalized version of the marginal effective rate of taxation&mdash;that incorporate all government interventions in a single, easily understood common denominator readily applicable to empirical research. Empirical estimates of the total protection measure for Europe suggest that for new investments government interventions in factor market increase profitability more than trade interventions.&copy; 1989 JIBS.

Abstract: This study investigates the extent to which the disclosure requirements of the London Stock Exchange relating to company annual reports are complied with or exceeded by Continental European companies listed on the Exchange. It was found that the companies exceeded Exchange requirements through a wide range of voluntary disclosures, which in some cases were substantial. The significance of the Stock Exchange requirements appeared to be relatively minimal compared to competitive pressures associated with the need to raise capital in the international capital market context. At the same time, there were persistent national characteristics in the pattern of items voluntarily disclosed.&copy; 1989 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (1989) 20, 315&ndash;336
