Abstract: International business is characterized by high uncertainty, making accurate forecasting both important and difficult. Development in forecasting methodology are examined in the prediction of international debt reschedulings. Three basic forecasting approaches are evaluated: single method forecasts, raw data combination forecasts, and forecast-combinations. All three approaches exhibited significant improvement in prediction accuracy over a naive forecasting approach, but only the odds-matrix forecast-combination approach outperformed another non-native approach. The odds-matrix forecast-combination method is less sensitive to data sparsity and unreliability and has the potential to synthesize, effectively and in a theoretically based way, diverse perspectives in the international context.&copy; 1989 JIBS.

Abstract: International management studies have been based primarily on the comparison of managerial behavior in countries around the world. Often these studies have implied that business people behave similarly with their domestic colleagues as with their foreign counterparts. In questioning that assumption, this study tests whether intra-cultural behavior accurately predicts cross-cultural behavior. Using a negotiation simulation and a sample of 462 Japanese, American, and Canadian businesspeople, behaviors in cross-cultural negotiations were found to differ in some important ways from those in intra-cultural negotiations.&copy; 1989 JIBS.

Abstract: As a preliminary step in the internationalization of business school curricula, 122 major Canadian corporations were surveyed for their views on the importance of various management skills and international courses, as well as their opinion on the mechanisms (Institutions and academics) for delivering them. This article reports on the response obtained and suggests methods for improving the overall effectiveness of international business education.&copy; 1989 JIBS.

Abstract: This study provides empirical evidence for the relationship between the degree of influence U.S. parent companies have over the human resource decisions of their Mexican affiliates and the affiliates&apos; resource dependencies on the parent company. Both wholly-owned and Joint venture affiliates are examined. Resource dependence was the factor most closely related to parent influence over affiliate human resource decisions. The importance of an affiliate to a parent company, the nationality of affiliate managers, and the type of ownership arrangements were also found to affect parent influence, but to lesser extents than resource dependencies.&copy; 1989 JIBS.

Abstract: The mechanisms of coordination used by Multinational Corporations (MNCs) are studied, through an exhaustive literature review. A pattern of evolution is found: as time has passed, researchers have concentrated more on subtler and informal mechanisms, abandoning their unidimensional focus on structural issues. It is suggested that the increase in the study of those mechanisms may be due, among other reasons, to the fact that MNCs are indeed making more use of them. That could be explained by changes in the international competitive environment, which force firms to adjust their strategies, requiring ever more multidimensional coordination.&copy; 1989 JIBS.

Abstract: Identification of generic competitive strategy types has recently attracted considerable attention. Most of this research has, however, focused on competitive strategy of U.S. businesses in their domestic market. The present study extends these findings to markets outside the United States, and more specifically Europe, based on a sample of industrial businesses drawn from the PIMS database. Similar dimensions underlying competitive strategy, and similar generic types are found among business in the U.S. and in Europe. Some differences in the performance and business characteristics of certain strategy types were, however, observed between U.S. and European markets. Rate of market growth also appeared to have more significant relation to performance of businesses in Europe than in the U.S.&copy; 1989 JIBS.
