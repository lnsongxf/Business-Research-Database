Abstract: Two approaches may explain how multinational enterprises (MNEs) select ownership structures for subsidiaries. The first argues that MNEs prefer structures that minimize that transaction costs of doing business abroad. The second argues that ownership structures are determined by negotiations with host governments, whose outcomes depend on the bargaining power of the firm. This paper presents a framework integrating these two approaches and uses statistical methods to separate their effects empirically.The statistical analysis supports an important hypothesis of bargaining school&mdash;that attractive domestic markets increase the relative power of host governments. But it finds no support for other hypotheses of this school, such as those predicting that firms in marketing- and R&amp;D-intensive industries have more bargaining power than others. These latter factors were apparently more important in determining firm ownership preferences. Furthermore, the paper measures when government ownership restrictions deter firm entry, concluding that relatively large firms, and those with high intra-system sales are deterred more than others.&copy; 1990 JIBS.

Abstract: Every country, particularly if it depends on foreign trade to such a high degree as the Federal Republic of Germany, has a vital interest in exploiting all its export opportunities. The authors have developed a measurement concept focusing on the foreign orientation of business managers. Their empirical research suggests that as many as one-third of the small- and medium-sized firms with a primarily domestic focus in their country could be turned into successful exporters. The paper not only reveals obstacles to exporting as perceived by the managers of these companies, but also points to specific measures to improve the efficiency of existing export promotion programs.&copy; 1990 JIBS.

Abstract: Based on firm-specific financial data, performance of foreign multinationals operating in the U.S. is evaluated to determine if they enjoy advantages over U.S. firms. Results of this study indicate that foreign firms operating in the U.S. are less profitable than randomly selected U.S. firms, that they spend more in research and development but less in advertising, and that they have higher debt levels combined with higher liquidity. In addition, the findings also demonstrate that the determinants of excess market value, as measured by Tobin&rsquo;s q, differ between foreign-owned firms and American-owned firms, and that the performance of foreign multinational differ by country of origin. This suggests that foreign-owned firms may have different reasons for investing in the U.S. and that foreign multinationals present investment opportunities to the U.S. investors distinct from American firms.&copy; 1990 JIBS.

Abstract: Data from the Benchmark Surveys of the Commerce Department show the beginning of a global liberalization in government restrictions on foreign equity in the 1980s. This was manifested in a small but unmistakable across-the-board reduction in the share of 50-50 and minority affiliates out of all U.S. affiliates in a country. Across countries there remains a huge variation in this proportion, and the second part of the paper seeks to statistically explain this variation in a cross-section regression analysis.&copy; 1990 JIBS.

Abstract: The paper probes into the basic question of what individuals seek from working. Results from a representative sample of the labor force in seven countries (n = 8192) showed that the two most dominant work goals are &ldquo;interesting work&rdquo; and &ldquo;good pay.&rdquo; These were consistent internationally, across different organizational levels, between the genders and among different age categories.&copy; 1990 JIBS.

Abstract: The major rating agencies assign quality rating to international security offerings. These ratings serve as indicators of perceived sovereign risk associated with such offerings. A review of the ratings process followed by the major rating agencies (in particular, the Standard &amp; Poor&rsquo;s Corporation) reveals that ratings are assigned with considerable reliance on informal judgment. Informal judgmental systems, however, can induce serious inconsistencies in the relative importance assigned to criteria used in assigning rating and lead to biased ratings.This paper presents a formal judgmental model for assigning sovereign debt ratings that avoids the potential inconsistencies of informal systems. Model use is illustrated by relying on descriptions of the rating process published by Standard and Poor&rsquo;s Corporation. While the model proposed in this paper provides a framework for the rating agencies to ensure consistency in their ratings process, we suggest a complementary relationship between multivariate statistical classification models typically used to assess economic and political risk and the proposed model which assigns country risk ratings.&copy; 1990 JIBS.

Abstract: The ability of American labor unions to organize workers in majority and wholly foreign-owned manufacturing plants in the U.S. is examined by analyzing union representation election results. The principal conclusions are that the nationality of a firm is not a significant factor influencing election outcomes and that foreign firms are as difficult to unionize as domestic American firms. Several reasons are offered to explain these findings.&copy; 1990 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (1990) 21, 119&ndash;132

Abstract: International trade intermediaries, such as export management companies, have long existed in the United States. Many studies and reports have provided &ldquo;snapshots&rdquo; of their activities and roles over time. Their evolution, however, has hardly been researched&mdash;mainly for lack of an appropriate dynamic model. This paper integrates various conceptual frameworks and theories to develop a useful mode of the evolution of the U.S. international trade intermediary in the 1980s.&copy; 1990 JIBS.
