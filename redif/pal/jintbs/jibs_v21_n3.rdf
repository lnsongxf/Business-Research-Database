Abstract: In increasingly complex global competition, multinational firms, U.S. and foreign alike, have stepped up international sourcing of components and finished products to serve various markets. Since an increasing portion of global competition is shaped by European and Japanese multinational firms with due emphasis on product quality and manufacturing, it is an opportune time to examine the like among their product development, manufacturing, and sourcing activities. Those European and Japanese multinational firms marketing products in the United States are chosen as subjects of this study.The purpose of this paper is twofold. First, a taxonomy of sourcing strategies is developed to systematically identify a variety of sourcing patterns. This taxonomy helps resolve some of the conceptual ambiguities and paves the way for further empirical investigation. Second, based on a few variables identified in the taxonomy, performance implications of various sourcing strategies are explored.&copy; 1990 JIBS.

Abstract: A multilevel analysis of environmental (country) and organizational (affiliate) factors is used to explain the differential utilization rates of U.S. nationals in overseas professional positions of a major U.S. bank with 84 branches in 43 countries. The research suggests that to the extent that the affiliates of a multinational corporation operate in environments with differing levels of political risk, cultural distance, and competition and have operations with different levels of complexity and interdependence, a single staffing policy may be inappropriate.&copy; 1990 JIBS.

Abstract: This paper examines the influence of environmental and firm-specific variables on the selection of international transfer pricing strategies. The primary data were obtained from 164 multinational enterprises by means of a questionnaire. Responses were analyzed by performing factor analysis and constructing a probit model. The findings suggest that legal constraints and firm size are significant determinants in the selection of international transfer pricing strategies by U.S. multinationals.&copy; 1990 JIBS.

Abstract: While substantial research has been done on the competitive struggle between U.S. and Japanese consumer products, few studies have examined the U.S. Japan rivalry from a neutral-third country perspective. This study, covering a ten-year period (1975&ndash;1985) of data collection, examines changes in Finnish perceptions of U.S. and Japanese consumer products and marketing efforts. Results indicate that while Finnish consumer perceptions of U.S. products and marketing efforts have improved over time, the corresponding perceptions of the Japanese alternative have improved substantially more. Similarly, in areas where U.S. competitors has initial advantages, the study results indicate that by 1985 Japanese firms were able to overcome such advantages and were perceived as superior in all categories.&copy; 1990 JIBS.

Abstract: The aim of this study was to establish the ways in which senior executives in four countries which shared a common language&mdash;United Kingdom, United States, Australia and New Zealand&mdash;characterized both their firm&apos;s marketing effectiveness, and corporate culture and beliefs. Results give support to those theorists who advance cultural specificity as the primary moderator of top managerial attitudes, but also emphasise that the best predictor of marketing effectiveness is similar in all four nations&mdash;the primacy of the importance of people, and with quality.&copy; 1990 JIBS.

Abstract: This paper focuses on the process that occurs when active exporters, reacting to new opportunities, either enter or increase exports to psychologically distant markets. The overall purpose of the study is to provide guidance for export promotion activities. Since future exports cannot be observed directly, the attitude regarding future exports is introduced as this study&apos;s primary dependent variable. A model is formulated where firm and product attributes, as well as perceived barriers/opportunities are proposed as determinants of attitudes towards future exports. Previous export experience in the relevant market is also introduced as an additional variable in explaining attitude towards future exports. The model is tested in a two-step procedure with multiple discriminant and regression analysis. The data used to test the model is taken from a survey of Norwegian exporters of fishery products.&copy; 1990 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (1990) 21, 469&ndash;485

Abstract: Along with the rise and development of transaction cost economics, Stephen H. Hymer&apos;s works have recently become a matter of some controversy. This note clarifies the main issues in the controversy and explores the contributions of Hymer&apos;s theory of the MNE. A review of Hymer&apos;s works reveals that he had incorporated a Coasian theory of firms and markets in his theory as early as 1968. This note suggests that the genesis of transaction costs as applied to the MNE can be traced to Hymer.&copy; 1990 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (1990) 21, 487&ndash;494

Abstract: This paper presents new data on the trading activities of multinational companies. Estimates of intrafirm shipments are developed for 1977 and 1982 from trade data contained in the U.S. government benchmark surveys of direct foreign investment. The paper shows that intrafirm shipments comprised a significant share of U.S. international trade and contributed to the deficit pressure on the U.S. trade balance.&copy; 1990 JIBS.
