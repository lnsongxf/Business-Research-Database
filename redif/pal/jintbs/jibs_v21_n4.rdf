Abstract: This paper analyses the usage and contents of corporate codes of ethics. The results from a sample of 600 large European companies are contrasted with findings reported for similar U.S. firms. The comparison reveals that significantly fewer European than U.S. firms adopted codes of ethics. In Europe, the large majority of codes have been introduced only very recently and there are indications that codes made their way into Europe via subsidiaries of U.S. firms. However, there are striking differences in content between U.S. and European codes of ethics pointing to the existence of a distinctly European approach to codifying ethics.&copy; 1990 JIBS.

Abstract: In this study, business competing in global industries were categorized into three groups according to the integration responsiveness framework for conceptualizing industry pressures confronting business competing internationally. Using this framework, contextual conditions associated with each group were examined. Competitive attributes distinguishing each group were then identified to clarify alternate business-level strategies for competing within a global industry context. Beyond providing additional insight into the nature of competition in global industries, several broad extensions to the integration-responsiveness framework are suggested.&copy; 1990 JIBS.

Abstract: Studies of negotiation have proliferated, but few, especially in international business, have systematically detailed the complexity of negotiations in situ. This paper describes and explains the widely publicized, controversial talks between IBM and the Mexican government that followed IBM&apos;s proposal to established a 100%-owned personal computer assembly plant near Guadalajara.&copy; 1990 JIBS.

Abstract: The main purpose of this paper is to examine the cost constraints on voluntary information disclosure in a comparative study of the perceptions of financial executives in U.K. and U.S. multinationals. The study examines the perceived net costs or benefits of disclosing information voluntarily, the types of costs involved and the significance of cost constraints in respect of specific items of disclosure. The results suggest that while there is substantial agreement on the major cost constraints involved and the individual items giving rise to major net costs, there are significantly different perceptions by U.K. and U.S. financial executives in terms of the overall emphasis of responses to the issue of cost constraints on voluntary information disclosures.&copy; 1990 JIBS.

Abstract: In increasingly complex global competition, U.S. multinational firms have stepped up imports under items 806.30 and 807.00 of the Tariff Schedules of the United States as a part of offshore sourcing of components and finished products to serve the U.S. market.The literature offers two opposing views of the impact of U.S. firms&rsquo; 806/807 imports on their innovative ability. At the current level of knowledge, mostly conceptual or anecdotal, the literature fails to present any empirical evidence as to whether such offshore sourcing by U.S. firms will indeed stifle or complement their innovative ability. This study attempts to fill this void by empirically examining this issue at the industry level.&copy; 1990 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (1990) 21, 623&ndash;638

Abstract: A mail survey of Japanese distributors of U.S. products provided data for an examination of how perceptions of influence affect control and conflict in the relationship. Results indicated that aggressive influence evoked resistance and conflict, while more subtle influence strategies appeared to reduce conflict. Results suggested that influence, as practiced in western channels, may not be effective in relationship such as these.&copy; 1990 JIBS.

Abstract: The established theory of international business is not without problems. It is necessary to specify the key relationship between internalization and market structure and between internalization and competitive advantage more carefully. This paper attempts to clarify the former relationship by reference to the work of Hymer and the latter by contrasting the nature of internalization decisions with those building short-run competitive advantage. Avenues of development of the theory include the integration of nontraditional concepts and the reintegration of areas of research that have become divorced from core international business theory.&copy; 1990 JIBS.

Abstract: This study explores the relationship between country-based and culture-based differences in pay practices. Pay data from forty-one manufacturing industries in twenty-eight countries across five different culture clusters were examined. Although significant differences were found between countries in terms of pay level, the largest portion of the variance in the relationship between wages and benefits is due to cultural affiliation. The implications for cultural clustering theory and internationally pay decisionmaking are discussed.&copy; 1990 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (1990) 21, 667&ndash;678
