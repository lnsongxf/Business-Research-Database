Abstract: US patenting by 686 of the world&apos;s largest manufacturing firms shows that their share of the world&apos;s production of technology is less than their share of R&amp;D activities, and varies greatly amongst sectors. In most cases, the technological activities of these large firms are concentrated in their home country, the characteristics of which influence the volume and trends in their technological activities much more strongly then the international component of these activities. At the same time, these large firms are major elements in the volume and the pattern of sectoral specializations in their home countries&apos; technological activities.&copy; 1991 JIBS.

Abstract: Print and television advertisements for a variety of American products appearing in the U.S., Germany and Japan are analyzed to explore differences in the informational content of standardized vs. specialized approaches to multinational advertising. Overall, highly standardized messages were found to contain significantly fewer consumer information cues than highly specialized messages. This trend was found to hold true, regardless of product category. The more standardized the message being transferred, whether for a high or low involvement purchase item, the lower the level of consumer information contained within the commercial message.&copy; 1991 JIBS.

Abstract: Prior studies are vague regarding determinants of criteria for selecting &ldquo;complementary&rdquo; partners for international joint ventures (IJVs). This paper first distinguishes task and partner-related dimensions of selection criteria. The paper then argues that relative importance of task-related selection criteria is determined by the strategic context of the proposed IJV and the parent firm, specifically the critical success factors of the venture&apos;s competitive environment and the parent&apos;s static and dynamic position vis-a-vis these factors.&copy; 1991 JIBS.

Abstract: The type of expertise that a company contributes to a joint venture may affect the amount of equity that it owns. This research observes the ownership patterns associated with four common combinations of partner expertise in international joint ventures. The results rank company assets with respect to the contributor&apos;s ability to negotiate majority ownership in the original joint venture contract and that company&apos;s tendency to buy up equity from the partner later on.&copy; 1991 JIBS.

Abstract: One of the unique features of Japanese management is the lifetime employment system found in large firms. In a study of two samples, Japanese executives and personnel directors, several theoretical models of the causes and effects of lifetime employment were tested. A control model received strong support. Lifetime employment is offered within a rhetorical context of loyalty and benevolence based on cultural values. Its impact, however, is to increase the control of Japanese employees by managers.&copy; 1991 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (1991) 22, 79&ndash;97

Abstract: Few studies have attempted to examine how American managers actually manage while on assignment in foreign countries or the effectiveness of these managerial behaviors. This study compared the self-reported managerial behaviors of American expatriate managers in Hong Kong to a sample of American managers in the U.S. and Hong Kong Chinese managers in Hong Kong. The results from the study indicated that American expatriate managers in Hong Kong exhibit very similar managerial behaviors to the sample of managers in the U.S. However, while these managerial behaviors were positively related to job performance for the managers in the U.S., they were not related to job performance for the expatriates in Hong Kong, nor were these managerial behaviors related to job performance for Hong Kong Chinese managers in Hong Kong.&copy; 1991 JIBS.

Abstract: Export promotion systems in Canada and Austria are contrasted and their services evaluated from a company perspective. The Canadian system is government-based, while the Austrian one operates in the private sector. Apart from the philosophy under which these export support systems operate, they differ also in strategic orientation. A survey of stratified samples of exporters in Canada (271) and Austria (312) shows significant differences in perceived usefulness of services given similar exporters needs.  Companies desire more tailored support as well as greater involvement of private sector institutions which are not currently providing export support. Overall, Austrian companies appear more inclined to use export support and generally seem more willing to acquire exporting know-how externally compared to Canadian firms. Conclusions are offered with respect to improving the respective export promotion systems.&copy; 1991 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (1991) 22, 115&ndash;133

Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to replicate Euromoney&apos;s and Institutional Investor&apos;s country risk ratings on the basis of economic and political variables. The evidence reveals that country risk ratings respond to some of the variables suggested by the theory. In particular, both the level of per capita income and propensity to invest affect positively the rating of a country. In addition, high-ranking countries are less indebted than low-ranking countries. It also appears that the ability of the model to duplicate the two country risk measures is very similar and both magazines&apos; ratings can be replicated to a significant degree with few available economic statistics.&copy; 1991 JIBS.
