Abstract: Chinese perceptions of machinery suppliers from six countries are used to evaluate supplier strategies and the customer relationships formed. Strategies based on product quality and service had the greatest impact on preferences. The relationship formed seemed to reflect mainly the perceived value of the product service-package offered. &ldquo;Friendship&rdquo; in the traditional Chinese sense did not seem to be a strong characteristic of these relationships.&copy; 1991 JIBS.

Abstract: We explore the comparative business failures of foreign-owned or controlled firms and domestically owned firms. Original data are collected regarding foreign-controlled firms in the U.S. that filed for bankruptcy protection, were involuntarily liquidated or ceased operations mainly due to poor financial performance during the 1978-1988 period. Our results show that foreign-controlled firms fail less often than domestically owned firms. The patterns of foreign-controlled business failures and the impacts of entry modes, ownership types, and national culture on the failures of foreign-controlled firms are also examined.&copy; 1991 JIBS.

Abstract: The cross-cultural adjustment research literature has largely been conducted from an atheoretical perspective. When a theoretical framework is imposed, the U-Curve adjustment theory has been the one most commonly used. The lack of a comprehensive review of the empirical literature on the U-Curve adjustment theory has allowed scholars to accept or dismiss the theory on grounds other than that of empirical evidence. This paper reviews the empirical literature and proposes a theoretical framework and research agenda for future research on cross-cultural adjustment.&copy; 1991 JIBS.

Abstract: International joint ventures (IJVs) are increasing in frequency and strategic importance. However, efforts to identify variables associated with IJV performance have been constrained by disagreements regarding the comparability and reliability of alternative performance measures and methods. This study tests several hypotheses regarding the reliability and comparability of a range of objective and subjective measures of IJV performance, as well as evaluating the relative utility of different data collection approaches.&copy; 1991 JIBS.

Abstract: Prior accounting research has provided evidence of the information content of a company&apos;s actual or predicted accounting earnings. Prior studies have also found that factors such as firm size, industry, or systematic risk influence the accuracy of the earnings predictions. This study investigates the accuracy and the consensus among forecasters of earnings estimates for U.S. domestic and U.S. multinational corporations. Companies were classified into a domestic or multinational type for this research following the criteria established by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 14 for required disclosure of foreign operations. The empirical results indicate that the accuracy of earnings forecasts is significantly lower for purely domestic firms than for U.S.-based multinationals. Likewise, the level of consensus in earnings estimates submitted by financial analysts is significantly lower for U.S. domestic than for U.S. multinational firms.&copy; 1991 JIBS.

Abstract: Most of the principal theories associated with consumer behavior have been developed and tested in the United States. A question that has been posed by some consumer researchers concerns the applicability of these theories outside of the United States. The study reported in this paper is a cross-cultural examination of the applicability of the Fishbein behavioral intentions model in Korea and the United States. Korea can be characterized as a collectivist culture that is different from the individualist culture dominant in the United States. The findings of the study suggest that the Fishbein model can be employed to explain consumers&apos; behavioral intentions formation in a Confucian culture, as well as in the United States.&copy; 1991 JIBS.

Abstract: This paper argues that it is important to distinguish between related and unrelated international geographic diversification when measuring impact of diversification on performance. It then extends the Jacquemin-Berry entropy measure to propose a comprehensive measure of global diversification that comprises related and unrelated product diversification. It suggests a classification of firms based on diversification strategies and proposes hypotheses for future research.&copy; 1991 JIBS.
