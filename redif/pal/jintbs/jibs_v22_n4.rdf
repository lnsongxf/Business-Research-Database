Abstract: Multinational enterprises (MNEs) have responded to the open-door policies of socialist countries in recent years by investing in their economies through joint ventures. MNEs must formulate their investment strategies to control and manage the environmental risks peculiar to a traditional centrally planned economy (CPE) in which contextual and transactional environments are blurred. Joint venture sharing arrangements may be structured to control exposures to uncertainties and to align the interests of transactional parties, mostly state-owned enterprises, to those of the venture. The study tests the hypothesis that a foreign investor&apos;s share in a joint venture in a CPE is inversely correlated with (1) the amount of uncertainties and risks and (2) the external dependency of the venture on the contextual and transactional relationships of the host country. The hypothesis is supported by empirical evidence from data on American joint ventures in China.&copy; 1991 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (1991) 22, 555&ndash;578

Abstract: Organizational theorists have correctly argued that the emergence and maintenance of robust cooperation between global strategic alliance partners is related to the diversity in the partners&apos; characteristics. Yet previous research has failed to systematically delineate the important dimensions of interfirm diversity and integrate the dimensions into a unified framework of analysis. This paper develops a multilevel typology of interfirm diversity and focuses on organizational learning and adaptation as critical processes that dynamically moderate diversity&apos;s impact on alliance longevity and effectiveness.&copy; 1991 JIBS.

Abstract: Just-in-Time manufacturing (J.I.T.), an essential component of the Japanese manufacturing model, is increasingly emulated by western corporations. While J.I.T. has received considerable conceptual and empirical attention, suitable management control systems, which are essential to successful implementation, have been sorely neglected. This study provides large-scale empirical evidence comparing management control systems as they relate to J.I.T. in the U.S. and Japan.&copy; 1991 JIBS.

Abstract: This article investigates the simple, widely-held hypothesis that an exogenous real home currency depreciation enhances the competitiveness of home country manufacturers vis &aacute; vis foreign rivals. The study associates changes in competitiveness with redistributions of value within an industry. Daily and weekly data on redistributions of value are obtained from world financial markets. The study estimates the relationship between changes in exchange rates and redistributions of value within the world automobile and steel industries during the period 1978-87. The data generally do not support the notion that firms benefit competitively from a depreciation of the home currency. On the contrary, for large fractions of both industries, a depreciation of the home currency is associated with a significant decline in their share of industry value.&copy; 1991 JIBS.

Abstract: This study examines ethical perceptions of industrial salespeople in the United States, Japan, and South Korea. Marketing ethics in general and selling ethics in particular have experienced increasing research attention. Many of the empirical studies have focused on ethical situations confronting marketing and sales practitioners. Despite the abundance of research in the general topic of marketing ethics, as well as the globalization of competition in recent years, a topic that has been virtually ignored is whether ethical perceptions of sales personnel are consistent across countries. This paper reports a cross-national comparison of  business ethics of industrial salespeople across the three countries. The findings indicate that nationality  influences salespeople&apos;s beliefs about the ethics of selling practices and the need for company policies to guide those practices.&copy; 1991 JIBS.

Abstract: This study examined anticipatory and in-country individual, job, organizational, and non-work variables and their relationship with work, interaction, and general repatriation adjustment for U.S. managers. The study also examined anticipatory and in-country individual and non-work variables and their relationship with interaction and general repatriation adjustment for the spouses of the managers who were married. Age, total time overseas, social status, and housing conditions were generally related to all facets of repatriation adjustment for both expatriates and spouses. Practical and research implications are explored.&copy; 1991 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (1991) 22, 671&ndash;694

Abstract: This article contains an investigation of the relationship between United Kingdom (U.K.) foreign direct investment in the European Community (EC) and the incidence of Institutional and Legal Non-Tariff Barriers (NTBs) within the EC. Different types of NTB are identified and the implications of each of these barriers for foreign direct investment is discussed. The analysis is based on a survey of U.K. manufacturing PLCs and case studies in sixty companies with cross-frontier manufacturing JVs and/or subsidiaries in the EC. The results highlight the impact of intra-EC NTBs on foreign direct investment in the EC. Particular emphasis is placed on the role of discriminatory public procurement policies.&copy; 1991 JIBS.

Abstract: This study examines the interrelationships between yields on the U.S. and several foreign market portfolios over the 1980-89 period. Tests of Granger causality are used to investigate the effects of uni-directional causality, bi-directional causality, and contemporaneous adjustment in the determination of market rates of return. The results indicate that international equity market returns are largely contemporaneously determined, and the significance of contemporaneous effects varied over time. Uni-directional and bi-directional causality were found to be relatively weak.&copy; 1991 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (1991) 22, 723&ndash;736

Abstract: An experiment was designed to assess the effects of an enclosed incentive (bookmark), a promised incentive (offer of free copy of the survey results), the target country and the nationality of the parent company on response from a sample of American and Japanese-owned foreign subsidiaries. Logit model analysis was used to identify main and interaction effects. Both the bookmark and nationality of parent company affected response rates, while the offer of survey results and target country had no effect. No interaction effects were found. The implications for cross-national mail survey research are discussed.&copy; 1991 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (1991) 22, 711&ndash;721
