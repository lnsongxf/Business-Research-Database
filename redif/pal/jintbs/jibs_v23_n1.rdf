Abstract: Firms interested in servicing foreign markets face a difficult decision with regards to the choice of an entry mode. The options available to a firm include exporting, licensing, joint venture and sole venture. Several factors that determine the choice of a specific foreign market entry mode have been identified in previous literature. These factors can be classified into three categories: ownership advantages of a firm, location advantages of a market, and internalization advantages of integrating transactions. This study examines the independent and joint influences of these factors on the choice of an entry mode. Multinomial logistic regression model is employed to test the hypothesized effects.&copy; 1992 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (1992) 23, 1&ndash;27

Abstract: This paper makes a case directed towards establishing the importance of global strategic considerations in choosing multinationals&apos; entry mode. Specifically, it is our contention that beyond the environmental and transaction-specific factors well established in the literature to affect the entry mode decision, we should also consider the strategic relationship a multinational envisages between its operations across borders in reaching this decision. After incorporating various global strategic variables into an electric framework of the factors influencing the entry mode choice, this paper tests both the validity of the overall framework and the importance of each entry mode determinant in differentiating among entry modes. This is done based on ninety-six multinational managers&apos; responses to a survey questionnaire concerning their entry mode decision experiences. The results suggest that an express incorporation of global strategic variables into an analysis of the entry mode decision is warranted.&copy; 1992 JIBS.

Abstract: This study examines the organizational and personal correlates of role conflict and role ambiguity of chief executive officers heading international joint ventures. Role conflict was found to be lower when the number of parent firms was higher and when the CEO had spent more years with the organization. Role ambiguity was found to be lower when the CEO had more years of education, when the Power Distance and Masculinity/Femininity gap between parents were lower, and when the Individualism/Collectivism and Uncertainty Avoidance gaps were higher. The implications of these findings for role theory and international management are discussed.&copy; 1992 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (1992) 23, 55&ndash;75

Abstract: Role theory espouses, and extensive empirical research has found, that role stress can have deleterious effect on work outcomes of sales personnel. The findings of these investigations, however, are predicated on U.S.-based samples of salespeople. Whether similar results would be obtained with samples of salespersons in other countries has not yet been determined. This paper reports the results of a study that examined the impact of role stress on performance, job satisfaction, and organizational commitment of industrial salespeople from the United States, Japan, and Korea. Tests of cross-national hypotheses indicate general consistency in the findings across the three countries.&copy; 1992 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (1992) 23, 77&ndash;99

Abstract: Cross-national face-to-face selling has thus far received very little scholarly treatment in marketing literature. With few notable exceptions, most existing research in this area has been fragmentary and opportunistic. These problems are largely because of the lack of a broad, generalizable framework within which to conceptualize and execute research studies. In offering such a conceptual framework, this article looks at buyer-seller interactions from a communication perspective.&copy; 1992 JIBS.

Abstract: Research on multinational corporations (MNCs) has neglected routines despite their importance for the process of coordination, and their prominence in organization theory. This paper focuses on three aspects of routinization in MNCs. First, the transmission of routines across cultural boundaries in considered. Second, the focus moves to routine interactions between performance teams in MNCs. Third, I discuss how such routines contribute to the structuring of complex international systems. The conclusion suggests that the MNC may have to recognize that every replica of an existing facility is also an experimental test of taken-for-granted practices.&copy; 1992 JIBS.

Abstract: In an era of global competition, adequate protection of intellectual property in Triad regions of the world, particularly in Japan, has become increasingly important. This study focuses on the differences and similarities in patent practices between Japan and the United States. British and German patent practices are also examined to offer a balanced comparison. Findings indicate that the Japanese patent practices seem to discriminate against foreign applicants with longer pendency periods than for domestic applicants, while the U.S., German, and British patent practices appear to discriminate against foreign applicants with lower patent grant ratios than for domestic applicants.&copy; 1992 JIBS.

Abstract: Global competition has motivated an increasing number of United States firms to set up production facilities in Mexico. This study examines productivity and management style differences in a Mexican maquiladora operation and its U.S. parent plant Likert&apos;s System 4 Theory was used as the theoretical basis of comparison. As hypothesized, significant differences were found in the management systems while productivity at the two facilities was equal.&copy; 1992 JIBS.
