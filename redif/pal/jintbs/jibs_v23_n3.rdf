Abstract: Fifty-six Soviet businesspeople and 160 American businesspeople participated in simulated intracultural, one-on-one, buyer-seller negotiations. All participants completed questionnaires after the negotiation sessions, and six negotiators from each cultural group were videotaped during the interactions. Analysis of the questionnaire data indicated that Soviet negotiators achieved higher individual profits when using a competitive approach in negotiations. This result is in contrast to a more cooperative approach associated with higher profits for the American participants. Analysis of the videotapes suggests both similarities and differences in observed bargaining behaviors across the two cultural groups.&copy; 1992 JIBS.

Abstract: The results of a three-year study of the objectives, strategies and organization of American subsidiaries are presented. Their operations are compared against a matched sample of competitive British and Japanese subsidiaries. American subsidiaries were found to be less ambitious, more orientated towards delivering short-term profit performance and less adapted to local market conditions than their Japanese competitors. Over the five-year period, only one in three U.S. subsidiaries exhibited successful profit and market performance, against more than three out of four Japanese subsidiaries.&copy; 1992 JIBS.

Abstract: A higher proportion of U.S.-owned firms operating in Britain adopts investment post-completion audit (PCA) procedures than that of domestic British enterprises, confirming differential adoption rates for many decision and control procedures found by other studies. Insights to this differential are sought in executives&apos; attitudes to the aims, benefits and drawbacks of post-completion auditing. The absence of clear differences in attitudes among all U.K.-based managers suggest that the differential in PCA adoption stems primarily from ownership factors, e.g., exportation of parental control techniques rather than from the influence of local environmental factors.&copy; 1992 JIBS.

Abstract: It is recognized in the literature that experience may affect the cost and the uncertainty of operating in foreign markets, and experience and market knowledge may therefore influence the location decisions of FDIs. Economic theory does not, however, predict a general expansion pattern of FDIs across industries. On the other hand, the theory associated with the &ldquo;internationalization process&rdquo; approach highlights the importance of cultural distance, and predicts a movement from &ldquo;close&rdquo; to more &ldquo;distant&rdquo; markets as more experience is acquired by the firm. The internationalization process approach is rooted in a behavioral theory of the firm.In this article two hypotheses are developed from the internationalization process approach regarding the location of FDIs. The database used for testing the hypotheses includes in principle all FDIs undertaken by Norwegian manufacturing companies up to the midyear 1982. Cultural distance is measured by an index developed by Kogut and Singh [1988]. No support is found for the notion that the first FDI in general takes place in culturally closer countries than later FDIs. Furthermore, for given companies, an expansion into more distant countries is not found as the number of investments increases.&copy; 1992 JIBS.

Abstract: The study of country-of-origin (COO) effects examines how consumers perceive products emanating from a particular country. This study examines COO in terms of the fit between countries and product categories. A framework is suggested which matches the importance of product category dimensions with the perceived image of the country-of-origin along the same dimensions. Such matches (or mismatches) can be either favorable or unfavorable. Managers can use product-country match information to assess consumers&apos; purchase intentions, and assist them in managing their product&apos;s COO. Data collected from consumers in Ireland, Mexico, and the United States demonstrate the product-country match framework and its strategic implications.&copy; 1992 JIBS.

Abstract: Many factors may contribute to the high rate of expatriate turnover experienced by U.S. multinational corporations. The objective of this article is to present a comprehensive model of the expatriate turnover process by identifying the key contributing factors and suggesting intermediate linkages and relationships. The model appears to have both managerial and theoretical implications.&copy; 1992 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (1992) 23, 499&ndash;531

Abstract: The purpose of this study is to determine the basic configuration and coordination patterns for medium-sized firms competing in global industries. Analyzing 126 business competing in nine different global industries, five distinct archetypes are identified. The results suggest that selective globalization&mdash;in which the firm defines its global strategy around a narrow subset of the value chain&mdash;may lead to the most effective outcomes.&copy; 1992 JIBS.

Abstract: Increasing global competition is changing the nature of knowledge needed for international human resource management. This article assesses the publishing trends in international organizational behaviour and human resource management (OB/HRM) and interprets their implications for conducting transnational business. A review of over 28,000 articles in seventy-three academic and professional journals identified three important trends in international OB/HRM: first, the focus has shifted from single country and comparative research to studies on international interaction; second, culture&apos;s impact on managerial behaviour has become well recognized; and, third, the community of discourse uniting academics and professionals leads in generating knowledge relevant to transnational firms. The first two trends bode well for the relevance of international management research to practicing managers. The third trend delineates the domain in which the majority of rigorous and relevant research is published and therefore the domain in which knowledge is advancing most rapidly.&copy; 1992 JIBS.
