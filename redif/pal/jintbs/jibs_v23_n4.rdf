Abstract: Export marketing literature supports the view that firm size is positively related to export intensity. Although the empirical findings have been mixed, a number of theoretical arguments are used to support this proposition, i.e., international marketing economies of scale, limited managerial and financial resources of small firms, decisionmaker&apos;s risk perception. Based on a large survey of the Italian manufacturing industry, the article falsifies the proposition and challenges some widely held assumptions in export marketing literature.&copy; 1992 JIBS.

Abstract: This study empirically examines the level of the export-related expertise of manufacturing firms in a Midwestern state of the United States, various problems they face in export business, and types of government assistance desired, by their stage of export involvement. It also investigates the appropriateness of government export assistance and the gap between governmental export promotion efforts and private sector needs. It is shown that the identification of expertise, problems, and government assistance needs by export stage can help government agencies develop a systematic approach to export promotion.&copy; 1992 JIBS.

Abstract: This article reports the results of a study that hypothesized the influence of culture on six aspects of budget control practices in the United States and Japan. Data were collected through questionnaires from 70 manufacturing companies in the United States and 149 such companies in Japan. Results of data analyses indicate that the Individualism-Collectivism dimension would seem to explain why the U.S. companies, compared to the Japanese companies, tend to use communication and coordination more extensively, build budget slack to a greater extent, and use long-term performance evaluations to a lesser extent. The implications of the results for further research and practice are discussed.&copy; 1992 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (1992) 23, 659&ndash;674

Abstract: In this study we empirically investigate the determinants of foreign direct investment of service multinationals based in the &ldquo;triad&rdquo; regions: Japan, Western Europe and North America. Foreign investment decisions of 168 of the largest service firms in nine service industries over the period 1976-1986 are analyzed and hypotheses that are developed based on findings of manufacturing FDI and studies of single service industries are tested using a logistic regression model. The applicability of the MNE-FDI theories to service MNEs is tested empirically over a broad range of MNE home countries and service industries. Differences in the international behavior of service MNEs based in different countries are uncovered and analyzed.&copy; 1992 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (1992) 23, 675&ndash;696

Abstract: The ability of American labor unions to obtain collective bargaining contracts in foreign-owned firms after winning the right to represent the workers is examined. Elections held and agreements reached during the period 1980-1988 in firms from sixteen different countries indicate that a union is likely to secure the first contract in only about half the cases, and even fewer in German- and Japanese-owned firms.&copy; 1992 JIBS.

Abstract: Implementing a global strategy requires coordinating subsidiary activities across country locations. The assumption often made is that such coordination must be managed at headquarters. However, an alternate approach is decentralized-centralized responsibilities in which different subsidiaries within the multinational are given worldwide mandates to manage specific products or products lines. This study identifies subsidiary characteristics that are associated with receiving a global mandate by examining foreign subsidiaries located in France, Germany, Japan, U.K., U.S., and Canada.&copy; 1992 JIBS.

Abstract: Although the increased internationalization of business has brought greater scholarly attention to the issue of adjustment to overseas assignments, comparatively little research activity has been paid to the topic of adjustment back to the home country and home office&mdash;repatriation adjustment. In this article we argue that repatriation adjustment is sufficiently different from other forms of work adjustment (e.g., domestic relocation and expatriate assignments) to warrant separate theoretical and empirical investigation. To facilitate this, we propose an initial theoretical framework and set of derived propositions to guide and spark future research on this topic.&copy; 1992 JIBS.

Abstract: This article assesses the extent to which the results of Bartlett and Ghoshal&apos;s [1989] work can be incorporated in what has now become one of the core explanations of multinational strategic management, i.e., the transaction cost-based theory of international production. We demonstrate that the transaction cost approach fully incorporates the empirical findings of Bartlett and Ghoshal&apos;s work. To do so requires that we make a new distinction between location-bound and non-location-bound firm-specific advantages. In addition, three possible uses of country-specific advantages by multinational enterprises need to be identified. While the transnational solution, as proposed by Bartlett and Ghoshal, is not itself a new theory of multinational strategic management, it is compatible with the transaction cost-based model of multinational strategic management.&copy; 1992 JIBS.

Abstract: Increased communication, trade and travel between countries act to bring them together in many respects. The present study examines similarities in macro-environmental characteristics of eighteen industrialized nations over a twenty-eight-year period. Contrary to the initial research proposition, countries were found to be diverging, especially in the latter part of the time period. In spite of the increased communications, travel and trade between countries, physical distance remains an important determinant of macro-environmental similarity. Two measures of national culture, Power Distance and Individualism, were found to be related to change in macro-environmental factors.&copy; 1992 JIBS.
