Abstract: Despite the growing involvement of multinational firms in foreign-based R&amp;D during the past fifteen years, little research has been done on why and how firms internationalize their R&amp;D and what effects it might have on firm competitiveness. The present paper calls attention to this neglect and seeks to advance the management of multinational R&amp;D as an area of study for international business scholars. To this end, the paper first examines the key contributing factors to increased foreign R&amp;D investments among multinationals. It then reviews the research literature to find out what we presently know about the management of multinational R&amp;D. Finally, a research agenda is proposed to provide a foundation and stimulus for future investigations. Seven research directions are recommended, with an emphasis on interdisciplinary inquiry and a focus on issues that have both theoretical and practical significance.&copy; 1993 JIBS.

Abstract: The success of export-led development initiatives in LDCs depends heavily on export diversification. This paper identifies three patterns of performance among Central American firms engaged in non-traditional exports. Each pattern is associated with a distinct strategy: low involvement-low volume-low content, price-cost-volume, and product-service quality oriented. The discussion emphasizes keys to exporter success and priority areas for public policy.&copy; 1993 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (1993) 24, 19&ndash;40

Abstract: The main objectives of this study were to (1) empirically classify current national financial reporting systems and (2) test the validity of a hierarchical classification proposed by Nobes [1983] and extended by Berry [1987]. Data on accounting practices were obtained for fifty countries and used as input into a hierarchical cluster analysis. The resulting classification bears significant similarity to the aforementioned taxonomies and provides several additional insights.&copy; 1993 JIBS.

Abstract: The study presented here attempted to identify the factors under the control of the organization that may predict expatriate job satisfaction. The results indicate that both job/task and organization characteristics are significantly related to both intrinsic and extrinsic job satisfaction. The results appear to have both managerial and research implications.&copy; 1993 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (1993) 24, 61&ndash;80

Abstract: This is a study of component sourcing decisions of European and Japanese manufacturers for supplying their manufacturing operations in their home countries for export to the U.S. as well as their operations in the United States. Specifically, employing data from seventy-one multinational manufacturers of European and Japanese origin operating in the U.S., the study investigated the determinants of international sourcing decisions. The authors found support for the hypothesis that international sourcing could be explained using international plant location theory. The significance of this finding is that it offers a new theoretical framework to spur much needed research on the topic of international sourcing.&copy; 1993 JIBS.

Abstract: The internalization/eclectic theory of foreign direct investment includes the important insight that government policies create market imperfections, which make foreign direct investment an economically rational strategic alternative for firms. This paper reexamines the effects of government policies on market imperfections and foreign direct investment (FDI). It broadens and refines the analysis of the impact of government policies by developing the following arguments: (1) There is a wide range of government policies that affect firms&prime; FDI decisions via their effects on market imperfections. (2) There are numerous dimensions of variability in government policies that need to be identified in order to understand fully the effects of government policies on market imperfections and hence FDI flows. (3) Some of the effects of government policies on market imperfections and FDI are the opposite of those previously noted in the FDI literature. (4) The effects of government policies vary across the several individual components of FDI flows. The paper thus examines the following variables and relationships more extensively and precisely than has the previous literature: government policy variables as causal factors affecting FDI; market imperfection variables as intervening factors in the causal connections between government policies and FDI; and the multiple indicators of the various dimensions of FDI as dependent variables.&copy; 1993 JIBS.

Abstract: This paper analyzes the location of export-oriented manufacturing investment. The analysis focuses on direct investment in the Caribbean Basin, using micro data for all reported manufacturing plant openings from 1984&ndash;87. We test a broad range of influences on country selection and compare the results with the existing literature on foreign direct investment in less-developed countries. The probability of country selection was estimated with a conditional logit model. The estimates were then used to predict the location of Caribbean Basin investments made in 1988 and 1989. Twelve independent variables were tested. Six variables had a statistically significant, positive relationship with plant location: per capita GNP, exchange rate devaluation, the length of income tax holidays, the size of free trade zones, political stability, and manufacturing concentration. Negative relationships were found for the wage rate, inflation rate, transportation cost, and profit repatriation restrictions.&copy; 1993 JIBS.

Abstract: In this paper, we examine the effect of differential corporate taxes on the debt denomination decision of U.S. multinational firms facing stochastic project cash flows and exchange rates. Assuming to international interest arbitrage opportunity, we show that U.S.-based multinational firms can maximize projects&prime; expected NPVs by borrowing in the foreign currency, as long as the excess foreign tax credit can be fully utilized by the parent firm. Otherwise, multinational firms should borrow the weaker currency when a lower exchange rate is expected. The effect of differential tax rates on the risk of multinational projects with different debt-denomination alternatives also is examined.&copy; 1993 JIBS.
