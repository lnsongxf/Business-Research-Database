Abstract: Even though international marketing has been challenged because of theoretical and methodological shortcomings, very few researchers have actually attempted to analyze the weaknesses based on principles of theory evaluation. In this article, the author examines two types of models addressing the individual firm&apos;s internationalization process. A theory evaluation is performed based on the explanation and the falsification criteria. In order to improve the internationalization models, some measures are proposed.&copy; 1993 JIBS.

Abstract: This exploratory study examines five antecedent conditions of organizational commitment among groups of American, Dutch, Israeli and British managers in six multinational banking corporations. Role, nationality, age, seniority, and rank are tested as correlates of the organizational commitment construct among three groups of managers: Headquarters (HQ) officials, expatriate managers, and host-country managers in foreign subsidiaries.No support was found to the widespread belief that expatriate managers are more loyal to the company than host-country nationals. Age predicted organizational commitment more accurately than did nationality or role. Further analysis of the organizational commitment construct found evidence for a two-factor model: Loyalty/identification and involvement. Age was then found to be predictive of organizational loyalty/identification and nationality predicted organizational involvement. Managers&prime; nationality could therefore be used to compare and differentiate their organizational involvement.&copy; 1993 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (1993) 24, 233&ndash;248

Abstract: In this study of convergence/divergence of managerial values, four Western-developed measures  (Machiavellianism, locus of control, intolerance of ambiguity and dogmatism) and the four dimensions of the Eastern-developed Chinese Value Survey (Confucian dynamism, human-heartedness, integration, and moral discipline) were the measures used. The findings indicate that often times both culture and the business environment interact to create a unique set of managerial values in a country.&copy; 1993 JIBS.

Abstract: This paper investigates the existence of country-of-origin effects occurring in foreign investments in the People&apos;s Republic of China. The eclectic theory of international production posits that the pattern of foreign investments should vary by country of origin. This aspect of the eclectic theory is difficult to test directly, especially in developing countries, because of the relatively small numbers of foreign investment projects in a single country. The data used in this research cover 1,665 Sino-foreign joint ventures (JVs) from 1979 to 1985, allowing a more reliable test of this aspect of the theory. Statistical evidence suggests that country-of-origin effects are indeed present in foreign investment activities in China.&copy; 1993 JIBS.

Abstract: Drawing upon complementary streams of research from the international production and manufacturing strategy literature a conceptual framework was developed that identifies the major internal and external factors that may influence a firm&apos;s international manufacturing configuration (IMC) decisions. The framework was then examined using sixteen companies drawn from four distinct industry sectors. The findings indicate that a firm&apos;s competitive priorities, expressed as the differential emphasis placed on four key manufacturing performance priorities, in addition to other key variables such as market orientation, experience, and product characteristics, play important roles in the development of IMC strategies.&copy; 1993 JIBS.

Abstract: In this study, managers of U.S. firms with operations in the Caribbean region evaluated the attractiveness of twenty host country incentives. Multivariate analysis of variance was employed to determine whether incentive preferences were a function of investment characteristics. The results indicate that incentive preferences depend on the type of investment, market orientation, size of investment, geographic location, year of investment, and type of product. Furthermore, exporters considered import duty concessions to be more desirable than did investors oriented toward the local markets. These results indicate that government programs waiving import duties, such as the free trade zones of the Dominican Republic and the maquiladora program of northern Mexico, are providing the incentive deemed most important by their targeted investors.&copy; 1993 JIBS.

Abstract: Standards of segment reporting disclosure of the enterprise&apos;s foreign operations by geographic area [FASB 1976, Statement No. 14]. This information is believed to be useful in predicting the future prospects of the enterprise as a whole. This paper examines the predictive value of geographic earnings vis-&agrave;-vis consolidated earnings figures. Time-series methodology is used for this analysis. Forecasting models were developed for both segmental and consolidated income series. To test the predictive ability of each set of data, earnings forecasts were made. Both the enterprise&apos;s segmental and consolidated models were used for these predictions. The result indicate that, although consolidated income series provide a reasonably adequate forecast of income, geographically segmented earnings improve the accuracy of predictions. Further, the findings suggest that the predictive ability of foreign earning is slightly improved (in eleven out of fifteen cases) with more data disaggregation.&copy; 1993 JIBS.

Abstract: The stock and bond market reactions to American banks&prime; announcements of their intentions to form Export Trading Companies are investigated.

Abstract: For some time, a number of industry leaders have been exhorting American business schools to train their students in the aspects of international business. As late as 1987, a group of prominent leaders from business, labor, academia and government issued a report that stated that business schools must internationalize the entire course of study and should include comparative business practices, foreign languages and analyses of other countries and cultures.But do the CEOs of the major American multinationals recognize the importance of an international business education for all employees in management? Do they believe that the business graduates they hire should have some education in the international aspects of business? In this study, unlike most studies of this nature, the respondents were asked about the importance of international business education for all business graduates, not just for those destined to work in the international operations of the firm.Nearly 80% of the respondents agreed that the employees will learn the international aspects of business on the job. This contrasts markedly with the results of the 1977 Nehrt report (30%), but is very close to the results of the 1984 Kobrin report (73%). The respondents who believe that international courses are relevant to their businesses (80% of all respondents) gave individual courses about the same importance as did those who participated in the 1984 Kohers study, which was also concerned with all business graduates hired by firms in the Southeast. Two other studies had similar results for business graduates destined for international operations only.&copy; 1993 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (1993) 24, 383&ndash;391
