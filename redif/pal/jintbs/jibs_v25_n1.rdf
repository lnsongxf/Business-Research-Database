Abstract: The formation of organizations that are international from inception&mdash;international new ventures&mdash;is an increasingly important phenomenon that is incongruent with traditionally expected characteristics of multinational enterprises. A framework is presented that explains the phenomenon by integrating international business, entrepreneurship, and strategic management theory. That framework describes four necessary and sufficient elements for the existence of international new ventures: (1) organizational formation through internalization of some transactions, (2) strong reliance on alternative governance structures to access resources, (3) establishment of foreign location advantages, and (4) control over unique resources.&copy; 1994 JIBS.

Abstract: This paper develops a model of international cooperative venture formation that is centered on the decisionmaking process of MNE executives. Central issues for managerial decisions are developed from the organizational studies literature. A framework delineating the sequence and criteria used in the decision to form international cooperative ventures is developed from these defined issues and from existing models. Propositions pertaining to the venture formation decision process are outlined.&copy; 1994 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (1994) 25, 91&ndash;113

Abstract: The authors conducted a quasi-longitudinal investigation of U.S. multinationals&apos; R&amp;D, manufacturing, offshore sourcing strategies, and resultant global market performance implications, utilizing comprehensive data collected by the 1977, 1982 and 1989 benchmark surveys of U.S. direct investment abroad. Hypotheses were tested in a path analytic framework. Despite increased competition at home and abroad causing their global market share positions to weaken in recent years, U.S. multinationals have maintained, and even may have improved, their global consolidated profitability levels by skillfully exploiting their technological prowess through technology transfer and off-shore sourcing. Rapidly changing roles of U.S. parent firms and their foreign affiliates in technology development and global sourcing relationships portend a maturing, yet arduous, shift toward a global rationalization.&copy; 1994 JIBS.

Abstract: This paper examines the role of structural and policy factors in explaining a country&apos;s attractiveness as a base for export-oriented production by U.S. MNEs. Empirical analysis finds wage rates and industrial capability to be important determinants of export-oriented production attracted by a country. Exports generated by relocation are found to be dependent upon intra-firm imports. U.S. MNEs are found to be using their hosts as export bases more selectively.&copy; 1994 JIBS.

Abstract: With the political and economic changes in Eastern Europe, there is an increasing need to market successfully products from these countries in the industrialized world. This paper explores the extent to which the risk attitudes, political convictions, and country-of-origin associations of individuals affect the buying decision of a product from a controversial source country. On a theoretical level, it is investigated where in the decision-making process political convictions and country-of-origin effects emerge most forcefully. Hypotheses are tested empirically against survey data on farmers&apos; evaluations of tractors from several countries, including the Russian-made Belarus. The data analysis involves the specification of a recursive system encompassing the steps the buyer goes through from product evaluation of purchase. The effects of political convictions, risk attitudes, and the country-of-origin connection are evaluated at each stage in the process. Implications are derived for potential strategies on the part of Russian manufacturers.&copy; 1994 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (1994) 25, 157&ndash;176

Abstract: This study reports on results of a cross-cultural, empirical investigation designed to assess the impact of individualism/collectivism upon organizational entrepreneurship. The findings indicate individualism/collectivism is an important factor in understanding entrepreneurial behavior in the firm. Implications of these findings are discussed.&copy; 1994 JIBS.

Abstract: This paper reports data collected on expropriation activity by developing countries from 1980-1992, extending previous work by Kobrin [1984]. Kobrin&apos;s assumption that expropriation activity would continue to decrease over time, and his reasons for this assumption, are supported. The paper introduces recent phenomena which further indicate that expropriation is unlikely to resurface in the near future as a source of multinational corporation-developing country contention. Many developing countries now protect foreign direct investors from expropriation. The broad-scale movement in developing countries to privatize state-owned enterprises also indicates that governments will not be eager to replace private-sector activity with state ownership.&copy; 1994 JIBS.
