Abstract: I have an uneasy feeling that, in responding to the invitation of JIBS&apos; editors to recount how I stumbled into the field of international business, I am providing very sparse fare for many of JIBS&apos; readers, particularly for those who want to gain hints of what it takes to make a success in the teaching of international business. But I could not resist the editors&apos; challenge to look back at my years as a teacher of international business from 1959 to 1978, in order to learn perhaps for the first time what the experience may have taught me.&copy; 1994 JIBS.

Abstract: A study of human resource management practices in 249 U.S. affiliates of foreign-based multinational corporations (MNCs) shows that in general affiliate HRM practices closely follow local practices, with differences among specific practices. The degree of similarity of local practices is significantly influenced by the method of founding, dependence on local inputs, the presence of expatriates, and the extent of communication with the parent. In addition, sharp differences are revealed among affiliates of Canadian, Japanese and European MNCs, suggesting strong country effects. Together, these findings support the view of MNCs as composed of differentiated practices, which in turn are shaped by forces for local isomorphism and for internal consistency.&copy; 1994 JIBS.

Abstract: This study examines the relationship between ownership entry modes and performance. The ownership entry modes examined are the wholly owned modes of acquisition and new venture entry, and the non-wholly owned mode of joint venture entry. A theoretical relationship is developed for international entry modes that is based on the contingency characteristics of resource requirements and organizational control factors. This model suggests that different entry modes have different performance outcomes based upon their resource and organizational control demands. The theoretical model, although developed using the eclectic theoretical approach, is based largely on concepts and relationships previously delineated in contingency theory. Our hypotheses suggest that new ventures should outperform joint ventures, and joint ventures should outperform acquisitions. An empirical test using a sample of 321 Japanese firms entering the North American market provides supporting evidence.&copy; 1994 JIBS.

Abstract: Management control systems should be designed to complement the strategies pursued. Few empirical studies, however, have focused on management control systems for quality control and zero-defect strategies. This study compares quality strategies and their relationship with management control systems in the Japanese and U.S. electronics industry.The results indicate that the quality strategies of U.S. manufacturing managers reflect adherence to zero-defect philosophies more than those of the Japanese managers. However, fewer U.S. managers receive management control information to support these zero-defect strategies.Tests linking quality strategies to management control information provide limited evidence that those U.S. managers who have adopted zero-defect strategies are more likely to receive modified management control information than U.S. managers who have not adopted zero-defect strategies. In contrast, the data suggest that Japanese managers are provided with goal-setting and feedback information about quality performance regardless of their adherence to a zero-defect versus a traditional quality management strategy, thus focusing workers&apos; attention on continuous quality improvement.&copy; 1994 JIBS.

Abstract: Building upon the concept of clans, this paper introduces the value of social knowledge as a control mechanism available for an MNC to manage its foreign subsidiaries. Social knowledge is defined as one&apos;s ability to understand and predict others&apos; general patterns of behavior. The hypotheses are empirically tested with Japanese FDI data into four host countries, the United States, Singapore, Taiwan, and Korea. The results offer broad support for the proposition that for MNCs with social knowledge, the need to resort to ownership for control purposes is reduced.&copy; 1994 JIBS.

Abstract: In spite of both positivistic and instrumental research, the reliability of measuring the degree of internalization of a firm remains speculative. We collected data on nine attributes of seventy-four American manufacturing MNCs. Alpha, factor, and frequency analyses revealed a linear combination of five variables with a reliability coefficient of .79 as a measure of the degree of internationalization of a firm. We discuss the statistical and conceptual properties of the scale and their implications for content and construct validity.&copy; 1994 JIBS.

Abstract: Do international acquisitions&mdash;in contrast to their domestic counterparts&mdash;create value for the acquiring firms&apos; shareholders? This study examines the valuation consequences of 276 U.S. international acquisitions made in the period 1975-1988, and provides direct evidence on the effect of international acquisitions on the market value of U.S. bidding firms. It is shown that, on average, international acquisitions create value for the acquiring firms. The study also finds that the value created is a function of the nature of the acquisition (e.g., related or unrelated); the nature of the bidding firm&apos;s industry (e.g., its concentration level and advertising intensity); the nature of the acquiring firm (e.g., it prior international experience and its current profitability); and the nature of the macroeconomic environment (e.g., tax regulations and the relative strength of the U.S. dollar).&copy; 1994 JIBS.

Abstract: Many academic studies and government leaders are asking small- and medium-sized firms to become more involved in exports. Unfortunately, the role that can be played by smaller firms is unclear. Despite the vast number of studies on size and export behavior, discrepancies in study findings and the absence of variance statistics prevent researchers from understanding the importance of size. This study has sought to examine the direct and indirect effects of firm size by examining three dimensions of export behavior: propensity of exports, countries exporting to and export attitudes for 14,072 Canadian manufacturers. The results indicate that while firm size is positively related to all dimensions of export behavior, its importance is limited as the amount of variance explained is modest.&copy; 1994 JIBS.

Abstract: Transborder data flows (TDF) have been shown to be vital to multinational corporations (MNCs) in managing the complex information flows required for control and implementation of worldwide strategy. Research on TDF has generally been on a global scale and from a headquarters perspective. This preliminary study takes a new direction by reporting results of a survey of TDF activity on a regional rather than a global level of analysis and from the viewpoint of U.S. MNC subsidiaries overseas rather than from a headquarter&apos;s driven analysis. In addition to a breakdown by manufacturing and service industries usage of TDF by functional area within the region is reported along with the climate of governmental regulation for TDF in the emerging economies of Mexico and Hispanic South America.The study addresses the hypothesis that TDF trends for MNCs on a regional level mirror those of a headquarters or global perspective. The study concludes that there is no significant difference between the nine Latin American nations in terms of TDF vitality, functional activity and regulatory climate. A major implication of the research note is that preliminary results from the Latin American region tend to parallel global and headquarters-related studies in corporate TDF.&copy; 1994 JIBS.
