Abstract: This paper first reviews the theories of the transfer of Japanese management practices overseas. The paper then outlines a contingency theoretical model that specifies the factors which are hypothesized to impact the transfer of Japanese-style HRM practices to overseas subsidiaries. Qualitative data from a field study a ten Japanese subsidiaries in the U.S., five in the service industry and five in manufacturing, are used to illustrate the concepts presented in the theoretical discussion.&copy; 1994 JIBS.

Abstract: This paper operationalizes and tests relationships between a geocentric managerial mind-set, geographic scope and the structural and strategic characteristics of firms and industries. Relationships are tested using data from a survey of senior corporate international HRM managers of large, U.S.-based, manufacturing multinationals. An index of a geocentric mind-set is found to correlated with geographic scope and various aspects of IHRM policy and practice; however, no relationship is found with measures of multinational strategy or organizational structure. The paper concludes with a speculative hypothesis: development of a geocentric mind-set may relate to the information or knowledge intensity of the firm rather than its position on the strategic continuum.&copy; 1994 JIBS.

Abstract: No matter what strategy managers choose, cross-national differences in states&apos; strategic capabilities and objectives affect multinational corporations&apos; capabilities to manage interdependent operations. In this paper, we develop four attribute dimensions along which states&apos; strategic economic capabilities vary. We then apply these dimensions to show how they contribute to familiar international business models of managerial process, MNC strategy and organizational structure, and country competitiveness.&copy; 1994 JIBS.

Abstract: A study on conflict resolution strategies of Canadian and Chinese (Peoples Republic of China) executives was conducted. Responses to two types of joint project conflicts&mdash;task-related and person-related with potential partners from their own culture or from the other culture&mdash;were examined. Neither group of executives altered its strategy when negotiating across cultures. Chinese executives were more likely to avoid conflicts but recommended more negative strategies (discontinue negotiation; withdraw negotiation) when conflict emerged. Person-related conflicts were found to generate more negative responses than task-related conflicts, especially for Chinese executives. Both Canadian and Chinese executives preferred to negotiate with Canadians than with Chinese.&copy; 1994 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (1994) 25, 537&ndash;555

Abstract: This study uses a sample of chemical processing industries to evaluate the effect of two types of uncertainty on the decision to invest in an industry. It analyzes the effects of relative price uncertainty, through exchange rates and input prices, and demand uncertainty on the probability of expansion in a particular country. The study then focuses on the behavior of individual companies, and distinguishes companies by whether or not they are multinationals in the production of the product. The results confirm previous evidence that exchange rate uncertainty has a negative effect on capacity expansions by domestic corporations and no effect on investment by multinational corporations. Finally, the study also shows that expansions of production capacity in this industry are more likely to occur in those countries where capacity utilization is higher.&copy; 1994 JIBS.

Abstract: Marketing scholars&apos; interest in the influence of source countries on product evaluations has intensified during the past twenty-five years. As this research tradition has evolved, the literature has gradually gained more depth and sophistication. Nevertheless, research in this area lacks a common conceptual framework. Furthermore, research priorities with regard to the role of this area of inquiry within the broader field of consumer behavior, marketing and general business decisions have not been made clear. This article rationalizes the buying decision processes within the context of source-country influences and offers a conceptual framework for further development. In addition, it links country-level considerations to firm-level decisionmaking, thus providing a foundation for meaningful managerial decisions.&copy; 1994 JIBS.

Abstract: This article presents the major findings of the fifth global curriculum survey of the Academy of International Business (AIB)&mdash;an examination of the status and trends in international business education around the world as of the early 1990s. The survey&apos;s findings, based on responses from more than 500 business schools, encompass different goals and methods of internationalization, international linkages and experiential activities, organizational issues, amounts of internationalization progress achieved, and degrees of administrative satisfaction with progress achieved. The overall conclusion is that considerable progress has been made, but much more remains to be accomplished.&copy; 1994 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (1994) 25, 605&ndash;623

Abstract: The growth of international business (IB) and concerns about the relevance of IB research indicate the need for managerial input on the topic. A survey of 108 U.S. CEOs reveals that IB issues are an important part of their strategic agenda. Four types of IB issues are identified which reveal that American CEOs appear to be taking a proactive stance regarding the international arena. The CEOs were also found to hold diverse perceptions of IB issues. The implications of these findings are discussed&copy; 1994 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (1994) 25, 625&ndash;637

Abstract: This study develops a classification of international business-level strategies built on the dimensions of segment differentiation and geographic scope. In addition, performance outcomes associated with specific international environment and business-level strategy matches are suggested. Using information from firms competing in both global and multidomestic industries, the study finds that geographic scope and segment differentiation can be used to distinguish four international strategies, the effectiveness of which is a function of the environments in which firms compete.&copy; 1994 JIBS.
