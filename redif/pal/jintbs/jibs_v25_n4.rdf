Abstract: This article analyzes patterns of country coverage in the Journal of International Business Studies during the twenty-five years of its existence. The analysis shows a substantial expansion in the journal&apos;s geographic reach over the years, but also a somewhat narrow &ldquo;mental map,&rdquo; with may countries and areas receiving only minimal coverage. Explanations for country preferences among researchers are explored and implications for the future are discussed.&copy; 1994 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (1994) 25, 675&ndash;686

Abstract: International business (IB) research has made enormous strides in the quarter century since JIBS was inaugurated. This article reflects upon the development of IB research during that period. It first reviews the findings and recommendations of a comprehensive survey of the embryonic field of IB research, conducted twenty-five years ago. Several early trends identified then are discussed: the astonishing acceleration in the pace of IB research; the broadening of research activity across a greater range of functional areas; and an expanding geographic base of research outside of North America, especially in Europe. We then discuss the evolution of IB research since that formative period; growing breadth and diversity; greater methodological sophistication; a move toward research transcending traditional functional boundaries; development of new research areas such as management information systems and international coalitions and alliances; research on the phenomenon of transnational firms as complete systems; and the continued broadening of the geographic base of research. Emerging research areas such as international entrepreneurship and small business, and the greening of business, are identified. The article concludes with calls for more research collaboration across national boundaries, and for greater synthesis for research into broader, more integrative frameworks.&copy; 1994 JIBS.

Abstract: In this paper we use citational analysis to examine the influence of individuals and disciplines on international business research. We collected citational data over the ten-year period 1984 to 1993 from every issue of the Journal of International Business Studies. We found that management, economics, marketing, and finance disciplines have had significant influence on international business research and identified researchers such as Dunning, Porter, Vernon, Casson, Rugman, and Hofstede as having made significant contributions to international business research.&copy; 1994 JIBS.
