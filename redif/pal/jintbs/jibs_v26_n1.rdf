Abstract: The concept of human resources management (HRM) has been much debated in the literature. The concept developed initially from work in the U.S.A. in the 1960s and 1970s and since then has been adopted increasingly around the world. This paper argues that in Europe there is only limited acceptance of the organizational autonomy upon which the concept in based, and that, therefore, different approaches to the notion of human resource management are required. External constraints are analysed and a new model of the concept that would encompass EuroHRM is proposed.&copy; 1995 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (1995) 26, 1&ndash;21

Abstract: This study examines linkages between business strategy and human resource management (HRM) strategy in Japanese subsidiaries in the U.S. It investigates whether or not fit between a subsidiary&apos;s business strategy and its HRM strategy is associated with higher performance. The data show that subsidiaries with matched strategies performed better than unmatched ones in terms of HRM-related performance measures such as rates of promotion and turnover. Japanese subsidiaries with a business strategy/HRM strategy match were also more likely to experience better business performance versus competitors than were unmatched ones.&copy; 1995 JIBS.

Abstract: This paper examines the preferences of 4405 individuals in forty-three organizations from sixty-eight different countries for four innovation championing roles: the organizational maverick, the network facilitator, the transformational leader and the organizational buffer. The study shows that the cultural value of uncertainty acceptance is significantly associated with preferences for these four championing roles. It suggests that uncertainty-accepting societies may be more innovative than uncertainty-avoiding societies because of the greater legitimacy of those roles.&copy; 1995 JIBS.

Abstract: This paper argues that, given the proliferation of journals within which to publish international business research, authors need to identify objectives for their research and develop a publishing strategy to ensure the appropriate and timely publication of their work. Based on archival data and a survey of journal editors, this study provides information about seventy-nine English language business publications to help authors develop such as strategy.&copy; 1995 JIBS.

Abstract: This study investigated the antecedents of commitment in IJVs from the major partners&apos; perspective. Data were gathered from Japanese and local partners in IJVs located in eleven countries and analyzed in structural equations models. Results indicated that commitment is largely a function of the perceived benefits of the relationship, i.e., satisfaction and economic performance. However, exploration analyses of differences between local partners and the Japanese suggest that the effects of psychological antecedents might be contingent on the strategic intent of the relationship.&copy; 1995 JIBS.

Abstract: In spite of the increasing popularity of international joint ventures, managers express a high level of dissatisfaction with them. This paper argues that overemphasis on the outcome has resulted in a neglect of the social processes underlying the outcome. The paper elaborates upon the rationale for a cooperative approach towards interorganizational collaborative relationships based on trust, and discusses it in the context of joint ventures. This is then applied towards understanding multinational ownership preferences and tolerance for joint ventures. It is argued that trust-centered logic is largely consistent with approaches that emphasize the issue of ownership, and deepens and enriches the insights provided by the latter. A shift in focus from ownership to relational dynamics is encouraged.&copy; 1995 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (1995) 26, 117&ndash;137

Abstract: This paper examines the determinants of foreign investment shares in the manufacturing sector of Indonesia, a large, rapidly industrializing developing country with a comparatively rich industrial database. Particular emphasis is given to the interplay between &lsquo;industrial organization&rsquo; and &lsquo;policy&rsquo; factors in determining these shares. Most of the industrial organization factors were found to be significantly correlated with ownership shares, although the two variables capturing intangible assets were not. Two of the three policy variables were found to be significant. Since the policy regime in developing countries is typically more interventionist than that in OECD economies, this suggests that studies of the former ignore the policy context at their peril. It is also demonstrated that the results of these types of studies are sensitive to the precise definition of &lsquo;foreign ownership&rsquo;.&copy; 1995 JIBS.

Title: Enhancing the Obsolescing Bargain Theory: A Longitudinal Study of Foreign Ownership of U.S. and European Multinationals

Abstract: This research attempts to enhance the obsolescing bargain theory, for manufacturing companies, by statistically testing the effects of nine explanatory variables on the static and dynamic manifestations of bargaining success, with longitudinal, firm-level data. In order to highlight those effects, it develops a conceptual framework that provides a broader context in which the primary variables operate. It demonstrates that the obsolescing bargain took effect in India over a fifteen-year period following restrictive legislation. Unlike previous research, this study measures the effect of benefits received by multinationals from the host government in exchange for equity dilution. American companies are found to retain a smaller share of their foreign ownership over time than British and other European multinationals. Some explanatory variables that have previously been found to influence level of foreign ownership (static bargaining success) are found to be less important, or have a different effect, in explaining proportion of foreign ownership retained (dynamic bargaining success).&copy; 1995 JIBS.

Abstract: Using a contingency model of global sourcing strategy, this study investigated the moderating effects of sourcing-related factors on the relationship between sourcing strategy and a product&apos;s strategic and financial performance. The results lent some support to the contingency model of global sourcing strategy in that product innovation, process innovation and asset specificity were significant moderator variables for financial, but not strategic, performance. However, the results provided no support for bargaining power of suppliers and transaction frequency as moderator variables. In other words, in achieving high financial performance for a product, whether a particular sourcing strategy should be used for a particular product depended on the levels of product innovation, process innovation and asset specificity.&copy; 1995 JIBS.
