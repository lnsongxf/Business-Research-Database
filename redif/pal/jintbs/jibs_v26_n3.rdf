Abstract: This article discusses the implications of the advent of alliance capitalism for our theorizing about the determinants of MNE activity. In particular, it argues that, due to the increasing porosity of the boundaries of firms, countries and markets, the eclectic, or OLI, paradigm of international production needs to consider more explicitly the competitive advantages arising from the way firms organize their inter-firm transactions, the growing interdependencies of may intermediate product markets, and the widening of the portfolio of the assets of districts, regions and countries to embrace the external economies of interdependent activities.&copy; 1995 JIBS.

Abstract: This study provides strong empirical evidence in support of the intangible assets model of foreign direct investment. The percentage of lawyers in total employment is introduced as a proxy for the internalization advantage that is associated with the presence of intangible assets. Legal intensity is shown to be directly related to the level of U.S. foreign direct investment abroad for sixty-one manufacturing industries from 1982&ndash;1989.&copy; 1995 JIBS.

Abstract: This paper explores how the tension between global integration and local responsiveness affects the dimensions and determinants of international human resource (IHR) strategy. To accomplish this, Jarillo and Martinez&apos;s [1990] business strategy framework for parents and their subsidiaries was recast in an IHR strategy setting. Then, the relationships between the two dimensions of IHR strategy that emerged, global integration and local responsiveness, and a set of interorganizational interdependency variables were explored. Several new and informative associations between the interorganizational interdependency variables (subsidiaries&apos; dependence on parent&apos;s resources, local resources, and hot institutions) and IHR strategy were observed in a sample of one hundred subsidiaries of Japanese, U.S. and European MNCs operating in Taiwan.&copy; 1995 JIBS.

Abstract: This study examines factors influencing the voluntary disclosures of three types of information (strategic, nonfinancial, financial) contained in the annual reports of MNCs from the U.S., U.K. and Continental Europe. While company size, country/region, listing status, and, to a lesser extent, industry are the most important factors explaining voluntary disclosures overall, the importance of the factors varies by information type.&copy; 1995 JIBS.

Abstract: Many researchers have pointed out that it is necessary to ensure measurement equivalence in cross-national comparative research. Three aspects of measurement equivalence, translation, metric, and calibration equivalence, are necessary to establish the cross-national reliability and validity of items used to measure theoretical constructs. This paper discusses these issues and proposes two recently developed empirical techniques, Multiple Group LISREL and Optimal Scaling, for use in diagnosing cross-national measurement equivalence. These techniques are illustrated by reanalysis of a pioneering U.S. and Japanese study. The two techniques yield convergent results, indicating measurement equivalence for some, but not all, ordinal-level items under consideration. The findings demonstrate that the proposed methods are useful diagnostic tools for exploring measurement equivalence. Several suggestions for reducing the likelihood of problems with measurement equivalence and a number of methods for dealing with items where lack of equivalence persists are also discussed.&copy; 1995 JIBS.

Abstract: Substantive inference from cross-national studies have important implications for theory (e.g., because they reveal insights into generalizability and boundary conditions) and managerial practice (e.g., because they offer guidelines to MNC managers). However, few empirical studies attend to measurement issues involved in cross-national research, and still fewer recognize the risk of inferential errors that are likely to occur by overlooking measurement issues. We discuss four measurement issues, namely (1) standardized versus unstandardized coefficients, (2) the impact of measurement error and unequal reliability, (3) the overall error rate and simultaneous analysis and (4) construct equivalence. Using illustrate examples we demonstrate the nature of each of these problems, the likely impact they can have on substantive conclusions, and approaches for tackling these problems. Additionally, we reanalyze a recently published three-nation study by Dubinsky, Michaels, Kotabe, Lim and Moon [1992] to clarify these measurement concerns, highlight a methodological approach, and delineate the extent and severity of inferential errors. Our reanalysis shows that the interactive effects of these measurement issues are pervasive, complex and unpredictable. We close with implications for cross-national research in general.&copy; 1995 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (1995) 26, 597&ndash;619

Abstract: In this study, businesses competing as part of the global U.S. construction equipment industry were categorized into three subgroups according to the integration-responsiveness framework (I-R) in an attempt to further understand industry pressures confronting businesses that compete internationally. The results show that three generic strategies suggested by the I-R framework do appear in a single industry context: globally integrated, locally responsive and multifocal. Beyond providing additional insight into the nature of competition in a &ldquo;single global industry,&rdquo; several broad extensions to the integration-responsiveness framework are suggested.&copy; 1995 JIBS.

Abstract: Little has been reported on joint ventures between firms from newly industrialized countries and developing countries. This paper examines twelve characteristics of a sample of Korean firms with partners in developing countries (LDCs) and contrasts them with existing research where (a) developed country firms have linked with firms in other developed countries, and (b) developed country firms have linked with local firms in developing countries. As part of the analysis, ten hypotheses were formulated and tested.Relative to previous findings on joint ventures from developed countries in LDCs, differences were found in terms of stability, venture creation rationale, satisfaction level with performance, and the relationship between control and performance and between ownership and control.&copy; 1995 JIBS.

Abstract: Hofstede and his associates have presented statistical evidence purporting to identify a link between national culture and economic growth. This note describes two problems with this line of research. First, two of the dimensions of culture used in this research, individualism and Confucian dynamism, are treated as if they are independent when in fact they appear to be highly interrelated. And second, culture is not a sufficient condition to explain economic growth and is related to other important factors that play a role in determining economic growth. The consequences of these problems on interpretation of the research findings are discussed and recommendations for future research directions are proposed.&copy; 1995 JIBS.

Abstract: This paper presents the results of a study linking the performance of international joint ventures and alliances set up in the global aerospace industry to their strategic and organizational features. In a first stage, an empirically based taxonomy of the observed alliances is generated. Then, the economic performance of various types of alliances is evaluated on the basis of industry expert opinions, and the difference in performance of different alliance types is tested.&copy; 1995 JIBS.
