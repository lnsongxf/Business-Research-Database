Abstract: This essay assesses the impact of global market integration in the currency trading industry as the market interfaces with states, with firms and with individuals, and raises questions for research from a variety of disciplines. Issues discussed include the question of state control in global markets, the impact of globalization on firm structures and processes, how firms can derive competitive advantage from global circadian rhythms, and the influences of the circadian rhythms of the global market on the individuals who work in this industry.&copy; 1995 JIBS.

Abstract: A three-fold typology of subsidiary roles (world mandate, specialized contributor, local implementer) was induced from the literature and its empirical validity was confirmed. Adopting a configurational approach, we then explored the ways in which subsidiary &lsquo;structural context&rsquo; varies across subsidiary role types. Structural context characteristics were determined through a discussion of the underlying principles of the &lsquo;hierarchy&rsquo; and &lsquo;heterarchy&rsquo; models of multinational organization. The key findings were: (a) higher strategic autonomy in world mandates than in local implementers; (b) a more internationally configured value-chain in world mandates and specialized contributors than local implementers; (c) lower levels of internal product flows in world mandates than the other two types; and (d) a significantly lower performance in specialized contributors. Implications for a configurational model of subsidiary management, and for heterarchy as a higher level conceptualization, are discussed.&copy; 1995 JIBS.

Abstract: This study builds upon previous control research to purpose a model of formal controls used in managing activities performed in foreign markets. Theoretically derived contingency relationships are also proposed to assess the performance consequences of different formal control types. The findings support the importance of internal and external sources of uncertainty in determining the type of control used. Partial support was also found for the premise that the fit between the type of control used and the type of uncertainty perceived will contribute to superior performance.&copy; 1995 JIBS.

Abstract: Foreign postings for executives are costly undertakings for multinational corporations, especially when they fail. Yet little research has been done on the causes of expatriate turnover. This 155-expatriate survey assesses individual, organizational/work and environmental influences on both internal and external turnover tendencies. It was found that job autonomy and material life satisfaction were key predictors for both internal and external turnover tendencies. Only for organizational turnover did job autonomy supersede material life satisfaction as the lead predictor of turnover tendencies. American expatriates attach much importance to maintaining living standards in postings to foreign locations.&copy; 1995 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (1995) 26, 787&ndash;813

Abstract: The literature on foreign direct investments (FDIs) has analysed the location strategies of multinational enterprises across national borders, but there have been few studies of location decisions by foreign investors within the borders of a single country. The paper argues that the driving factors of these location choices have differing influences on indigenous and foreign investors. Specifically, foreign investors suffer from a condition of adverse asymmetry in information costs compared to insiders. Thus, foreign investors&apos; decisions on the location of their activities within a host country mainly reflect a rational responses to the existence of information costs.In this paper, a cross-region multiple regression model is developed, with reference to a database containing detailed information on cross-border takeovers involving Italian industrial firms in the period 1986&ndash;91. Empirical evidence supports the hypothesis that the spatial distribution of inward FDIs is mainly governed by information costs. Finally, implications for future research are discussed.&copy; 1995 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (1995) 26, 815&ndash;841

Abstract: This paper tests whether the pattern of related and unrelated acquisitions is consistent with the existence of cost disadvantages to cross-border investing. Data from the U.S. chemical industry (1978&ndash;89) are consistent with the implications that foreign investors are more likely than domestic investors to make closely related acquisitions. The data also indicate that U.S. FTC antitrust policy affected the pattern of domestic acquisitions.&copy; 1995 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (1995) 26, 843&ndash;857

Abstract: This paper reports the results of a large-scale survey among senior executives in the U.S., the U.K., Germany and Austria. The research provides empirical evidence on the variation of perceptions of ethical issues by country and type of firm. Our findings suggest that country and industry type have significant effects, both with regard to identification of ethical problems and the comprehensiveness of written ethics policies and ethics training.&copy; 1995 JIBS.

Abstract: This not reports a quantitative analysis of the country-of-origin (COO) effect. Based on fifty-two articles or papers containing sixty-nine independent studies and 1,520 effect sizes, an analysis of fifteen study characteristics revealed that country-of-origin effects are only somewhat generalizable. Using omega-squared as the measure of effect size, verbal product descriptions produced larger COO effect sizes than did the presence of an actual product. Likewise, single-cue studies produced larger COO effect sizes than did multiple-cue studies, and larger samples produced effect sizes that on average were greater than those produced by smaller samples. The size of an observed COO effect was a function of whether the dependent variables was a quality/reliability perception or a purchase intention; the average effect size of quality/reliability perceptions was .30, whereas the average effect size for purchase intentions was .19. Purchase intentions were most susceptible to methodological artifacts than were quality/reliability perceptions. Study findings selectively confirm and refute common beliefs regarding the impact of a country-of-origin cue on product perceptions and purchase intentions.&copy; 1995 JIBS.
