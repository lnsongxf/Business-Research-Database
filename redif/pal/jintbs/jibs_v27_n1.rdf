Abstract: This study examines the determinants of foreign equity ownership in joint ventures in China. Drawing upon Duning&apos;s ownership, locational and internalization paradigm and the literature on bargaining power, eleven variables that impact foreign ownership preferences and concessions are examined. These variables are advertising intensity, foreign capital input, country risk of China, EJV investment amount, EJV contractual duration, cultural distance, competitive intensity, local partner state ownership, local partner alignment, foreign partner alignment, and EJV location. The empirical findings are largely consistent with the hypotheses. The empirical findings are largely consistent with the hypotheses. Further, interesting differences were found among U.S., European and Japanese firms with respect to the impact of these determinants.&copy; 1996 JIBS.

Abstract: The study examines what drives the founding of specialist firms. Two theoretical explanations are tested for the founding of specialists: density dependence and resource partitioning. The study finds that specialists&apos; foundings are dependent on the population&apos;s density at the global level, but not at the United States level. The evidence from a fragmented industry does not support the resource partitioning hypothesis, either at the global level or the United States national level. The study shows how multi-level analyses can suggest if an industry is multi-domestic or globally integrated.&copy; 1996 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (1996) 27, 27&ndash;42

Abstract: This paper investigates and models the transition process within established multinational corporations (MNCs) in moving from decentralized toward network-based structures. Whereas there has been substantial research on various MNC models, there has been little longitudinal research on the movement toward projected network-based models. This paper develops an evolutionary perspective of this transition, distinguishing adjustments altering how the MNC defines its &ldquo;global&rdquo; strategy, where it locates key resources, and how it structures and manages operations. It argues that rather then being a planned process, each phase represents a viable strategic response to then-existing challenges and opportunities. The paper also argues that the focus of the process shifts over time, initially focusing on building organizational linkages and adjusting the quantity and nature of resources within dispersed units, and later shifting toward reallocating resources and roles across units.&copy; 1996 JIBS.

Abstract: This study investigated whether small Japanese automobile ancillary firms followed the major Japanese automakers in setting up production facilities in the United States. Based on Dunning&apos;s eclectic theory of foreign direct investment and resource dependence theory, hypotheses were generated to explain the determinants of foreign investment of Japanese suppliers. It was hypothesized that mutual dependencies between the major Japanese automobile firms and their suppliers, firm-specific ownership advantages, profitability, and keiretsu affiliation influenced the foreign direct investment of the first-tier automobile ancillary firms into the United States. Data on the entire population of 446 Japanese automobile ancillary manufacturers were obtained from archival sources. Logistical regression analyses indicated that keiretsu affiliation, previous international experience, small size, lower dependence of supplier firms on the automobile assembly firm, and higher dependence of core firms on affiliate firms all contributed to this foreign direct investment.&copy; 1996 JIBS.

Abstract: This study examines post-listing equity price performance of foreign firms which cross-listed sponsored American Depository Receipts (ADRs) on the New York and the American Stock Exchanges during the period 1982-1992. We use three valuation metrics &ndash; price-to-book, price-to-cash-earnings, and price-to-earnings &ndash; which are adjusted for the home country and world industry indices to which the listing firm&apos;s stock belongs. We find positive valuation effects associated with cross-listing for both country-benchmarked and industry-benchmarked price ratios. Variables that proxy for home country characteristics such as governance styles, disclosure quality, market liquidity, and so forth are unable to explain the cross-sectional variation in the data. Our results thus suggest that cross-listing in the U.S. enhances valuations for listing firms by simply reducing the overall effect of segmentation among different national securities markets.&copy; 1996 JIBS.

Abstract: Managers in China, the USA and Britain were asked to describe the extent to which they used five sources for handling nine managerial events. Western managers were found to rely more upon their own experience and training, while in China, rules and procedures were more salient. For most events, Western managers who described themselves as relying on their own experience and training believed that the events had been well handled. They reported that events were less well handled to the extent that they referred to their superiors. Reliance on the superior was associated with role ambiguity among Western managers but not in China. Even though Chinese managers relied more upon rules and procedures they too evaluated events more positively when they had relied on their own experience and training. The results are discussed in terms of Chinese and Western cultural values and the prospects for change in managerial practice in China.&copy; 1996 JIBS.

Abstract: Given the large size and rapid growth of foreign direct investment in the United States, this subject is a central concern of U.S. firms and U.S. government policymakers. This study explores the factors that contribute to the explanation of FDI in the United States by country of origin of investment. Evidence from the past twelve years shows that the main significant positive influences are home country&apos;s exports to the United States and home country market size. Significant negative influences include the home country&apos;s imports from the United States, the cultural and geographic distances of the home country from the United States, and the exchange rate (fx/$).&copy; 1996 JIBS.

Abstract: Contrary to prior research, this U.K.-based study finds a contemporaneous relation between the foreign exchange rate and the market value of large exporters. We also find a weak lagged relationship which suggests that the stock market takes time to incorporate all of the implications of foreign currency movements into share prices. Evidence that the nature of this relationship changed when sterling was in the ERM is also provided.&copy; 1996 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (1996) 27, 157&ndash;165

Abstract: Sullivan&apos;s [1994] suggestion that an index measure of the internationalization construct is superior to single-variable measures is critiqued on psychometric, content validity, criterion validity, reliability, and utilitarian grounds. We argue that internationalization is more complex than envisioned by this index and suggest that further refinement of the construct is necessary before constructing indices.&copy; 1996 JIBS.
