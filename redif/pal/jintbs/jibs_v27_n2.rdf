Abstract: This paper examines the notion that the multinational&apos;s nationality influences its foreign subsidiary ownership decisions. It identifies theoretically meaningful constructs to represent nationality and examines, under carefully controlled conditions, their influence on subsidiary ownership preferences in American and European multinationals. The paper concludes that there are indeed significant differences in ownership preferences among various nationalities that can be explained using cultural as well as economic variables, but that these differences may become weaker in larger multinationals.&copy; 1996 JIBS.

Abstract: There is no simple relationship between internationalization of firms&apos; operations and expanding trade. The variation in exports from Swedish affiliates is here shown to be influenced by properties related to their degree of vertical and horizontal integration. Affiliates&apos; propensity to export is positively affected by production in few countries, intermediate imports from the parent, plant size, income level of the host country and a location in the European Community, and is negatively affected by R&amp;D intensity and the size of the host country market.&copy; 1996 JIBS.

Abstract: This paper focuses on international strategic technology partnerships, and the choice that companies have in terms of the organizational mode, either through complex inter-organizational modes involving equity-sharing, or contractual non-equity alliances. The empirical results show that the choice of particular mode of cooperation varies with the technological characteristics of sectors of industry. Joint ventures are disproportionately represented in relatively mature industries. Contractual alliances dominate strategic technology partnering in so-called high-tech industries.&copy; 1996 JIBS.

Abstract: This paper employs a simple stochastic model to investigate how transaction cost and strategic option considerations interact to influence a firm&apos;s evaluation of collaborative venturing as a market entry mode. After demonstrating how uncertainty about the market and about the potential partner can add to the value of a collaborative venture, the paper explicates a condition under which the option to acquire or sell out generates a positive economic value for both of the partners. The interaction of transaction cost and strategic option considerations is then examined, and a number of testable hypotheses are proposed based on the theoretical analyses of the paper.&copy; 1996 JIBS.

Abstract: Companies tend to begin their internationalization process in countries that are &lsquo;psychically&rsquo; close. Researchers describe the sequence of entry that firms follow and the mode of entry they choose. They suggest that psychically close countries are more easily understood than distant ones; and offer more familiar operating environments. Although not prescriptive, an unstated conclusion can be drawn linking sequence of entry to performance. Evidence from thirty-two Canadian retail companies shows that only seven (22%) were functioning successfully in the United States. The psychic distance paradox is that operations in psychically close countries are not necessarily easy to manage, because assumptions of similarity can prevent executives from learning about critical differences. Moreover, empirical evidence from 271 CEOs confirms greater cultural differences between Canada and the U.S. than assumed previously. Modifications are suggested to improve the psychic distance concept.&copy; 1996 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (1996) 27, 309&ndash;333

Abstract: We show that in uncertain environments ownership and internalization advantages may be negatively rather than positively associated with FDI. This reversal from extant theory occurs because ownership advantages often serve to make FDI delayable, while internalization advantages often serve to make it less reversible. When FDI becomes either more delayable or less reversible, it is less likely to occur at a point in time. Our approach enriches the &ldquo;who,&rdquo; &ldquo;Where&ldquo;why&rdquo; explanations offered by current FDI theory to incorporate the question of &ldquo;when.&rdquo;&copy; 1996 JIBS.

Abstract: In this paper, we suggest that the dominant motives for firms investing in Advanced Industrial Nations or Developing Countries (AINs or DCs) tend to be different. These dissimilar principal motives manifest themselves in aggregate impacts on national trade balances. Using market imperfections theory and borrowing from Root [1977], we suggest that firms generally tend to use FDI in AINs for market access and penetration, increasing host-country import levels. Firms tend to use FDI in DCs in order to gain resource advantages that can be exploited in export markets leading to increased exports and hence, trade surpluses. A contingency framework which outlines the conditions under which FDI inflows will be related to national trade surpluses and/or deficits, based on the dominant strategic motives of the investing firms, is presented and tested. Our findings suggest that the relationship between FDI inflow and trade balance is moderated by whether a country is an Advanced Industrial Nation or a Developing Country. In the Limitations and Future Research sections of the paper, readers are cautioned to view the findings as research opening rather than as definitive. Recommendations for future research are also discussed.&copy; 1996 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (1996) 27, 359&ndash;373

Abstract: Assessing whether the other party is likely to fulfil all obligations can be arduous when a transaction is international. The mechanisms that underpin compliance with agreements, and the functional detail of these mechanisms, may vary in relative importance between countries, perplexing the foreign operative. Additionally, a foreigner may suffer from informational constraints, communications distortions, and difficulty in achieving full acceptance in the local business culture.&copy; 1996 JIBS.

Abstract: The study explores the impact of cross-national carriers of ethics on attitudes about questionable business practices and form of moral reasoning across Mexican, Spanish and U.S. MBAs. Results show substantial agreement across cultures on twelve personally most objectionable practices, while form of moral reasoning varied significantly. Social cognitive theory is used to address the theoretical and practical implications.&copy; 1996 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (1996) 27, 391&ndash;411
