Abstract: The strategic choice between joint ventures, licensing agreements and mergers is analysed using eight key factors suggested by internalisation theory. The model explains the increasing role of international joint ventures in the 1980s in terms of the accelerating pace of technological innovation and the globalisation of markets. It offers a range of predictions about the formation of joint ventures within industries, across industries, across locations, and over time. It exploits a powerful modelling technique that has many other applications in international business strategy.&copy; 1996 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (1996) 27, 849&ndash;876

Abstract: In this paper we examine organizational characteristics, structural mechanisms and contextual factors that influence knowledge acquisition from the foreign parent in international joint ventures (IJVs). We in turn relates assessments of knowledge acquisition to IJV performance. The data come from a survey of IJVs in the Hungarian context, where learning and knowledge acquisition from the foreign parent is thought to be particularly critical. Adaptation mechanism, such as capacity to learn, articulated goals, and structural mechanisms, such as the provision of training, technology and managerial assistance by foreign parents, all were positively associated with the degree to which IJVs reported acquiring knowledge from their foreign parents. We also found limited support for the belief that cultural conflicts can impede knowledge acquisition, but only two-party joint ventures with 50/50 equity arrangements. We also looked at the relationship between knowledge acquisition and different dimensions for evaluating IJV performance. The relationship between knowledge acquisition and performance was significant for all indicators of performance, through knowledge acquisition from the foreign parent and the organizational characteristic hypothesized to enhance IJV knowledge acquisition affected assessments of some dimensions of performance more than others. Our findings contribute to advancing knowledge about the relationship between organizational characteristics and organizational knowledge acquisition in IJVs, as well as relationships between knowledge acquisition and different dimension of IJVs performance.&copy; 1996 JIBS.

Abstract: Foreign firms in host country environments frequently face location-based disadvantages. This study proposes three means (channels) of overcoming local knowledge disadvantages. Based on a sample of 558 Japanese joint ventures (JVs) located in Southeast and East Asia, we find that partnering with local firms (the first channel) can be a primary strategy for accessing local knowledge and improving JV performance. JV experience in the host country (the second channel) also mitigates local knowledge disadvantages and leads to increased JV performance. The third channel, the foreign parent&apos;s host country experience, leads to increased performance in the absence of a local partner. However, when a JV is formed with a local partner, increased parent experience in the host country leads to decreased performance suggesting that the need for a local partner declines as parent experience in a host country increases.&copy; 1996 JIBS.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the cooperative strategies between two firms in an overseas country. In part 1, we examine the circumstances under which foreign firms would cooperate with another foreign firm in a third country market. Drawing upon existing literature, we develop and test a set of hypotheses using a longitudinal data set from China. The types of cooperative arrangements include all the major modes of operation. In part 2, we further investigate what types of operation and level of control exist among the cooperative arrangements between two foreign firms in China. We used a sample of 483 cooperative arrangements between two firms from Hong Kong, the U.S., Japan, Germany, or Britain. This study offers interesting insight as to why foreign firms form cooperative arrangements in an overseas country and what types of cooperative arrangements these firms prefer.&copy; 1996 JIBS.

Abstract: In a survey of local employees of joint venture hotels in China, it was found that procedural and performance-based distributive justice was related to job satisfaction, but interactional justice was not. Comparison with other local employees was related to job satisfaction, but comparison with overseas employees was not. Senior managers reported a lower level of procedural and interactional justice, and senior managers and supervisors regarded their pay as less fair in comparison with local employees in state-owned hotels. Employees who worked with overseas Chinese and Japanese expatriates were less satisfied than those who worked with expatriates from the West, and this difference was explainable in terms of differences in perceived distributive justice.&copy; 1996 JIBS.

Abstract: Most current research on technology alliances assumes that trading partners are free to select an optimal governance structure. However, for international scientific research centers working with advanced technologies, the choices for industrial collaboration are often limited to short-term contracts. This research investigates whether in high technology settings, such short-term contracts can substitute for longer-term cooperative alliances. While the short-term transaction costs are high, the results suggest that, similar to alliances, certain market-based contracts do result in long-term learning and transferable firm-specific advantages.&copy; 1996 JIBS.

Abstract: This study investigated the formation and outcomes of trust between partners in a specific form of strategic alliance not often studied, the non-equity-based international cooperative alliance (ICA). Because a component of the investigation involved the reciprocal effects of trust in the ICA relationship, dyadic data were gathered from Japanese and U.S. partners in 101 ICAs based in Japan. Results showed that partner cultural sensitivity is an important contributor to trust building for both sides of the dyad. Complementarity with partner contributed to trust for the U.S. but not for the Japanese. Similarity between ICA partners led to trust for the Japanese but not the U.S. partner. The results also showed strong reciprocal effects of trust in the relationship, and that trust of the ICA partner leads the individual firm to integrate the ICA into its own strategic framework.&copy; 1996 JIBS.

Abstract: Existing research on international partnerships focuses primarily on the ex ante structuring of interorganizational relationships. This study departs from this research by taking a behavioral approach to understand the ex post maintenance of cross-border marketing partnerships. A conceptual model is developed by identifying the antecedents of trust and performance in such partnerships. The model is empirically tested on a sample of U.S. firms having distributor and licensing relationships with firms from Asia, Europe, and Central/South America. Findings support the importance of bilateral relational norms and informal monitoring mechanism in building interorganizational trust and improving market performance of international partnerships.&copy; 1996 JIBS.

Abstract: Cooperative relationships between firms can be better understood if they are examined in the context of a network of connected business relationships. Based on research on business relationships and business networks, this paper formulates a LISREL model that analyses cooperation in international business relationships between suppliers and customer firms. Theory suggests that cooperation can raise the value of business relationships, and that business network connections have an impact on cooperation. The model is investigated in a sample of 136 international business relationships. The analysis shows that relationship profitability is directly affected by relationship commitment and, indirectly through commitment, by business network connections.&copy; 1996 JIBS.
