Abstract: This paper explores the relationship between national institutional context and the development of biotechnology in the United States, United Kingdom, Japan and Germany. National patterns in biotechnology R&amp;D are linked to the configuration of county-specific institutional features into a system of innovation which supports (or impedes) the accumulation and diffusion of knowledge between the scientific and industrial communities. Building on this comparative analysis, it is argued that the particular characteristics of national systems of biotechnology innovation form the basis for complex interdependence within the global system, through international technological cooperation and the cross-border adoption and adaptation of institutional forms and practices. Implications for national technological advantage and the stability of national institutional systems are discussed.&copy; 1997 JIBS.

Abstract: This paper investigates the proposition that foreign direct investment in a high-technology industry is motivated in part by the sourcing of country-specific technological advantages embedded in foreign firms. The empirical findings show that foreign equity investment is drawn to American biotechnology firms with high levels of patent activity. We suggest that, in the biotechnology industry, foreign direct investment in the form of equity participation can be an efficient vehicle for tapping into country-specific, firm-embodied technological advantages.&copy; 1997 JIBS.

Abstract: Recent literature has suggested that a key stakeholder may be able to shift the balance of bargaining power during a joint venture negotiation, and thus change the outcome of the process. This paper explores the role of central and eastern European transitional governments as key stakeholders, and how they influence international joint venture negotiations. This role is described and analyzed by examining eight dyads of western European and central/eastern European enterprises that have recently negotiated agreements. The findings suggest that transitional governments as key stakeholders intervene at different stages of the negotiation process, have both direct and indirect influences on the process, and that they can change the balance of power in the negotiations, sometimes to the detriment of their own state-owned enterprise.&copy; 1997 JIBS.

Abstract: We test the hypothesis that culturally related international diversification will have a positive impact on firm performance and that the opposite will be true for culturally unrelated globalization. Cultural diversity for Fortune 500 firms was used to predict performance over a ten-year period (1985&ndash;1994), controlling for several organizational and industry characteristics. Regression tests using nine indicators of cultural diversity revealed no significant cultural effects. Alternate interpretations are offered.&copy; 1997 JIBS.

Abstract: Using a behavioral approach, this study identifies and delineates components of experiential knowledge in the internationalization process. Three hypotheses are developed and tested. They center around the lack of knowledge in the areas of foreign business, foreign institutions and firm internationalization, as well as the effect that this lack of knowledge has on managers&apos; perceived cost in the internationalization process. With the help of a LISREL-based structural model, the three hypotheses are tested on a sample of 362 service firms. The analysis shows that lack of internationalization knowledge has a strong impact on the lack of both business and institutionalization. But there is no direct effect of lack of internationalization knowledge on perceived cost of internationalization.&copy; 1997 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (1997) 28, 337&ndash;360

Abstract: This study examines how brand popularity in conjunction with other marketing variables influences market share directly as well as indirectly by interacting with country-related intangible assets (or simply country image). The results of our empirical analysis show that a competitive analysis without the recognition of country image would be misleading. We found that country-specific intangible assets exist and that they significantly interact with marketing variables differently for U.S. and Japanese brands in the subcompact car market in the USA. Brand popularity and advertising were found to be key factors for intangible assets for both the U.S. and the Japanese brands. Brand popularity was the most significant factor for market share in both the short run and the long run. Japanese firms&apos; direct investment (FDI) in the target country directly influenced market share only in the short run. Several important implications for international marketing are presented.&copy; 1997 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (1997) 28, 361&ndash;386

Abstract: One of the major criticisms of government export promotion schemes in many countries is that they tend to be poorly targeted. Awareness levels about export schemes among managers of companies at exporting or pre-exporting stages of internationalization are often quite low, and the perceived usefulness of schemes may decline as companies internationalize and their needs become more specific. One solution may be to develop a better understanding of the needs of managers who make export market development decisions, and to target segments of managers (rather than companies) who share similar strengths and weaknesses. This study attempts to address these concerns by devising a typology of senior international marketing managers. The most senior marketing decisionmakers in a broad, multi-industry sample of New Zealand exporting firms were surveyed. The results of the cluster analysis suggest that groups of managers who share similar characteristics can be identified and profiled, based on shared international business attitudes and similar levels of knowledge and skills. This appears to be a useful method of segmenting international marketing managers to determine what sort of educational and export assistance particular groups may require.&copy; 1997 JIBS.
