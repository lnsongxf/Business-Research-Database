Abstract: Studies on foreign direct investment (FDI) have concentrated on sectoral effects, but rarely on country patterns, In this paper, we use U.S. Department of Commerce data to identify the largest country shares of new FDI entries into the U.S. and the technological motivations for their investments. Based on the technological intensities of major investing countries in manufacturing industries, we conclude that technological industries attract a disproportionate share of FDI entries. However, the acquisition of U.S. technology is not a major motivation. The findings indicate that industry rivalry is an important dimension to understanding FDI.&copy; 1997 JIBS.

Abstract: An empirical test of 290 U.S. and 653 Japanese managers, using the Miles and Snow typology, provides a cross-national examination of strategy&apos;s impact on conflict. Results substantially support the study&apos;s predictions and indicate that firms should: (1) monitor their conflict handling mechanisms; (2) emphasize integrative approaches; and (3) appropriately use formalization for conflict handling. Despite a convergence of management practices globally, findings indicate that considerable differences still exist between U.S. and Japanese firms.&copy; 1997 JIBS.

Abstract: International exchange is a two-sided coin, involving exporters and importers. However, a systematic search of the academic literature reveals a striking imbalance: while exporter behavior has been extensively studied, importer behavior remains a largely neglected area of study, even though importers are playing an even more important (often dominant) role in consummating trade transactions. In this article, we assert that this neglect stems from two critical &ndash; but flawed &ndash; assumptions. The first is that exporters are the driving force behind international trade transactions, and the second is that importers follow the neoclassical economics theory of &ldquo;rational choice&rdquo; in international sourcing.We offer an integrated exporter/importer decision framework, a critical review and synthesis of extant studies of importer behavior, and suggestions for future research directions. Evidence shows that much international exchange is better conceptualized as buyer-coordinated importing rather than producer-initiated exporting. Furthermore, the revealed behavior of importers is different from what can be expected of them from the rational choice paradigm, and is messier than what is commonly assumed of them in the export management literature. From a cognitive perspective, our study also suggests that there may exist a fundamental behavioral difference between domestic and IB decisionmaking.&copy; 1997 JIBS.

Abstract: Institutional analysis is proposed as an alternative theoretical methodology for the study of comparative marketing systems. This paper argues that institutional analysis offers considerable potential for understanding dynamics marketing systems and for the explicit study of change. Disciplinary insights of institutional analysis are reviewed and the richness of the conceptual apparatus of comparative institutional analysis, as applied to the study of comparative marketing systems, is explicated.&copy; 1997 JIBS.

Abstract: This paper investigates the effect of international activities on capital structure as measured by a debt ratio. Prior studies have examined factors that affect the debt ratio for both multinational corporations (MNCs) and domestic corporations (DCs); however, the incremental explanatory power and the direct effect of the extent of international activities on capital structure have not been tested. This paper uses multiple regression analyses to add measures of international activities after controlling for measures pertinent to both MNCs and DCs. Using a sample of 18,495 observations from the Compustat Tape, we find 1) consistent with results reported by prior studies, the debt-equity ratio is negatively related to both bankruptcy costs and growth options; 2) after controlling for bankruptcy costs and growth options, MNCs have lower debt-equity rations than DCs; 3) within the MNCs, the debt-equity ratio is positively related to the degree of internationalization, and this calls for further investigation.&copy; 1997 JIBS.

Abstract: We investigate the effect of firm-specific advantages being &lsquo;local&rsquo; in scope, and the influence of subsequent location-specific disadvantages, on the choice of foreign entry mode and subsidiary performance. To look into this issue, we examine Japanese FDI data from the wholesale and retail industries &ndash; two sectors that have productive activity concentrated in downstream processes and location-bound resources. Our theoretical and empirical analyses demonstrate that, in situations where required capabilities must be developed through local experience and where location-specific resources were subject to market failure, acquisition and joint venture strategies were preferred. Greenfield entries were successful disadvantages for the entry mode literature and offer a perspective on the performance of the entry mode choice.&copy; 1997 JIBS.

Abstract: Effective international management requires knowledge of culturally patterned self-concepts and concomitant feedback desires. This paper argues that the cultural forces of individualism versus collectivism shape the self-concept, and by extension individual performance evaluation and feedback seeking. We present a comparative study to test the hypotheses that U.S. respondents desire success feedback (whereas Japanese and Chinese desire feedback), show more initiative and perceive more direct workplace feedback than do either Japanese or Chinese respondents. Strong support was found for comparisons between the U.S. and Japan, but the Chinese consistently departed from predictions. We interpret these results in terms of recent reforms in the People&apos;s Republic of China, and discuss implications of the study for international management.&copy; 1997 JIBS.

Abstract: Dual-career expatriate couples present a challenging set of problems for international human resource managers. The results of a survey of husbands and wives in expatriate dual-career couples are analyzed relative to: 1) differences between the expatriates and their trailing spouses; 2) differences between male- and female-led dual-career couples; 3) differences between dual-career couples&apos; opinions prior to expatriation and upon repatriation. The results of the study indicate dual-career couples have relatively consistent concerns and expectations prior to expatriation and upon repatriation to their home country. The significant differences observed were between male-led dual-career couples prior to expatriation when compared to male-led dual-career couples upon repatriation. In addition, the dual-career expatriate respondents did not feel the MNC that transferred them overseas provided adequate training or social support during the international assignment.&copy; 1997 JIBS.
