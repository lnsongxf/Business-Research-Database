Abstract: This paper reflects on the general problems and specific opportunities faced by contemporary research on multinational enterprise. The general problems include controlling properly for the firm&rsquo;s opportunities when testing the effectiveness of its policy choices; avoiding biases that result from studying surviving business units and ignoring those that disappeared; and mobilizing longitudinal data and exploiting the many census-based data sets now coming available.&copy; 1998 JIBS.

Abstract: Flexibility is identified as the hallmark of recent modelling of the multinational enterprise. The focus on flexibility is a response to the rationalization and restructuring of international business, which has occurred since the end of the &ldquo;golden age&rdquo; of Western economic growth. Flexibility has been south in factor markets, intermediate product markets and markets for final products. It has been sought by both governments and firms. Flexible firms are attracted to locations with flexible host governments. This article contrasts the modern research agenda based on flexibility with the more traditional research agenda which predominates in the literature reviewed by Caves (1996).&copy; 1998 JIBS.

Abstract: This article first traces the changing world economic scenario for international business over the past two decades, and then goes on to examine its implications for the location of foreign direct investment and multinational enterprise activity. It suggests that many of the explanations of the 1970s and early 1980s need to be modified as firm-specific assets have become mobile across natural boundaries. A final section of the article examines the dynamic interface between the value-added activities of multinational enterprises in different locations.&copy; 1998 JIBS.

Abstract: Since at least the late 1950s, it has been recognized that multinational enterprises operate in imperfect markets characterized by oligopoly. The dominant &ldquo;transactions-cost&rdquo; theory of multinational enterprises does not wholly account for why this is so. The reductio ad absurdum of this theory would predict imperfect markets to be sure, but they would be monopolistic rather than oligopolistic. In this article, a simple model based on noncooperative game theory shows how oligopolistic markets can evolve from monopolistic ones. Also shown is that it is neither necessary nor sufficient that a firm have lower costs than its rivals in order to have an incentive to become multinational.&copy; 1998 JIBS.

Abstract: This article reviews the relevance of the transactions-costs model to the role of the firm in production and diffusion of knowledge. A revival of interest in technology, productivity and growth has generated a new empirical and theoretical literature. A review of these developments suggests that they have not yet been reflected in significant adaptation of the conventional firm-versus-market concept. Research has been severely hampered by data gaps and suggestions are made with respect to improvements in the information base. Finally technology issues are and will be of increasing significance in both domestic and international policy, and must be factored into the conceptual template of corporate strategy.&copy; 1998 JIBS.

Abstract: IN: Multinational Enterprise and Economic Analysis Caves provides a summary of economic research on multinationals and developing countries. Yet, for policy makers major questions remain unanswered. The gaps can be grouped into four categories: the impact of the widespread change in development strategies on multinationals, the net impact of foreign direct investment on host countries, the causes of declining tensions between developing countries and foreign investors, and links between our economic knowledge and the decisions that face private and government managers.&copy; 1998 JIBS.

Abstract: The interaction between governments and multinational enterprises is analyzed using a new conceptual framework. This captures the key aspects of Richard Caves&prime; &ldquo;normative&rdquo; and &ldquo;behavioral&rdquo; approaches to the literature, but also develops a more contemporary &ldquo;strategic&rdquo; approach. Our framework uses insights from the resource-based theory of the firm to analyze managerial aspects of multinational enterprises and public policy neglected by Caves. In particular, we incorporate strategies of national responsiveness.&copy; 1998 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (1998) 29, 115&ndash;136

Abstract: Previous theoretical research has argued that national cultural distance hinders cross-border acquisition performance by increasing the costs of integration. This article tests the alternative hypothesis that national cultural distance enhances cross-border acquisition performance by providing access to the target&apos;s and/or the acquirer&apos;s diverse set of routines and repertoires embedded in national culture. Using a multi-dimensional measure of national cultural distance and controlling for other effects, we examine a sample of 52 cross-border acquisitions that took place between 1987 and 1992, and find a positive association between national cultural distance and cross-border acquisition performance.&copy; 1998 JIBS.

Abstract: With operations spread worldwide, firms that find themselves competing in a global marketplace are looking at the implications of the admonition, &ldquo;When in Rome. ...&rdquo; This raises the question: &ldquo;Do cultures of countries have an impact on the generally accepted methods of managing human resources?&rdquo; The answer to this question is the focus of this article. By developing culture-specific propositions for four categories of compensation practices based on status, performance, social benefits and programs, and employee ownership plans, we seek to determine the extent to which Hofstede&apos;s four dimensions of culture are associated with specific compensation practices. Support is found for most of the propositions. The implications of the finding for the management of human resources by multinational firms are discussed.&copy; 1998 JIBS.

Abstract: The paper presents a conceptual framework that links international joint venture context (cultural similarity, relative power, and relationship age) and partners&prime; conflict resolution strategies to satisfaction. Special attention is paid to the mediation effect of conflict resolution behavior on the linkage from context to satisfaction. The framework is assessed empirically using a sample of U.S. and Chinese joint venture managers in China.&copy; 1998 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (1998) 29, 179&ndash;196
