Abstract: This paper shows that network linkage is an important determinant of location choice in foreign direct investment (FDI). Network linkages are divided into internal (intra-firm) and external (inter-firm) linkages. External linkages are further separated into strategic and relational linkages. We found that Taiwanese firms are keen on making external linkages, but are indifferent to, or incapable of, making internal linkages through FDI. Strategic linkages motivate Taiwanese FDI in the United States, while relational linkages facilitate Taiwanese FDI in Southeast Asia and China. Small firms are more sensitive to relational linkages than large firms in their choice of FDI location.&copy; 1998 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (1998) 29, 445&ndash;467

Title: Do Foreign-Owned and U.S.-Owned Establishments Exhibit the Same Location Pattern in U.S. Manufacturing Industries?

Abstract: There are arguments to support and contradict the proposition that foreign-owned and U.S.-owned establishments exhibit similar location patterns within the United States. This paper addresses these conflicting views by comparing the location of all manufacturing establishments in the United States held by the U.S. and by foreign firms. The empirical evidence indicates that the location patterns of foreign-owned and U.S.-owned establishments differ. Moreover, the most influential factor in explaining the location pattern difference is that foreign-owned establishments, compared to U.S.-owned establishments, favor coastal states. I also find evidence to suggest that foreign firms favor states with low unionization rates, low wage rates, and right to work legislation. These results are consistent with arguments that foreign establishments differ from their domestic counterparts and value location attributes differently.&copy; 1998 JIBS.

Abstract: This study examines the implications of differences in strategy and industry structure for firms&prime; economic exposures to foreign exchange rate movements. In contrast with previous research using a single currency proxy, this study estimates firms&prime; exposures using a multiple currency model. The empirical evidence from U.S. manufacturing firms indicates that 13 to 17 percent of firms are exposed to foreign exchange rate movements. Results from cross-sectional analyses reveal that foreign direct investment reduces economic exposure to foreign exchange rate movements.&copy; 1998 JIBS.

Abstract: This paper tests the proposition that national origin affects the strategies of multinational enterprises by looking at the determinants of the choice they make between entering the United States through partially versus wholly owned subsidiaries. We pool entries into the United States made by firms based in two countries, Japan and Finland, which differ both in their cultural characteristics and in their cultural distance to the United States. After carefully controlling for the known firm and industry-level determinants of subsidiary ownership strategies, we find that cultural distance between the home base of the investor and the target country (or perhaps political risk) exerts a powerful influence on ownership of subsidiaries, but cultural characteristics of the home base do not.&copy; 1998 JIBS.

Abstract: A new fully integrated analysis of the foreign market entry decision is presented, encompassing the choice between exporting, licensing, joint venturing and wholly owned foreign investment. The choice between acquisition and greenfield investment is examined, and so too are options based on subcontracting and franchising. The model extends the insights of internalization theory, and draws on concepts from the economics of industrial organization. A special feature of the model is the distinction between investment in production facilities and investment in distribution facilities - an important practical distinction that has been overlooked in much of the international business literature. The strength of competition from indigenous rivals is emphasized as a determinant of entry strategy into both production and distribution.&copy; 1998 JIBS.

Abstract: When U.S. firms make large international acquisitions, the unpredicted component of their profits over the next five years increases with the relative size of the acquired firm, degree of product diversification, and reliance on R&amp;D assets. The unpredicted component declines with the acquirer&apos;s size, experience, and previous profits. Transitory and longer-run unpredicted components are distinguished.&copy; 1998 JIBS.

Abstract: This paper examines the role of firm technology investment, in concert with managerial incentives alignment, to explain the relative market value compared to the accounting value for a multinational firm. The results are consistent with internalization theory in that greater multinationality corresponds to a higher valuation of the firm if technology investment is high, and the impact is even greater if managerial incentives alignment is high as well. However, greater multinationality alone does not correlate to a significantly greater value, which differs from the tenets of imperfect capital markets theory.&copy; 1998 JIBS.

Abstract: This note analyzes the impact of political risk on investors&apos; required return and the multinational corporation&apos;s cost of capital on foreign direct investment using the basic diversifiable-nondiversifiable dichotomy of portfolio theory. Whether or not a particular political risk affects the value of a multinational corporation through its cost of capital depends on whether the risk is related to investors&apos; relevant market portfolios. We provide a numerical example that illustrates the potential impact of political risk on required return.&copy; 1998 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (1998) 29, 599&ndash;607

Abstract: Building on Leonidou and Katsikeas&apos; (1996) review of the export development literature, we identify an important missing link in existing research: the role of export intermediaries as an organizational form connecting domestic manufacturers and foreign buyers. In response, a new research agenda drawing on the transaction cost and resource-based perspectives is advanced. This agenda focuses on why export intermediaries are selected by manufacturers in their channel choice decisions, and why some intermediaries outperform others. The paper closes with discussions of research, practice, and public policy implications.&copy; 1998 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (1998) 29, 609&ndash;620

Abstract: This article examines the standing of the Journal of International Business Studies (JIBS) among scholarly journals, and changes in its influence, over a 11 year period (1981 to 1991) using a variety of citation indices. We suggested that two new measures&mdash;a prestige index and a trajectory index&mdash;are helpful in assessing a journal&apos;s influence and reputation. We estimate these, as well as several standard citation measures, to gauge JIBS&prime; progress in the recent past. We find that JIBS does well on all measures, but room for improvement remains. This article discusses options available to the editorial board to raise JIBS&prime; prestige.&copy; 1998 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (1998) 29, 621&ndash;631
