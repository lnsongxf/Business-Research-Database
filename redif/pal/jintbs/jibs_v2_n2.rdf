Abstract: In the global economic competition marked by the United States as the most developed and most powerful representative of the free enterprise system and by the Soviet Union as the oldest and most influential representative of the socialist world, Hungary is a small and perhaps inconsequential competitor. Since January 1, 1968, however, this small but enterprising nation through the implementation of a set of economic reforms, which can only be described as the most advanced and perhaps the most liberal in the socialist camp, has made news all over the world.&copy; 1971 JIBS.

Abstract: As a company expands its operations from a predominately domestic base to a multinational base, it might be expected that its formal systems of reporting and control will undergo some fundamental changes. For example, Hawkins concludes a discussion of this with the statement, &ldquo;Those responsible for foreign operations need to create management control systems tailored to the peculiar objectives, organization, and environment of their international operations, rather than simply exporting their domestic control systems.&rdquo;11David F. Hawkins, &ldquo;Controlling Foreign Operations,&rdquo; Financial Executive, Vol. 33, No. 2 (February 1965), p. 25. But does this occur in practice? And, more important, should it occur?&copy; 1971 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (1971) 2, 11&ndash;28

Abstract: The value of U.S. overseas investments has grown rapidly in recent years. From $10.7 billion in 1949, the worldwide total of U.S. direct investments had grown to $70.8 billion by 1969. Sales from overseas operations had risen correspondingly. In 1967 they totaled approximately $80 billion, amounting to 2.6 times the value of U.S. merchandise exports.&copy; 1971 JIBS.

Abstract: Since the publication of the Leontief paradox in 1953, there has been a proliferation of theories and studies intended to provide a better explanation of observed trade patterns than does the traditional factor proportions theory.11These are summarized in G. C. Hufbauer, &ldquo;The Impact of National Characteristics and Technology on the Commodity Composition of Trade in Manufacturing Goods.&rdquo; in The Technology Factor in International Trade, ed. by Raymond Vernon (New York: National Bureau of Economic Research, 1970), pp. 145-232.&copy; 1971 JIBS.

Abstract: A major challenge facing teachers of international business subjects during the decade of the 1970&apos;s will be the efficient and effective integration of international concepts with the functional areas of current business school curricula. This challenge is a consequence of the development of international business programs during the 1950&apos;s and the shifted emphasis toward concern with &ldquo;greater internationalization of the functional areas of business&rdquo; in the 1960&apos;s.11Schuyler F. Otteson, Internationalizing the Traditional Business Curriculum, International Business Research Series #1 (Bloomington, Indiana: Bureau of Business Research, Indiana University, 1968) p. 90. (The problems of the 60's are also discussed in Stefan Robock and Lee Nehrt, eds., Education in International Business, (Bloomington, Indiana: Indiana University, 1964). the current task is broader than the former ones in that it involves &ldquo;total&rdquo; integration. Such integration, however, necessarily involves optimal allocation of resources within the university. Thus administrators must find the proper combination of internationalized functional business courses and functionalized international courses. Achievement of such a condition necessitates obtaining the effective faculty interaction needed in any successful interdisciplinary approach. Furthermore, it adds additional pressure to the fact that many business school resources are already strained with no immediate relief in sight.&copy; 1971 JIBS.
