Abstract: This paper examines the determinants of foreign direct investment (FDI) in research and development laboratories by 32 multinational enterprises in the pharmaceutical and electronics industries. The paper applies a dichotomous set of motives for FDI. Results from an econometric analysis of 136 laboratory investments show that relative market size and relative strength of a country&apos;s science base determine whether FDI in research and development is carried out in order to exploit existing firm-specific advantages, or in order to build up new firm-specific advantages. This holds true in similar form for Japanese, European and U.S. firms and across the two industries.&copy; 1999 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (1999) 30, 1&ndash;24

Abstract: In this paper, we examine the importance of decision specific experience for a multinational firm&apos;s foreign ownership structure and establishment mode decisions. A unique procedure to measure the decision specific experience construct is developed. Based on data for the period 1969&ndash;1991, we find strong empirical evidence from experiences of Japanese firms to support the hypotheses that firms tend to select ownership structures and establishment modes based on their experiences with similar ownership structures and establishment modes in the past.&copy; 1999 JIBS.

Abstract: From a management coordination perspective, this paper compares the relative performance of the lean and mass organization systems under different market environments and organizational operating conditions. Results from an empirically based computer model suggest that the success of either organization system depends not only on the organization&apos;s structural characteristics for management coordination, but also on internal and external environmental conditions. This study calls for caution against rushing into lean management practices.&copy; 1999 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (1999) 30, 45&ndash;79

Abstract: Market share performance and profitability of overseas business activities has long been an important issue in international business. In this study, we explore the impact of order and mode of market entry into an overseas market. We find that early entrants have significantly higher market shares and profitability than late followers. We also find that equity joint ventures have a higher profitability than either wholly owned operations or contractual joint ventures. A significant interaction exists between order and mode of market entry. As expected, firm efficiency and size affect the performance of firms. These results are based on the business activities of a sample of 14,466 foreign firms in China in 1995.&copy; 1999 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (1999) 30, 81&ndash;103

Abstract: Each year, the value of gray market products sold throughout the world runs into the billions of dollars. Past research has stated that exporters of manufactured goods can hardly afford to ignore the possibility of this phenomenon due to the often severe effects on their sales volume, margins, and relationships with distributors and end-users. Through a survey of export managers of manufacturing firms, coupled with a series of qualitative interviews, this study investigates how organizational specific, control specific, and market specific factors drive gray market activity, and in turn explores the effects of unauthorized distribution on export performance. Several factors are shown to evaluate the potential of unauthorized distribution in their export markets, namely the centralization of decision making, the degree to which the product is standardized, channel integration, and channel control. International experience, market volatility, and the number of markets served were found to have no effect on gray market activity, this contrary to traditional thinking. Furthermore, the effects of gray market activity on strategic versus economic performance is shown to be significantly different. Each of these issues is discussed in detail, along with the implications for export managers.&copy; 1999 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (1999) 30, 105&ndash;126

Abstract: Adopting a network perspective, we demonstrate that two different, yet complementary, forces influence the formation of trade and investment policy. One the one hand, nations that are trading partners develop similar policies through a process of close and enduring interaction. On the other hand, nations that compete for trading opportunities adopt comparable policies through a process of establishing similar types of relations with other nations, even though they may not have direct ties to each other. Implications for managers of multinational enterprises are developed.&copy; 1999 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (1999) 30, 127&ndash;147

Abstract: A causal model of salesperson performance and satisfaction is tested using data collected in Japan and the United States. The model seems to work well for both cultural groups, that is, comparable levels of variance are explained. However, the data appear to fit the model differently across samples; culture appears to moderate the relationships among constructs. Pay and valence for pay play a more central role for the Americans than the Japanese. Value congruence has a strong influence on job satisfaction for the Japanese, but not the American sales representatives. These findings confirm both the conventional wisdom that financial incentives are crucial in the United States, and the anecdotal evidence that closer supervision and corporate culture will be more useful sales management tools in Japan.&copy; 1999 JIBS.

Abstract: This paper reports findings from a study that systematically evaluated the form of the relationship between multinationality and performance. In contrast to most of the prior conceptualizations that rely on linear, monotonic models of the linkage, this study examined a curvilinear model that addresses both the costs and benefits associated with multinationality. It used time-series techniques to capture both the static and dynamic components of the relationship. Results show that increasing levels of multinationality bring significant performance benefits up to a certain optimum level beyond which benefits begin to decelerate, while costs accelerate.&copy; 1999 JIBS.

Abstract: This paper develops a conceptual framework for analyzing organizational responses to contractual uncertainty in the context of emerging economies. Elaborating on Hennart&apos;s (1989) transaction cost rationale for countertrade, we develop a typology of exchange and transaction governance pertinent to the study of emerging economies: Contract, trust and hostage. Notwithstanding the traditional explanation based on foreign exchange shortage, we argue that the persistence of international countertrade illustrates organizational remedies to institutional deficiency in transaction governance.&copy; 1999 JIBS.

Abstract: Australians and Japanese working in Australian and Japanese organizations in both countries were involved in a research project that estimated stereotypical views of national culture. Respondents rated the importance of cultural values in Australia and Japan using the List of Values (LOV) instrument. The results of a discriminant analysis suggested that potentially detrimental misunderstandings about their respective cultures may exist between Australians and Japanese engaged in mutual international business.&copy; 1999 JIBS.
