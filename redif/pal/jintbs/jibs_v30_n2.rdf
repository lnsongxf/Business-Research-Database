Abstract: Guanxi refers to a Chinese system of doing business on the basis of personal relationships, and it is representative of the way that business is done throughout much of the non-western world. In this paper we first evaluate guanxi from an ethical perspective, and then attempt to shed light on the sources of its economic advantages and disadvantages through the use of a simple mathematical model. Finally, we point out how eastern and western business practices may already be converging toward systems based on more complete models of trust to deal with the conditions of progress coupled with uncertainty that form our new economic reality.&copy; 1999 JIBS.

Abstract: The extent to which exchange rate fluctuations affect international prices is called &ldquo;exchange rate pass-through.&rdquo; This paper develops a conceptual model in explaining how exchange rate fluctuations are channeled into international pricing strategy, and offers research propositions. Our model posits that the extent of exchange rate pass-through in international pricing is affected by the firm&apos;s pricing orientation, performance orientation, distribution policy, and brand equity, as well as by exchange rate uncertainty and competitive symmetry.&copy; 1999 JIBS.

Abstract: Does organizational learning as measured by experience in a host country affect international expansion performance? If so, does such a relationship between experience and performance hold over time? How do the environmental forces in the host country affect such a relationship? Focusing on organizational learning by multinational enterprises (MNEs) operating in a transition economy, this study answers these three critical questions by exploring the relationships among experience, environment, and performance at the subsidiary level. Based on a recent survey of 108 MNE subunits operating in China, we find that the intensity and diversity of host country experience is an important predictor of subunit performance. While the positive effect of the intensity of experience on performance diminishes over time, the impact of the diversity of experience on performance remains unchanged. Moreover, for MNEs experiencing greater environmental dynamism, complexity, and hostility, there is a stronger positive relationship between experience and performance.&copy; 1999 JIBS.

Abstract: We use the metaphor of the mutual assurance game to develop the notion that overseas suppliers may proactively manage uncertainty by making customized investments to serve their buyers. Using this game-theoretic conceptualization as a complement to the transactions cost analysis notion of credible commitments, we argue that such investments serve as assurances of commitment to the international buyer. The hypotheses are tested using data collected in a survey of U.S. purchasing managers regarding their relationships with their Pacific Rim suppliers. Consistent with our hypotheses, our primary results indicate that suppliers&apos; relationship-specific investments are greater when technological uncertainty is high and buyers value supplier responsiveness. Further, our results suggest that relationship stability and buyer information sharing are greater when supplier relationship-specific investments are greater. These results provide some support for our argument that in the face of technological uncertainty, overseas suppliers may unilaterally commit to their buyers in attempts to obtain reciprocal benefits that help them manage external uncertainty.&copy; 1999 JIBS.

Abstract: A 2 &times; 4 (culture of participants &times; degrees of cultural adaptation) experimental design with 145 Thai and 101 Japanese professionals is used to investigate the effect of cultural adaptation on attraction and outcomes when Americans adapt to Japanese and Thais. This study extends the research of Francis (1991). The curvilinear relationship between adaptation and attraction found in Francis is not replicated. For Thais, the relationship appears monotonic positive. For Japanese, it reaches a plateau beyond moderate adaptation.&copy; 1999 JIBS.

Abstract: This paper examines the impact of national wealth, income distribution, government size, and four cultural variables on the perceived level of corruption in a country. The study finds that corruption is significantly correlated to GNP per capita, power distance, masculinity, and uncertainty avoidance. Significant interaction effects occur in collectivistic and high power-distance countries. Suggestions for future research are developed.&copy; 1999 JIBS.

Abstract: This paper examines the internationalization process of telecommunication carriers. In this industry, early entrants gain substantial first-mover advantages due to the transient nature of the windows of market opportunity, and the potential to influence the regulatory process as an incumbent. To capture these strategic and economic advantages, firms follow a strategy of preemption, both of markets and partners. The authors argue for the need to augment prevailing theory with contextual idiosyncrasies that characterize specific industries.&copy; 1999 JIBS.

Abstract: We investigate the role of information in the internationalization of small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Information internalization is fundamentally antecedent to SME internationalization and is being facilitated increasingly by recent important trends. We offer a conceptual explanation and related propositions on information internalization, emphasizing hurdle rate theory for ascertaining the acceptability of firms&apos; internationalization projects.&copy; 1999 JIBS.

Abstract: This paper conducts an in-depth critique of previous research on international joint venture instability by pointing out its major limitations: lack of clear conceptualizations and consistent operationalizations, lack of clarity in the relationship with performance, static focus on the eventual destination rather than developmental processes, and lack of managerial relevance. To overcome these deficiencies, we propose a significant reconceptualization in which instability is defined as a neutral, dynamic, process-based, and multifaceted phenomenon. Directions for future research are provided.&copy; 1999 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (1999) 30, 397&ndash;414

Abstract: Our goal is to develop a profile of Chinese managers, and in particular a profile of the New Generation of Chinese managers. The purpose for developing this profile is primarily to provide relevant information for non-Chinese business people, especially Westerners, who plan to engage in business in China. This profile is based on measures of individual values (Individualism, Collectivism and Confucianism) relevant to China and business. Our findings suggest that the New Generation manager is more individualistic and more likely to act independently, while taking risks in the pursuit of profits. However, these New managers are, likewise, not forsaking their Confucian values. Thus, they may be viewed as crossverging their Eastern and Western influences, while on the road of modernization.&copy; 1999 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (1999) 30, 415&ndash;427
