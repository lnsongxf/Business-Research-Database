Abstract: This paper reports on a multi-method study of knowledge transfer in international acquisitions. Using questionnaire data we show that the transfer of technological know-how is facilitated by communication, visits &amp; meetings, and by time elapsed since acquisition, while the transfer of patents is associated with the articulability of the knowledge, the size of the acquired unit, and the recency of the acquisition. Using case study data, we show that the immediate post-acquisition period is characterized by imposed one-way transfers of knowledge from the acquirer to the acquired, but over time this gives way to high-quality reciprocal knowledge transfer.&copy; 1999 JIBS.

Abstract: The competitive nature of knowledge transfer and the process of organizational learning between partners constitute a fundamental challenge for both academics and practitioners alike. By focusing on one type of competency - marketing know-how - this research examines the role of knowledge ambiguity pertaining to the process of knowledge transfer in international strategic alliances. Based on a cross-sectional sample of 151 multinationals and a structural equation methodology, this study empirically investigates the antecedents of knowledge ambiguity: tacitness, asset specificity, complexity, experience, partner protectiveness, cultural distance, and organizational distance. Further, the strength of the relationships between these theoretical constructs and ambiguity is examined in light of the possible moderating effects of collaborative experience, firm size, and the duration of the alliance entered. Consistently, tacitness emerges as the most significant determinant of knowledge transferability. Moreover, the effects of cultural distance, asset specificity, and prior experience are moderated respectively by the firm&apos;s level of collaborative experience, the duration of the alliance, and the firm&apos;s size.&copy; 1999 JIBS.

Abstract: Attempts to measure the spillover effects of multinational enterprises on host countries have generally been cross-sectional and limited to labour productivity in manufacturing for a single country. Recent work in growth theory has measured the extent to which growth in total factor productivity in a country depends not only on domestic R&amp;D capital stocks but also on foreign R&amp;D capital stocks. This paper extends such work by adding foreign direct investment stocks to foreign trade as a channel linking total factor productivity levels between countries. This is done by considering the role of trade and FDI as diffusion channels for G6 R&amp;D to the OECD countries. There are three main results: the coefficient estimates for FDI are higher than those for trade in the standard model; the importance of the trade channel is much reduced once FDI is included; and the overall spillovers increase significantly with the inclusion of FDI.&copy; 1999 JIBS.

Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to identify, using the framework of a statistical model, the extent to which policy changes in Canada specifically directed toward inward foreign direct investment (FDI) have influenced both capital outflows to Canada and capital outflows from Canada. The paper adds to the literature concerned with how public policies targeted specifically at FDI have altered capital inflows, and uniquely links such policies to outward direct investment (ODI). We examine specifically the effects of major policy changes toward FDI implemented by the Canadian government over the period 1950-1995. In Canada&apos;s case, free-trade agreements (FTA and NAFTA) appear to have significantly increased levels of inward and outward foreign direct investment; however, Canada&apos;s attempt to screen FDI via the Foreign Investment Review Agency (FIRA) had no significant effects on either FDI or ODI.&copy; 1999 JIBS.

Abstract: This study does not support the generally accepted theory that transnational corporations (TNCs) use different criteria to evaluate managers based on their location (host or home country). If it is assumed that a major TNC strategy is to maximize profits, thus maximizing returns to shareholders, it follows that management decisions are made with this strategy as the desired outcome. Current theory does not address the more global view of the TNC where subsidiaries act in concert to maximize profits, and therefore can be evaluated in a similar fashion. There is some evidence, however, that specific performance evaluation criteria do vary in importance by country.&copy; 1999 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (1999) 30, 533&ndash;555

Abstract: We comprehensively test the Black, Mendenhall, and Oddou (1991) model of the dimensions and determinants of adjustment to international assignments. We also expand the model to examine two individual factors (i.e., previous assignments and language fluency) and three positional factors (i.e., hierarchical level, functional area, and assignment vector) as moderators of adjustment determinants. Surveys were completed by 452 expatriates from 29 different countries assigned to 45 host countries by large multinational firms. The multi-dimensionality of adjustment was investigated and confirmed. Support for the expanded Black et al. (1991) model was found. Several significant moderating effects emerged, showing different patterns of adjustment for those with different amounts of previous expatriate experience and levels of host country language fluency. Hierarchical level and assignment vector were also important moderators, but the effects for functional area were generally weak.&copy; 1999 JIBS.

Abstract: This study examines the influences on the international standardization of corporate visual identity for a sample of U.K. multinationals. The results suggest that market entry form and equity holding are associated with the degree of corporate visual identity standardization. Further findings show the influence of culture, nationalism and product attributes on corporate visual identity standardization.&copy; 1999 JIBS.

Abstract: In this study, we directly measure culture along two of Hofstede&apos;s (1980) dimensions, individualism-collectivism and power distance, which we argue are potentially more malleable than stable, at least within the developing nation of interest, Indonesia. We compare these direct measures from Indonesia with those from a developed country, the United States, to gauge the degree to which the culture of this emerging economy remains stable despite strong foreign influences. Utilizing English and back-translated Indonesian language versions of the 1994 Values Survey Module, we find statistically significant support for a narrowing of the differences in these two cultural dimensions between Indonesian and U.S. managers compared to earlier findings by Hofstede (1991).&copy; 1999 JIBS.

Abstract: The Nigerian consumer obsession with foreign-made goods has had a detrimental effect on the domestic manufacturing industry. This paper uses conjoint analysis to investigate the importance of a product&apos;s country-of-manufacture relative to other attributes in the Nigerian consumer choice. It was found that the country-of-manufacture is significantly more important than price and other product attributes in consumer preference. Nigerian consumers have a negative image of the &lsquo;Made in Nigeria&rsquo; label, rating it lower than labels from more economically developed countries. Additional analyses indicate that the superior reliability and technological advancement of foreign products are the most important correlates of the Nigerian consumer&apos;s likelihood to purchase foreign products. Implications for foreign marketers, domestic governments and domestic manufacturers are discussed.&copy; 1999 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (1999) 30, 611&ndash;622

Abstract: This paper examines four diaspora communities resident in the United States that were targeted by their homelands as foreign investors during the 1990s. The homelands comprise Armenia, Cuba, Iran, and Palestine. We pose the question: What are the determinants of interest in homeland investment, and can they be generalized across the four communities? The paper explores concepts of ethnic advantage, altruism, homeland orientation, and perceptions of business impediments, as well as investigating the role of demographic factors regarding investment interest.&copy; 1999 JIBS.
