Abstract: This study examines computer-use ethics among nine countries (Singapore, Hong Kong, United States, Great Britain, Australia, Sweden, Wales, and the Netherlands). Based on Paradice [1990], an instrument was developed containing three scales focusing on ethical attitudes toward software license infringement, use of virus programs, and misuse of corporate computing resources. Analysis indicates that there are significant differences in ethical values among nationalities for each of these scales.&copy; 1999 JIBS.

Abstract: This study reports on the construction and psychometric assessment of a measure of export market orientation. Four multi-item scales were developed showing strong evidence of reliability and convergent, discriminant, and nomological validity in samples of U.K. and Dutch exporters. Further analysis revealed full invariance of the final measure across the two country samples. Several suggestions for applying the measure in substantive research are offered.&copy; 1999 JIBS.

Abstract: Existing research fails to distinguish between stable cross-cultural (C/C) competencies (e.g., personality traits) and dynamic ones. Yet, stable competencies may constrain trainability in the dynamic C/C skills that are critical for C/C adjustment. Accordingly, this distinction is drawn using Black &amp; Mendenhall&apos;s [1990] 3-dimensional typology of C/C competencies as a framework. Operationalizations for the C/C competencies are suggested. The practical and theoretical implications for expatriate management are then discussed.&copy; 1999 JIBS.

Abstract: Many studies have examined the impact of leadership behaviors on salespersons&apos; organizational commitment. Unfortunately, little is known about how leadership behaviors impact salespersons&apos; organizational commitment in countries other than the United States. The lack of research is problematic given that many firms today operate globally. This study fills the gap and presents a framework for understanding the role of culture on relationships between leadership behaviors and organizational commitment.&copy; 1999 JIBS.

Abstract: The objective of this study is to determine the effect of culture on the provision of employee benefits. Cultural influences have been investigated from a variety of perspectives, but not in the context of pension and welfare benefits. Using unique data, this study analyzes the level of coverage of employee benefits in the United States. Results indicate that culture does have an effect on the provision of these benefits.&copy; 1999 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (1999) 30, 745&ndash;762

Abstract: International management scholars and practitioners agree that managers cannot simply assume that leadership behaviors effective in one culture can be readily transferred to other cultures. This study examines the relationship of transformational leadership and leader member exchange to organizational justice and job satisfaction in five separate cultures. Results indicate that while there is consistent support for some of the proposed linkages, there are also some interesting differences across cultures. Implications for theory and future research on international business are discussed.&copy; 1999 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (1999) 30, 763&ndash;779

Abstract: Understanding the nature and influences of culture is central to international business. Such inquiry presupposes knowing that the cultural grouping(s) of a study is a valid unit of analysis, which is critical in that the estimation of culture effects can vary based on the unit definition. Unfortunately, perhaps out of convenience, international studies often simply use a country-based definition of culture. In a desire to facilitate further development in understanding culture effects, in this paper, we propose a framework by which valid cultural groupings may be assessed.&copy; 1999 JIBS.

Abstract: This paper discusses the methodological and theoretical significance of intra-cultural variation (ICV)&mdash;the population distribution of a characteristic within a culture. A Monte Carlo study shows that ICV has substantial influence on the statistical power of cross-cultural tests. Therefore, studying ICV is methodologically important if we are to understand inconsistent findings and design cross-cultural studies with enough statistical power.Moreover, an examination of the cultural means and ICVs of 42 cultures shows that ICV is as large as the variation of cultural means across cultures and its relationship to cultural means is not definite. A model based on multiple disciplines is proposed to cast ICV in a nomological net and to illuminate several avenues for future research. Practical implications are also discussed.&copy; 1999 JIBS.

Abstract: This article analyzes the duopolistic competition of Fujifilm and Kodak according to the product life cycle and &ldquo;game theoretic&rdquo; exchange-of-hostage hypothesis of international trade and investment. It shows how each firm used its home-team and first-mover advantages to compete with the other. It shows that Fujifilm&apos;s strategic use of marketing logistics and innovative products reduced Kodak&apos;s market share in Japan and elsewhere. This article has implications for the global competition of multinationals&apos; policies and for market competition and trade policies of the U.S., Japan, and other countries.&copy; 1999 JIBS.

Abstract: Can Dunning&apos;s OLI (Ownership, Location, Internalization) framework be used to predict the best performing international entry modes or merely the most commonly selected modes? Using data from German and Dutch firms investing in Central and Eastern Europe, we investigate the relationship between Dunning&apos;s OLI variables, entry mode selection and managerial satisfaction with firm performance. We found empirical support for Dunning&apos;s framework as both a descriptive and a normative model.&copy; 1999 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (1999) 30, 831&ndash;844

Abstract: We examine managerial work values and subsequent behaviors of Vietnamese managers that foreign investors may face doing business in Vietnam. To establish a global reference-point, we compare the managerial values of Vietnamese managers with those of Chinese and U.S. managers. The findings from this exploratory study, while not always intuitive, should help foreign investors to better understand Vietnam. Furthermore, the study raises important theoretical issues concerning Individualism and Collectivism as cross-cultural measures.&copy; 1999 JIBS.
