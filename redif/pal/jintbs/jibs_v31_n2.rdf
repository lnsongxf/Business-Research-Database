Abstract: In this era of globalization how do we explain the &ldquo;home bias,&rdquo; unexpectedly large distance effects, and lagged adjustment patterns visible in international exchange? In this paper, I argue that in the real world, the identity and reliability of potential exchange partners are seldom the data that most economists take them to be. In fact, firms confront formidable problems of search and deliberation. In these circumstances, firms&apos; social networks can provide a key recourse. Yet, for historical reasons, most firms&apos; social networks still tend to be local or national. And, absent institutional solutions, even in the face of apparent cross-border economic opportunities, firms&apos; responses appear overly sticky and lagged. I explore these arguments in an empirical study that contrasts multinational and domestic firms&apos; trade responses to changes in real exchange rates.&copy; 2000 JIBS.

Abstract: The primary objective of this paper is to demonstrate the usefulness of an artificial intelligence technique known as neural network analysis as an aid to uncovering the underlying patterns, or trace effects, of national culture. To make our case, we provide an application of the technique&apos;s pattern recognition capability utilizing survey data from top executives in French and British firms. We conclude by interpreting the trace effects found and encouraging the use of this tool by cross-cultural researchers in the future.&copy; 2000 JIBS.

Abstract: The determination of entry-modes is examined using an institutional theory framework. Two sources of isomorphic pressures affect a strategic business unit&apos;s (SBU) entry-mode choice: (1) host country institutional environment, and (2) internal institutional environment (the parent organization). SBUs were hypothesized to adopt similar organizational forms, structures, policies, and practices, thus becoming isomorphic, based on felt pressures to conform to behavioral norms within the environments. The results indicated that SBUs using wholly-owned entry-modes demonstrated high levels of internal (parent) isomorphism; those using exporting, joint ventures, or licensing agreements demonstrated external isomorphism; and those using multiple or mixed entry-mode demonstrated low levels of isomorphic pressures.&copy; 2000 JIBS.

Abstract: We examine the determinants of trust in 453 supplier-automaker relationships in the U.S., Japan, and Korea. We define trust and derive a model of its determinants drawing upon (1) an embeddedness (relationship-based) perspective, (2) a process-based perspective, and (3) an economic (hostage-based) perspective. Our findings indicate strong support for the process-based perspective in all countries; embeddedness was only important in Japan, and the economic hostage-based variable (stock ownership) was not important in any country.&copy; 2000 JIBS.

Abstract: As international entrepreneurship gains momentum as a significant and relevant field of research, scholars need to address methodological issues that can facilitate the triangulation of research results. In this paper, we examine the relationship between culture and four personality characteristics commonly associated with entrepreneurial motivation. By demonstrating systematic variation in entrepreneurial characteristics across cultures, we raise important questions about the boundaries of international entrepreneurship research and the challenges of transcending them.&copy; 2000 JIBS.

Abstract: Theory suggests that culture may hinder the ability to effectively standardize the process of relationship development strategies across intra- and inter-cultural relationships. Construct relationships between trust, commitment, conflict and satisfaction in manufacturer-distributor relationships are examined intra- (i.e., within a single cultural type) and inter-culturally (i.e., between different cultural types) with a sample of distributors from Canada, Chile, Mexico and the United States. Results support theoretical differences in the consequences of the trust-commitment relationship between intra-cultural and inter-cultural relationships. The results suggest process standardization based upon cultural type.&copy; 2000 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (2000) 31, 303&ndash;324

Abstract: This paper extends our understanding of the diffusion of technology across firms and nations. The dynamic capabilities perspective in its micro and macro version provides the theoretical framework for an explanation of the international organization of the biotechnology industry. We address two interrelated aspects of the phenomenon of international diffusion: organizational form and geographical flows. An examination of the empirical profile lends support to the dynamic capabilities argument.&copy; 2000 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (2000) 31, 325&ndash;335

Abstract: Rating agencies play a pivotal role in international credit transactions. Their sovereign risk-assessments are largely thought to reflect objective evaluations of the creditworthiness of potential borrowers. We test this assumption by examining the role that competitive positioning and dynamics play in the risk-assessments these agencies provide. Our analyses of agency risk-assessments for emerging-market sovereign borrowers indicate that they are significantly related to agency positioning as an incumbent or insurgent (new entrant), to agency specialization in sovereigns from particular geographic regions, and in some instances, to the level of agency rivalry in a specific sovereign market. Our findings suggest both significant general and contingent links between foreign investment risk-assessment and competitive positioning and rivalry among agencies.&copy; 2000 JIBS.

Abstract: This research improves upon empirical studies that examine the measurement of intellectual property rights (IPR) protection. Prior measures examine only one type of law or lack a component that addresses the actual enforcement of these laws. The measure presented here uses three types of IPR laws and enforcement components for them.&copy; 2000 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (2000) 31, 349&ndash;360
