Abstract: This paper attempts to examine theoretically and empirically the explanatory power of concepts drawn from economic geography for the explanation of the location of TNCs. It combines concepts from economic geography and international business theories in a model that seeks to explain the location of Transnational Corporations (TNCs), and tests the model on financial and professional service FDI to the US. The findings suggest a need to extend the conventional location model of international business by acknowledging the processes taking place among firms located in geographic proximity.&copy; 2000 JIBS.

Abstract: This study examines the motives underlying foreign acquisitions of U.S. firms, estimates the extent of value creation associated with such acquisitions, and examines how total gains are shared between acquiring firms and targets. We show that the synergy hypothesis is the predominant explanation for our sample of foreign acquisitions of U.S. firms. However, the hubris hypothesis coexists with the synergy hypothesis in explaining the acquisitions in our sample that are characterized by positive total gains. The evidence is also consistent with the managerialism hypothesis for the acquisitions in our sample with negative total gains. We show that the incidence of competition is associated with higher total gains, as well as higher gains to targets.&copy; 2000 JIBS.

Abstract: This paper examines intra-industry productivity spillovers from foreign direct investment (FDI) in the UK manufacturing sector. The empirical analysis uses panel data for 48 UK industries over the period 1991 &ndash; 1995. A major contribution is empirical evidence on spillover effects in situations where the host country is developed. The results indicate that the very presence of FDI has a positive spillover impact on the productivity of UK-owned firms. The analysis also shows that the extent to which local firms benefit from the introduction of advanced technology depends largely on their own technological capabilities.&copy; 2000 JIBS.

Abstract: This paper studies strategy related beliefs in five organizations in Hungary with substantial foreign participation. We find that one of the strongest determinants of similarity of beliefs was being a member of the functional area favored by the strategic change. The effect of being in the favored area was greater than the effect of all other individual characteristics, including nationality.&copy; 2000 JIBS.

Abstract: The social dynamics which precede international exchange are considered in light of data collected on 133 foreign market entries from a sample of highly-internationalized manufacturing firms. Consistent with research done in the social network field, the findings support the hypothesis that knowledge of foreign market opportunities is commonly acquired via existing inter-personal links rather than collected systematically via market research. This study thus contributes towards an understanding of those antecedent conditions that lead to the formation of export exchange relationships.&copy; 2000 JIBS.

Abstract: This study investigates the effects of several dimensions of internationalization on the behavior of MNCs&apos; top management teams. The effects include top executives&apos; personal presence in foreign markets, their participation in meetings about international strategic issues, and their tacit knowledge of the firms&apos; international business activities.&copy; 2000 JIBS.

Abstract: We used structured questionnaires and interviews to explore cultural factors affecting adaptation to fluid workgroups and teams in Taiwan and Australia, proxying for Chinese and Anglo-American societies. Consistent with collectivist, high power distance culture, we find members of Taiwanese organizations to have more difficulty adapting to fluid teams with changing membership and leadership. The results have implications for the implementation of flexible organization structures and interaction patterns in different countries.&copy; 2000 JIBS.

Abstract: The Hofstede (1994) dimensions of culture were measured for 586 middle managers in South Africa. A similarity on these dimensions was found between the ethnic groups. Both management culture and perceived management effectiveness were found to be independent of both race and the dimensions of culture. These findings suggest that employee diversity in the workplace should not adversely affect management performance.&copy; 2000 JIBS.

Abstract: In this paper, I test the common assumption that Japanese firms strive to appropriate knowledge from the global scientific community while sharing little in return. I found no support for this conventional perspective in the flat panel display industry. U.S. firms shared no more knowledge with their global scientific community than Japanese firms. Similarly, Japanese firms appropriated no more knowledge from the global community than their U.S. counterparts.&copy; 2000 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (2000) 31, 521&ndash;530
