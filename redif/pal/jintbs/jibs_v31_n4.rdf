Abstract: In this study, we propose and test a hierarchical model of market entry modes. Entry modes can first be viewed as equity-based versus non-equity-based. Within equity-based modes, the choice is between wholly owned operations and equity joint ventures, while within non-equity-based modes, the choice is between contractual agreements and export. Empirically, we demonstrate that there are factors that exert substantial influences at the equity versus non-equity level, but rather weak influences at the lower level of choice hierarchy. The empirical results are based on a sample of over 10,000 foreign entry activities into China between 1979 to 1998. The findings provide supportive evidence for the hierarchical model of market entry modes.&copy; 2000 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (2000) 31, 535&ndash;554

Abstract: This paper empirically analyzes the determinants of the choice between wholly owned subsidiary and technology licensing as a strategy for expansion abroad. We use a new and comprehensive database on worldwide plant level investments in the chemical industry during the 1981 &ndash; 1991 period. We find that both cultural distance and the presence of other potential licensors favor the use of licensing as a strategy for expanding abroad, whereas, prior experience favors the choice of wholly owned subsidiary. An implication of this study is that competition in the market for technology can foster the international diffusion of technology through the use of arm&apos;s length agreements.&copy; 2000 JIBS.

Abstract: This study examines the transfer of local market knowledge within the diversified firm as its divisions expand into a new host country. Within the U.S.-based corporations in our sample, both the nature of local market knowledge itself and differences in organizational structures significantly influence the extent of internal knowledge transfer among divisions. The results suggest that as firms expand into new international markets, their organizational learning processes differ significantly.&copy; 2000 JIBS.

Abstract: Because entrepreneurs mature within a societal context, their attitudes toward cooperation are likely to be influenced by the underlying values of their society. Using a seven-nation sample, we find that entrepreneurs from feminine, collective, and uncertainty-avoiding societies have a greater appreciation for the strategic importance of cooperative strategies than their counterparts. Moreover, entrepreneurs from feminine societies place greater emphasis on partner commonality in terms of objectives and values to ensure cooperative success, whereas those from individualistic societies emphasize contractual safeguards.&copy; 2000 JIBS.

Abstract: Corporate international diversification theory posits that multinational corporations (MNCs) should have lower risk and higher financial leverage than purely domestic corporations (DCs). We suggest an alternative upstream-downstream hypothesis according to which the overall effect of internationalization on the risk and leverage of MNCs is expected to vary with home and target market conditions. The empirical results are consistent with the suggested hypothesis.&copy; 2000 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (2000) 31, 611&ndash;629

Abstract: Using a survey database of Japanese and Korean firms, we compare the styles of two Asian business systems, with a Japanese rather than an American mirror. There are substantial differences in the two country styles. We introduce two sources of convergence, firm size as measured by sales, and globalization as measured by export ratio, and find that both of these factors reduce the difference, with globalization the more significant of the two.&copy; 2000 JIBS.

Abstract: As global corporations pursue a dual strategy of global integration and local responsiveness, it becomes necessary to determine whether some management practices can be applied across borders. Using a sample of 143 employees from nine Nigerian organizations, we found that organizational support contributed to technology usage. However, only employees with low computer training associated support with aspects of technology usage such as daily use, frequency of use, and total application.&copy; 2000 JIBS.

Abstract: We examine cross-national generalization of the relative importance of factors that affect supplier selection and level of usage for global business services providers. Tests indicate that the majority of the response coefficients for a model of foreign exchange markets are equal across the four countries studied &ndash; U.S., Canada, U.K., and Germany. Inter-country differences in buyer response seem most related to competitiveness and identifiable country-specific institutional factors.&copy; 2000 JIBS.

Abstract: This study seeks to assess and rank the relative quality of 30 international business journals using both a citation analysis and a survey approach. Journal rankings are presented using both approaches in addition to a composite ranking. The rankings provide an objective analysis of journal quality for tenure and promotion committees, for IB researchers considering journal submission options and provide the academic community with a better understanding of which international business publication outlets are the most influential in guiding research in this discipline.&copy; 2000 JIBS.

Abstract: Transaction cost theory posits that culture plays a limited role in the choice between JV and WOS. In contrast, research suggests that firms&apos; preferred level of ownership in their foreign subsidiaries is influenced primarily by cultural traits. This study provides additional evidence in this ongoing debate by replicating Hennart&apos;s transaction cost model of entry mode choice in two different national contexts: Japanese firms investing in the U.S. and the U.S. firms investing in Japan. The results suggest that the transaction cost explanation for the ownership choice holds in the both national contexts. Yet, the propensity to choose JV or WOS significantly varied between Japanese and the U.S. firms.&copy; 2000 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (2000) 31, 705&ndash;713

Abstract: This paper examines the economic exposure of German corporations to changes in the DM/US-dollar exchange-rate. Our work contributes to the existing body of literature in the following ways. Firstly, we point out conceptual problems of previous attempts to estimate economic exposure. Secondly, we find that German firms are significantly exposed to changes in the DM/US-dollar rate. However, our results are unstable over time.&copy; 2000 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (2000) 31, 715&ndash;724

Abstract: In this paper we propose that states which attract comparatively more FDI should concentrate on activities designed to draw additional foreign investment rather than on activities designed to promote exports. Results indicate that states with comparatively more FDI have greater success in their use of trade missions for the purpose of inward FDI attraction and in their use of trade shows to promote high-tech exports.&copy; 2000 JIBS.
