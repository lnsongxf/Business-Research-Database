Abstract: This paper focuses on institutional change as the central and most consequential contextual aspect of China&apos;s transition. Identification of key characteristics of China&apos;s emergent institutions leads to propositions on their relevance for international business practice. China&apos;s transition also raises issues for theory development, including the way that transition is modeled, the need to draw upon multiple perspectives, and the concomitants of a contextual approach.&copy; 2001 JIBS.

Abstract: The traditional bargaining model of MNC-host developing country relations has become obsolete. Today, those relations are better understood as the result of a two-tier, multi-party bargaining process. Tier-1 bargaining, between the governments of host and home countries, occurs bilaterally or through multilateral institutions. It produces macro rules on FDI that affect micro negotiations in Tier-2 (per the traditional bargaining model). The extent of FDI liberalization resulting from Tier-1 bargaining varies predictably across home-host country pairs and industries. Suggestions for testing the two-tier bargaining model are also presented.&copy; 2001 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (2001) 32, 23&ndash;39

Abstract: This study compares the control-performance relationship for foreign versus local parents in international joint ventures in China. Transaction cost analysis is found more applicable to foreign than to Chinese parents. Both overall and specific controls are associated with performance for foreign parents, while only specific control is for Chinese parents. Under goal incongruity, Chinese parent control is associated with foreign parent dissatisfaction with venture performance, but not vice-versa. Having a majority stake improves performance from a foreign parent perspective, but not from that of the Chinese parent.&copy; 2001 JIBS.

Abstract: This study investigates the relationship between human resource management (HRM) and the performance of 101 foreign-owned subsidiaries in Russia. The study&apos;s results provide support for the assertion that investments in HRM practices can substantially assist a firm in improving performance. Further, different HRM practices for managerial and non-managerial employees are found to be significantly related to firm performance. Only limited support, however, is obtained for the hypothesized relationship between efforts at aligning HRM practices with firm strategy and subsidiary performance.&copy; 2001 JIBS.

Abstract: This paper explores the impact of indigenous business culture upon the corporate restructuring program initiated in the Thai subsidiary of a Western multinational. Defined in terms of behavioral institutionalization, change implementation was largely resisted by one of two key strategic departments. Using a conceptual framework developed from existing cross-cultural business research we examine the key determinants of local opposition and trace the emergence of &lsquo;crossvergent&rsquo; business practices acceptable to both &lsquo;Thai-market&rsquo; and &lsquo;Western-corporate&rsquo; agendas. Implications for the management of western corporate subsidiaries in the developing economy of Thailand are then discussed.&copy; 2001 JIBS.

Abstract: This study examines the usage and outcomes of organization development (OD) interventions in multinational firms. We test competing hypotheses derived from the cultural and institutional/isomorphic perspectives. Data from firms operating in Hong Kong show that Western firms (U.S. and European) are more receptive to OD interventions than Asian firms (local and Japanese), which supports the cultural explanation. However, the local isomorphism explanation is valid in predicting organizational outcomes that OD interventions have similar effects regardless of a firm&apos;s country origins. Hence, neither perspective alone is sufficient to explain both usage and outcomes. This implies that local adaptation of OD interventions is a complex issue for managing multinational firms.&copy; 2001 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (2001) 32, 95&ndash;114

Abstract: This study applies a resource-based view of the firm to analyze data from a sample of 898 joint-venture firms in China, including both joint ventures established by overseas Chinese and by firms from Western cultures. It is hypothesized that culture could influence the timing of entry of joint ventures, their investment preferences, and performance. ANOVAs and regressions were conducted, and the results suggest the impact of cultural as well as technological resources. This paper concludes with a discussion on the implications of the findings.&copy; 2001 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (2001) 32, 115&ndash;131

Abstract: This study examines the relationship between market valuation and the geographic scope of U.S. multinational corporations&apos; (MNCs) foreign operations by focusing on the importance of the location of MNC operations. The location factors utilized here capture the degree of segmentation/integration between the United States and the foreign regions where the MNC operates. The results indicate that MNCs with presence in countries with developing economies have significantly higher market values than MNCs that operate only in countries with advanced economies. Furthermore, the market value impact of intangible assets increases with the degree of an MNC&apos;s expansion into developing locations only; this result is consistent with the notion that internalizing markets for the cross-border transfer of intangibles leads to competitive advantages.&copy; 2001 JIBS.

Abstract: The study investigates the impact of patriotism, nationalism and internationalism as antecedents to consumer ethnocentrism in Turkey and the Czech Republic. Controlling for demographics, the findings indicate that the impact of patriotism and nationalism is not consistent across the two countries. Consumer ethnocentrism in Turkey is fueled by patriotism, and in the Czech Republic by nationalism. Internationalism does not have a significant effect on consumer ethnocentrism in either country. Managerial implications of these findings are considered and future research directions are identified.&copy; 2001 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (2001) 32, 157&ndash;175

Abstract: Past studies of the relationship between national cultural distance and entry mode choice have produced conflicting results. Some scholars find cultural distance associated with choosing wholly owned modes; others find cultural distance linked to a preference for joint ventures. In this paper we provide both theoretical and empirical evidence to explain the discrepant findings and thus, help to resolve the national cultural distance paradox.&copy; 2001 JIBS.
