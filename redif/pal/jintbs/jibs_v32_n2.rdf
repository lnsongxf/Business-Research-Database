Abstract: Firms have different motives for investing abroad, most notably to exercise existing capabilities, but also to build new capabilities by accessing knowledge located abroad. Recognizing this heterogeneity helps determine whether foreign investments transfer technology to their host industries. Using host industries&apos; initial level of competition to differentiate when each of these dichotomous motives is more likely, I examine change in productivity resulting from inward FDI in US manufacturing industries for 1987 through 1991. While controlling for change in industry competition, I find that relatively uncompetitive industries experience productivity growth while competitive industries experience productivity stagnation from FDI. This differential outcome is consistent with heterogeneous investment motives.&copy; 2001 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (2001) 32, 211&ndash;229

Abstract: This paper uses two theoretical perspectives, information processing and resource dependency, to examine global account management (the co-ordination of activities involved in serving a single customer in multiple countries). It is hypothesized that global account management structures allow the multinational corporation (MNC) to increase its information processing capacity as well as its bargaining power vis-&aacute;-vis the global customer. Using data on 106 global accounts in 16 MNCs, we find support for both perspectives individually. Furthermore, evidence is presented for an interaction effect in which the effectiveness of structures for increasing information processing is conditional upon the presence of high customer dependence.&copy; 2001 JIBS.

Abstract: Although there have been several studies concerning the issue of advertising standardization, few authors have proposed an integrated model of the determinants of advertising standardization Even if the extent of control of Multinational Corporations (MNC) over their subsidiaries is often cited as a key element in the determination of the level of advertising standardization adopted by the MNCs, there is no consistent view concerning the role of this variable. This paper attempts to clarify these points by proposing, at the MNC level, a measurement model and a structural model for the determinants of the degree of advertising standardization. In this model, the mediation effect of the MNC&apos;s degree of control over the subsidiary is tested and validated. In addition, the measurement instruments used for the determinants are confirmed.&copy; 2001 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (2001) 32, 249&ndash;266

Abstract: The international operations of firms have substantial impact on the formulation and implementation of business ethical principles such as codes of conduct. The international sporting goods industry has been a pioneer in setting up codes and thus provides much relevant experience. Different sourcing strategies, degrees of multinationality and national backgrounds affect the contents of codes. Moreover, international (non-governmental) organizations prove equally effective in triggering sophisticated codes.&copy; 2001 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (2001) 32, 267&ndash;283

Abstract: We study the role of three characteristics of international managers&mdash;nationality, cultural distance, and expatriate status, for their network ties. A network analysis of cross-subsidiary interactions among 457 managers in an MNE demonstrates that managers form strong expressive ties with peers with smaller cultural distance and from the same status group. However, managers form strong instrumental ties with peers who are different on these background characteristics. The implications for international management theory and practice are discussed.&copy; 2001 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (2001) 32, 285&ndash;303

Abstract: This study examines the effects of within-country subcultures on business outcomes. We first argue that individuals&apos; values vary across subcultures. We then suggest that values, as expressed through motivational domains, influence business performance. Finally, joining these two propositions, we posit that business performance will vary by subculture. Based on data from four regional subcultures in Brazil, a subculture effect was found for both motivational domains and business performance. The results suggest that it is important to consider the cultural variation within a country when examining business outcomes.&copy; 2001 JIBS.

Abstract: Integrating transaction cost, agency, and resource-based theories, this study extends the work of Peng and Ilinitch (1998) by undertaking the first empirical efforts to explore the determinants of export intermediary performance. We suggest that given the transaction cost constraints and principal-agent conflicts, export intermediaries&apos; performance depends on their possession of valuable, unique, and hard-to-imitate resources which help minimize their clients&apos; transaction and agency costs. Survey results from 166 firms largely support our hypotheses.&copy; 2001 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (2001) 32, 327&ndash;346

Abstract: This note examines isomorphism and diversity in a global industry. We study how the ongoing internationalisation process has affected companies from various regions of the world. Empirical research is focussed on the international computer industry. We find that companies in this sector have become more divergent and that there is little evidence of a process of isomorphism.&copy; 2001 JIBS.

Abstract: The process of change from a centrally planned system to a market economy generates an institutional framework that is only partially reformed, and therefore inconsistent and unstable. This leads to high transaction costs for economic agents. Multinational enterprises entering transition countries have to adapt their strategies to the local institutions and reduce exposure to highly imperfect markets. This paper analyzes how the costs of organizing business in transition environments influence entry mode choice. The empirical results show that host country institutions in transition economies, have an impact on the choice of entry modes. Moreover, different mechanisms determine the internalization of managerial and technological knowledge.&copy; 2001 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (2001) 32, 357&ndash;367

Abstract: Satisfaction with the host culture has been found to influence the expatriate&apos;s commitment to the local operation and to the parent company. This paper investigates the role that the expatriate&apos;s consumer experiences play in the determination of his/her satisfaction with the new culture. Market alienation has a negative effect on satisfaction, but it is reduced by participation in the host marketplace. Further, cultural knowledge was not found to be directly related to satisfaction with the host culture, but rather was related indirectly through its association with participation in the host marketplace.&copy; 2001 JIBS.
