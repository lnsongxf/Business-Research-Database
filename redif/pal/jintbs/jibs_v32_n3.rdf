Abstract: This study examines cooperation-based relations between MNCs and host governments. We theorize that resource commitment, personal relations, political accommodation, and organizational credibility are four building blocks for improving an MNC&apos;s cooperative relationships with governments. Analysis of 131 MNCs in China validates the importance of these blocks in shaping MNC&ndash;government relations and the importance of these relations in shaping the performance of MNC subsidiaries.&copy; 2001 JIBS.

Abstract: We examine whether knowledge spillovers from MNCs&apos; local R&amp;D activities benefit domestic firms in the Indian pharmaceutical industry from 1980-1994. In a policy environment that restricted FDI and provided weak intellectual property protection, we find that the only significant R&amp;D spillovers in the Indian pharmaceutical sector were between MNCs and each other. We explore the implications of our findings in light of India&apos;s economic and industrial policy goals and implementation.&copy; 2001 JIBS.

Abstract: Critics assert that globalization is detrimental to the environment because it encourages location of polluting industries in countries with low environmental regulations. We suggest that globalization might also have positive environmental effects because global ties increase self-regulation pressures on firms in low-regulation countries. Using survey data from firms in China we find that multinational ownership, multinational customers, and exports to developed countries increase self-regulation of environmental performance.&copy; 2001 JIBS.

Abstract: The globalization literature questions national autonomy in a world where MNEs spur increased international flows of capital and trade. This paper empirically tests whether globalization undermines the autonomy of domestic airline competition policy. A comprehensive panel data set, covering twenty-one nations over the 1983-92 period, yields two major findings: (1) globalization undermines domestic airline competition policy autonomy; (2) government institutions mediate globalization&apos;s impact.&copy; 2001 JIBS.

Abstract: Is globalization being derailed by opponents? Results of this event study analysis of the 1997 fast-track denial suggest that investors (1) may have perceived fast-track as a debate on globalization and (2) appear to have expected financial losses to result from the failure to enact fast-track. Regression results further support the event study findings.&copy; 2001 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (2001) 32, 479&ndash;496

Abstract: This manuscript examines when global integration is perceived as being beneficial and/or detrimental to employee careers. Study results demonstrate that employees of more interdependent offices generally perceive greater career benefits from global integration, while employees of more locally embedded offices perceive negative career consequences. Hypotheses are guided by a theory of attention focus.&copy; 2001 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (2001) 32, 497&ndash;507

Abstract: Cultural distance is a widely used construct in international business, where it has been applied to foreign investment expansion, entry mode choice, and the performance of foreign invested affiliates, among others. The present paper presents a critical review of the cultural distance construct, outlining its hidden assumptions and challenging its theoretical and methodological properties. A comprehensive framework for the treatment of the construct is developed and concrete steps aimed at enhancing rigor are delineated.&copy; 2001 JIBS.

Abstract: This study uses a theory of face to identify predictors of interest in entrepreneurship in six East Asian and four Anglo-Saxon countries. At the cultural level, social status of entrepreneurship and shame from business failure predict interest in entrepreneurship better in East Asian than Anglo countries. At the individual level, social status predicts interest in entrepreneurship in the entire sample.&copy; 2001 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (2001) 32, 537&ndash;553

Abstract: We propose a method to design better multi-country samples for international business studies using Hofstede&apos;s framework and aimed at determining the effects of national culture on various business phenomena. We describe typical research scenarios, then develop sets of algorithms that calculate indexes reflecting the power of different samples for hypotheses testing. The indexes were computed from Hofstede&apos;s data, then rank ordered. The top multi-country samples are presented in tables for selection when designing studies.&copy; 2001 JIBS.

Abstract: This paper focuses on the brown-field entry mode, as a special case of acquisition, in which the resources transferred by the investor dominate over those provided by the acquired firm. We see this mode as having particular relevance for entry strategies in emerging markets. The choice of entry mode is analyzed on the basis of a framework utilizing both resource-based and transaction-cost theories. The resource requirements have to be matched with resources available to the investor through an acquired firm, and the decision has to account for the costs of acquiring and integrating the resources.&copy; 2001 JIBS.

Abstract: Global dynamic capabilities is used to integrate resource- and market-based views of the firm to enhance understanding of a firm&apos;s power in international business relationships. Regression is used to model resource- and market-based assets influencing power in international relationships, with a sample of distributors from Canada, Chile, Great Britain, and the Philippines. Results indicate that asset specificity, predictability and market knowledge gap influence a distributor&apos;s power. Implications are presented.&copy; 2001 JIBS.
