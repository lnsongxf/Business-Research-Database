Abstract: We explore how the possibility of remote electronic access to markets, resources and knowledge, enabled by the new information and communication technologies (ICTs), might change the motivations of firms to locate activities internationally, and in turn affect worldwide dispersion and concentration in an industry. Preliminary results from an exploratory analysis of the spatial distribution of firms in financial services suggest that the introduction of a business-to-business (B2B) trading network increases the global market participation of firms from peripheral countries, but does not appear to reduce the importance of locational clusters. A set of propositions is derived that provide guidance for more detailed research on the impact of ICTs on the strategy and structure of global industries.&copy; 2001 JIBS.

Abstract: The issue of how to regulate transactions in cyberspace is central to the future of international electronic commerce. This paper is based on four assumptions: (1) the Internet and e-commerce cannot exist apart from the social order; (2) attempts to regulate and tax activities on the Internet through existing territorial jurisdiction will be problematic; (3) cyberspace and e-commerce are inherently international, thus any successful governance regime will involve significant and substantial international cooperation; and (4) effective governance of cyberspace will require public-private sector cooperation, i.e., hybrid or integrative schemes combining self-regulation with government oversight and enforcement capabilities. The paper discusses the first three of these assumptions, then explores taxation in more detail as a case study that typifies the issues raised by e-commerce in a global context. Next, I develop a framework for understanding the governance of cyberspace as an evolving process involving growing formalization and an increase in the number of actors involved over time. The paper concludes with a discussion of several issues that require further research.&copy; 2001 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (2001) 32, 687&ndash;704

Abstract: A systematic cross-country analysis of e-commerce activity reveals that although physical infrastructure explains much of the variation in basic Internet use, e-commerce activity also depends significantly on a supportive institutional environment. Chief among the characteristics of such an environment are national respect for the &ldquo;rule of law&rdquo; and, secondarily, the availability of credible payment channels such as credit cards. These results suggest that an institutional environment that facilitates the building of transactional integrity is critical to the development of e-commerce.&copy; 2001 JIBS.

Abstract: The prospect of an emerging global Internet consumer entices many internationalizing organizations as it would enable standardization of Internet strategies on a worldwide basis. A sample of advanced Internet users from 20 countries shows differences in beliefs, attitudes, perceptions, and Internet buying behavior depending on user experience, and home country or region. There were important differences after controlling for social, cultural and macro-economic variables. Implications for a regional approach to global e-commerce strategies are discussed.&copy; 2001 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (2001) 32, 725&ndash;748

Abstract: E-commerce has contributed to the retail brokerage industry becoming more global and more contestable. By examining the different stages of the value chain, we can analyze the differential impact of the information and communication technology (ICT) revolution on each segment of the industry. To date, the primary drivers of globalization have been manifested at the &lsquo;wholesale&rsquo; stage of the industry. In contrast, important features of the broker-customer interface have perpetuated a multi-locational competitive structure at the retail stage of the industry. Nevertheless, actual and potential competition has been significantly increased by the spread of e-commerce at all stages of the industry. E-commerce innovations encourage both standardization and variety within an increasingly competitive industry.&copy; 2001 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (2001) 32, 749&ndash;768

Abstract: By providing a nearly instant connection among parties at opposite corners of the world and enabling a variety of commercial exchanges, the Internet emerged as the technology expected to create a truly global market space. Internet firms faced the challenge of capitalizing on this development. In this paper we examine what firm-specific factors are associated with the propensity of pure U.S.-based Internet firms to enhance their international presence on the Internet by developing country-specific websites. Despite the assertion that all Internet firms are born global, our findings show that the pursuit of internationalization by Internet firms is related to the levels of their intangible assets and strategic activity. Two types of intangible assets&mdash;reputation and website traffic&mdash;are positively related to the degree of internationalization; so are the levels of competitive and cooperative activity, and the interaction effects between reputation and competitive and cooperative activity. These findings suggest that ideas from both resource-based theory and research on competitive dynamics can contribute to understanding the internationalization of Internet firms.&copy; 2001 JIBS.

Abstract: This paper examines the impact of operational hedges of US multinational corporations (MNCs) on their exchange rate exposure. The two important contributions of this study are: First, it documents the importance of operational hedges as significant determinants of exchange rate risk, as measured by &ldquo;breadth&rdquo; and &ldquo;depth&rdquo; dimensions of the MNC foreign subsidiary network. Second, this finding remains robust even after examining the impact of operational hedges on exposure separately for negatively and positively exposed MNCs.&copy; 2001 JIBS.

Abstract: Principal-agent problems between corporate parent and subsidiary operations are frequently exacerbated in international settings by exchange rate fluctuations between the foreign subsidiary&apos;s local currency and the parent multinational corporation&apos;s reference currency. We develop a conceptual solution to this international control conundrum using Economic Value Added as the sole performance num&eacute;raire. Our framework facilitates assessment of foreign subsidiary performance in emerging-market countries in the presence of unexpected, exchange-related shocks.&copy; 2001 JIBS.

Abstract: The fall of the Soviet Union brought new enterprise opportunities whose exploitation required the development of entirely new strategies. Simultaneously, enterprises faced crucial constraints in their governance structures. This paper analyzes the impact of governance structures of privatized firms on one key outcome of new strategies: export intensity. Using a longitudinal, multi-industry dataset of privatized firms in Russia, Ukraine and Belarus, we analyze how export intensity is mediated by strategies involving product development, acquisitions and links with foreign partners.&copy; 2001 JIBS.

Abstract: This paper combines the perspective of an international economist with that of an economic geographer to reflect on how and to what extent the Internet will affect the location of economic activity. Even after the very substantial transportation and communication improvements during the 20th Century, most exchanges of physical goods continue to take place within geographically-limited &ldquo;neighborhoods.&rdquo; Previous rounds of infrastructure improvement always have had a double effect, permitting dispersion of certain routine activities but also increasing the complexity and time-dependence of productive activity, and thus making agglomeration more important. We argue that the Internet will produce more of the same: certain forces for deagglomeration, but offsetting and possibly stronger tendencies toward agglomeration. Increasingly the economy is dependent on the transmission of complex uncodifiable messages, which require understating and trust that historically have come from face-to-face contact. This is not likely to be affect by the Internet, which allows long distance &ldquo;conversations&rdquo; but not &ldquo;handshakes.&rdquo;&copy; 2001 JIBS.

Abstract: Export managers from the U.S. and Peru completed a survey designed to measure cooperative decisions during a sequence of three simulated interactions with business partners. During the initial stage of the relationship the decisions of Peruvian export managers reflect less trust than do those of their U.S. counterparts. During the second stage Peruvian exporters respond differently to weak cheating. Results generally are consistent with cultural differences in attitudes toward in-group v. out-group members. However, the influence of cultural differences gradually erodes in favor of personal characteristics and relationship-specific history, suggesting that cultural differences between business partners decline in importance as they get to know each other.&copy; 2001 JIBS.

Abstract: Multinational bank loans have grown in emerging and transition economies in recent years. This paper looks at the determinants of multinational bank (MNB) loans for 72 countries from 1985 to 1998 using data from the Bank for International Settlements and the International Monetary Fund. We find that MNB loans are greater where MNB deposits are larger, where the past presence of MNBs has been larger, where better profit opportunities exist, where current account deficits are larger, where inflows of FDI are larger, and where the currency is more undervalued in real terms.&copy; 2001 JIBS.
