Abstract: This study analyzes how market barriers and firm capabilities affect multinationals&apos; choice of joint ventures versus wholly-owned subsidiaries abroad. In the study, we compile a vector of variables that distinguish between industry-specific barriers and firm-specific capabilities to analyze Japanese investors&apos; ownership decisions in the US. Our results in general support the hypothesis that Japanese investors facing high market barriers in the target industry are more likely to choose joint ventures, while those possessing strong competitive capabilities are more likely to set up wholly-owned subsidiaries. Specifically, marketing variables are more influential than technological factors in determining the choice of partial versus full ownership. These findings, however, vary across sub samples that represent low- versus high-tech industries and consumer versus industrial products.&copy; 2002 JIBS.

Abstract: This paper compares the predictions of transaction cost and institutional theories in an empirical study of the entry mode choice for 1,194 Japanese foreign subsidiaries. The findings indicate the institutional model adds significant explanatory power over and above the predictions of the transaction cost model. Using the concepts of frequency-based, trait-based and outcome-based imitation, I find support for institutional isomorphism, as later entrants tended to follow the entry mode patterns established by earlier entrants. Isomorphic behavior was also present within a firm, as firms exhibited consistency in entry mode choices across time. Further, a firm&apos;s investment experience moderated institutional influences on entry mode choice.&copy; 2002 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (2002) 33, 19&ndash;37

Abstract: This study attempts to explain the timing of entry of firms in international markets. Based on the existing literature, we propose a framework that consists of firm-specific factors, industry/market factors, and host country factors. Empirical results, based on the entry information of U.S. Fortune 500 firms in China between 1979 and 1996, show that larger firms with greater level of internalization and scope economies are likely to enter this foreign market earlier. In addition, non-equity modes, competitors&apos; behavior in the product market, and lower levels of country risk are significantly associated with early entry.&copy; 2002 JIBS.

Abstract: Just as the competitive activities of MNC subsidiaries exhibit differentiation as well as integration, so might MNC political activities. This paper combines the literatures on international business-government interactions and on multinational corporations, with resource dependence theory as a foundation. We develop and test hypotheses on factors that might influence the degree to which subsidiary political activities are integrated with affiliated organizations. We find that subsidiary strategic integration and the economic integration of the host country significantly influence integration of subsidiary political activities.&copy; 2002 JIBS.

Abstract: Researchers in international business have long been interested in understanding the relationship between the multinationality of a firm and its market performance. This article contributes to this research stream by incorporating firm heterogeneity in examining the multinationality-performance relationship. The findings, based on a time series cross-sectional analysis of firms from 12 different industries over a seven-year period, indicate that the impact of multinationality on both financial and operational performance is moderated by firm&apos;s R&amp;D and marketing capabilities.&copy; 2002 JIBS.

Abstract: Why does knowing the nationality of the company help predict its financial leverage? Differences in institutional backgrounds provide only a partial answer to this question. This study suggests that national culture affects corporate capital structures. Empirical hypotheses, drawn from financial models and cross-cultural psychology, are tested against a sample of 5591 firms across 22 countries. Results show that countries with high scores on the cultural dimensions of &ldquo;conservatism&rdquo; and &ldquo;mastery&rdquo; tend to have lower corporate debt ratios. The effects are strong and remain significant even after accounting for differences in economic performance, legal systems, financial institutions, and some other well-known determinants of debt ratios.&copy; 2002 JIBS.

Abstract: The literature provides conflicting evidence on the relation between corporate international activity and the cost and level of debt financing. Based on this evidence, we explore the impact of firm internationalization on debt financing. Using a market based sample of U.S. firms, we find significant evidence of a non monotonic relation between firm international activity and both the cost and level of debt financing. Specifically, we find that, contrary to prior research, firm international activity is, on average, associated with a 13% reduction in the cost of debt financing and a 30% increase in firm leverage.&copy; 2002 JIBS.

Abstract: This study was particularly designed to respond to Jaffe and Nebenzahl&apos;s (1984) suggestion to test whether and how entity-based and attribute-based semantic differential scaling formats could predict purchasing behavior within a country-of-origin setting. The study includes recent research on survey context effects in order to explain and extend our analysis, and uses attitude consistency theory as a conceptual framework. A comparison of the fit statistics between the two scaling formats on each entity (country) indicates that the attribute based format estimates a higher attitude response consistency and predictive validity by giving better predictors of global country image (evaluation) and buying frequency of products from the different countries investigated. This study uses data collected from a probability sample of industrial buyers within the seafood industry.&copy; 2002 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (2002) 33, 149&ndash;167

Abstract: This study distinguishes between personal and structural attachments and examines how these two types of attachments stimulate exchange in IJVs. Analysis of archival and survey data from 255 IJVs in China suggests that both personal and structural attachments contribute to IJV performance, but the rates of contribution of these attachments to IJV profitability diminish as the attachments increase. Moreover, personal and structural attachments strengthen each other in their respective influences on IJV performance.&copy; 2002 JIBS.

Abstract: This paper argues that the nature and extent of the benefits that FDI confers on host economies depends in part on the degree of autonomy enjoyed by subsidiary management. Survey evidence of multinational subsidiaries in Malaysia indicates that the autonomy conferred on local management is limited. Even where subsidiary management categorise their organisations as &ldquo;decentralised&rdquo;, their autonomy is limited to local operational matters. In general, the more integrated the subsidiaries in the global activities of the parent, the less their autonomy, which implies limits to their contribution to the Malaysian economy.&copy; 2002 JIBS.
