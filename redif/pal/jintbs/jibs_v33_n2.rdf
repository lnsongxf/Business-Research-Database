Abstract: In this study, we examine foreign market entry mode choice and firm performance for a sample of European Union firms. Examining both financial and non-financial performance measures, we attempt to determine if firms that select their entry mode based on transaction cost, institutional context, and cultural context variables perform better than firms that make other mode choices. We found that mode choice did matter. Firms whose mode choice could be predicted by the extended transaction cost model performed significantly better, on both financial and non-financial measures, than did firms whose mode choice could not be predicted by the extended transaction cost model. Implications for future research are discussed.&copy; 2002 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (2002) 33, 203&ndash;221

Abstract: Many studies have examined the choice between different types of equity and non-equity modes; however, none has focused on the choice between different types of non-equity modes that service firms employ routinely. This study develops a theoretical framework based on the &ldquo;organizational capability&rdquo; perspective to explain the choice between two non-equity modes&mdash; franchising and management-service contracts. While previous studies are based on the premise that foreign market entrants choose a mode&mdash;equity or non-equity&mdash;that offers them most control given their particular circumstances, the premise of this study is that foreign entrants choose a non-equity mode that, in addition, offers effective transfer of the firm&apos;s capabilities to the host-country venture.&copy; 2002 JIBS.

Abstract: This study examines the effect of dimensions of national and organizational culture differences on international joint venture (IJV) performance. Based on data from a survey of executives from joint ventures between Indian partners and partners from other countries, we found that the presumed negative effect from culture distance on IJV performance originates more from differences in organizational culture than from differences in national culture.&copy; 2002 JIBS.

Abstract: Partner identification is an important and under-studied precursor to selection and eventual performance of international joint ventures (IJVs). The mechanics of the identification process were investigated in-depth across a sample of eighteen Sino-Hong Kong IJVs using the case study research method. The cross-case findings of this exploratory investigation support the idea that social networks provide a valuable resource for reducing IJV partner search costs. Specifically, the findings reveal that while weakly-linked bridge ties are valuable in identifying potential partners, searches based on strong ties tend to be shorter and provide a more robust basis for inter-partner cooperation.&copy; 2002 JIBS.

Abstract: This study examines the impact of corruption on foreign direct investment (FDI). First, the level of corruption in the host country is analyzed. Second, the absolute difference in the corruption level between the host and home country is examined. The analysis provides support for the negative impacts of both. The results suggest that foreign investors generally avoid corruption because it is considered wrong and it can create operational inefficiencies.&copy; 2002 JIBS.

Abstract: This article reports the results of a field study that evaluated behavioral responses to low job satisfaction of participants in Hong Kong and New Zealand. Culture, measured by vertical and horizontal individualism and collectivism, had both main and moderating effects on responses. First, cultural groups responded differently to low job satisfaction with exit, voice, loyalty, or neglect. Second, culture moderated the effect of quality of job alternatives and job satisfaction on exit and loyalty, and moderated the effect of quality of job alternatives on voice.&copy; 2002 JIBS.

Abstract: This paper provides empirical evidence from France on the role of export intermediary firms. Using data from 20,000 French firms, this paper tests two of the five transaction cost-based propositions on the role of export intermediaries by Peng and Ilinitch (1998). While the empirical evidence only partially supports their first proposition on distance and familiarity, their second proposition on product complexity is corroborated.&copy; 2002 JIBS.

Abstract: This paper presents evidence that international animosity and consumer ethnocentrism are distinct constructs that play different roles depending on the set of products available to consumers. Results show that animosity toward a foreign nation is related to choices between foreign goods, while consumer ethnocentrism is related to choices between domestic and foreign goods. Further, the study finds animosity effects even though anger levels are generally low, thus extending the boundaries of the animosity model of foreign purchase. The study focuses on U.S. consumer views of Japan and Japanese products. Implications for decisions concerning global versus local branding strategies are discussed.&copy; 2002 JIBS.

Abstract: This research note challenges international business researchers to think of their future work in terms of the past achievements of their discipline. It identifies three key research areas corresponding to attempts to tackle crucial empirical questions: the explanation of foreign direct investment, the multinational firm and the globalization of business. It ends by considering the future research agenda.&copy; 2002 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (2002) 33, 365&ndash;373

Abstract: This study examines the impact of four source country factors on the equity ownership in international joint ventures (IJVs). These factors are exchange rate, cost of borrowing, export capability, and management orientation. Based on a sample of 8,078 IJVs in China, this study shows that equity ownership tends to be higher for parent firms from a source country with strong currency, low cost of borrowing, strong export capability, and high uncertainty avoidance.&copy; 2002 JIBS.

Abstract: Nations differ in national means as well as intra-cultural variations (ICVs) of particular cognitions and behaviors. Au (1999) argued that means and ICVs have distinctive impacts on organizational phenomena cross-nationally. We tested whether this holds true for the individual-level relationship between intrinsic job rewards and job satisfaction. Multilevel analyses of data from 130,000 employees covering 46 countries suggest that national means and ICVs complement each other&apos;s impact on international business life.&copy; 2002 JIBS.
