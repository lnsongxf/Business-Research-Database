Abstract: This study examined several hypotheses regarding the location choice of foreign direct investment from newly industrialized economies (NIEs). Using a sample of 328 Taiwanese firms in the analysis, this study found that the firms&apos; motivations had a significant impact on the choice of their investment location (developed countries vs. less developed countries), yet this impact was moderated by the capabilities that the firms possessed. The results suggest that both asset-exploitation and asset-seeking aspects of investments are predictive of the NIE firms&apos; location choice of investment.&copy; 2002 JIBS.

Abstract: International cooperative ventures (ICVs) are known to be strongly influenced by the parent firms&apos; values, practices, and systems (VPSs). However, less clear is whether and why VPSs actually adopted by an ICV are those of either parent singly, both parents jointly, or neither parent. This question is especially timely in the transition economies of Central and Eastern Europe, where cooperative activity with Western multinationals is growing rapidly, and where decades-old legacies of communism abound. In this exploratory study, we used a multiple case study methodology to examine 17 Hungarian-Western ICVs. Results show that a majority of the ICVs adopted the VPSs of the Western partner. We develop a theoretical model of integration process and outcomes, and suggest future research directions.&copy; 2002 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (2002) 33, 423&ndash;455

Abstract: We use an infinitely repeated prisoner&apos;s dilemma model to examine the role of inter-partner credible threat in international joint ventures (IJVs). Inter-partner credible threat refers to the certainty of either partner&apos;s retaliation given the other partner&apos;s earlier cheating. We argue that inter-partner credible threat represents the first order determinant and partners&apos; management control represents the second order determinant of partner payoffs. When inter-partner credible threat is present, both partners achieve balanced payoffs whereas when it is absent, partners&apos; relative control will determine their relative payoffs. In-depth interview data from four IJVs in China provide preliminary support for our theoretical arguments.&copy; 2002 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (2002) 33, 457&ndash;478

Abstract: This article examines issues of level in the study of joint venture trust. In particular, we explain how international joint venture (IJV) trust can be conceptualized and measured at the person, group, and firm levels. To do this, we (1) provide a definition of IJV trust applicable to persons, groups, and firms, (2) promote alignment of levels of theory and measurement through the use of a 3&times;3 approach to guide researchers in identifying the level at which they are theorizing and the proper level of measurement, and (3) propose operational measures of IJV trust across levels and dimensions in order to lay a solid foundation for theory testing.&copy; 2002 JIBS.

Abstract: The paper compares the extent and content of businesses&apos; communications about corporate social responsibility (CSR) in France, the Netherlands, the U.K., and the U.S. In particular, the study investigates the nature of CSR principles, processes, and stakeholder issues discussed in web pages. The results show that businesses in the four countries do not display the same eagerness to appear as socially responsible and employ diverse means to convey social responsibility images.&copy; 2002 JIBS.

Abstract: We develop a reconceptualization and operationalization of psychic distance that broadens the concept. We then empirically test this operationalization and investigate the relationship between psychic distance and organizational performance. Our results suggest that psychic distance, as a summary construct, explains a significant proportion of the variance in financial performance and strategic effectiveness. However, disaggregation of the construct substantially increases its explanatory power. The results also support a psychic distance paradox, where psychic distance has a positive relationship with organizational performance.&copy; 2002 JIBS.

Abstract: This paper examines the effects of institutional forces on change schemas of senior managers, mid-level managers and front-line workers of different types of firms in China. We postulate that several socio-economic forces including regional economic prosperity, firm type (state-owned and foreign-invested), within-firm ranks, and organizational cultures are at work. The cognitive differences among people in local and foreign firms operating in similar contexts are examined. Through a survey of 3,960 managers and workers we test hypotheses that relate various institutional forces on how individuals perceive, evaluate and infer future changes that challenge them. We also examine the effects of individual change schema on firm commitment and job satisfaction, two indicators that may mediate future changes in these firms.&copy; 2002 JIBS.

Abstract: Based on the upper echelons theory, this study of 126 CEO successions and 271 foreign market entry events examines the relationships between successor CEO characteristics and choice of entry mode. Results indicate that CEO position tenure, throughput functional background, and international experience are associated with full-control entry modes. Additionally, these relationships were observed in the subgroup of high-performing firms but not in the low-performing subgroup.&copy; 2002 JIBS.

Abstract: We summarize the major findings of the sixth global survey of business school internationalization sponsored by the Academy of International Business (AIB). The survey covers various aspects of internationalization including: objectives, organizational issues, curriculum and faculty internationalization, foreign institutional arrangements, and satisfaction with progress achieved. The empirical results indicate that, across all dimensions, significant progress continued to be made in the internationalization of business schools.&copy; 2002 JIBS.

Abstract: As business becomes more international, have academic journals, particularly management journals, followed suit? In this paper we examine the amount and type of international research in 19 top management journals from 1976 to 1980 and again from 1996 to 2000. International business studies are classified as multinational enterprise (MNE) research and comparative research. Although the amount and type of international content varies by journal, it appears that many management journals are increasing their international content while others are not.&copy; 2002 JIBS.

Abstract: We analyze the nature of international competition among multinational firms in the tire industry. Using the frameworks of the theories of oligopolistic reaction and foreign direct investment, we find that the firms&apos; investment patterns are related to the number and identities of competitors, host country characteristics, and foreign experience. Global tire companies from several nations demonstrate oligopolistic reaction behavior.&copy; 2002 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (2002) 33, 593&ndash;602

Abstract: This paper presents a transaction costs analysis of the firm size and export intensity relationship. We submit that relation-specific investments and the costs of safeguarding these investments play a significant role in export relationships. Firm size related differences with respect to these factors are used to explain the different relationships between firm size and export intensity that have been found in previous studies. The theoretical framework is tested empirically, and support is found for different industries.&copy; 2002 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (2002) 33, 603&ndash;613

Abstract: This paper extends the study of market orientation into the international arena by developing and testing hypotheses relating to the antecedents to and consequences of market-oriented activities in firms&apos; export operations. Export experience, export dependence and coordinating capabilities were found to be positively related to export market-oriented activities. In turn, export market-oriented activities were positively associated with aspects of export performance.&copy; 2002 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (2002) 33, 615&ndash;626
