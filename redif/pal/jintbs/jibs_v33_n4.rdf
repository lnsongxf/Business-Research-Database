Abstract: Using detailed cross-section data for 1995, non-Chinese MNEs are found to generate technological and international market access spillover benefits for Chinese firms, while overseas Chinese investors confer only market access benefits. State-owned enterprises reap no benefits, and indeed receive negative spillovers from overseas investors, in marked contrast to the positive spillovers gained by collectively-owned firms. These findings underline the importance of reform in state-owned enterprises to raise the absorptive capacity of the Chinese domestically-owned sector.&copy; 2002 JIBS.

Abstract: Does following a product strategy of price leadership result in superior performance satisfaction for Chinese exporters? Does branding products and targeting less developed countries significantly improve Chinese exporters&apos; satisfaction with export performance? Results indicate performance satisfaction decreased when Chinese firms pursued price leadership product strategies. While performance satisfaction increased when Chinese exporters used a branding product strategy, branding products and targeting other less developed countries with these brands significantly increased performance satisfaction over branding alone.&copy; 2002 JIBS.

Abstract: The emergence of the Internet has created a dynamic electronic marketplace, where a new species of e-commerce corporations are taking root. However, the factors affecting the growth of these e-commerce corporations is a relatively unexplored area in international business. This study contributes to the international business literature in two significant ways. First, it attempts to critically evaluate the major international business theories to identify the variables affecting the growth of e-commerce corporations. Second, the proposed framework in the study extends the explanatory power of the eclectic paradigm not only by interpreting the paradigm in the context of e-business, but also by including an element of network-based advantages to the OLI-configuration.&copy; 2002 JIBS.

Abstract: In this paper we test whether national cross cultural differences between joint venture (JV) parents affect JV longevity by comparing that of two categories of JVs placed in the same environment, those between two or more Japanese parents on one hand, and those between Japanese and American parents, on the other. Carefully controlling for other factors that may affect JV longevity, we find that the longevity of Japanese-American JVs is lower than that of Japanese-Japanese JVs. Such effects, however, appear only for dissolutions that result from the sale of the venture to one of the partners, not for those due to liquidation or sale to a third party.&copy; 2002 JIBS.

Abstract: Most studies of Japanese supplier-automaker relationships have focused on the nature of the dyadic interfirm relationship and the performance of the assembler. We examine the relationship from the point of view of the supplier and argue that a broad &ldquo;customer scope strategy&rdquo; (i.e., number of customers) leads to superior performance, primarily because of learning opportunities. In addressing these learning opportunities, we draw attention to the important distinction between relation-specific and re-deployable knowledge and the complementary relationship between them. Our analysis of 125 Japanese suppliers supports the key argument that less exclusive ties may be a superior strategy. The argument has important implications for vertical integration and the structure of buyer-supplier relations.&copy; 2002 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (2002) 33, 717&ndash;736

Abstract: A model is developed to explain the effect of national context on risk-related decisions. An essential feature of risk-related decisions is substantial uncertainty, or inadequate information, as well as significant consequences regarding future outcomes. We argue that differences in information flows and consequences across national institutional environments affect the perceived uncertainty of decision situations. For this reason, the institutional environment in which managers reside should play a fundamental and systematic role in influencing their perceptions of risk. We test our model on managers from two environments that contrast in terms of information and consequences related to risk, a free-market economy (the U.S.) and a centrally planned economy (the Czech Republic in 1992). Our results indicate that the institutional environment does indeed play a strong and systematic role in explaining managers&apos; risk-related decisions. Thus, national environment appears to be an important contextual condition to which the propensity to take risks is sensitive.&copy; 2002 JIBS.

Abstract: Much of the recent literature on interorganizational relations provides evidence that relationship commitment can produce significant benefits for firms. Somewhat surprisingly, limited attention has been devoted to the role that commitment plays in international buyer-seller associations. Merging findings from the international business and transaction cost economics literature, we propose and test a model that explains how commitment develops and its impact on performance in cross-cultural interorganizational relations. A sample of 216 overseas distributor&ndash;manufacturer relationships provides the empirical setting for this research. The findings suggest that transaction specific investments by the importer and exporter opportunism affect importer commitment, and that environmental volatility and cultural sensitivity are indirectly associated with commitment through opportunism. Most important, the study reveals that an importer&apos;s commitment has a positive impact on its performance in the relationship. However, no relationship is established between environmental volatility and commitment. The implications of the study are discussed, along with limitations and directions for future research.&copy; 2002 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (2002) 33, 757&ndash;783

Abstract: Goals-in-use of successful businesspersons were rated by over 1,800 junior managers and professionals, attending evening MBA courses at local universities in 15 countries. A hierarchical cluster analysis of perceived goals divided the countries into seven clusters. The relative ordering of goals within these clusters suggested seven different archetypal business leader roles. Perceptions correlated significantly with national wealth, as well as with dimensions of national culture.&copy; 2002 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (2002) 33, 785&ndash;803

Abstract: Nine foreign banks own the ten largest U.S. affiliates or subsidiaries of foreign banks. These account for 86% of the assets in affiliates and subsidiaries. Their histories suggest that most now represent an attempt by the parents to grow outside the confines of home markets. Original motives for their establishment have included ethnic banking and operational stability stemming from geographical dispersion. There is one major instance of acquiring capabilities, but it does not involve retail banking. The dispersal of national origins suggests that bank-specific capabilities are the primary source of the parents&apos; competitive advantage. Being from English speaking countries also appears to help. Lastly, the growth of the affiliates and subsidiaries has not come from incremental growth but rather from a rearrangement of assets among banks.&copy; 2002 JIBS.
