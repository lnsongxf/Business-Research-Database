Abstract: This article reviews the main antecedents to Buckley and Casson&apos;s seminal volume The Future of the Multinational Enterprise (1976). In particular it considers and evaluates two main approaches to understanding the nature and function of firms viz the exchange approach and the value-added approach.

Abstract: This paper examines the reasons for the impact of Buckley and Casson&apos;s The Future of the Multinational Enterprise (1976) on research in international business (IB). Earlier work concentrated on ownership-specific advantages or locational determinants rather than the central concept of internalization. The few exceptions were incomplete or not well known. Internalization as applied to the MNE spread rapidly because of the appeal to IB researchers of an analytically powerful idea that was based on institutional economics and involved an accessible methodology. The spread was also helped by the parallel growth of transaction costs in the domestic theory of the firm, and the publication activity of the authors and their associates.

Abstract: This paper assesses the continued relevance of Buckley and Casson&apos;s (1976) book on The Future of the Multinational Enterprise (MNE), against a background of increasing criticism of transaction-cost-related scholarly work. We demonstrate that the &lsquo;schism&rsquo; that can currently be observed in the field between international business and international management is misguided, as the transaction cost/internalization school may offer useful insights to both management scholars and managers. For this to occur, however, it is necessary first to extend the empirical scope of transaction-cost-based reasoning to include the functioning of differentiated network MNEs. The paper suggests that Buckley and Casson&apos;s book still represents a beacon of clarity and a superb starting point for the study of the MNE, even if the complexity of this governance structure has grown far beyond what any international business scholar or even international management scholar could have predicted 25 years ago.

Abstract: If markets were either completely isolated by or integrated across borders, there would be little room for international business strategy to have content distinctive from &lsquo;mainstream&rsquo; strategy. But a review of the economic evidence about the international integration of markets indicates that we fall in between these extremes, into a state of incomplete cross-border integration that I refer to as semiglobalization. More specifically, most measures of market integration have scaled new heights in the last few decades, but still fall far short of economic theory&apos;s ideal of perfect integration. The diagnosis of semiglobalization does more than just supply a relatively stable frame of reference for thinking about the environment of cross-border operations. It also calls attention to the critical role of location-specificity in the prospects of distinctive content for international business strategy relative to mainstream business and corporate strategy. In addition, it flags factors/products subject to location-specificity as being salient from the perspective of international business. Finally, it highlights the scope for strategies that strive to capitalize on the (large) residual barriers to cross-border integration, as well as those that simply try to cope with them.

Abstract: In this study we present evidence that geographic diversification increases shareholder value and improves long-term performance when firms engage in core-related foreign direct (greenfield) investments. Non-core-related foreign investments are found to be associated with both short-term and long-term losses. Our results suggest that the synergy gains stemming from the internalization of markets are rooted in the core business of the firm. Geographic diversification outside the core business of the firm bears strongly against the prediction of the internalization hypothesis. The analysis also shows that, regardless of the industrial structure of the firm (that is, number of segments), foreign direct investments outside the core business of the firm are associated with a loss in shareholder value, whereas core-related (focused) foreign direct investments are found to be value increasing. Unrelated international diversification, however, is less harmful for diversified (multi-segment) than specialized (single-segment) firms. The larger gains to diversified firms suggest that operational and internal capital market efficiency gains are considerably greater in multi-segment than single-segment firms when both expand their core business overseas.

Abstract: Recent patterns of rapid internationalization in sectors characterized by strong public interest and both government and domestic capital constraints seem, at first, inconsistent with the drivers of internationalization identified by Buckley and Casson (1976) for manufacturing industries in the postwar era. A more microanalytic perspective, however, identifies the ability to manage institutional idiosyncrasies as a firm-level capability akin to research or advertising that can drive internalization across national borders and thereby internationalization. These arguments are examined using evidence from the independent power production sector. Journal of International Business Studies (2003) 34, 173&ndash;184. doi:10.1057/palgrave.jibs.8400015

Abstract: The evolution of foreign entry in the form of joint ventures and wholly owned manufacturing operations is examined as a staged process shaped by experience and imitation dynamics at the firm, group, and industry levels of analysis. The expansion of South Korean firms into China between 1987 and 1995 lends support to the staged view of foreign entry. Over time, technology-intensive firms are more likely to abandon joint-venture entry modes, owing to contractual hazards. Firms in the same business group are found to imitate each other&apos;s choice of joint ventures and wholly owned plants. Firms in the same industry mimic each other&apos;s choice of wholly owned plants, though not of joint ventures.

Abstract: Although several studies have shown that inward foreign direct investment (FDI) often leads to greater host country productivity, researchers have yet to determine the relative importance of direct technology transfer and competitive pressure. To assess the relative importance of the two channels, we examine the US auto-component industry between 1979 and 1991. During this period, Japanese automobile assemblers began to produce vehicles in North America, and began to purchase inputs from US auto-component manufacturers. Those US manufacturers that sold components to Japanese transplants would be the direct recipients of any technologies transferred from the Japanese. Although we find that the direct investment by Japanese assemblers was associated with overall productivity improvement in the US auto-component industry, we find little evidence of direct technology transfer. The productivity growth of US suppliers affiliated with Japanese assemblers was no greater than that of other, non-affiliated US suppliers. Further, we find that the Japanese assemblers tended to purchase components from less productive US suppliers and, moreover, that low-productivity suppliers that sold goods to Japanese assemblers had a higher survival rate than low-productivity suppliers that did not sell to Japanese firms. The results suggest that increased competitive pressure in the auto-sector was the main cause of overall productivity improvement, at least during the initial stages of FDI of the 1980s.
