Abstract: This paper seeks to provide a rationale for changing trends in the flow and determinants of foreign direct investment (FDI) as a result of macro-economic and firm strategy considerations. We identify several factors that impact on such trends, and develop propositions that could explain the phenomenon generically. The study then provides preliminary empirical support for the propositions presented, and outlines the path for further research needed to investigate more causal links. The statistical analysis of investments by US multinational enterprises (MNEs) reveals significant changes in the regional distribution of FDI, and a change in some of its traditional determinants. Results show that US MNEs are now making increasing investments into Asia to exploit low wage levels and to secure entry into new markets.

Abstract: The way that multinational businesses in integrated global industries coordinate and control R&amp;D, manufacturing, and marketing functions across borders has significant implications for performance. We propose that, in such global industries, certain integrating modes will be more effective than others in integrating a function globally. We show that each function has a different combination of effective integrating modes. For global R&amp;D integration, people-based and information-based modes are more effective than formalization-based and centralization-based modes. For manufacturing, people, information, and formalization are more effective than centralization. With respect to marketing, information and centralization are more effective than people and formalization. We also demonstrate that the co-alignment between actual and ideal profiles (configurations or patterns) of integrating modes results in superior performance. Our results reveal that people-based and information-based modes are generally more effective than formalization-based and centralization-based modes in coordinating and controlling business functions worldwide.

Abstract: International diversification is a growth strategy that has a major potential impact on firm performance. The relationship between international diversification and firm performance has been extensively studied in the international strategy literature. A major gap in the literature has been the non-existence of studies that have examined the effect of international diversification on performance in service firms. Previous studies that have tested the international diversification&ndash;performance relationship were based on samples of manufacturing firms. We argue that the form of the relationship between multinationality and performance is different in service firms. We provide a theoretical argument for this claim and hypothesize that there is a U-shaped curvilinear relationship between multinationality and performance in service firms. Our sample consists of 81 major German service firms, spanning across four industries. Results show that there is support for a U-shaped curvilinear relationship. Based on the findings, implications and directions for future research are provided. Journal of International Business Studies (2003) 34, 345&ndash;355. doi:10.1057/palgrave.jibs.8400036

Abstract: This study updates and extends research on foreign entry modes by examining the impacts of knowledge transfer capacity and knowledge tacitness. Research on international corporate expansion has long emphasized that deploying intangible knowledge-based assets is required for successful international expansion. More recently, research from a &lsquo;knowledge-based&rsquo; perspective has addressed the role of tacitness in constraining a firm&apos;s ability to transfer knowledge internationally. We combine these perspectives to describe how knowledge tacitness affects the relative suitability of four archetypal entry modes: exporting, licensing, establishing an alliance, and wholly owned entry. We then examine and develop conceptually a seldom-studied firm characteristic, knowledge transfer capacity. We offer predictions that describe the combined effects of knowledge tacitness and transfer capacity on entry mode choice. We distinguish between the transfer capacity of the organization that develops knowledge (source transfer capacity) and that of the organization that seeks to access that knowledge (recipient transfer capacity). The discussion addresses how our model generalizes to knowledge-seeking strategies and to the study of ongoing multinational networks. The study enriches and reconciles multiple theoretical perspectives on entry strategy. It brings together the study of knowledge characteristics and firm heterogeneity in the theory of the multinational corporation, and in international and strategic management more generally.

Abstract: This paper examines two important research questions: (1) To what extent have recent economic and regulatory changes influenced the Japanese inter-corporate network? (2) Have the patterns of firm performance fostered by the Japanese inter-corporate system remained stable, or has there been an evolution to more &lsquo;North American&rsquo; performance profiles? Using hierarchical regressions to compare patterns of networking and firm performance with data from the periods 1987 to 1991 and 1992 to 1997, we find little evidence to support the existence of significant changes in the patterns and implications of Japanese industrial organization. We conclude that the keiretsu system remained strongly in place throughout the first half of the 1990s. Nevertheless, we suggest that the continued move toward globalization of capital markets in Japan and ongoing regulatory change may potentially impact networking and performance implications in the 21st century.

Abstract: Drawing from concepts of cultural distance and cultural propensity to change, we predict the convergence, divergence or crossvergence of distributive justice values in China and Russia, as compared with US managers. Using institutional theory, we predict responses by organizational type (joint ventures/foreign-owned vs state-owned enterprises (SOEs)). Lastly, we develop predictions based on the interaction of culture and organizational type. Results indicate divergence in China, regardless of organizational type. In contrast, differences by organizational type were observed among Russian managers, with convergence among managers in joint ventures, but continuing divergence among managers in SOEs. Implications for theory are discussed. Journal of International Business Studies (2003), 34, 389&ndash;406. doi:10.1057/palgrave.jibs.8400040
