Abstract: This paper argues that structural characteristics of knowledge-diffusion networks, such as density levels, centralization levels, and the presence of global knowledge brokers, contribute to the emergence of dominant designs and the competitiveness of countries&apos; firms and industries. It further suggests that national institutional structures and firm-specific attributes influence the development of these knowledge-diffusion networks. Six propositions, developed from examination of one industry&apos;s networks and previous scholarly literature, specify these arguments.

Abstract: Globalization is the outcome of the interface between national states and MNEs. It is a negotiated solution rather than perfect market equilibrium. Even in a global liberalized world, national states are trying to generate as much welfare for their residents as they can, while MNEs try to maximize their value. This creates a bargaining situation. A stylized game theory model is presented and discussed, in order to gain insights into the income distributional effects of the globalization process. Two important features of the model are: (a) that there is a need for a carefully spelt out strategy, and (b) that optimal solutions depend on an ability to identify the elements of the bargaining where the opportunity cost is low. A case study of the negotiation between the State of Israel and Intel is presented as an illustration for this general model.

Abstract: We seek to examine the importance of environmental factors in determining MNE subsidiary roles. In particular, we examine the environmental factors associated with &lsquo;deep&rsquo; integration schemes such as the EU. Such schemes require a convergence of economic structure, due to the establishment of common regional institutions, regulations and policies. Specifically, we distinguish between the scope of activities performed by subsidiaries, and the level of competence of those subsidiaries. The empirical analysis is based on a large-scale survey of foreign-owned units in Denmark, Finland and Norway. These Nordic countries differ with regard to their EU-membership status &ndash; Norway being the &lsquo;outsider&rsquo;, while the others are members &ndash; but are very similar to each other in most other respects. Our data show that subsidiaries in Norway report significantly lower scores for both scope of activities and levels of competence. The effects remain strong even when we are controlling for other potentially influential factors. The findings indicate that being on the &lsquo;outside&rsquo; of the EU may indeed carry the price of becoming less attractive to MNE activity.

Abstract: Stock price responses to 170 announcements about global product design and development (GPDD) by NYSE, AMEX, and Nasdaq firms are significantly positive. This indicates that GPDD, which is fast becoming a strategic initiative of choice for multinational firms in the face of globalization and short time-to-market, is value-enhancing. The value enhancement is strong when announcing firms have a high level of information technology/systems infrastructure and a wide geographical spread of operation, and respond aggressively to their peers&apos; strategic initiatives. Further, cross-sectional analyses show that firms&apos; product market structure, their peers&apos; competitive strategy posture, and whether they produce a good or a service, jointly determine the variation of excess returns attributable to global product development.

Abstract: This paper argues that the ownership and control dimensions of foreign market entry mode choice should be separated, and that foreign market entry mode decisions should be expanded to business activities beyond production and distribution. Empirical results from the global hotel industry indicate that the transferability of the entrant&apos;s competitive advantages, the local market&apos;s absorptive capacity, and the availability of trustworthy local partners differentially affect the ownership and control dimensions of the entry mode decision.
