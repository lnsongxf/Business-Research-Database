Abstract: Research on international marketing channels accentuates the importance of relational norms and trust-building activities between buyers and sellers. Indeed, cultural and country differences may limit the use and effectiveness of traditional tools (such as market incentives and authoritative control) that govern the relationship between an exporting manufacturer and its foreign distributor. Consequently, exporting manufacturers need to emphasize relationships with their foreign distributors. This research finds evidence that supports both direct and indirect effects between the manufacturer&apos;s use of governance via relational norms and its competitiveness in the export market. The indirect effect results from the mediating role of trust, a finding that makes a key contribution to the understanding of the role of relational governance in cross-border relationships.

Abstract: In this study, we examine the extent to which foreign subsidiaries are responsible for the development and implementation of marketing activities, as compared with these activities being controlled by headquarters. We propose and test a model of conditions that affect such headquarters and subsidiary roles, and explore the extent to which the alignment of these roles with certain conditions is associated with product performance. Our findings suggest that the more closely headquarters and subsidiary roles in marketing activities are aligned with relational, industry, and market conditions, the greater market share tends to be.

Abstract: Based on a sample of 169 subsidiaries of multinational corporations (MNCs) operating in the USA, Russia, and Finland, this paper investigates the relationship between MNC subsidiary human resource management (HRM) practices, absorptive capacity, and knowledge transfer. First, we examine the relationship between the application of specific HRM practices and the level of the absorptive capacity. Second, we suggest that absorptive capacity should be conceptualized as being comprised of both employees&apos; ability and motivation. Further, results indicate that both ability and motivation (absorptive capacity) are needed to facilitate the transfer of knowledge from other parts of the MNC.

Abstract: Firms are social communities that specialize in the creation and internal transfer of knowledge. The multinational corporation arises not out of the failure of markets for the buying and selling of knowledge, but out of its superior efficiency as an organizational vehicle by which to transfer this knowledge across borders. We test the claim that firms specialize in the internal transfer of tacit knowledge by empirically examining the decision to transfer the capability to manufacture new products to wholly owned subsidiaries or to other parties. The empirical results show that the less codifiable and the harder to teach is the technology, the more likely the transfer will be to wholly owned operations. This result implies that the choice of transfer mode is determined by the efficiency of the multinational corporation in transferring knowledge relative to other firms, not relative to an abstract market transaction. The notion of the firm as specializing in the transfer and recombination of knowledge is the foundation to an evolutionary theory of the multinational corporationJournal of International Business Studies (2003), 34, 516&ndash;529. doi:10.1057/palgrave.jibs.8400058

Abstract: Kogut and Zander&apos;s 1993 JIBS article, which developed an evolutionary perspective on the multinational enterprise (MNE), has had three critical impacts on MNE research. First, it has stimulated scholars to conduct more eclectic, empirical analyses, which should include both transaction cost related parameters, and broader learning/competence related variables. Second, it has usefully argued that the rigorous study of MNE behavior does not need to reply upon the Williamsonian, behavioral assumption of opportunism. Third, it has (implicitly) suggested a new path to be followed by internalization theory scholars, in order to remain relevant to the field of international business. The transaction cost economics lens adopted in internalization theory clearly remains critical to any analysis of MNE strategy with impacts on the boundaries of the firm. In addition, the co-evolution of the MNE&apos;s governance structure and its technological competences determines present and future strategy choices. Here, both transaction cost considerations and learning effects influence strategy selection. Journal of International Business Studies (2003) 34, 498&ndash;504. doi:10.1057/palgrave.jibs.8400062

Abstract: Researchers and potential investors in transition economies need to understand the Human Resource Management (HRM) strategies of target firms, since human resources are arguably their most valuable assets. Understanding is difficult, however, because HRM strategies help to determine firms&apos; performance, but are in turn influenced by corporate governance, particularly insider ownership. This paper employs a structural equation modeling methodology to examine the relations between governance, HRM strategies and performance in the context of a novel dataset of Ukrainian industrial firms. It is found that insider ownership is positively associated with high-commitment HRM strategies and negatively with low-commitment, cost-cutting HRM strategies. Cost-cutting HRM strategies are in turn associated with weaker firm performance. These outcomes correspond broadly with theoretical expectations.

Abstract: The production of the 1993 article awarded the JIBS Decade Award was written during a time when ideas regarding knowledge and the international expansion of the firm confronted a hostile audience. The sources of these ideas were directly related in Winter&apos;s and Roger&apos;s prior work, but also to a broader literature on &lsquo;category errors&rsquo; and technology transfer. The theory of the firm as a social community is a distinctly sociological theory and, though sharing many key ideas with the resource-based view that developed at the same time, is deeply opposed to engineering conceptions of firms as Lego-modular pieces that can be easily shifted, bought, and sold. We describe our individual biographies and the subsequent intellectual development of the concepts in our article.
