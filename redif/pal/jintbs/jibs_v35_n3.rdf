Abstract: A framework is presented to characterize four different ways in which management control is partitioned between a multinational enterprise (MNE) and local partners within international joint ventures (JVs): split control management, shared management, MNE-partner-dominant management, and local-partner-dominant management. The framework was tested using a sample of international JVs in Korea. We found that JVs following the split control management performed better than any other approach. No performance differences were found among the remaining three types of management control. This suggests that MNEs and local partners should split control: that is, choose the activities to control so that those chosen activities can be matched with their respective firm-specific advantages.

Abstract: This paper studies a new frontier in the understanding of International Strategy (IS). To explore it, we propose the analogy of the ecology of firms and places as a way to emphasize that the real problem is the colocation of different places with different types of firms. Locations are in fact the distinctive content of International Business Strategy. We deal with this problem with four different perspectives. First, differences across countries must be addressed with integrative frameworks able to represent the multidimensionality of &lsquo;semiglobalization&rsquo;, or intermediate states between total localization and total integration. Second, differences in the development of intermediary markets in a particular place influence firm positioning and industry structure in that place, but their impact also crosses different places, and it is endogenous to the ecology of places and firms in a systemic, integrative way that makes simplifications extremely risky in the design of competitive strategy in an international context. Third, places, firms, and strategies form a complex ecology that can be studied with a framework focused in understanding the geography&ndash;strategy link that incorporates different levels of analysis, new economic actors, and a set of primitives. Finally, firms around the ecology of places face the challenge of developing strategies and business models to serve the majority of humanity today excluded from world trade. It is a fundamentally different way to think about the ecology of places and firms. Overall, we present an intriguing New Frontier, with the capacity to impact both research and practice in the field of international strategy, based in understanding the interplay among firms and places.

Abstract: This study extends the international literature by empirically testing a model of expatriate adjustment that examines the relationships between organizational antecedents (i.e., reasons for assignment), a more comprehensive set of adjustment behaviors, self-reported performance, and subordinate-rated managerial effectiveness. Using data from 194 expatriate managers and 505 subordinates working in the multinational hotel industry, structural equations modeling results supported the hypothesized model. The conceptual and empirical contributions of this study as well as the managerial implications are discussed.

Abstract: Bargaining between host states and investors over the terms of investment in sensitive sectors of the economy generates political and economic tensions. In this study, we investigate the factors that contribute to the outcomes of those negotiations as measured by the private (vs state-owned) share of newly consummated telecommunications infrastructure projects. We find that private ownership is positively associated with overall economic development and investment liberalization in the host country and with greenfield (vs divestiture) and joint venture (vs wholly owned) projects. Private ownership is negatively associated with existing telecommunications infrastructure, higher levels of state ownership of foreign investing firms, and the technological sophistication of the projects. Our analysis also shows a curvilinear (inverted U-shaped) relationship between investment policy hazards and private ownership. This finding supports the insight from transaction cost economics that potential gains from internalization are greatest at intermediate levels of uncertainty.
