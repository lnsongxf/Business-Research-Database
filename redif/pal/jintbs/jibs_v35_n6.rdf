Abstract: In contrast to the much-studied role of capital markets in fostering convergence in corporate governance practices worldwide, we argue that the globalization of product and talent markets has affected corporate governance of firms in the Indian software industry. We model several possible reasons why a particular firm, Infosys, has emerged as the exemplar of good corporate governance in India, traditionally a backwater of corporate governance practices. We further analyze the manner in which Infosys has attempted to shape corporate governance practices in India more generally, and why these attempts have had limited effects thus far.

Abstract: From publicly available data, we identified two national culture dimensions, individualism&ndash;collectivism and uncertainty avoidance, and their interaction that influences Internet shopping rates across a wide spectrum of countries. Together, these factors accounted for 14&percnt; of the explained variance (on top of the combined variance of 63&percnt; explained by national income level, educational level, economic growth rate, unemployment rate, and crime rate) in predicting Internet shopping rates. For countries lower in uncertainty avoidance, individualist cultures show higher Internet shopping rates than do collectivist cultures. Implications for national- and Internet firm-level web design strategies are discussed. Journal of International Business Studies (2004) 35, 545&ndash;559. doi:10.1057/palgrave.jibs.8400104

Abstract: Entry mode choice is a critical ingredient of international entry strategies, and has been voluminously examined in the field. The findings, however, are very mixed, especially with respect to transaction-cost-related factors in determining the ownership-based entry mode choice. This study conducted a meta-analysis to quantitatively summarize the literature and empirically generalize more conclusive findings. Based on the 106 effect sizes of 38 empirical studies, the meta-analysis shows that the findings of the existing studies are moderated to varying degrees by both study-setting factors and statistical artifacts, although the combined overall effects of transaction cost-based determinants are consistent with the predictions of transaction cost economics. We extensively discuss the implications of meta-analytical results, especially moderating effects of location, country of origin, industry type, and statistical artifacts, highlight the measurement adequacy, equivalence, and multidimensionality of transaction cost determinants, and present our suggestions to improve theoretical inquiries and empirical verifications on entry mode choice.

Abstract: The reuse of organizational practices in multiple locations is a fundamental way in which MNCs leverage knowledge to seek competitive advantage. Scholars approaching the issue of adaptation from both a market and an institutional perspective argue that, in order to achieve fit with the local environment, some degree of adaptation is advisable, and the need for adaptation increases as the institutional distance between source and recipient locations increases. However, arguments to date have examined the effect of adaptation primarily on a subsidiary&apos;s long-term performance. A necessary precursor is to understand the effect of adaptation on the transfer process itself, as transfer difficulty, or stickiness, may preclude the reuse of an organizational practice in the first place. In this paper, we explore how the adaptation of organizational practices affects the stickiness of cross-border transfers. We use structural equation modeling to analyze data from 122 internal transfers of best practice. Contrary to expectation, we find that adaptation significantly increases, rather than decreases, the stickiness of cross-border knowledge transfer.

Abstract: The emergence of organized civil society and of nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) as organizational manifestations of broader social movements has dramatically altered the global political&ndash;economic landscape. The increasing global reach of NGOs challenges established international business (IB) research, and highlights opportunities for broadening and adapting extant paradigms in the field. In this article, we introduce the concept of NGOs and contrast them with their private-sector (firm) and public-sector (government) counterparts within the context of IB. We discuss factors giving rise to NGOs as important organizational entities that participate in global value creation and governance, and identify limits to their efficacy and viability. We identify important questions raised by incorporating NGOs into our conceptualization of global context, and we challenge three basic tenets of IB theory: the definition and dynamics of an institutional field, the relevance/centrality of a firm&ndash;government (i.e., two-sector) bargaining model, and the pre-eminence of the firm as the global organization of interest within the field. We conclude by offering suggested research directions that should serve as catalysts for this new and potentially rich area of future IB research.
