Abstract: Contrasting systems of corporate governance persist internationally but are subject to regulatory and firm-level institutional change. Such changes may be viewed as organisational innovations, often imported from the USA in the face of different national cultures. This paper analyses the implications of national culture for the translation of innovations, and provides case study illustrations of regulatory and firm-level governance changes experienced in Germany. These illustrations demonstrate that the diffusion of both kinds of change has been subject to substantial translation that is consistent with German national culture.

Abstract: There were a large number of US drug company takeovers in the 1990s by both foreign and domestic acquirers. Observation of the absolute difference between target and acquirer R&amp;D intensity suggests there is no difference between foreign and domestic technology-sourcing patterns. However, a firm-level estimation of the acquirers&apos; choice of targets reveals that foreign and domestic acquirers differ with respect to the relationship between target and acquirer R&amp;D intensity. Foreign acquirers with low R&amp;D intensity choose targets with high R&amp;D intensities, which suggests technology sourcing as a motivation. Domestic acquirers prefer targets with high R&amp;D intensities the higher their own R&amp;D intensity, which suggests a synergy story.

Abstract: International business research has paid scant attention to whether and how electoral politics and economic policies affect foreign investment risk assessment, particularly in developing countries, where the last decade has seen both considerable foreign investment and domestic progress toward democratization and electoral competitiveness. We respond with development and testing of a framework using partisan and opportunistic political business cycle (PBC) theory to predict the investment risk perceived by investors holding sovereign bonds during 19 presidential elections in 12 developing countries from 1994 to 2000. Consistent with our framework, we find that bondholders perceive higher (lower) investment risk in the form of higher (lower) credit spreads on their sovereign bonds as right-wing (left-wing) political incumbents appear more likely to be replaced by left-wing (right-wing) challengers. For international business research, our findings illustrate the promise of PBC theory in explaining the election-period behavior of sovereign bondholders and, perhaps, other investors who also &lsquo;vote&rsquo; in developing country elections and can substantially influence the price and availability of capital there. For developing country investors and states, our findings highlight the financial effects of democracy in action, and underscore the importance of state communication with investors during election periods.

Abstract: Both Pearce and Molm have conducted research in interpersonal trust. Here we apply their work to international business by deriving hypotheses from their work, some compatible, some conflicting. We test them with data from managers in China, the United States, Hong Kong and Thailand using measures from the World Bank, World Competitiveness Report, and Transparency International and managerial interviews. We find support for Pearce&apos;s arguments on the effects of governmental facilitation on managers&apos; trust in their business partners, and for extensions of Molm&apos;s work on reciprocal exchange to international field settings. For the conflicting hypotheses, results support Pearce&apos;s arguments that the structural assurances of facilitative governments lead to higher levels of trust in business associates.

Abstract: The article by Oviatt and McDougall threw the spotlight on international entrepreneurs, on international new ventures, and on their importance in the globalising world economy. Recognising the rich theoretical implications of this phenomenon, they mounted a challenge to received internationalisation process theories and established a new and exciting research theme, that of international entrepreneurship. This article reviews the impact of their contribution and discusses new research themes raised by their challenge to the process theories of internationalisation.

Abstract: Oviatt and McDougall&apos;s JIBS article identified and defined international new ventures (INVs) and their prominent role in the global marketplace. The article spurred worldwide interest in INVs by raising questions about the validity and efficacy of existing theory, especially about the Uppsala process model of internationalization. The article also laid an important theoretical foundation for research into international entrepreneurship (IE), where younger and well-established companies use their entrepreneurial activities to create value as they internationalize their operations. This paper reviews Oviatt and McDougall&apos;s original propositions, highlighting their important contributions to the field. The paper also highlights the progress made in research using Oviatt and McDougall&apos;s framework, the major debates that persist about the nature and role of INVs, the source of their competitive advantages, and the key issues to be explored in future research.

Abstract: Our article that has been awarded the 2004 Journal of International Business Studies Decade Award, &lsquo;Toward a Theory of International New Ventures&rsquo;, represents an integration of international business, entrepreneurship, and strategic management scholarship. This retrospective article explains the intellectual and personal origins of the work. In addition, it highlights the definitions of &lsquo;international new ventures&rsquo; and &lsquo;international entrepreneurship&rsquo;. Finally, in response to recent concerns about the importance of international business scholarship, the research discussed here stands as an example of the successful exportation of international business scholarship into adjacent disciplines.

Abstract: Organizations that are international from inception &ndash; international new ventures &ndash; form an increasingly important phenomenon that is incongruent with traditionally expected characteristics of multinational enterprises. A framework is presented that explains the phenomenon by integrating international business, entrepreneurship, and strategic management theory. That framework describes four necessary and sufficient elements for the existence of international new ventures: (1) organizational formation through internalization of some transactions, (2) strong reliance on alternative governance structures to access resources, (3) establishment of foreign location advantages, and (4) control over unique resources.
