Abstract: Although foreign multinational firms from the Triad regions increasingly use mainland China as both a sourcing and a marketing location, no study has directly examined the sourcing strategy&ndash;performance linkage. Using resource complementarity and resource dependence theory, we extend the sourcing literature and apply these perspectives to an important transitional economy&mdash;China. These two theoretical perspectives suggest that product and uncertainty factors moderate the relationship between strategic alliance-based sourcing (SA sourcing) of major components and market performance. We find that, at low levels of product innovativeness and technological uncertainty, the use of SA sourcing is positively related to market performance. However, the effects of product differentiation and demand uncertainty on the sourcing&ndash;performance relationship are insignificant.

Abstract: There has been significant interest in understanding how the distribution of parental control over international joint ventures (IJV) influences IJV outcomes (e.g., parent conflict, survival, performance). Yet, the accumulation of research on the relationship between control structure and IJV outcomes has been somewhat inconclusive and even contradictory. We contribute to this research stream by developing an organizational justice-based contingency model relating parental control structure to parent conflict. We suggest that the level of conflict between IJV parents will depend on the consistencies between the control structure and parents&rsquo; contribution of proprietary resources, and between control structure and the parents&rsquo; abilities to effectively monitor operations. Our analysis of Vietnamese joint ventures provides some support for our model, and suggests that the relationship between parent control structure and IJV outcomes is perhaps more complex than previously thought.

Abstract: This paper studies the degree to which country differences in intellectual property rights protection affect the choice of companies for a particular mode of international inter-firm R&amp;D partnering. It focuses on the preference of companies for either an equity joint venture or a contractual partnership. We find that international differences in intellectual property rights protection are a significant factor: with less secure protection, firms choose R&amp;D joint ventures rather than contractual partnerships. The level of technological change in industries has an inverse effect on the preference for international R&amp;D joint ventures.

Abstract: Internalization theory suggests that multinational enterprises set up subsidiaries to exploit technology advantages abroad when licensing is too difficult to arrange with indigenous firms. This direct investment vs licensing trade-off, which is built on a business-to-business transaction, does not recognize the linkages with the final products market as a component of transaction cost analysis. By adopting a unilateral perspective on international technology transfer, neither does it consider the possible role of complementary assets (e.g., manufacturing capabilities) held by potential business partners in foreign countries. After taking into account the presence of such assets in indigenous firms, this article extends internalization theory by positioning the technology transfer transaction in the broader context of the entire value chain, including especially the manufacturing/marketing linkages with the final products market. More specifically, it demonstrates that conventional internalization theory neglects various alternative market governance mechanisms not captured by a licensing agreement. The analysis shows that the choice of an optimal governance structure is determined by the complementarity of strategic assets controlled by the economic actors involved, and by the linkages among the technology&ndash;manufacture interaction in two intermediate input markets, and the subsequent sales function in the final products market.

Abstract: This study examines how transactional characteristics and the institutional environment influence contractual governance for international joint ventures (IJVs). Unlike previous studies that view joint venture contractual governance as a unidimensional construct (clause specificity), thus causing a debate upon whether IJV contracts should be more specific, contractual governance herein is defined as a three-dimensional construct that includes the extent to which contractual terms are clearly specified (term specificity), possible contingencies are accounted for (contingency adaptability), and joint venture parties are legally bound to the contract (contractual obligatoriness). Our analysis of IJVs in China suggests that term specificity and contractual obligatoriness increase when the proprietariness of resources to be invested in the IJV or the incompleteness of the host country&apos;s legal system increase. Contractual obligatoriness appears to be an increasing function of economic exposure and environmental volatility, whereas contingency adaptability in a contract rises when interparty dependency, investment uncertainty, and knowledge proprietariness intensify or when environmental hazards escalate. These results suggest that an IJV contract, if structured multidimensionally as above, can curtail opportunism and guide venture evolution at the same time. These contractual dimensions should not be prefixed but properly aligned with transactional and institutional characteristics. This alignment has strong implications in reducing transaction costs and spurring IJV evolution in the complex and volatile institutional environment.

Abstract: Critiques of international business theory have recently pointed to weaknesses in the handling of context, of culture, and of policy implications. It is contended that the origins of such failings lie in the discipline&apos;s commonly accepted methodologies, and in turn that they have epistemological roots. As a route out of the dilemmas faced, a proposal is made to adopt more complete ways of handling determinacy, including the influences of history, culture, and the societal emergence of institutions. Business systems theory is drawn upon and a model proposed, developed from the work of Whitley. In this, culture is seen as underpinning formal institutions, which in turn underpin societal business systems. The use of the model relies on the ideas of Geertz on &lsquo;thick description&rsquo; and of Ragin on holistic analysis. It is illustrated with a comparison of the American and French socio-economic systems, seen historically. Findings in strategy research about the geographically defined nature of firm supremacy in many industries are brought into the account, using the business systems literature. Consistent patterns of determinacy, as well as distinct and contrasting trajectories of business system evolution, are noted. A more complete and multidisciplinary form of explanation, grounded in socio-economics, is advocated as a means of meeting the challenges both of understanding and of policymaking at several levels.
