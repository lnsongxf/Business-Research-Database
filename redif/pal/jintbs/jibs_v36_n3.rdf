Abstract: The search for strategic fit has become a core concept in normative models of strategy formation. The issue of strategic fit is becoming increasingly important in global supply chain relationships as managers and academics examine the effectiveness of culturally founded relational governance strategies across multiple supply chain relationships. This study empirically examines the performance implications of strategic fit of relational norm governance strategies in global supply chain relationships between US firms and their primary Japanese and US partners. The performance implications of fitting relational norm governance strategies (i.e., information exchange, flexibility and solidarity) across culturally diverse partners are tested. Results indicate that firm performance is enhanced when the relational norms of information exchange and solidarity are fit to culturally founded norm expectations across culturally diverse relationships simultaneously. Implications for theory and practice are discussed. Journal of International Business Studies (2005) 36, 254&ndash;269. doi:10.1057/palgrave.jibs.8400131

Abstract: This paper uses a comparative institutionalist approach combined with a power/interests perspective to examine the processes whereby diversity policy is &lsquo;internationalised&rsquo; by US multinational companies. It argues that the process of policy transfer to UK subsidiaries is complicated by incomplete and contested &lsquo;institutionalisation&rsquo; of diversity within the US itself, and by differing conceptions of diversity between the US and the UK. The ability of actors within the UK subsidiaries to mobilise and deploy specific power resources allows them to resist the full implementation of corporate diversity policy, leading to a range of compromise accommodations. It is argued that the findings have more general implications for analysing the transfer of HR practices between national business systems.

Abstract: We empirically examine the determinants of the decision whether or not to appoint an expatriate as the managing director of overseas affiliates for a sample of 844 Japanese manufacturing affiliates operating in Asia in 1995. Confirmation is found for hypotheses derived both from a control and coordination perspective on expatriation and from a knowledge creation and learning perspective. Strategic dependence of the parent on the affiliate increases the propensity to appoint expatriates, whereas localisation of the affiliate reduces it. Organisational experience in the country, both by the affiliate and by the firm, increases the probability that host country nationals will be appointed. Inter-firm relationships within vertical keiretsu groups impact on expatriation policies through inter-organisational knowledge exchange in host countries and the mitigation of localisation requirements owing to intra-group transactions.

Abstract: Although a growing literature indicates that cultural distance &ndash; that is, differences between national cultures &ndash; is an important determinant of organizational actions and performance, both empirical and theoretical concerns abound. In this study, the relationships of cultural distance with entry mode choice, international diversification, and MNE performance are examined by meta-analyzing data from 66 independent samples, with cumulative sample sizes ranging from 2,255 to 24,152. Regression results failed to provide statistical evidence of significant relationships between cultural distance and entry mode choice, international diversification, and MNE performance. The examination of moderator effects, however, yielded important results. We found a strong negative association between cultural distance and entry mode choice for US-based MNEs. The cultural distance&ndash;international diversification relationship was negative for high-technology industries, while it was positive for other industries. Cultural distance also had a strong positive effect on MNE performance for developed country investments. A similar, strong positive relationship was found between cultural distance and international diversification in studies with more recent samples. Results of this study indicate that substantial additional research is needed before the role of cultural distance is fully understood.

Abstract: In this study, we develop and test a model of the determinants of political strategies used by foreign subsidiaries of multinational enterprises (MNEs). Using recent theoretical advances in institutional theory that recognize that MNE subsidiaries are confronted with pressures for isomorphism within the corporation (internal legitimacy) and within the host country (external legitimacy), we integrate international business and political strategy literatures to create a multilevel model of subsidiary, host country and parent determinants of political strategy. Our hypotheses are tested using survey and archival data from Western European subsidiaries of US MNEs.

Abstract: This paper presents a three-stage process of conceptual development in response to the call for a unifying direction for research in the emergent field of international entrepreneurship. Drawing on classic approaches to internationalisation, and importing insight from entrepreneurship as a separate and distinct field of study, the paper develops three potential models of internationalisation as a time-based process of entrepreneurial behaviour. The models evolve from the simple through general to precise levels of conceptualisation. Research implications are discussed.
