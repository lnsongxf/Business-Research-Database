Abstract: This paper provides a methodology for identifying the dynamics of international firm expansion, demonstrating systematic evidence of both &lsquo;toe in the water&rsquo; and concentrated bursts of internationalization by US multinational enterprises. We use the methodology of statistical process control to analyze initial investments in host countries and develop a numerical measure of temporal clustering or bunching. Using this measure, we identify two distinct patterns of growth; whereas some firms cluster their investments over time, others do not cluster their investments. For firms that cluster, three types of clustering strategy are identified: concentrating, hibernating, and hybrid. Arguments based on internal firm architecture, experience, and learning are advanced to explain these findings.

Abstract: Corporate income tax law in OECD countries requires multinational enterprises (MNEs) to set their transfer prices according to the arm&apos;s length standard. In 1990 the United States (US) government introduced a transfer pricing penalty for cases where MNEs deviated substantially from this standard. More than two dozen other governments have followed suit. Our paper uses event study methodology to assess the impact of the US transfer pricing penalty on the stock market valuation of Japanese MNEs with US subsidiaries in the 1990s. We find that the penalty caused a drop in their cumulative market value of &dollar;56.1 billion, representing 12.6&percnt; of their 1997 market value.

Abstract: Using 4-year data (1990, 1994, 1998, and 2002), we have provided a ranking of schools with international business (IB) orientation based on the membership of editorial boards of 30 leading international business journals. Participation on the editorial boards of quality journals is highly selective, and should provide a quality indication of the schools. Both quality-unadjusted and adjusted board membership-based ranking are calculated in this study. Several interesting findings are worth noting. First, US schools play a significant leadership role among the leading IB programs. Second, the findings of this study also show the major contribution of non-US schools, which confirms the importance of the global nature of the IB discipline. Third, the top-ranked schools share a number of characteristics. Finally, the correlation among different ranking criteria can be low, particularly for the top-ranked schools, suggesting that care should be exercised in interpreting school ranking.

Abstract: This study examines the impact of Anglo-American financial markets on CEO compensation. Starting from a sample of Norwegian and Swedish listed firms, we analyse this effect as manifested in the capital market (Anglo-American cross-listing) and in the market for corporate control (Anglo-American board membership). These effects are analysed together with the geographically broader effect of the product and service market internationalisation of the firm. We conclude that all three effects contribute positively to the level of CEO compensation. We argue that the higher CEO compensation found in firms exposed to Anglo-American financial influence &ndash; as compared with firms not subject to such influence &ndash; reflects institutional contagion, the demand for and supply of viable CEO candidates, and a pay premium for increased risk of dismissal.

Abstract: An ever-growing literature has reported consumer bias toward national origins of products, and has explored factors that moderate such bias. Researchers have assumed, if only tacitly, that consumers are knowledgeable of brand origins, and that this knowledge is a significant influence that drives judgments of product quality, brand attitudes, and choice behavior in the marketplace. Using categorization theory and attribute diagnosticity as the theoretical foundation, our research reveals that consumers actually have only modest knowledge of the national origins of brands, and that American consumers&rsquo; proficiency at recognizing foreign brand origins is predicted by variables such as socioeconomic status, past international travel, foreign language skills, and gender. In the second of two studies, we determined that brand origin recognition is based largely on consumers&rsquo; associations of brand names with languages that suggest country origins. These studies ultimately lead us to conclude that past research has inflated the influence that country of origin information has on consumers&rsquo; product judgments and behavior and its importance in managerial and public policy decisions.

Abstract: The paper provides a state-of-the-art review of several innovative advances in culture and international business (IB) to stimulate new avenues for future research. We first review the issues surrounding cultural convergence and divergence, and the processes underlying cultural changes. We then examine novel constructs for characterizing cultures, and how to enhance the precision of cultural models by pinpointing when cultural effects are important. Finally, we examine the usefulness of experimental methods, which are rarely used by IB researchers. Implications of these path-breaking approaches for future research on culture and IB are discussed.

Abstract: Recent research has addressed the heterogeneity among MNEs in terms of their tendency to agglomerate. In this paper, we extend the scope of the firm-specific attributes considered to affect this agglomeration tendency by examining product differentiation. We find significant association between product differentiation and the preferences of firms for proximity to other firms in their industry. These findings imply that the value of agglomeration varies for firms pursuing different product differentiation strategies. We propose a conceptualization of product and location differentiations as two related dimensions of MNEs&rsquo; strategy.
