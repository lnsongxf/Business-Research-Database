Abstract: Shane and Venkataraman&apos;s Discovery, Evaluation and Exploitation entrepreneurship framework ignores issues central to comparative international entrepreneurship (IE) because of unnecessarily under-socialized assumptions regarding entrepreneurial opportunities and the individuals who discover them. To better promote comparative IE research, we develop a Comparative Discovery, Evaluation and Exploitation framework (CDEE), which takes as a starting point that individuals motivated by diverse goals enact market opportunities in a variety of social settings. Building on this characterization, the paper explores how and why processes of opportunity discovery, evaluation and exploitation vary across and within nations, as well as the implications of these differences.

Abstract: Building on general systems theory, we argue that the multi-system nature of the international joint venture (IJV) drives two distinct but inter-related sets of human resource (HR) issues: a set whose core is mainly within the venture subsystem (within-IJV HR set), producing a detrimental impact on venture performance; and a set associated mainly with the relational tension along the interface between the parent and the venture subsystem (relational/interface HR set). The relational set is detrimental at the system level, but actually has a positive performance impact at the venture subsystem level. Hierarchical regression results from a sample of 265 China-based IJVs offer support for the above hypotheses developed around the two sets of HR issues. We discuss implications for IJV theory, research, and practice. Journal of International Business Studies (2005), 36, 505&ndash;518. doi:10.1057/palgrave.jibs.8400154

Abstract: In this paper we explore some of the potential determinants of foreign exchange (FX) exposure and firm value. We contribute to previous research on stock returns and firm value as we have access to a unique survey database and can include as determinants in our empirical analysis the objectives and emphasis on risk management, as well as considering previous factors including the nature of the business environment. We can also examine any regional influences as our sample includes UK, US and Asia Pacific multinational companies (MNCs). As predicted by theory, we find some evidence that MNCs with greater foreign operations have a larger magnitude of FX exposure. However, our proxy for the emphasis of FX management does not have the predicted negative association with the magnitude of FX, indicating that managers may focus on short-term cash flows in their FX management rather than firm value. With regard to the potentially differential regional role of our variables, a range of interesting results is found. Arguably, in our most notable such finding, we see that the contribution of overseas business to total revenues has no association with the magnitude of FX exposure for US MNCs: it has a positive role for UK MNCs (consistent with theory) and a negative role for Asia Pacific MNCs, which could be explained by macroeconomic and/or financial characteristics of the MNCs in the sample.

Abstract: This paper examines the risk of US direct foreign investments over the period 1982&ndash;98 in 59 host countries. The first part of the analysis builds an empirical model to explain the time-series and cross-country patterns of return on capital. The estimation then uses the return on assets (ROA) as a measure of the return on capital, and investigates its determinants. There are four main findings. First, the ROA in a majority of countries does not simply track the worldwide ROA. Second, some cross-country differences are explained by financial risks. Third, unexplained country risk is qualitatively and quantitatively related to unobserved political risk. Fourth, unexplained country risk is also compensated with a higher ROA, enhancing its credibility as a measure of political risk. The unexplained country risk is thus used to calculate a new index of political risk ratings for 56 host countries that may be useful to managers, investors, policymakers, and academics.

Abstract: Recent years have seen recurring international financial crises, as well as a tremendous rise in trading and speculation. How are the two related? Are speculators and trading responsible for market volatility? This paper presents a study of the Gulf Crisis of 1990&ndash;1991, examining the behavior of the international oil market during a period of unprecedented volatility. The analysis suggests that a combination of political events and market fundamentals, rather than trading, was behind this volatility.

Abstract: Although effective in improving socialization, development, and retention in the US domestic context, mentoring would likely benefit expatriates and their firms, but it remains theoretically underdeveloped in the international context. We develop a theory of international mentoring by integrating current perspectives on protean and boundaryless careers with the literature on mentoring and expatriates. Expatriates need multiple mentors to assist their adjustment and development during the pre-departure, expatriation, and repatriation stages of international assignments. We discuss both hierarchical and peer, and formal and informal, mentoring relationships to delineate which relationships best address specific expatriate needs. International mentoring may improve expatriate adjustment, development, and retention, and thus may affect outcomes of international strategy. We conclude by discussing implications and avenues for future research. Journal of International Business Studies (2005), 36, 519&ndash;538. doi:10.1057/palgrave.jibs.8400159
