Abstract: In spite of the increasing popularity of international joint ventures, managers express a high level of dissatisfaction with them. This paper argues that overemphasis on the outcome has resulted in a neglect of the social processes underlying the outcome. The paper elaborates upon the rationale for a cooperative approach towards interorganizational collaborative relationships based on trust, and discusses it in the context of joint ventures. This is then applied towards understanding multinational ownership preferences and tolerance for joint ventures. It is argued that trust-centered logic is largely consistent with approaches that emphasize the issue of ownership, and deepens and enriches the insights provided by the latter. A shift in focus from ownership to relational dynamics is encouraged. Journal of International Business Studies (2006) 37, 30&ndash;43. doi:10.1057/palgrave.jibs.8400161

Abstract: The devastating economic effects of the Asian financial crisis and US corporate scandals have underscored the need to strengthen corporate governance provisions. Although cronyism has been suggested as a leading cause of the two crises, it has received little attention from scholars. In this paper, we analyze the concept of cronyism and argue that it comes in various guises arising from different motivational bases and power dependence relations. We distinguish cronyism from related constructs and posit that it is a form of corruption with different dynamics from other forms. We advance propositions on its likelihood of occurrence across cultures and develop a typology of cronyist exchanges.

Abstract: This paper develops an expectancy model for Chinese&ndash;American differences in conflict-avoiding, and tests this model using a scenario study with respondents from Taiwan and the US. Our results show that a higher Chinese tendency to avoid conflict is explained by higher Chinese expectations that direct conflict will hurt the relationship with the other party, and by greater concern for the other party among Chinese. It is not, however, explained by differences in the expected career costs/benefits of good/bad relations with others. Also, Chinese are more sensitive to hierarchy than Americans, so that avoiding is heightened more for Chinese than for Americans when the other party is of higher status. Qualitative results suggest that Chinese&ndash;American differences in time frames may also explain differences in avoiding. Implications for businesses and management are suggested.

Abstract: In both quantitative and qualitative field studies, the self-efficacy of entrepreneurs in the transition economies of Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan is examined. Using a social cognitive framework, the complex interaction among these entrepreneurs&apos; (N&equals;133) personal characteristics, environment, and self-efficacy is analyzed by structural equation modeling. Their self-efficacy was found to have a direct and mediating impact on performance. Another sample of entrepreneurs from these countries (N&equals;239) qualitatively assessed what they actually do in their day-to-day activities. The findings from these two studies contribute to better understanding and have implications for successful entrepreneurial practice in countries undergoing the difficult process of transition to a market economy.

Abstract: This paper makes a unique contribution to the HRM convergence/divergence debate by examining whether organisations operating in Europe, over the 10-year time period preceding 2000, are converging in their adoption of contingent employment practice. The susceptibility of contingent employment practice to both convergent and divergent pressures acts as a useful analytical lens. Data are drawn from organisations operating in Germany, Spain, Sweden, the Netherlands and the UK in 1991 (2918 organisations), 1995 (2048 organisations) and 2000 (1555 organisations). The results suggest that convergence is limited by the institutional embeddedness of organisations.

Abstract: This article investigates managerial career progress in a major Japanese multinational corporation over a 23-year period. We contrast our one-stage model of career progress, in which early career experiences can predict long-term career progress, with the well-accepted two-stage model of career progress, in which performance at the end of the first stage determines long-term career progress. In addition, we compare the predictions of our early screening model with those of the tournament model. Our early screening model is as good as or better than the other models in isolation or combination. Overall, we provide preliminary evidence that career progress in Japanese organizations during the high growth period of the 1970s and 1980s was perhaps more complex than shown by the two-stage career progress model that has enjoyed widespread acceptance.

Abstract: This paper examines the impact of market liberalization on firm performance through institutional changes during the economic reform in China. The conceptualization focuses on the decentralization of control, ownership restructuring, and industrial policy as the primary institutional changes to implement market liberalization in China. These institutional changes affect firm performance by shaping managerial incentives, affecting transaction and agency costs, and making selective resource allocations across and within industries. Using a large-scale data set including 23,577 firms between 1992 and 1996, the study examines how market liberalization affects the profitability and productivity of Chinese firms and the relationship between ownership change and the performance of state-owned enterprises.

Abstract: Both theoretical and empirical studies of professional service employee standardization preferences are relatively scarce. Using responses from 398 employees of an international public relations firm, this study finds that employees from high power distance, high uncertainty avoidance and high-context cultures prefer greater standardization, whereas employees from high individualism cultures prefer less standardization. Additionally, work interdependence is positively associated with standardization preferences, whereas local embeddedness is negatively associated with standardization preferences.

Abstract: We make the case for fresh approaches to examine the role of trust in international collaborations, based on the idea that not only do the levels of trust differ across international borders but also both the nature of trust and the institutional and cultural support for trust can vary across different national contexts. Collaboration partners from different countries are therefore likely to bring either symmetric or asymmetric conceptions of trust to the business relationship. We develop a model and propositions linking symmetry and asymmetry in the institutional and cultural support for trust in international collaborations with the degree of partner interdependence, and identify implications for governance and trust-building investments. We conclude with some suggestions for research that incorporates trust asymmetries between partners.

Abstract: Madhok&apos;s 1995 article defined and developed a trust-based perspective on the stability of international joint ventures (IJVs). Proposing a shift in focus from ownership to relationship, and from governance form to process, the article emphasised the role of trust in holding IJVs together and the importance of considering the dynamics of inter-organisational collaboration. By distinguishing between structural and social components of trust, it contributed to a more nuanced understanding of what makes inter-firm partnership durable and able to realise its value potential. This paper reviews Madhok&apos;s original ideas and highlights the influence they have had on the field of international business. It concludes with avenues for further research inspired by the article. Journal of International Business Studies (2006) 37, 12&ndash;20. doi:10.1057/palgrave.jibs.8400181

Abstract: In this paper, I reaffirm the role of trust in interfirm relations and make an appeal for more cross-disciplinary work to further our insights into the functioning of important phenomena of interest such as international joint ventures. I also pose a couple of fundamental questions: (1) Is ownership over-rated? That is, should we and our scholarship be so consumed with issues of ownership? (2) Is trust under-rated? In what way might we and our scholarship change if we assumed trust rather than opportunism? In what way might it change firms&apos; attitudes and behavior towards their partnership relations?Journal of International Business Studies (2006) 37, 4&ndash;11. doi:10.1057/palgrave.jibs.8400182
