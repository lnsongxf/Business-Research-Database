Abstract: We investigate the effects of trade liberalization on profitability and financial leverage using Canadian data arising from implementation of the Canada&ndash;US Free Trade Agreement. We find that falling domestic tariffs are associated with declining profits, especially for import-competing firms, while falling foreign tariffs are associated with increasing profits, especially for export-oriented firms. Also, import tariff reductions tend to increase leverage while export tariff reductions tend to decrease leverage.

Abstract: Although businesses increasingly operate across cultures, there is a paucity of research that examines the influence of national culture on leadership practices. This study uses a structural equation modeling approach to investigate relationships among leader&ndash;member exchange (LMX), delegation, paternalism, and job satisfaction in Turkish business organizations. Results from a survey study of N&equals;185 full-time employees from Turkish companies support the relationship of LMX to delegation and job satisfaction. However, the effect of LMX on job satisfaction is mediated by paternalism, an emic cultural dimension. Results suggest that delegation might not be an effective management tool in the Middle Eastern context.

Abstract: Organizational change in emerging economies, although difficult, is inevitable. The authors study the drivers and consequences of organizational changes in an emerging economy, China. The results of a firm-level survey show that organizational changes in technical vs administrative areas are differentially driven by firms&apos; motivation to change (past performance), opportunity to change (firm location and market orientation), and capability to change (firm ownership, managers&apos; change attitude, and leader charisma). Furthermore, technical and administrative changes affect firm performance through distinct paths. Technical changes have a direct, positive impact on performance, whereas administrative changes enhance firm performance indirectly through technical changes, and the effect of administrative changes on performance is strengthened by the presence of a participative culture.

Abstract: This study uses a unique sample to evaluate changes in shareholder wealth from announcements of expansion by US firms into 18 transition economies, through four entry modes, from 1987 to 1999. On average, expansion in transition economies is associated with significant positive wealth effects. Results show that value creation is most significantly associated with expansion through less risky entry modes into host countries that are in the more advanced stages of market liberalization and structural reform. Sample firms with lower profitability also experience significantly higher abnormal returns, while significant value creation documented for firms entering transition economies in 1989, 1990, and 1992 suggests first-mover advantages.

Abstract: Countries differ in the way their financial activities are organized. In Anglo-Saxon countries such as the US and the UK financial systems are dominated by stock markets, whereas in continental Europe and Japan banks play a predominant role. Why do countries differ in the configuration of their financial systems? We argue that national culture plays a significant role. We find that countries characterized by higher uncertainty avoidance are more likely to have a bank-based system.

Abstract: Past empirical studies have yielded &lsquo;no consistent relationship between strategy adaptation and firm performance&rsquo;. These inconclusive results may be partially due to a bias amongt managers to under-adapt their host market strategies. This paper presents the results of the second stage of a longitudinal study identifying a potential status quo bias among exporters, leading to systematic under-adaptation.
