Abstract: Ireland has been very successful in attracting foreign MNEs in high-technology sectors. Although these sectors exhibit faster growth than the traditional low-technology sectors populated primarily by indigenous firms, the high-technology sectors are also more volatile. We use portfolio theory to show that Ireland&apos;s FDI strategy has led to a more diversified manufacturing sector that exhibits higher growth without a commensurate increase in volatility and risk.

Abstract: Using a new unique data set on mutual fund stockholdings, we identify several interesting similarities and differences in the stock preferences of domestic and foreign fund managers from 11 developed countries. Results show that both groups of managers prefer stocks with high return on equity, large turnover, and low return variability, and that they also exhibit differential investment behavior. Domestic managers also favor firms that pay large dividends, have low financial distress and high growth potential, whereas foreign managers prefer to invest in corporations that are globally well known. The demand for globally visible stocks by foreign managers is especially strong when their fund mandate is to diversify globally or across regions, and is weakened when their stock holdings are concentrated mainly in a specific local market. The results also show no difference in the stock preferences of American-, European- and Asian-based funds. In general, our overall evidence suggests that the differential mandates of fund managers and hence the geographic allocations of their fund investments influence their stock preferences, but not the geographic location of the managers.

Abstract: This paper analyses the relationship between the internationalisation strategies of SMEs and types of ownership. Different types of ownership affect firms, and this in turn will influence the internationalisation strategy adopted. Using a sample of Spanish SMEs, our results show that internationalisation is negatively related to family ownership and positively related to corporate ownership. We have also observed that the presence of a corporate blockholder in family firms encourages internationalisation. These results support the idea that ownership type influences the decision to internationalise. Journal of International Business Studies (2006) 37, 340&ndash;351. doi:10.1057/palgrave.jibs.8400196

Abstract: This paper develops a framework for analyzing the multinational corporation (MNC) as a multilingual community in which parent functional language and subunit functional languages are concurrently used and recursively linked through an intra-corporate communication network. The unit, breadth and intensity of an MNC&apos;s language system are designed to apply global strategies within the context of evolving environmental and organizational realities. To the extent that language design is the product of deliberate choice, we suggest that headquarters functional language is determined by the MNC&apos;s international strategy, organizational structure, and transnationality, while subunit functional language is designed in accordance with organizational form, strategic role, and expatriate deployment. Aligning language systems with organizational strategy and dynamics improves MNC communication, coordination, and knowledge-sharing.

Abstract: Colleagues have characterized my place in the early days of international business (IB) studies and my later contributions as &lsquo;in limbo&rsquo;, &lsquo;at the interfaces&rsquo;, &lsquo;a synthesis&rsquo;, &lsquo;focusing on linkages&rsquo; and &lsquo;iconoclastic&rsquo;. The &lsquo;limbo&rsquo; placed me outside the usual functional disciplines in business schools, which in the 1950s seldom included &lsquo;international business&rsquo;. The &lsquo;interfaces&rsquo; and &lsquo;linkages&rsquo; of IB were focused on the interdependence of politics, government and business; the &lsquo;synthesis&rsquo; was an effort to see IB as a &lsquo;whole&rsquo; involving many cultural, social, economic and public elements; while &lsquo;iconoclastic&rsquo; reflected an effort to break through restrictive models used in the academic mainstream and to embrace as many facets of IB and foreign economic policy as were relevant to such issues as the growing significance of foreign direct investment in international economic integration, the increasing importance of technology transfers, and the emergence of transnational corporations and of a global economy &ndash; all of which were concerns of host and home governments, leading to a focus on IB and governments.

Abstract: Since Geert Hofstede&apos;s Culture&apos;s Consequences: International Differences in Work-Related Values (Sage, 1980) was published, researchers have utilized Hofstede&apos;s cultural values framework in a wide variety of empirical studies. We review 180 studies published in 40 business and psychology journals and two international annual volumes between 1980 and June 2002 to consolidate what is empirically verifiable about Hofstede&apos;s cultural values framework. We discuss limitations in the Hofstede-inspired research and make recommendations for researchers who use Hofstede&apos;s framework in the future.

Abstract: Previous empirical studies have found that global diversification results in 18&percnt; shareholder loss. In this paper, we examine the sources behind the global diversification shareholder value loss in a contingent claims framework. This postulates that the risk-reduction effects of global diversification should decrease the value of shareholder equity (call option), whereas they should increase bondholder value. Consequently, near-all equity globally diversified firms should not experience a shareholder value loss. Consistent with the risk-reduction effects of global diversification, using cross-border acquisitions data we find three major results. First, shareholder value loss to global diversification is directly related to firms&apos; leverage. Second, near-all equity firms do not trade at a discount. Third, the use of book value debt in estimating excess value produces a downward bias in globally diversified firms. Our findings confirm that increased foreign involvement increases bondholder value while it decreases shareholder value. This is consistent with the contingent claims view predicting that global diversification has a positive impact on bondholders&apos; wealth while it has a negative influence on shareholder value (i.e., global diversification discount). Overall, our results reveal that global diversification does not destroy firm value. Journal of International Business Studies (2006), 37, 352&ndash;371. doi:10.1057/palgrave.jibs.8400203

Abstract: In this paper, we provide new evidence about the unconditional pricing of exchange risk in the stock market, based on emerging market data. We conduct empirical tests using cross-sectional data at the market, portfolio and firm level from nine emerging markets (EMs) to determine whether exchange risk is priced under alternative model specifications and exchange rate measures. Our results support the hypothesis of a significant unconditional exchange risk premium in emerging stock markets, differently from most unconditional tests for major developed markets. However, there is indication that at the aggregate market level the significance of the exchange risk factor is subsumed by local market risk. With firm-level data, although the importance of local market is confirmed for most countries, some measure of exchange rate risk remains significant for most countries. This suggests that a careful model specification is necessary for EMs when testing for the pricing of exchange risk in order to avoid a potential spurious significance of such factor because of a missing local risk or vice versa.
