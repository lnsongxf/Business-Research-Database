Abstract: We argue that the field of international business should evolve its rhetoric from the relatively uncontroversial idea that &lsquo;history matters&rsquo; to exploring how it matters. We discuss four conceptual channels through which history matters, illustrating each with a major example. First, historical variation is at least a worthy complement to contemporary cross-sectional variation in illuminating conceptual issues. As an example, we show that conclusions reached by the literature on contemporary emerging market business groups are remarkably similar to independently reached conclusions about a very similar organizational form that was ubiquitous in the age of empire. Second, historical evidence avoids spurious labeling of some phenomena as &lsquo;new&rsquo;, and by so doing may challenge current explanations of their determinants. Whereas some firm types today were also present earlier, some types have disappeared, some have appeared, and some have disappeared and reappeared later. Third, history can allow us to move beyond the oft-recognized importance of issues of path dependence to explore the roots of Penrosian resources. We argue that the choices made by Jardine&apos;s and Swire&apos;s in Asia today, for example, are an outgrowth of strategic choices first in evidence more than a century ago. These would remain obscured absent an historical analysis. Fourth, there are certain issues that are unaddressable, except in the really long (that is, historical) run. Exploring the causal relationship (if any) between foreign direct investment, a staple of the international business literature, and long-run economic development provides one important example. Throughout, we advocate embracing rigorous methods for analyzing small-sample and qualitative data when conventional regression techniques do not apply. That is, we suggest that re-embracing history in the mainstream is not tantamount to sacrificing methodological rigor.

Abstract: Many international business failures have been ascribed to a lack of cross-cultural competence (CC) on the part of business practitioners. However, the international business literature appears to lack an adequate conceptualization and definition of the term &lsquo;CC&rsquo;, focusing instead on the knowledge, skills and attributes that appear to be its antecedents. In this conceptual study, we propose a definition of CC as it applies to international business and develop a model for understanding how CC is nurtured in individuals, linking our definition to the concept of cultural intelligence. We discuss the components of the model and suggest that there are environmental and contextual impediments to the effective application of the requisite skills, knowledge and attributes that have been identified as necessary for CC, resulting in a gap between &lsquo;knowing&rsquo; and &lsquo;doing&rsquo;. We conclude by discussing the implications of the model for practitioners, and by suggesting appropriate directions for further research.

Abstract: The extant business literature contains three separate characterizations of international marketing strategy: standardization&ndash;adaptation, concentration&ndash;dispersion, and integration&ndash;independence. These characterizations have, for decades, informed researchers, students, and practitioners alike of the strategic options a multinational firm might have in formulating its cross-border marketing approaches. Although useful, these characterizations have yet to be unified within an integrative classification scheme that considers the gestalt combinatorial patterns along multiple strategy dimensions. Toward creating such a classification scheme, this paper proposes a holistic conceptualization of international marketing strategy grounded in configurational theory, whereby strategies are viewed as multidimensional archetypes. We present evidence of three distinct international marketing strategy archetypes obtained through an exploratory case coding/clustering study. After discussing the characteristics, possible drivers, and contingent performance potentials of these archetypes, we offer directions for future research.

Abstract: The paper highlights the export-diversifying impact of foreign direct investment (FDI) in a developing country. FDI may lead to export diversification in the host country if it positively affects the export intensity of industries that have a low share in world exports. Indirectly, FDI may encourage export diversification through spillover effects: that is, the presence of FDI in an industry may increase the export intensity of domestic firms. The empirical results for the Indian economy in the post-liberalisation period show that FDI from the US has led to diversification of India&apos;s exports, both directly and indirectly. However, Japanese FDI has had no significant impact on India&apos;s exports. Journal of International Business Studies (2006) 37, 558&ndash;568. doi:10.1057/palgrave.jibs.8400207

Abstract: We tested the relationships between Chinese employees&apos; goal orientation and their performance, as well as the moderating effects of temporal norms (future planning and scheduling) on this relationship. Results from employees across seven different organizations in China demonstrated that the mastery goal orientation was positively related to job performance. The performance goal orientation was unrelated to employment outcomes. Further, results showed that a mastery goal orientation was most useful when future planning was emphasized and scheduling was de-emphasized.

Abstract: This paper assesses productivity spillovers from R&amp;D, exports and the very presence of foreign direct investment (FDI) in China&apos;s manufacturing sector, based on a panel of more than 10,000 indigenous and foreign-invested firms for 1998&ndash;2001. There are positive inter-industry productivity spillovers from R&amp;D and exports, and positive intra- and inter-industry productivity spillovers from foreign presence to indigenous Chinese firms within regions. OECD-invested firms seem to play a much greater role in inter-industry spillovers than overseas Chinese firms from Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan within regions. The findings have important managerial and policy implications. Journal of International Business Studies (2006), 37, 544&ndash;557. doi:10.1057/palgrave.jibs.8400209

Abstract: Establishing the applicability of multi-item measures is important for making valid inferences when testing theories cross-nationally. Typically, researchers have relied upon the tenets of classical measurement theory (CT) using confirmatory factor model invariance testing to conclude that a unidimensional measure is applicable across countries. However, two important issues remain unresolved via CT techniques: (1) if the measure is found not to be invariant, CT tells us little as to why the measure varies across countries; and (2) if the measure is multi-dimensional, what factors affect its cross-national applicability? Our research seeks to address these issues and the cross-national measurement applicability of multi-dimensional scales via generalizability theory (GT). In this paper, we use a cross-national data set and simulated data sets to demonstrate the usefulness of GT to cross-national multi-dimensional measurement.
