Abstract: This paper critiques an earlier contribution by Rugman and Verbeke (2004); and it does so by considering the global distribution of foreign direct investment (FDI). It also adds several new dimensions to the regionalisation/globalisation debate, noticeably by (i) the incorporation of inward multinational enterprise (MNE) activity, (ii) evaluating changes in the geography of FDI between 1990 and 2003, and (iii) the introduction of the concept of revealed investment comparative advantage (RICA) of countries and regions. While broadly supporting the findings of Rugman and Verbeke, our paper shows that much of the explanation for the regional concentration of FDI and MNE activity reflects that of the gross domestic product (GDP) and trade of the countries concerned, rather than any distinctive strategy on the part of investing firms.

Abstract: We are pleased that Dunning et al. have provided macro (country) level data demonstrating the increased internationalization of many nations over the past decade. We also appreciate their findings lending support to our perspective on the regional nature of world business. Our work was based solely on micro (firm) level data. Both country-level data and firm-level data have methodological problems, which we attempt to reconcile in this commentary. We also address the broader conceptual issues of how to interpret country-level vs firm-level data.

Abstract: In this paper, we examine organizational characteristics, structural mechanisms and contextual factors that influence knowledge acquisition from the foreign parent in international joint ventures (IJVs). We in turn relate assessments of knowledge acquisition to IJV performance. The data come from a survey of IJVs in the Hungarian context, where learning and knowledge acquisition from the foreign parent is thought to be particularly critical. Adaptation mechanisms, such as capacity to learn, articulated goals, and structural mechanisms, such as the provision of training, technology and managerial assistance by foreign parents, all were positively associated with the degree to which IJVs reported acquiring knowledge from their foreign parents. We also found limited support for the belief that cultural conflicts can impede knowledge acquisition, but only for two-party joint ventures with 50/50 equity arrangements. We also looked at the relationship between knowledge acquisition and different dimensions for evaluating IJV performance. The relationship between knowledge acquisition and performance was significant for all indicators of performance, through knowledge acquisition from the foreign parent and the organizational characteristics hypothesized to enhance IJV knowledge acquisition affected assessments of some dimensions of performance more than others. Our findings contribute to advancing knowledge about the relationship between organizational characteristics and organizational knowledge acquisition in IJVs, as well as the relationships between knowledge acquisition and different dimensions of IJV performance.

Abstract: Our paper focuses on how foreign automobile manufacturers in Brazil have implemented and benefited from strategic modularization. Based on our case studies and in-depth interviews, we developed a theoretical framework to examine the antecedents and outcomes of strategic modularization. Our theoretical framework suggests that strategic modularization may help improve a firm&apos;s positional advantage by reducing the cost of managing tacit knowledge. In addition, the adoption of strategic modularization influences the nature of relationships with major suppliers, further blurring the boundaries of the firm.

Abstract: Using a set of panel data of 11,324 firms in China from 1996 to 1999, the paper finds that positive technology spillovers from FIEs to domestic firms occur through tangible assets rather than intangible assets, through domestically consumed products rather than exported products, through &lsquo;traditional&rsquo; products rather than new products, and through FIEs employing unskilled workers rather than FIEs employing skilled workers. FIEs are found to generate negative spillovers through exports and through employment of skilled workers.

Abstract: We look at the development of absorptive capacity, organizational learning and IJV research literatures since 1996, using our 1996 JIBS paper as our &lsquo;centering point&rsquo;. Taking stock of the timing and patterns of citations to this paper opened up a unique window across time, venues and topics. This permitted us to more clearly position the paper vis-&agrave;-vis the contemporary corpus of the different literatures that provided the original context and impetus for us in the early 1990s. The paper has been embraced and carried forward by the burgeoning community of international business (IB) scholars on transitional economies and on IJVs. Although the Hungarian setting circa 1989&ndash;early 1990s was one we tended to view as a context to address and test theory-based issues and assumptions from a broader management literature, most indications of &lsquo;outward&rsquo; diffusion of our ideas beyond the IB community have been recent. Indeed, over half the citations have occurred after 2003. We project our take on the current landscape toward the future, providing suggestions about research opportunities.

Abstract: To empirically address the importance of the cultural context for successful assignments, we conducted two studies using a large sample of public-sector US professionals working in comparable jobs in 156 different countries. The results provided direct evidence that social and perceptual skill, reasoning ability, and adjustment- and achievement-orientation personality requirements are higher in expatriate assignments, which has implications for pre-departure selection. Also, the results partly supported the hypothesis that expatriates are required to adjust their behavior to be consistent with the local cultural values, which has implications for post-arrival behavioral training.

Abstract: Our study investigates why some firms engage in low international commitments such as exports in the early phases of internationalization, whereas others leapfrog the internationalization process and start with high international commitments in the form of foreign direct investment (FDI). Process models of internationalization propose that firms start with low commitment activities and gradually increase their commitments to international markets. However, recent empirical evidence has shown that many firms make high international commitments from the start. Our findings suggest that domestic resources and competitive action propensity affect early international commitments indirectly through domestic mindsets. A domestic mindset refers to the knowledge structures of the top management team prior to starting international activities, based on their managerial experience and learning in domestic markets. Our results suggest that knowledge and learning gained in domestic markets through diverse resource and competitive activities may be crucial in early international commitments.

Abstract: This paper provides a theoretical model of the trade-offs that an MNE faces when organising its R&amp;D as decentralised or centralised. R&amp;D decentralisation avoids having to adapt centrally developed innovations to local markets, being able to use the specific know-how of the subsidiary. In addition R&amp;D subsidiaries can be used to source locally available external know-how. At the same time, however, R&amp;D internationalisation intensifies the spillover of valuable know-how to competitors located in the foreign markets. The analysis demonstrates the importance of the intensity of competition in the local market in determining the size of both the benefits and costs of R&amp;D decentralisation. It shows that when R&amp;D is undertaken abroad in association with production, the local knowledge base is not unequivocally a pulling factor attracting R&amp;D investments by foreign MNEs, depending on the level of local competition. The paper also shows that efficiency in reverse intra-company technology transfers is a critical factor in benefiting from technology sourcing. The results thus illustrate the complementarity of efficient internal and external knowledge management systems. In addition the model suggests that, with a fall in the cost of intra-company technology transfers, relative market size loses importance as a locational factor for R&amp;D decentralisation.

Abstract: Country-of-origin preferences of distribution channel gatekeepers when sourcing food imports were investigated using in-depth interviews in five European markets. Channel member perceptions of product-country image related more to specific issues of confidence and trust in integrity of production, certification and regulatory systems than to country image stereotypes. This study integrates these trust-determining factors with price-perceived value constructs in order to build a comprehensive model applicable to food channel gatekeepers.

Abstract: Hungary has been the focus of Lyles and Salk (1996) because their research interest, organisational learning, was of particular concern in joint ventures in that country at that time. This allowed them to investigate in greater depth what drives knowledge acquisition, and how it influences the performance of joint ventures. This commentary reviews the contribution by Lyles and Salk, as reflected in the subsequent literature. The setting of the study in Hungary 1993 raises the challenging question of how this particular context may have influenced the research outcomes. I argue that the national context of radical environmental change and the organisational context of joint ventures incorporating privatised state firms crucially influence processes of organisational learning. The importance of context suggests modifying future research agendas in international business, and in organisational learning in particular. I thus suggest that future research should incorporate context more explicitly to establish boundary conditions for theory, and to develop managerially relevant insights.

Abstract: We conducted a series of studies to conceptualize, operationalize, and validate entrepreneurial career success from a Chinese perspective. For Study 1, we defined constructs based on interpretations of Hong Kong entrepreneurs. In Study 2 (Hong Kong entrepreneurs) and Study 3 (Shanghai entrepreneurs and their employees), we developed and validated measures. Guided primarily by social identity theory, we mapped the criterion space and tested etic and emic predictors of career success.

Abstract: In this essay, I critically review the 2006 JIBS Decade Award article by Lyles and Salk &lsquo;Knowledge acquisition from foreign parents in international joint ventures (IJVs): An empirical examination in the Hungarian context&rsquo;. This article develops theoretical arguments and empirically tests a two-stage research question: (1) What are the organizational characteristics and structural mechanisms between IJV parents that influence knowledge acquisition from the foreign parent, and (2) what is the relationship between knowledge acquisition and performance in Hungarian IJVs? The most important contribution is the focus on both the antecedents and the consequences of knowledge acquisition in IJVs. I also discuss subsequent research that draws heavily on the conceptual or empirical findings of the 2006 JIBS Decade Award paper. I conclude by suggesting areas of future research in the field of knowledge transfer, organizational learning and international strategic alliances.
