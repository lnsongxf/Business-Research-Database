Abstract: IB is a field constrained not only in time, but also in economic model (institutional, country-level, and developmental variation) and intellectual direction. We need more: a transformation of IB that involves a synthesis and integration of temporal, spatial and developmental data from around the world.

Abstract: Commenting on Jones and Khanna, we suggest that international business (IB) needs simultaneously maturing theory and on-going rigorous empirical work. We advocate careful data collection and develop solid theory based on the rich empirical information. The difficulty in the process is the deciphering of causality, and that is where historical studies play a significant role. Historical documents shed light on motivations and exogenous incidents. Historical studies and large-scale data analyses can complement each other in revealing causality. While path dependence constraints causal inferences using cross-sectional data, historical studies can identify differences and similarities in the paths of events across geography and time. This advantage is particularly attractive in understanding the relationship between institutions and business behaviour, which lies inside the proper domain of IB studies.

Abstract: Should companies adjust their orientations toward customers or toward competitors in global markets? To answer this question, we use contingency theory and examine how the effects of customer and competitor orientations on performance are moderated by different environmental conditions. Our results from the global hotel industry indicate that a customer orientation works better in economically developed markets, as well as in markets with good local business conditions, greater resource availability, and demanding customers. In contrast, a competitor orientation is more effective in markets that are economically developing, have poor local business conditions, and face resource scarcity.

Abstract: In this study, we investigate how multinationality affects firms&rsquo; risk levels. Our investigation builds on the idea from real options theory that international operations offer switching options to multinational corporations, yet we also emphasize different sources of coordination costs that can mitigate the benefits of operational flexibility. The findings from Tobit models accounting for self-selection underscore the importance of unobserved heterogeneity in the relationships between international investments and risk levels. Consistent with the coordination costs surrounding international operations, we find that the relationship between multinationality and downside risk is curvilinear: risk first declines and then increases as a firm&apos;s portfolio of international investments becomes extensive. In addition, downside risk is an increasing function of the average cultural distance between a firm&apos;s home base and the host countries in which its foreign subsidiaries operate.

Abstract: This study examines the determinants of international knowledge flow. From a resource-based perspective, it evaluates the impact of cross-national knowledge transfer on firm innovative performance. Based on 56,027 US patents owned by 53 selected firms in the US-based pharmaceutical industry, the results suggest that innovative performance is a curvilinear function of the international knowledge content used by a firm to innovate. As hypothesized, it was found that at (1) low and moderate levels of international knowledge content, a firm&apos;s strategy to transfer international knowledge improves its innovative performance, and at (2) higher levels of international knowledge content, there are diminishing marginal returns to transferring knowledge from overseas.

Abstract: Several studies have explored how certain economic and cultural variables affect a country&apos;s corruption level. This study extends previous research by not only considering these variables, but also taking into account the impact that information and communication technology can have on corruption. The results indicate that the greater the access to information, the lower the corruption levels. Therefore bridging the digital disparity across countries can also serve to lessen national corruption levels.

Abstract: Learning and acquiring local market knowledge from foreign distributors are central to manufacturers&rsquo; export market performance. Drawing from the resource-based view, we propose that manufacturers need to develop stronger local market competence while simultaneously minimizing the costs of distributor opportunism in order to compete successfully in the export market. Cultural distance and other barriers, however, may hinder the development of local market competence for the manufacturer while contributing to the occurrence of distributor opportunism. In order to overcome these barriers, we examine the impact of three alternative forms of manufacturer governance &ndash; trust, knowledge sharing, and contract-based relationship &ndash; in export channels. Findings suggest that all three governance mechanisms contribute to enhancing the manufacturer&apos;s competence to exploit local market opportunity. However, of the three, trust seems to be the only effective way to curtail distributor opportunism.

Abstract: International new ventures (INVs) are a popular mode of entry into foreign markets. INVs, those companies that enter foreign markets at inception, often suffer the two liabilities of newness and foreignness, which may increase the odds of their failure. This paper empirically examines the survival of INVs by comparing them with other sequential modes of international operations (e.g., acquisitions). Data from 275 British firms show that INVs have lower unconditional survival probabilities than other modes of foreign market entry. Our analyses also show that differences in survival probabilities disappear when the firms&rsquo; competitive strategies are considered.

Abstract: Recent developments in the global economy and in multinational corporations have placed significant emphasis on the cognitive orientations of managers, giving rise to a number of concepts such as &lsquo;global mindset&rsquo; that are presumed to be associated with the effective management of multinational corporations. This paper reviews the literature on global mindset and clarifies some of the conceptual confusion surrounding the construct. We identify common themes across writers, suggesting that the majority of studies fall into one of three research perspectives: cultural, strategic, and multidimensional. We also identify two constructs from the social sciences &ndash; cosmopolitanism and cognitive complexity &ndash; that underlie the perspectives found in the literature. We then use these two constructs to develop an integrative theoretical framework of global mindset. We then provide a critical assessment of the field of global mindset and suggest directions for future theoretical and empirical research.
