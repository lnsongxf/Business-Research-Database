Abstract: International business activity has to adapt to a number of new challenges, including higher temperatures and flood risks. The adaptation process will depend partly on the development of new forms of risk analysis for decision-making. This paper identifies statistically significant differences in regional temperature risk profiles, and develops climate change risk rankings for 11 regions of the globe. The methodology is based on a univariate time series analysis of regional mean temperatures, and takes into account the extent to which extreme temperature events cluster together, an important factor in weather-related risk analysis. The implications of the empirical results are discussed, with particular reference to the insurance and reinsurance markets.

Abstract: This study sets out to explore human resource management (HRM) practices in multinational corporation (MNC) subsidiaries within an institutional theory framework. Based on a sample of 158 subsidiaries of MNCs operating in the United States, Russia and Finland, the paper examines factors hypothesised to influence the HRM practices adapted in US, Japanese and European MNC subsidiaries located in Russia, Finland and the US. The results indicate significant differences in HRM practices used across host countries. Both the status of the subsidiary human resource department and the degree to which the subsidiary was involved in knowledge transfer with other parts of the MNC had a significant impact on the selection of HRM practices.

Abstract: We develop a taxonomy that relates foreign direct investment (FDI) motivation (technology- and cost-based) to its anticipated effects on host countries&rsquo; domestic productivity. We then empirically examine the effects of FDI into the United Kingdom on domestic productivity, and find that different types of FDI have markedly different productivity spillover effects, which are consistent with the conceptual analysis. The UK gains substantially only from inward FDI motivated by a strong technology-based ownership advantage. As theory predicts, inward FDI motivated by technology-sourcing considerations leads to no productivity spillovers.

Abstract: Consumers often are positively biased in their evaluations of domestic products vs foreign alternatives. This study establishes economic and socio-psychological motives for this home country bias. Building on social identity theory, this paper shows that home country bias is in part driven by a need for self-enhancement. This influence is stronger for consumers who identify more strongly with their own country, and is complementary to the effect of consumer ethnocentrism, which provides an economic motivation for home country bias. The framework is supported in empirical studies conducted in the Netherlands and in the USA. Journal of International Business Studies (2007) 38, 361&ndash;373. doi:10.1057/palgrave.jibs.8400269

Abstract: An inconsistent pattern of findings drawn from past research on the market orientation&ndash;performance relationship hints at the presence of extraneous sources of influence relating to geographical factors. This paper makes an initial step towards explaining these inconsistencies by advancing propositions linking market orientation with the location of the firm&apos;s marketing activities. Data from an exploratory study conducted within a small trade-dependent economy support the idea that the development of a market orientation is hindered to the extent to which a firm is dependent on diverse and distant foreign markets.

Abstract: The initial stages of internationalisation, prior to firms having established their definitive sources of advantage, remain the relatively unexplored area of the international business (IB) literature. At these early stages, where firms are seeking to establish themselves, and new multinational firms are appearing to exploit new opportunities created by globalisation, the entrepreneurial aspects of internationalisation come to the fore. In this paper we aim to delineate an emerging field of IB scholarship: we use the appearance of international new ventures, and the phenomenon of accelerated internationalisation that they feature, to identify a set of issues that has slipped through the net of some of the existing IB frameworks. We propose that the salient features of accelerated and early internationalisation by the newly internationalising firm are best captured in a framework that is found at the intersection of entrepreneurial and internationalisation perspectives, which we propose be known as international entrepreneurial dynamics. We discuss such a framework in terms of entry points and pathways mapped by firms as they probe the IB arena, and the key factors that impinge on behaviour and strategic choices. In line with recent developments in the entrepreneurship literature, these are grouped into three milestones of entrepreneurial processes that extend across national boundaries: (1) the discovery of new opportunities; (2) the deployment of resources in the exploitation of these opportunities; and (3) the engagement with competitors. Implications for MNE and internationalisation theory are discussed. Journal of International Business Studies (2007) 38, 387&ndash;403. doi:10.1057/palgrave.jibs.8400271

Abstract: This paper reviews and integrates two perspectives on repatriate retention: a traditional one, which suggests that the main determinant of repatriate retention is the availability of repatriation support programs; and an emerging one, which focuses on individual career activism in a changing employment context. Results of a study of 133 expatriates from 14 MNCs indicate that both views contribute to our understanding of repatriate retention. Building on the results of our study, we put forward a framework to guide future research. Journal of International Business Studies (2007) 38, 404&ndash;429. doi:10.1057/palgrave.jibs.8400273

Abstract: This paper finds that the nationality of ownership of foreign investors significantly impacts upon productivity spillover effects, revealing a curvilinear relationship with foreign direct investment on data for overseas Chinese (Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan) multinational enterprises, but not for other (Western) firms. This relationship is most pronounced for low-technology host industries. These findings suggest that the curvilinear form is more appropriate to the future study of the spillover effects of foreign presence.
