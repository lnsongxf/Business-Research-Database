Abstract: In this article, we present a springboard perspective to describe the internationalization of emerging market multinational corporations (EM MNEs). EM MNEs use international expansion as a springboard to acquire strategic resources and reduce their institutional and market constraints at home. In so doing, they overcome their latecomer disadvantage in the global stage via a series of aggressive, risk-taking measures by aggressively acquiring or buying critical assets from mature MNEs to compensate for their competitive weaknesses. We discuss unique traits that characterize the international expansion of EM MNEs, and the unique motivations that steer them toward internationalization. We further delineate peculiar strategies and activities undertaken by these firms in pursuit of international expansion, as well as internal and external forces that might compel or facilitate their propulsion into the global scene. We finally explain the risks and remedies associated with this international &lsquo;springboarding&rsquo; strategy and highlight major issues meriting further investigation.

Abstract: This study investigates the determinants of Chinese outward direct investment (ODI) and the extent to which three special explanations (capital market imperfections, special ownership advantages and institutional factors) need to be nested within the general theory of the multinational firm. We test our hypotheses using official Chinese ODI data collected between 1984 and 2001. We find Chinese ODI to be associated with high levels of political risk in, and cultural proximity to, host countries throughout, and with host market size and geographic proximity (1984&ndash;1991) and host natural resources endowments (1992&ndash;2001). We find strong support for the argument that aspects of the special theory help to explain the behaviour of Chinese multinational enterprises.

Abstract: Past literature on foreign direct investment generally supports an economics perspective that there is a direct relationship between firm-specific ownership advantages and international expansion. However, in emerging economies, with their institutional environment context characterized by low resource munificence and continuous economic liberalization, a theoretical extension of the current perspective is needed. This paper introduces new parameters by focusing on specific ownership advantages and strategic actions that firms have to develop in response to the institutional characteristics of the emerging economies when they decide to pursue outward FDI. The focus here is on international venturing that requires a firm to engage in activities for new business creation in a foreign country rather than simply seek to distribute a product in another nation. It is shown empirically that the relationship between firm-specific ownership advantages and international venturing is moderated by the degree of home industry competition and export intensity. In addition, such a relationship is mediated by the intensity of corporate entrepreneurial transformation in the form of innovation, new business creation, and strategic renewal.

Abstract: Previous studies emphasise that the foreign direct investment (FDI) strategies of firms from newly industrialised economies (NIEs) are different from the FDI strategies of firms from developed economies. It has also been shown that NIE firms are often controlled by founding families who make key strategic decisions, and that they rely heavily on network linkages when developing their FDI strategies. What is less clear, however, is how the corporate governance factors in NIEs, the risk preferences of the main shareholder constituencies, and the network-based business culture affect the decision to undertake FDI in emerging markets. This paper explores the entry mode and location choices of firms from an Asian NIE (Taiwan) in an emerging market (the People&apos;s Republic of China). It shows that the choice of equity stake in an affiliate depends upon the extent of family and institutional share ownerships in the parent company. High-commitment entry is found to be positively associated with the affiliate being located in areas with strong economic, cultural and historic links with the parent company. Furthermore, the entry mode and location decisions appear to be interrelated, with the parent&apos;s equity stake in the affiliate depending inter alia upon the location within China, and the favoured location depending inter alia upon the equity stake.

Abstract: In this study we seek to explain how firms from emerging markets build capabilities to operate in international markets through learning from parental networks. The building of these capabilities is of particular interest, as firms from emerging markets may not necessarily possess the monopolistic advantages commonly referred to in IB literature, which allow a firm to succeed in international markets. Using lagged cross-sectional regression models on a sample of 794 Indian firms, we found that firms draw on the international experience of their parental and foreign networks to build such capabilities. Findings also indicate that network scope is beneficial for increasing exposure to international markets only in the case of networks that are either small or medium sized. Additionally, we found that firms lacking market power in their home market benefit through foreign partnerships when internationalizing operations.

Abstract: This paper offers a social network explanation for the purported relationship between internationalization and firm performance in the context of born-global small and medium enterprises (SMEs). We argue that home-based social networks play a mediating role in the relationship between inward and outward internationalization and firm performance. The mediating mechanism is attributed to three information benefits of social networks: (1) knowledge of foreign market opportunities; (2) advice and experiential learning; and (3) referral trust and solidarity. Using survey data from SMEs in the largest emerging economy of China, we found some support for this mediating role of social networks in the form of guanxi. The results imply that international business managers should consider social networks as an efficient means of helping internationally oriented SMEs to go international more rapidly and profitably.

Abstract: In this study, we examine from an institutional perspective the legitimacy rationale behind the choice of subsidiary ownership structure among multinational corporations (MNCs). We suggest that, when under a strong pressure to conform at the host country and local industry levels of their institutional environment, MNCs are likely to take a lower ownership stake in exchange for external legitimacy in the host country or local industry that their foreign subsidiaries are entering. We also suggest that MNCs are likely to take a higher ownership stake in response to strong internal pressure to sustain their internal legitimacy at the corporate level of their institutional environment. We also propose that MNCs are more likely to exchange ownership for legitimacy in local industries than in host countries, and in local markets with a high level of political instability than in those with a low level of political instability. These propositions are generally supported by our analysis of 4451 subsidiaries established by 898 Japanese MNCs that operated in 39 countries across 52 industries (two-digit SIC) between 1988 and 1999.

Abstract: This research develops a location&ndash;allocation, mixed integer linear model that simultaneously evaluates a substantial number of multinational enterprise (MNE) location and control configurations to yield an optimal network, considering R&amp;D, production and marketing facilities, produced in-house and/or outsourced. The model places special emphasis on the role of intra-firm, inter-firm and extra-firm knowledge flows in addressing cost minimisation considerations of MNEs. A simulation analysis is undertaken to evaluate potential solutions from such a framework and to analyse their consistency with theoretical expectations.

Abstract: In this perspective paper we argue that outward foreign direct investment (OFDI) undertaken as escape response to perceived misalignment between firm needs and home country institutional conditions represents an important but under-explored phenomenon in the international business (IB) literature. We propose that, in advanced industrialized nations, the extent of OFDI as escape is likely to rise with the extent of societal coordination in the political economy. Societal coordination is associated with relatively slower rates of institutional adjustment and thus with relatively greater prevalence of misalignments that may drive OFDI. We illustrate the face validity of our argument and lay out the implications for future research in IB.

Abstract: We combine data on international trade linkages with network methods to examine the global trading system as an interdependent complex network. We map the topology of the international trade network, and suggest new network-based measures of international economic integration, at both a global system-wide level and a local country level. We develop network-based measures that incorporate not only the volume of trade but also the influence that a country has on the international trading system. These measures incorporate the structure and function of the network, and may provide a more meaningful approach to globalization than current measures based on trade volumes. We find that, in terms of participation and influence in the network, global trade is hierarchical, with a core&ndash;periphery structure at higher levels of trade, though integration of smaller countries into the network increased considerably over the 1990s. The network is strongly &lsquo;balkanized&rsquo; according to geography of trading partners, but not as strongly by income or legal origin. Using these new measures we find that a country&apos;s position in the network has substantial implications for economic growth. We therefore suggest that a network approach to international economic integration has potential for useful applications in international business, finance and development.

Abstract: This paper presents an integrative model of the impact of cultural differences on capability transfer in cross-border acquisitions. We propose that cultural differences affect the post-acquisition capability transfer through their impact on social integration, potential absorptive capacity, and capability complementarity. Two dynamic variables &ndash; the use of social integration mechanisms, and the degree of operational integration of the acquired unit &ndash; are proposed to moderate the effects of cultural differences on social integration and potential absorptive capacity. The implications for acquisition research and practice are discussed. Journal of International Business Studies (2007) 38, 658&ndash;672. doi:10.1057/palgrave.jibs.8400287
