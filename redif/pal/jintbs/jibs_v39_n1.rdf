Abstract: While the topic of interorganisational trust is gaining attention in academic literature, research on developing countries remains sparse. With the premise that certain contextual elements may be more relevant for developing countries, we expand on existing models by testing the effect of initial support, use of just-in-time delivery, and informal commitment to predict the trust that Turkish automotive suppliers have towards their buyers. The results support the predictions that soft technologies and informal commitment increase trust.

Abstract: This paper contributes to the debate on the performance impact of &ldquo;added cultural distance&rdquo; in the multinational enterprise&apos;s (MNE&apos;s) expansion path. Our research focuses on the ability of MNEs to handle complexity associated with added cultural distance in international expansion, and on the effect this may have on profitability. We hypothesise that firms that make expansion moves involving a high level of added cultural distance per unit of time, and those that expand in culturally distant countries in an irregular fashion, that is, with a higher variability, will be less profitable. We test these hypothesised relationships using detailed data on 2404 expansion moves undertaken by our panel of 91 German MNEs, whose expansion paths we tracked during periods ranging between 5 and 20 years.

Abstract: We explore determinants of subsidiary autonomy in setting human resource management (HRM) practices within US-parented multinational enterprises (MNEs), in Europe and Australia. We examine both the effect of strategic context and the effect of the institutional location of the subsidiary. We find that US MNEs show greater centralisation of control over HRM where the subsidiary faces global markets, in coordinated market economies vs liberal market economies, and where union density is low.

Abstract: This cross-disciplinary study examines the way national culture affects consumption patterns of life insurance across countries. Life insurance is a service that is abstract, complex, and focused on unsure future benefits. Because of the uncertainty and ambiguity inherent in the life insurance product, consumers are more likely to respond according to their cultural prescriptions. Our research hypotheses are tested empirically using Hofstede&apos;s cultural dimensions, and data from 1976&ndash;2001 across 41 countries. The findings show that individualism indeed has a significant, positive effect on life insurance consumption, whereas power distance and masculinity/femininity have significant, negative effects. The results are robust, even after controlling for economic, institutional and demographic determinants.

Abstract: In recent years the international trade literature has focused on the effects of exporting and its benefits in an open economy. Scholars note that engaging in trade enhances knowledge spillovers, and results in income growth and income convergence among trading partners. Although the macro-literature has long addressed economic convergence, there has been relatively little research examining the effect of exporting on ex post firm performance. Likewise, there has been little research that examines the differential learning-by-exporting effects across industries. In this paper we build upon the convergence literature to argue that engaging in exporting provides firms, especially firms in technologically lagging industries, the opportunity to benefit disproportionately from knowledge spillovers. Using a sample of Spanish manufacturing firms from 1990 to 1997, we investigate empirically how exporting differentially influences the innovative outcomes of firms in technologically leading vs lagging industries. We find evidence that firms in technologically lagging industries (in which Spain lags the global technology frontier) learn more from exporting than those firms in technologically leading industries (in which Spain is at, or near, the global technology frontier). The results enrich the traditional convergence argument by suggesting that industry heterogeneity matters to knowledge transfer, and stands to play a substantial role in reducing knowledge gaps.

Abstract: Because stock markets in emerging economies are relatively new, under-regulated, and often segmented, investors&apos; responses to public announcements by firms in these economies may differ from responses in developed economies&apos; stock markets. We draw on the institutional and corporate governance literatures to explain investor reactions to announcements of international strategic alliances (ISAs) between foreign and emerging-market firms. We argue that emerging economies&apos; stock markets positively value ISAs; however, information leakages due to weak regulatory environments siphon off the &ldquo;good news&rdquo; before the ISA announcement date. The level of state ownership of publicly traded firms and the nationality of foreign partners both affect the size and timing of market reactions.

Abstract: Cultural sensitivity is assumed to be important in international business, yet little empirical work explores how cultural sensitivity actually develops. In-depth interviews with buyers from the Asian Pacific Rim were conducted, and support was found for a four-stage model of cross-cultural sensitivity in which buyers move through the stages of romantic sojourner, foreign worker, skilled worker, and partner. This paper explores the development and evolution of cultural sensitivity as it interacts with trust and development of international business relationships.

Abstract: We assess Stephen Hymer&apos;s contribution to the theory of the multinational enterprise and to international business (IB) scholarship. We focus on Hymer&apos;s evolving analytical framework, and assess it in terms of its internal consistency and in the light of the shifting global landscape and scholarly thinking. We also extend Hymer&apos;s framework, revisit his predictions, and conclude by questioning his canonical status within the IB profession.

Abstract: This study assesses the impact of economic ideology and national culture on the individual work values of managers in the United States, Russia, Japan, and China. The convergence&ndash;divergence&ndash;crossvergence (CDC) framework was used as a theoretical framework for the study, while the Schwartz Value Survey (SVS) was used to operationalize our investigation of managerial work values across these four countries. The findings largely support the crossvergence perspective, while also confirming the role of national culture. Implications from the findings are drawn for the convergence&ndash;divergence&ndash;crossvergence of values, as well as for the feasibility of multidomestic or global strategies for a corporate culture.

Abstract: This paper provides a brief overview of the evolution of comparative management theories/paradigms, and highlights the contribution of the &lsquo;cross-vergence&rsquo; construct. Despite progress, most studies of work values across countries continue to suffer from two primary limitations. The first is the fallacious assumption of cultural homogeneity with nations. Given the growing diversity of the workforce within country, intra-national variations can often be as significant as cross-national differences. The second is the fallacious assumption of cultural stability over time. Since cultures evolve, albeit slowly, it is important to take these changes over time into consideration, and be aware of the paradoxes inherent within any given society. Hence the paper calls for the need to balance cross-national and intra-national diversity in order to truly understand cross-cultural phenomena, and thus further improve the quality of cross-cultural research.

Abstract: The 1997 JIBS paper by Ralston, Holt, Terpstra, and Yu was instrumental in anchoring and extending the construct of crossvergence in cross-cultural research. Ten years on, the paper has lost none of its relevance, and continues to offer important opportunities for further theory development and attendant empirical research. Scope for further work seems to exist especially in three areas: the meaning of crossvergence; national culture and economic ideology; and processes of change.

Abstract: In this retrospective, I chronicle the development of the crossvergence theory of values evolution, which states: it is the dynamic interaction of the sociocultural influences with the business ideology influences that provides the driving force to precipitate the development of new and unique values systems in societies. Crossvergence theory was introduced in our 1993 JIBS paper, and was the focus of our 1997 Decade Award paper, as well as of a series of subsequent papers. Thus I discuss the purpose and findings for six papers that have contributed to our present level of knowledge concerning crossvergence theory. I conclude my comments with a discussion of the relevance of longitudinal and multilevel research, measures found to be useful, and methodologies to consider, as well as identifying research topics in need of exploration.
