Abstract: We use an interdisciplinary approach to investigate multinational banks&rsquo; foreign activities. We bridge core concepts from the stages theory of internationalization to internalization theory, to extend the literature on the defensive expansion hypothesis. Unlike the primarily aggregate levels of analysis employed in previous research on multinational banking, we utilize a firm-level analysis of the internationalization experiences of 21 Japanese banks in the period 1980&ndash;1998. We find that banks undertake foreign direct investment to secure internalization benefits by following their existing clients, and to achieve economies of scale in the application of their intangible assets in international markets. The magnitude of these relationships, however, is contingent upon the level of a bank&apos;s experience in the host countries. Consistent with predictions from internationalization theory, we find that the motivations for international expansion can change over time.

Abstract: Studies in international business have considered both theoretical and empirical analyses of investment strategies by multinational firms in transition economies. However, there is scant research on the impact of firm-specific factors on the likelihood, timing, and mode-of-entry decisions in these economies. We provide evidence on three aspects of the strategic decisions by US firms to invest in transition economies. First, we find that firms entering the region have greater advertising intensity and sales growth than industry peers that did not enter the region, suggesting that market-seeking considerations motivate expansion. Second, we find that earlier entry is undertaken by firms with fewer industry competitors and higher sales growth, suggesting that the desire to secure market share ahead of competitors motivates entry timing. Finally, we investigate the choice of entry mode into the region, and find that firms from concentrated industries are more likely to enter the region with high-equity commitment, consistent with market-seeking motives. We also find that firms incorporate the degree of progress with market-oriented reforms in making decisions concerning entry timing and mode.

Abstract: This paper employs organizational learning theory to examine the short-term effect of past export performance, and internal (management) and external (market) forces on marketing strategy adaptation and current export performance. Results from a survey of over 500 export managers indicate that current-period performance improvement (in terms of performance achievement, export intensity, and performance satisfaction in the current year) is influenced by the firm&apos;s commitment to exporting. Further, the authors found that while performance satisfaction feeds performance improvement in the following year, both the previous year&apos;s export intensity and export performance achievement produce a negative impact on current-period performance improvement. More importantly, the level of development in the export market facilitates marketing strategy adaptation in the short term, as does export intensity in the previous year. However, satisfaction with previous-year performance negatively influences the degree of distribution adaptation. Implications for international business researchers and practitioners are also discussed. Journal of International Business Studies (2008) 39, 304&ndash;325. doi:10.1057/palgrave.jibs.8400339

Abstract: In this paper, we argue that geographic location may be one reason why some ventures are able to acquire the resources needed to internationalize while others cannot. We use ecological arguments to predict an inverted U-shaped relationship between the concentration of industry clustering within a geographic location and the venture&apos;s internationalization. We also explore whether venture characteristics influence the nature of this relationship. Our hypotheses are regressed on international intensity and scope, and analyzed through a sample of 156 publicly held new ventures. Results confirm that location influences new venture internationalization, and firm characteristics impact the nature of the relationship.

Abstract: Alan Rugman and co-authors argue that globalisation, and with it global strategy, is a myth. This contention rests on a taxonomy of the world&apos;s largest firms based on their sales, showing an overwhelming share of home-regional firms. We question the rationales underpinning their classification scheme. When retesting the data using different schema we find that the original results are far from robust, with a significant share of firms attaining bi-regional or global status. Further longitudinal analysis shows that large firms increasingly are extending their sales beyond the home region. Our results defy regionalisation theory in its current form, and we call for refinements through further research.

Abstract: This study examines how regional diversification affects firm performance. The results indicate that regional diversification has linear and curvilinear effects on firm performance. Regional diversification enhances firm performance linearly up to a certain threshold, and then its impact becomes negative. The results also show that firms of developed countries maximize their performance when they operate across a moderate number of developed regions and a strictly limited number of developing regions. This explains why internationalization by most international firms is regional rather than global.

Abstract: In the world&apos;s largest 500 firms, there are 64 Japanese multinational enterprises (MNEs) with data on regional sales, but only three operate globally; whereas 57 of them average over 80&percnt; of their sales and foreign assets in their home region. Why is there such a strong intra-regional dimension to their activities? Using empirical data and a new framework for analysing both downstream (sales) assets and upstream (production) assets we analyse why most large Japanese firms appear to have firm-specific advantages (FSAs) that are based in their home region. A structural contingency approach is applied to two case studies to explain how home-region-bound FSAs constrained the ability of Japanese MNEs to implement internationalisation strategies.

Abstract: We investigate the factors that influence the extent to which a multinational corporation&apos;s headquarters (MNC-HQ) sources knowledge from the host countries of its R&amp;D labs. We propose that the technological capabilities held by MNC-HQs present a paradox. On the one hand, they enhance MNC-HQs&apos; learning capabilities. On the other hand, they reduce MNC-HQs&apos; motivations to outsource knowledge from host countries. We also argue that it is important to consider both relative and absolute levels of technological capabilities, because relative levels can influence MNC-HQs&apos; motivations to source knowledge from host countries. Statistical findings generally support our arguments. Journal of International Business Studies (2008) 39, 291&ndash;303. doi:10.1057/palgrave.jibs.8400348

Abstract: We are grateful to Osegowitsch and Sammartino for their critical analysis of our work on the regional and global strategies of multinational enterprises (MNEs). In this response, we demonstrate that changing the quantitative thresholds for classifying MNEs as global vs non-global has no bearing on our earlier conclusions. First, very few global firms exist. Second, scholarly reflection on regional vs global MNE strategy requires substantive extensions of extant international business theory.
