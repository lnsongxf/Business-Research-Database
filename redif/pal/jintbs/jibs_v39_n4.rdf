Abstract: We test two alternative perspectives on the start-up size and subsequent growth of new firms in a heavily regulated (HR) economy and a lightly regulated (LR) economy. The first argues that, in an HR economy, there will be fewer new firms, and those that do start will be larger than those in an LR economy, but they will grow more slowly. A second perspective is that regulation does not influence the scale of entrepreneurship &ndash; merely its distribution between that which is registered and that which is not registered. Using parallel datasets for HR Spain and LR Britain we find some support for both perspectives. Specifically we find that registered new firms in Britain do start smaller than in Spain and do grow faster. However, when both registered and unregistered firms are included, these differences disappear. Journal of International Business Studies (2008) 39, 688&ndash;704. doi:10.1057/palgrave.jibs.8400340

Abstract: The type of activity in which entrepreneurs engage is likely to influence the potential contribution of entrepreneurship to economic growth and prosperity. Yet the entrepreneurship literature has focused largely on identifying the determinants of the level, rather than the type, of entrepreneurial activity. In this paper we hypothesize that a country&apos;s institutional environment will influence the allocation of entrepreneurial effort, and in particular will influence the extent to which entrepreneurial effort is directed toward high-growth activities. We test our hypotheses using data on 40 countries over the period 2002&ndash;2004. We find that the allocation of entrepreneurial effort toward high-growth activities is positively related to a country&apos;s financial and educational activities targeted at entrepreneurship, and is negatively related to a country&apos;s level of corruption. Our study is the first to provide empirical evidence that institutional characteristics significantly influence the allocation of entrepreneurial effort, and it is therefore the first to identify an empirically important channel through which a nation&apos;s institutions may contribute to economic growth.

Abstract: The effects of ISO 9000 diffusion on trade and foreign direct investment (FDI) have gone understudied. We employ panel data reported by OECD nations over the 1995&ndash;2002 period to estimate the impact of ISO adoptions on country-pair economic relations. We find ISO diffusion to have no effect in developed nations, but to positively pull FDI (i.e., enhancing inward FDI) and positively push trade (i.e., enhancing exports) in developing nations.

Abstract: New-technology-based firms (NTBFs) embarking on a strategy of rapid internationalisation choose foreign market entries that minimise transaction costs and the related risks of failure. Means to reduce the young firms&apos; vulnerability to the appropriation of intellectual capital are particularly important influences on early foreign market choices. We explore the effect of the institutional dimension, specifically the national regulatory environment, on the location choices and the speed of internationalisation by British and German NTBFs. We provide evidence that entrepreneurial young firms choose to enter country markets offering better regulatory protection for their intellectual property. This decision is moderated by a home regulatory regime bias. In contrast, we observe that the speed of internationalisation is influenced less by the foreign regulatory regime and more by industry and firm characteristics. We also observe that managerial experience influences the location choices of NTBFs facing regulatory hazards.

Abstract: This inductive study offers an examination of 23 cases in which informants from firms engaged in large-scale global projects reported unforeseen costs after failing to comprehend cognitive-cultural, normative, and/or regulative institutions in an unfamiliar host societal context. The study builds on the conceptual framework of institutional theory. The findings, which include propositions and a generic narrative model, contribute to theoretical knowledge of how institutional exceptions arise, how they are resolved, and how they typically involve three general phases: ignorance, sensemaking, and response. The findings also articulate the kinds of institutional transaction costs that an entrant incurs in each of the three phases, and the conditions that lead to the growth of these costs.

Abstract: This study addresses the essential question of causal complexity and diversity related to the influence of institutions on the direct investments (FDI) of multinational enterprises. Using a relatively new methodological approach of fuzzy-set analysis, and 47 host countries from the period 1999 to 2003, the paper analyses how and why countries with different degrees of membership in different institutional constraints either attract or do not attract FDI. The findings show that institutional factors have diverse influences. Similar institutions may even be associated with different outcomes if different regional categories of countries are examined. Countries may neither be attractive nor unattractive owing to the presence or absence of a single institutional factor. Instead, the outcome usually results from a combination of institutional conditions. Moreover, there typically are several possible paths to a specific outcome. The study confirms some of the propositions of previous theory, but, most importantly, it explains why earlier research has provided conflicting conclusions related to institutional factors. The study also offers an approach for future international business research to apply fuzzy-set methods and develop mid-range theories.

Abstract: This paper analyzes the effectiveness of laws against bribery abroad in inducing foreign investors to reduce their investments in corrupt countries. The laws are designed to reduce the supply of bribes by foreign investors by increasing the costs of bribing abroad. Such increase in costs will make foreign investors more sensitive to corruption, and induce them to reduce their investments in corrupt countries. However, the paper argues that these laws need to be implemented and coordinated in multiple countries to become effective. Otherwise, investors in a country will have incentives to bypass them when competitors from other countries are not bound by similar legal constrains. The empirical analysis shows that investors from countries that implemented the OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions of 1997 reduced their investments in corrupt countries. Investors from the US, which were bound by the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, also reduced investments in corrupt countries, but only after the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention was in place.

Abstract: This paper examines how social capital and organizational innovativeness influence business performance through their separate, indirect, or interactive effects, and how these effects differ across the institutional contexts of a transition economy and a market economy. In line with institutional theory, our findings show that the effects of social capital are more extensive and probably more malignant in a transition economy than in a market economy. Furthermore, different types of organizational innovativeness, as corporate culture, can be cultivated by different forms of social capital in different institutional contexts. The implications for institutional theory and social capital theory, and the managerial implications, are discussed.

Abstract: This paper examines the role of institutional analysis within the field of international business (IB) studies. Within IB, institutions matter, but the view of institutions tends to be &ldquo;thin&rdquo;, utilizing summary indicators rather than detailed description, and thus approaches institutions as unidimensional &ldquo;variables&rdquo; that impact on particular facets of business activity. This paper argues that IB research would be usefully advanced by greater attention to comparing the topography of institutional landscapes and understanding their diversity. A number of alternative case-based approaches are outlined that draw on a growing &ldquo;comparative capitalisms&rdquo; literature in sociology and political science. The paper develops a number of empirical examples to show the utility and limits of these approaches for IB scholars.

Abstract: We examine the product diversification of a multinational firm within each of its host-country markets. Based on a sample of 12,992 foreign subsidiaries of Japanese multinational firms, we find that higher levels of within-country product diversity led to higher subsidiary performance where the institutional strength of the local market was weak, and where a firm&apos;s corporate product diversity level was high. Our study highlights the importance of examining a multinational firm&apos;s strategy in its individual host-country markets, as influenced by the institutional characteristics of a host-country market and the corporate-level strategy of the multinational firm.

Abstract: We develop a theoretical framework for defensive and strategic restructuring, and provide estimates of restructuring in privatized firms in an advanced transition economy: Slovenia. Our rich data point to both types of restructuring, as well credit rationing and bargaining with respect to investment. Privatized firms display profit-maximizing behavior, and a firm&apos;s export orientation and institutional features, such as insider vs outsider privatization, employee ownership, and employee control, do not affect the firm&apos;s employment and investment behavior. The results suggest that a major exposure to world competition induces similar economic behavior in firms with different structural and institutional characteristics.
