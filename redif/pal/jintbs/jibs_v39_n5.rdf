Abstract: As competition for human capital intensifies, understanding how employees perceive their fit in a company can assist companies in harnessing the knowledge and skills needed to achieve competitive advantage. Building on the person&ndash;organization fit theoretical framework, we suggest that individual employee perceptions of globalization-related career opportunities represent a fit between individual and company capabilities and values. We find both similarities and differences between the relationships of individual- and company-level globalization capabilities and attitudes towards women (an important capability source) and globalization-related career perceptions within samples of 96 Iranian and 210 US employees.

Abstract: Using job announcements posted by MNC subsidiaries in Taiwan and Thailand, we investigated the effects of MNC home-country cultural and institutional forces on the use of employment gender and age discriminatory criteria in host countries where anti-discrimination legislation was absent. We examined the cultural effects with composite measures taken from the work of Hofstede and Schwartz. The effects of the existence of anti-age and anti-gender discrimination employment legislation in an MNC home country were also assessed to control for institutional factors. Logit analysis shows that MNC home-country culture and institutional environment can have a strong impact on the use of discriminatory criteria by MNCs in host countries, at least those lacking protective legislation. Specifically, MNCs based in countries that have existing and effective age and gender discrimination laws, and have more individualist and less masculine cultures, are less likely to engage in at least overt gender-based and age-based discrimination.

Abstract: Leveraging the recent research interest in emerging economies, this Perspective paper argues that an institution-based view of international business (IB) strategy has emerged. It is positioned as one leg that helps sustain the &ldquo;strategy tripod&rdquo; (the other two legs consisting of the industry- and resource-based views). We then review four diverse areas of substantive research: (1) antidumping as entry barriers; (2) competing in and out of India; (3) growing the firm in China; and (4) governing the corporation in emerging economies. Overall, we argue that an institution-based view of IB strategy, in combination with industry- and resource-based views, will not only help sustain a strategy tripod, but also shed significant light on the most fundamental questions confronting IB, such as &ldquo;What drives firm strategy and performance in IB?&rdquo;Journal of International Business Studies (2008) 39, 920&ndash;936. doi:10.1057/palgrave.jibs.8400377

Abstract: Subsidiaries of multinational firms play an important role in the globalization of innovation, yet we have an incomplete idea of the influences on their innovative activity. Drawing on prior research in international business and strategy, we identify two sets of factors that influence the absorption and utilization of knowledge in multinational corporation subsidiaries: (a) the range of external and internal knowledge sources available; and (b) the subsidiary capabilities associated with knowledge absorption and utilization. We find that knowledge absorbed from the host country is useful to subsidiary innovation. We also find support for the role of subsidiary capabilities: both sourcing capability and combinative capability have a significant influence on the scale and quality of innovation.

Abstract: In this paper, we use the country institutional profile to investigate how selected cognitive, normative, and regulative aspects of various countries relate to traditional gender role attitudes of managers from these countries. Our cross-level analyses, using hierarchical linear modeling, control for a number of individual characteristics (i.e., age, education, gender, and social class). Results support our hypotheses that managers&apos; traditional gender role attitudes relate positively to nation-level uncertainty avoidance and power distance. Moreover, the results support our predictions that gender egalitarian normative institutions, degree of regulation, and degree of educational development are negatively related to managers&apos; traditional gender role attitudes. However, results reject our hypotheses regarding nation-level religiosity, assertiveness, and masculinity, not showing the proposed relationship with managers&apos; traditional gender role attitudes. Implications for research and practice are discussed. Journal of International Business Studies (2008) 39, 795&ndash;813. doi:10.1057/palgrave.jibs.8400384

Abstract: Export performance models anchored in the industrial organization and resource-based theories have previously been developed and tested. Thus far there have been no empirically tested export performance models that have reflected the core tenets of the relational, or behavioral, paradigm. Drawing from relational exchange theory, a model that includes reciprocal perceptions that relate to both past and future exchanges is developed. This model is tested with dyadic data from 125 West&ndash;East (Australia&ndash;Thailand) exporter&ndash;importer partnerships, reflecting the increasing importance of West&ndash;East exchange relationships. Results support the theory&apos;s contention that commitment (to future exchanges) is associated with export performance, and is itself driven by a reciprocal cycle of each partner&apos;s perception of the other&apos;s commitment, relationship-specific investments and dependence. This cycle of commitment is in turn influenced by each partner&apos;s trust in the other (from past exchanges), with different types of trust linked to different types of commitment. Trust and commitment are then found to be related both to interpersonal factors (i.e., effective communication, cultural sensitivity and likeability of partner) and to firm factors (reputation and competencies of partner).

Abstract: The sensitivity of executive pay to share price performance has been the main focus of Western executive pay studies, reflecting shareholders&rsquo; efforts to reduce agency problems by better aligning the rewards of executives with their own. However, these studies have ignored motivational effects and possible two-way pay&ndash;performance causation. This paper reports Chinese executive pay&ndash;performance sensitivity, with international comparisons, to examine whether China&apos;s unique institutional environment has produced outcomes consistent with those for Western market economies. This same unique environment makes possible the first estimates of two-way causation based on panel data analysis. The results show that executive pay and firm performance mutually affect each other through both reward and motivation.

Abstract: Several recent studies have investigated international differences in advertising practices. Most of these address advertising in general, leaving the transferability of comparative advertising practices largely unexplored. Based on a theoretical framework of consumer skepticism toward novel information, we conducted a cross-national study to examine the effectiveness of comparative ad format and message content advertising executions under conditions of market and sponsor brand novelty, and loyalty toward the comparison brand. Analyses of responses from participants in France, the Netherlands, and the United States indicate that novelty of the brand and novelty of the practice of comparative advertising interact with various ad elements to produce both desirable and undesirable outcomes.

Abstract: Analyzing the timing, patterns, and competitive interactions of foreign direct investments (FDIs), we find evidence that Japanese automobile manufacturers compete selectively with their domestic rivals. While some firms appear to follow rivals&rsquo; investments, they also steer away from markets with incumbent Japanese competitors. Competing in some key markets, these firms also avoid unnecessary competition in other markets. This finding provides evidence that the &ldquo;bandwagon effect&rdquo; is not universal for FDI within oligopolistic industries.
