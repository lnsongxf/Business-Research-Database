Abstract: Do global marketing efforts, for example, those using television as a medium, impact on the values and life satisfaction of people, and, if so, is the process similar or different in various regions of the world? We empirically examine the relationship between television viewing, core values (i.e., religiosity and materialism), and perceived well-being factors (e.g., perceived socioeconomic status and relative life satisfaction). Data collected from the Western developed nations (e.g., United States and New Zealand) and several culturally homogeneous regions, including New Europe, Latin America, the Middle East, and the Far and Southeast, support the prevalence of diverse consumptionscapes with multiple global consumer cultures, rather than a single global culture. Globalization and advances in technology have not created global norms and homogenized our identities, but behavioral patterns and regional identities that are surprisingly durable. Specifically, materialism was shown to influence perceived socioeconomic status both positively (for two regions) and negatively (for two regions), and relative life satisfaction (except in New Europe), while perceived socioeconomic status had a positive influence on relative life satisfaction (except in New Europe and Latin America). The quantity of television viewing was positively shown to influence materialism, directly in some cases, as well as through perceived realism in others, providing limited support for the cultivation theory effect. Finally, religiosity was shown to play a countervailing role in negatively influencing materialism only in Latin American and Middle Eastern countries, and a positive influence on relative life satisfaction only in Latin America. The rationale behind the differences across regions was also explored. The overall results can perhaps be best explained by &ldquo;postmodern&rdquo; epistemologies, in which people worldwide are increasingly implicated, and in which new traditions are constantly being invented.

Abstract: A large body of literature has examined how managerial ownership affects corporate strategy and risk-taking. The present study extends this literature by investigating the effect of other forms of corporate ownership on a firm&rsquo;s equity risk (measured as the volatility of a company&rsquo;s stock returns) and stock returns in the People&rsquo;s Republic of China (PRC) &ndash; an important emerging economy that is rich in various forms of corporate ownership. We find that the various types of corporate ownership appear to have important but different impacts on equity risk and returns. In particular, companies with more state ownership tend to have higher stock volatility and lower stock returns; in contrast, companies with more legal-person ownership tend to have lower stock volatility and higher stock returns. Foreign and managerial ownership are found to have little effect on firms&rsquo; equity risk and returns. These findings support the predictions of agency theory &ndash; for example, that state ownership increases agency conflicts in companies because bureaucrats and state agencies do not have the same economic incentives to maximize the value of firms. We believe that our study contributes to the international business literature on investment strategy and risk assessment in developing markets such as China, and as a result our findings could have important implications for international investors.

Abstract: This paper examines the relationships between foreign ownership, managers&apos; independence in decision-making and exporting of foreign-invested firms in five European Union accession countries. Using a unique, hand-collected data set of 434 foreign-invested firms in Poland, Hungary, Slovenia, Slovakia and Estonia, we show that foreign investors&apos; ownership and control over strategic decisions are positively associated with export intensity, measured as the proportion of exports to total sales. The study also analyzes specific governance and control configurations in foreign-invested firms, showing that foreign equity and foreign control over business functions are complementary in terms of their effects on export intensity.

Abstract: Diversification benefits appear to be a major reason why investors choose international equity funds. Funds less correlated with the US market tend to receive higher flows from investors. In addition, investors prefer funds that invest in a diversified portfolio of securities from different regions in the world to funds that focus only on a specific region. Risk-adjusted return is shown to exert greater effect on flows into international equity funds than raw return. International equity funds from fund families offering a greater number of investment objectives also receive higher flows. On the other hand, international equity fund investors do not appear to be sensitive to expenses or exchange rates.

Abstract: Knowledge and learning are ascribed pivotal roles in firms&apos; internationalization processes: perceived market uncertainties, namely knowledge gaps related to business environments in foreign markets, may curb firms&apos; inclinations to commit resources to these markets. This study explores whether knowledge gaps tend to increase or decrease with time when operating in the foreign market, and it discusses which learning components narrow &ndash; or widen &ndash; the perceived knowledge gap. A theoretical model is developed based on the internationalization process view and the more recent organizational learning perspective, including such concepts as overconfidence and absorptive capacity. The theoretical model is tested on a set of primary data covering Danish and Swedish firms and their foreign market operations. The results suggest a more subtle relationship between experience and perceived knowledge gaps than the &ldquo;mechanical&rdquo; relationship portrayed by the internationalization process view &ndash; a relationship in which absorptive capacity and, in particular, overconfidence play important roles.

Abstract: I examine how a country&apos;s financial system influences assessments of firm-level risk. Consistent with theories of financial intermediation, I find that firms located in a country with a bank-oriented financial system are perceived as posing a lower credit risk and correspondingly are assigned higher credit ratings than otherwise similar firms in a market-oriented setting. Even after considering elements of a country&apos;s legal infrastructure that relate to creditor protection and insolvency proceedings, the financial system remains an important determinant of credit-rating assignment. The results are robust to the inclusion of several firm-level controls, including financial performance, industry, ownership concentration, political connections, and the ease with which the firm&apos;s assets can be monitored.

Abstract: This study is motivated by two research questions: (1) Which recent contributions have been driving the research agenda in international business? (2) Which emerging themes in the literature are likely to set the stage for future work? To examine these questions, the study examined scholarly work in international business over the time period 1996&ndash;2006 in six leading international business journals (Journal of International Business Studies, Management International Review, Journal of World Business, International Marketing Review, Journal of International Marketing, and International Business Review). Next, a Delphi study of the most prolific authors in these journals over the same time period was conducted to delineate a future research agenda in international business. Addressing these two research questions provides us with a more complete understanding of the progress made to date in international business research, and provides a glimpse of the future.

Abstract: This study investigates product innovation in market-seeking international joint ventures (IJVs) in a large emerging market, and tests two sets of hypotheses: organizational orientation and environmental adaptation. Drawing on organizational ecology theory, we suggest that IJVs&rsquo; product innovation can be understood as a consequence of organizational orientation defined by IJV contract specifications and as a subsequent response to major contingencies of the local environment. Empirically, we analyzed a longitudinal dataset consisting of 3555 IJVs in China from 1999 to 2003, and found strong support for both sets of hypotheses. Product innovation in IJVs is positively associated with initial conditions such as balanced ownership structure, state partnership, and project size; IJVs are more innovative when they operate in an industry with a faster pace of innovation or a higher level of foreign direct investment legitimization, and where they are located in a region with greater agglomerated innovative activities.
