Abstract: Although knowledge flows create value, the market often does not price them accordingly. We examine &ldquo;unintended&rdquo; knowledge flows that result from the cross-border movement of inventors (i.e., flows that result from the move, but do not go to the hiring firm). We find that the inventor&apos;s new country gains from her arrival above and beyond the knowledge flow benefits enjoyed by the firm that recruited her (National Learning by Immigration). Furthermore, the firm that lost the inventor also gains by receiving increased knowledge flows from that individual&apos;s new country and firm (Firm Learning from the Diaspora). Surprisingly, the latter effect is only twice as strong when the mover moves within the same multinational firm, suggesting that knowledge flows between inventors do not necessarily follow organizational boundaries, thus creating opportunities for public policy and firm strategy.

Abstract: We hypothesize that expatriate deployment is a control function predicted by home country culture dimensions with transaction cost and agency repercussions (rather than culture in the aggregate). This departure from the traditional conceptualization and measurement of cultural impact also yields a hypothesized asymmetrical effect, which is tested for a multi-country sample of 236 multinational subsidiaries. Using multiple measures of national culture, hypotheses are supported, with assertiveness and power distance confirmed as prime predictors of expatriate deployment.

Abstract: This paper analyzes the impact of globalization on the exit behavior of manufacturing firms in Belgium. Imports from low-wage countries are found to exert a strong competitive effect, which raises the likelihood of exit of firms in industries where intra-industry trade is relatively low. Similar to import competition, growing penetration by multinational firms in the industry has an equally strong competitive impact on the likelihood of exit of domestic firms. However, Belgian firms that offshore activities to non-European Union countries are able to substantially improve their chances of survival. This also holds for subsidiaries of multinational enterprises operating in Belgium. Unlike domestic firms, the likelihood of exit of subsidiaries of multinational enterprises is found to be less sensitive to domestic market conditions in the host country.

Abstract: While comparative studies of human resource management (HRM) are relatively plentiful, few have examined the way organisations in different countries train and develop their managers, or the impact of this upon firm performance. Given the centrality of management capability for corporate and national competitive performance, this represents an important area of enquiry. Utilising telephone interview data from the human resource development manager and a line manager in 482 domestic and multinational organisations in four European countries, patterns of management development (MD) are found to differ according to country and, to a lesser extent, by international strategy. However, a significantly greater amount of organisational performance is explained by internal MD strategies adopted by the organisations concerned and the credence accorded these by line managers.

Abstract: There has long been an interest in the effects of mentors on prot&eacute;g&eacute; career outcomes, and with scholars now beginning to examine mentoring across national boundaries. Using survey information as well as company records for 299 expatriates (163 men, 136 women) in 10 countries, we examined the impact of home- and host-country mentors upon expatriate effectiveness. We found that having a host-country mentor had a significant positive effect on the expatriate&apos;s organizational knowledge, organizational knowledge-sharing, job performance, promotability, and perceptions of teamwork. Having a home-country mentor had a significant positive effect only on organizational knowledge, job performance, and promotability. Surprisingly, our results revealed that having a home-country mentor had a significant but negative effect on the expatriate&apos;s organization identification and job satisfaction. Contrary to the literature, neither type of mentoring had a significant effect on job tension. Implications for practice as well as future research are detailed.

Abstract: The present study identifies a major limitation of current research on multinational enterprises (MNEs). Joint decision-making in a distributed setting is of critical importance in practice, but has received little attention in our theories. To address this gap in knowledge, we examine the effects of flexible decision teams when MNEs assess turbulent markets. Remarkably, flexible teams composed of fallible evaluators can outperform what is usually thought of as an &ldquo;optimal&rdquo; decision. Our main result supports the claims advanced in recent empirical studies. Structural flexibility can help MNEs achieve high levels of performance, even in conditions of turbulence.

Abstract: Cross-cultural researchers have questioned the extent to which European&ndash;American management practices can be transported to major markets in Asia, such as the People&apos;s Republic of China. Applying employee involvement theory, we examined the relationships between climate for autonomy, work demands climate, employee stress and organizational productivity in a cross-national study of 51 UK and 104 Chinese manufacturing organizations. We predicted and found that climate for autonomy was positively and negatively related to stress in the Chinese and UK contexts, respectively. The interaction of climate for autonomy and work demands climate was significant: climate for autonomy was positively related to organizational productivity only when work demands climate was low.

Abstract: This paper explores whether and how an important environmental issue such as climate change can not only give multinational enterprises the opportunity to develop &ldquo;green&rdquo; firm-specific advantages (FSAs), but also help reconfigure key FSAs that are viewed as the main sources of firms&apos; profitability, growth, and survival. We examine the nature and geography of such FSA development, and develop two organizing frameworks, which are subsequently applied to climate change, using information from Global 500 firms. Implications and future directions for international business research are indicated. Journal of International Business Studies (2008) 39, 1359&ndash;1378. doi:10.1057/jibs.2008.61
