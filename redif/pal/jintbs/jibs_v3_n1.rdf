Abstract: The yearly operations of a multinational firm involve a considerable amount of trade between the parent and its subsidiaries. These internal flows include both purchases and sales of raw materials, semi-finished and finished goods, and a wide range of services. They are often the single most important method of effecting capital transfers among the different countries in which the multinational firm operates and comprise an extremely secretive area of decision making.&copy; 1972 JIBS.

Abstract: The simulated international business negotiation has been developed as a pedagogical device to contribute to the special needs of education for international business. It was first used by Professor Kapoor in the Spring of 1968 and has since been employed in a variety of other courses with substantial success. It appears to have considerable promise in development both of intellectual capacities for formulation of international business strategy and development of personal behavioral skills in dealing with international environmental situations. This paper will outline the main characteristics of the simulations and discuss their practical utilization.&copy; 1972 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (1972) 3, 19&ndash;31

Abstract: This research examines a hypothesis, modified from one originally stated by Isaiah A. Litvak and Peter Banting,11Isaiah A. Litvak and Peter Banting, &ldquo;A Conceptual Framework for InterNational Business Arrangements,&rdquo; Marketting and the New Science of Planning, ed. Robert L. King (Chicago: American Marketting Association, 1968 Fall Conference Proceedings), pp. 460-467.   concerning the relationship of U.S. companies&rsquo; entry strategies into overseas country markets and those countries&rsquo; positions along an environmental &ldquo;temperature gradient&rdquo;. Although Litvak and Banting&rsquo;s original hypothesis was put forth to explain why international agent middlemen evolve into merchant middlemen, the analytical framework is relevant to explain the evolution of other marketing channel phenomena. The hypothesis is:&copy; 1972 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (1972) 3, 33&ndash;50

Abstract: The desire of Latin American governments to promote social, economic, and political development can create the necessity for hard choice between sometimes conflicting subaspects of the general developmental goal. An illustration of this is the conflict between the objective of promoting a qualitative and quantitative change in the goods and services produced by their national economies, and the desire for increased national independence defined as the attainment of complete autonomy of decision-making with respect to each economic sector. Such conflict stems from the technological implications of producing &ldquo;modern&rdquo; goods and services. To produce these goods efficiently it is imperative that the basic technical relationships of their production not be violated. This often implies heavy capital investment in product development, production process development, and the establishment of extensive distribution networks. The key prerequisite, however, is the organizational ability to develop, accumulate and coordinate the myriad physical and human resources necessary for producing the desired final output. It is often the case that a very high production volume is often required to permit the effective utilization of these technical and organizational inputs in order to minimize the unit costs of final output.&copy; 1972 JIBS.

Abstract: THE GENERAL LATIN AMERICAN VIEW OF PRIVATE FOREIGN INVESTMENT:The climate for private foreign direct investment is deteriorating rapidly in many countries of Latin America as the socialization of development is becoming not only more widespread, but also more leftist-oriented. Paradoxically, the gap between the lip-service paid to, and actual policies adopted regarding private foreign investment in this region, is increasing as rapidly as is the need for such external investment inflows. The contemporary Latin American attitude towards private foreign direct investment, especially with respect to investments by international corporations, is summarized below.&copy; 1972 JIBS.
