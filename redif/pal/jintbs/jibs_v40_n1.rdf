Abstract: Trust is a central construct in relationship marketing. Yet the literature provides mixed empirical evidence on the trust&ndash;performance linkage. Also, there is limited research on how to build trusting international buyer&ndash;seller relations. We develop a comprehensive model integrating performance-enhancing mechanisms and antecedent processes of trust in import&ndash;export relationships. Our survey results from importers trading with overseas manufacturers suggest that existing levels of trust have a positive effect on relationship performance outcomes achieved 1 year later. Importantly, trust takes on greater importance in enhancing performance under conditions of high interdependence, whereas in circumstances of low interdependence trust has no discernible effect. The findings also indicate that interfirm psychic distance, internal uncertainty, and exporter transaction-specific assets and opportunism are related to importer trust. Implications for academics and practitioners are addressed. Journal of International Business Studies (2009) 40, 132&ndash;155. doi:10.1057/palgrave.jibs.8400401

Title: A transaction cost rationale for private branding and its implications for the choice of domestic vs offshore outsourcing

Abstract: In this study, I take a transaction cost approach to explore the coincidence of private branding with offshore outsourcing &ndash; two retail trends that have attracted substantial attention but have never been analyzed concurrently. Retailers now play an increased role in marketing a product to shoppers, although their marketing efforts are usually specific to the supplier who brands the product. This is called brand specificity, a special case of asset specificity that drives up the cost of conducting the manufacturer&ndash;retailer transaction, especially when the parties are located in different nations. With the right to brand a product being shifted from manufacturers to retailers, private branding can eliminate this problem of brand specificity that inflicts a transaction cost penalty on offshore outsourcing, which is why the two seemingly unrelated retail trends coexist. Data obtained from a national chain reveal that the retailer is more likely to brand a product that needs its marketing efforts, but less motivated to outsource the product offshore before putting a private brand on it. These results establish a transaction cost link between private branding and offshore outsourcing, from which important theoretical and practical implications can be drawn.

Abstract: We extend the &ldquo;centers of excellence&rdquo; concept to address the diversity and multidimensionality of subsidiary competence. Using Rugman and Verbeke&apos;s diamond network model, we hypothesize the contingencies influencing the links between host-country environments and subsidiary competence configuration, and provide evidence from more than 2000 subsidiaries in seven European countries. Our results provide new insights into how multinational enterprises can overcome &ldquo;unbalanced&rdquo; national diamonds by acquiring complementary capabilities across borders.

Abstract: The paper presents a simple general equilibrium model that formalizes internationalization in the eclectic paradigm based on a reconfiguration of concepts taken from the new classical economics literature. The model enables us to address simultaneously the role of ownership, location and internalization advantages, and their interaction, in the emergence of the multinational enterprise (MNE) through a set of mathematical inequalities. Our model offers a bridge between the detached perceptions of the MNE often held by international trade economists and international business scholars, and makes specific aspects of the eclectic paradigm empirically testable.

Abstract: This paper presents new evidence on US multinational firms and shows that the decision to diversify internationally is endogenous, and depends on firm, industry, and home-country characteristics. US multinational firms are a self-selected sample, and firms that are more likely to diversify internationally have lower firm values. Contrary to the global diversification discount literature, multinational firms are valued at a premium after controlling for the endogeneity of the global diversification (foreign direct investment-FDI) decision. These results parallel the industrial diversification literature and underline the importance of controlling for endogeneity when examining the impact of international diversification on firm value.

Abstract: This study examines the performance consequences of international attention, defined as the extent to which headquarters executives in the multinational enterprise (MNE) invest time and effort in activities, communications, and discussions aimed at improving their understanding of the global marketplace. Using detailed questionnaire and archival data on 135 MNEs, our analysis revealed three significant findings. First, international attention can be operationalized as a meta-construct that consists of three interrelated and reinforcing dimensions. Second, international attention has a curvilinear (inverted U-shape) relationship with MNE performance. Third, the performance benefits of international attention increase with three categories of moderating factors: the international assignment experience of top executives, the independence of value-adding activities across country locations, and the degree of industry dynamism.

Abstract: This paper examines the regional effect of MNEs&apos; foreign subsidiary localization. We hypothesize that the number of subsequent foreign subsidiaries in a country is in part determined by a firm&apos;s prior foreign subsidiary activity at the regional level. We test our hypotheses using data on 1076 Japanese MNEs that created 3466 foreign subsidiaries (1837 wholly owned FDIs and 1629 joint ventures) over the period 1996&ndash;2001. We use a multilevel negative binomial approach with three levels of analysis: localization decisions in a country (49 countries), in a region (six regions) and at the headquarters level. In this way, we test the regional effects controlling for country and corporate dimensions. We also run separate models to differentiate wholly owned and joint venture localization decisions. Our results strongly support the semi-globalization perspective in that the regional-level effects are significant and different from the country-level effects for all foreign subsidiaries, for wholly owned subsidiaries and for jointly owned subsidiaries. Japanese MNEs adopt a regional perspective that complements their decisions at the country and firm levels. They seek regional agglomeration benefits and make arbitrage decisions between countries in the same region.

Abstract: This article first traces the changing world economic scenario for international business over the past two decades, and then goes on to examine its implications for the location of foreign direct investment and multinational enterprise activity. It suggests that many of the explanations of the 1970s and early 1980s need to be modified as firm-specific assets have become mobile across natural boundaries. A final section of the article examines the dynamic interface between the value-added activities of multinational enterprises in different locations.

Abstract: In the early development of the international business field, the focus of attention moved from the country level to the firm level, and interest in location issues declined. More recently, firm-based research has itself become increasingly concerned with the study of firm&ndash;location interactions. When examining two-way knowledge flows or spillovers between multinational enterprises (MNEs) and other actors in specific locations, the diversity or heterogeneity of firms matters, as does the diversity of locational environments. The localization of knowledge sources depends on MNE group-level strategies for growth and organizational decentralization, on subsidiary-level evolution towards local competence-creating efforts, and on the development of suitable business networks within locations. MNEs now have a greater potential to benefit from a synergistic locational portfolio of complementary sources of knowledge. The locational composition of the international network for knowledge sourcing of a given MNE depends upon the extent of institutional compatibility between the locations in which the MNE is active. This compatibility between locations in turn affects the capacity of the MNE to become an insider in local business systems, and to influence the local institutional environment.
