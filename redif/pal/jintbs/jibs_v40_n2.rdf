Abstract: The trend of increasing internationalization of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) is noteworthy, because such firms typically have far fewer financial and tangible resources than large multinational enterprises. As a result, international business is often more challenging for smaller firms. In this study we investigate the widespread internationalization of SMEs, and specific factors that support their superior performance abroad. We uncover a collection of intangible capabilities that are especially salient to these firms and their growing international involvement. We identify international business competence (IBC) as an intangible, overarching firm resource that engenders superior international performance in the international SME. Through case studies and a comprehensive literature review, we identify four dimensions of IBC. We devise and assess a model that links IBC to SME international performance. Results suggest that international orientation, international marketing skills, international innovativeness, and international market orientation are all significant dimensions of IBC, and that IBC is instrumental in SME international performance. We discuss resultant findings and offer managerial implications. Journal of International Business Studies (2009) 40, 255&ndash;273; doi:10.1057/palgrave.jibs.8400397

Abstract: Because of the strategic importance of organizational learning in a global economy, the knowledge that repatriates acquire during international assignments is a valuable resource. Few multinational enterprises, however, actively harvest this knowledge, and little quantitative empirical research on this topic exists to date. We propose an original model and propositions that delineate the facilitative and inhibiting factors affecting repatriate knowledge transfer to work units. We conclude with suggestions for future research and practical implications. Journal of International Business Studies (2009) 40, 181&ndash;199; doi:10.1057/palgrave.jibs.8400402

Abstract: Drawing from the resource-based view and a contingency approach, the authors develop and test a model of the antecedents of client-perceived value in the context of international, professional business-to-business services (consultants, engineers, project management, IT consultants, etc.) in a developing economies setting. Further, we examine the effects of key moderators (e.g., country-of-origin (COO), firm&apos;s international experience, client&apos;s buying experience) on client-perceived performance and value. The results generally support the hypotheses that client-perceived performance is impacted by a firm&apos;s internal resources (e.g., technical skills, customer orientation, innovation). In addition, this relationship is contingent upon the COO effect, while client-perceived value is moderated by the client&apos;s buying experience. The findings can guide practitioners as to the key drivers of client-perceived value, and under what conditions this value is maximized.

Abstract: Culture is a critical variable in international business (IB), and Leung, Bhagat, Buchan, Erez and Gibson (2005) enrich our understanding of its role. However, that said, their framing of this variable conflates the role of national culture (NC), a particular form of culture, with culture itself, a more pivotal, holistic and central construct. This paper, by commenting on and critiquing their approach, seeks to shift the theoretical center of gravity from a NC-centric paradigm to a culture-centric, constructivist one, and from a top-down, bottom-up view to a flatter, glocalized one. Implications are provided which suggest that research should address cultural processes of patterning and production, as well as cultural forms, such as global communities and global culture (GC), which share with or even capture the spotlight from NC as a focus for studying and developing IB cultural theory.

Abstract: This study examines predictors that lead to effective individual learning of global management competencies on expatriate assignments and the transfer (i.e., the application of those competencies) in new assignments upon repatriation. A structural equation model based on data from 305 Japanese repatriates identifies linkages from organizational support, intercultural personality characteristics, self-adjustment, and repatriation policies to outcomes of global competency learning and transfer, which in turn lead to heightened job motivation and performance.

Abstract: Using a sample of over 800 cross-border acquisitions during 1991&ndash;2004, we find that, contrary to general perception, cross-border acquisitions perform better in the long run if the acquirer and the target come from countries that are culturally more disparate. We use mainly the Hofstede measure of cultural dimensions to measure cultural distance, but also examine alternative proxies. The positive relationship of performance to cultural distance persists after controlling for several deal-specific variables and country-level fixed effects, and is robust to alternative specifications of long-term performance. Cash and friendly acquisitions tend to perform better in the long run. There is also some evidence of synergies when acquirers are from stronger economies relative to the targets.

Abstract: Alliances are recognized as an indispensable tool for managers operating in a global business environment, and as a fundamental stage of the internationalization process of the firm. Drawing on a co-evolutionary framework, this article investigates the mimetic and experiential effects in international alliance formation. We focus on a critical unresolved issue in the literature: what is the role of mimetic behavior and previous alliance experience in mitigating the uncertainty associated with engaging in cross-border operations? An event history analysis of 792 international marketing alliance formations initiated by 317 firms in the US pharmaceutical industry is employed to test the hypotheses. The findings of two different hazard rate models reveal significant complex effects of density and cross-border alliance experience on the propensity to engage in new international marketing alliances.

Abstract: Drawing on agency theory, corporate governance, and international business literatures, we develop arguments relating equity ownership structures and CEO compensation mix to a firm&apos;s choice of foreign market entry modes. Based on a sample of 432 foreign market entries by 118 non-diversified firms in the US manufacturing sector between 1991 and 1998, our findings indicate that greater equity ownership by institutional shareholders and inside directors is positively associated with a preference for full-control entry modes. In addition, our results suggest that CEOs with a greater proportion of pay tied to firm long-term performance are more inclined to choose full-control entry modes over shared-control modes.

Abstract: Despite the prominence of the competitive strategy perspective, it remains unclear whether foreign firms entering China can still adopt a differentiation or low-cost position to achieve superior performance, given the unique market and institutional environments in China. Alternatively, should foreign firms follow conventional wisdom and actively build managerial ties with government officials and business community to enhance their performance? This study develops and tests an interactive perspective that highlights the moderating effects of managerial ties on competitive position&ndash;performance relationships. The results indicate that though both differentiation and low-cost positions foster foreign firm profitability, the benefit of a differentiation position is conditional on political and business ties in different directions: political ties impede and business ties strengthen the positive effect of a differentiation position on foreign firms&apos; profitability. Moreover, foreign firms benefit from their use of business ties, but their profitability suffers when they rely increasingly on the heavy use of political ties.
