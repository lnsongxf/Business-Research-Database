Abstract: This research investigates hypotheses about differences between Chinese and American managers in the configuration of trusting relationships within their professional networks. Consistent with hypotheses about Chinese familial collectivism, an egocentric network survey found that affect- and cognition-based trust were more intertwined for Chinese than for American managers. In addition, the effect of economic exchange on affect-based trust was more positive for Chinese than for Americans, whereas the effect of friendship was more positive for Americans than for Chinese. Finally, the extent to which a given relationship was highly embedded in ties to third parties increased cognition-based trust for Chinese but not for Americans. Implications for cultural research and international business practices are discussed. Journal of International Business Studies (2009) 40, 490&ndash;508. doi:10.1057/palgrave.jibs.8400422

Abstract: The JIBS Statement of Editorial Policy states that &ldquo;Empirical submissions utilizing undergraduate student samples are usually discouraged.&rdquo; Wording is important here &ndash; &ldquo;usually&rdquo; does not imply &ldquo;always.&rdquo; This statement suggests that while student samples are appropriate, in principle, undergraduate ones are not, except in unusual situations. The purpose of this From the Editors column is to discuss the pros and cons of student samples in international business (IB) research. Are student samples appropriate for developing and testing IB theories? When are student samples appropriate, and when are they not appropriate? Is there a difference between undergraduate and graduate samples? What are the &ldquo;best practices&rdquo;? This editorial is intended to provide IB researchers with guidelines as to when student samples, and which types of student samples, are appropriate in IB research.

Abstract: While there is a vast amount of research on firms&rsquo; choice of ownership form when entering a foreign market, little attention has been paid to changes in ownership forms of operation abroad after initial entry. Using transaction cost economics and institutional theory we identify a number of factors that may help to explain the likelihood of foreign firms&rsquo; converting their joint venture with a local firm into a wholly owned subsidiary. We formulate a number of hypotheses and test them against data collected through a questionnaire survey of managers representing foreign subsidiaries in the People&apos;s Republic of China (PRC) that are run either as international joint ventures (IJVs) or as wholly owned foreign subsidiaries (WFOEs) that have recently been converted from IJVs into a WFOE. The paper contributes to research by showing that transaction-cost-based thinking is useful for explaining not only the initial choice of ownership mode when entering a new market, but also the potential subsequent changes of this ownership mode. By combining transaction cost theory with arguments from institutional theory, the study identifies a number of factors that contribute to explaining post-entry changes of foreign firms&rsquo; ownership forms in the PRC, and provides empirical evidence of this phenomenon.

Abstract: This paper examines the choice of mode for a multinational enterprise and a local firm to exploit their complementary capabilities. We develop a combined real options and game-theoretic model of modal choice by incorporating a range of factors drawn from the dynamic capabilities theory and transaction cost or organizational economics. The factors scrutinized in the model include the parties&apos; absorptive capacities, frictions in knowledge and asset markets and associated incentive problems, cost of switching from one mode to another and cost associated with power jockeying. The model uses simulation to examine how these factors interact to influence the choice of mode. The results identify a number of conditions for one factor to dominate another, and help to reconcile different theories that have made contradicting predictions with regard to the effects of such factors as uncertainty and capability divergence on the optimal choice of mode.

Abstract: This study examines the impact of national corporate governance models on inward foreign direct investment (FDI) in emerging economies. We consider three potential mechanisms, and conduct an empirical test of how family ownership and control in large group-affiliated firms in Taiwan affect joint venture investment from US and Japanese firms during the period 1988&ndash;1998. Results support the neo-institutional perspective of FDI developed in this study: the home-country corporate governance models are likely to shape foreign firms&rsquo; choice of local partners.

Abstract: This note provides an explanation for the presumably counterintuitive, negative correlations between values and practices reported by the Global Leadership and Organizational Behavior Effectiveness project. We argue that such results are compatible with basic microeconomic insights concerning diminishing marginal utility. This explanation implies that values surveys, as they are, generally elicit marginal preferences rather than underlying values. Therefore they are a problematic instrument for the measurement of cultures, and need to be improved so as to discriminate between the importance attached to an objective in general and that attached to it given current levels of satiation.

Abstract: Foreign operations are becoming increasingly important for US companies. We investigate whether the market&apos;s valuation of foreign earnings is a function of the firm&apos;s geographic segment disclosures. Specifically, we examine the effects of an increase in the number of geographic segments disclosed and the inclusion of earnings measures in geographic segment disclosures following the adoption of SFAS 131. We find strong evidence that our proxies for increased disclosure are positively associated with the valuation of foreign earnings. Our results are robust to a number of sensitivity analyses. Taken together, our results suggest that the pricing of foreign earnings is associated with important aspects of the firm&apos;s information environment.

Abstract: Scholars have noted that international investments have the potential to provide firms with real options value under uncertainty. To assess this issue, prior studies have tended to focus primarily on exchange rate volatility. Although multinational firms face other types of uncertainty as well, including those stemming from their domestic operating environment, the role of such uncertainty for firms&apos; flexibility needs has not been previously considered. In this study we compare the influence of both domestic economic uncertainty and exchange rate uncertainty on the real option value of international investments of Korean firms over 16 years of varying uncertainty. We find evidence that an international investment network characterized by greater breadth and lower depth is associated with higher firm value under domestic economic uncertainty. Exchange rate uncertainty, however, was not found to play a role in firms&apos; need for flexibility. The results suggest that firms are able to hedge exchange rate uncertainty by using mechanisms such as forward contracts or derivatives, thus potentially reducing the impact of this type of uncertainty on their operations.

Abstract: Foreign direct investment, particularly cross-border mergers and acquisitions can spawn a range of individual-level outcomes from cross-cultural adjustment and synergistic learning, on the positive side, to work alienation, on the negative. Unsuccessful navigation of these individual-level outcomes leads to failed integration that can seriously affect the realization of desired organizational outcomes such as successful technology transfer, knowledge-sharing, and the general realization of global growth. By means of an iterative between-methods triangulation, the study surfaces cross-cultural work alienation as a phenomenon that can limit the overall success of such ventures, and identifies interventions that help to promote successful post-merger integration.

Abstract: We conceptualize international assignees as informational boundary spanners between multinational enterprise units, and develop a cross-level model that explores how assignees&apos; social capital translates into inter-unit intellectual capital. First, as knowledge brokers, assignees create inter-unit intellectual capital by linking their home- and host-unit social capital, thereby enabling cross-unit access to previously unconnected knowledge resources. Second, as knowledge transmitters, assignees&apos; host-unit social capital facilitates their creation of individual intellectual capital, which, in turn, translates into inter-unit intellectual capital. We conclude that individual social capital needs to be explicitly transferred to the organizational level to have a sustained effect on inter-unit intellectual capital.
