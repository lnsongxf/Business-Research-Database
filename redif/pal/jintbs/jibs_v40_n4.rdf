Abstract: We question previous research assuming that privatizing firm performance generally benefits from decreasing state ownership and the passage of time, both of which purportedly align principal&ndash;agent incentives promoting organizational decision-making that increases shareholder value. When state ownership shifts from majority and controlling to minority and non-controlling, the performance impact may be positive in the short run, particularly where there is instability in the local investment policy environment. Consistent with this proposition, we develop and test hypotheses derived from a minority and non-controlling or &ldquo;residual&rdquo; state ownership framework, grounded in credible privatization and institutional theory. We propose that: (1) residual state ownership positively affects shareholder returns after strategic decisions by privatizing firms because it signals state support for managerial initiatives; (2) the passage of time since initial privatization negatively affects shareholder returns after strategic decisions by privatizing firms because initial undertakings in support of the privatizing firm are reversed; and (3) home-country investment policy stability moderates these two effects &ndash; greater stability obviates the need for residual state ownership, and slows policy reversals over time. We find empirical support for our residual state ownership framework in event study analyses of cumulative abnormal returns (&ldquo;CARs&rdquo;) associated with 196 major investments announced from 1986 to 2001 by 15 privatizing telecoms from around the world. CARs are positive at 5&ndash;25&percnt; state ownership levels but turn negative at higher state ownership levels. CARs turn sharply negative within 1&ndash;2 years from initial privatization dates. Increasing policy stability diminishes positive ownership and negative time effects on CARs. Results confirm the potential supporting role that residual state ownership can play in enhancing strategic decision-making and financial performance by privatizing firms, particularly where there is instability in the home-country investment policy environment.

Abstract: This paper develops a real options portfolio perspective on foreign affiliate divestments. Affiliates are less likely to be divested in response to adverse environmental change if they represent growth or switch option value to the multinational firm under conditions of macroeconomic uncertainty. However, the affiliate is partially redundant to the option value of the multinational firm&apos;s affiliate portfolio if the affiliate shares the manufacturing platform role in the host country with other affiliates, or if macroeconomic conditions of the host country are highly correlated with those of other countries in which the multinational firm operates affiliates. We find strong support for these arguments in tests on a comprehensive sample of 1078 Asian manufacturing affiliates of Japanese electronics multinationals.

Abstract: Licensing can be considered an initial trial of a foreign market before a firm fully commits to it through other investment modes. The length of trial has great importance, because licensing duration represents part of the licensing agreement. When it is too short, the firm may not acquire the necessary experience and knowledge of the foreign market, but if it is too long, the firm misses optimal expansion timing. Arguing that licensing can be considered as a European-style real option with a fixed holding period, we develop and test a model of the determinants of licensing duration in foreign markets. Empirical results based on a sample of firms in various countries show that uncertainty and threat of competitive pre-emption in the foreign market are related to shorter duration of the technology licensing agreements. We also find that irreversibility of the impending investment moderates the relationships between uncertainty and duration. Specifically, market and technology uncertainties in the foreign market induce shorter contracts under low levels of irreversibility.

Abstract: A recent Offshoring Research Network (ORN) global survey of offshoring shows that since 2004 management concerns about operational issues on achieving the benefits of offshoring have increased significantly. In this paper we examine inter-task interdependence, a key operational determinant of inter-site interaction and communications in offshoring. We analyze existing theories of interdependence to examine the extent to which they provide guidance for understanding the interaction and communication requirements between work segments that are offshored and distributed across the globe. Using a series of mini-cases on globally distributed work (GDW), we show how the traditional typology of interdependence developed in the 1960s and 1970s is no longer adequate for understanding and managing task interdependencies in GDW. We propose three concepts to address this problem: integration interdependence, &ldquo;hand-offs&rdquo;, and information &ldquo;stickiness&rdquo;. We then show how our revised typology of interdependence enables a better understanding of the interactions and communication requirements between sites. Using this revised theory we propose guidelines for work design, and examine their implications for practical offshoring and work-distribution decisions. Implications for theory and practice for MNEs engaged in offshore relationships are discussed. Journal of International Business Studies (2009) 40, 642&ndash;667. doi:10.1057/jibs.2008.77

Abstract: This paper investigates the extent to which different human resource management (HRM) practices work better in different countries. We also try to open the black box between HRM and multinational enterprise (MNE) subsidiary performance by considering mechanisms through which HRM practices affect MNE subsidiary performance. The study utilizes a unique data set consisting of subsidiaries of 241 MNEs operating in Russia, USA, and Finland. In the partial least-square analysis used to examine our hypotheses, we demonstrate that different HRM practices are preferable in different countries, and that motivation and ability are important mediating variables in the HRM&ndash;MNE subsidiary performance relationship.

Abstract: Channel communications in emerging markets are embedded in the intricacy of economic and sociocultural environments. Managing channel relationships in emerging markets therefore requires more than formal interfirm communication to rely on interpersonal influence. Extending embeddedness theory, we offer a conceptualization incorporating three embedding elements &ndash; task environment, social relations, and institutional norms &ndash; into a preliminary model that specifies the antecedents, moderators, and contingent consequences of interpersonal influence strategies in marketing channels. Specifically, dependence, firm boundary spanners&rsquo; social capital, and their cultural values (e.g., guanxi orientation) may combine to shape firm boundary spanners&rsquo; use of interpersonal influence in channel communications, which in turn affects channel member satisfaction. In a Chinese marketing channel context, we test our research hypotheses with parallel analyses of 395 matched supplier&ndash;retailer dyads. The empirical results provide general support for the predictions, and reveal differences between suppliers and retailers in terms of the focal effects.

Abstract: The globalization of brands is an evolutionary process that is determined by environmental and firm-level factors, including a brand&apos;s position in the firm&apos;s global brand architecture. A framework is developed incorporating aspects of environmental uncertainty, mimetic behavior, and experiential learning as they relate to the globalization of brands. Global brand architecture is introduced as an important strategic consideration of a brand&apos;s position and stage of internationalization. The hypotheses are tested within the context of the global automotive industry, employing an event history analysis with time-varying covariates. The results reveal complex effects with respect to the role of market attractiveness, experiential learning, and mimetic behavior in globalization patterns. Overall, this study suggests that firms can accelerate the process of creating global brands if they enter the three major continents in the early stages of international expansion.

Abstract: We examine how the organizational structure for diversification decisions involving firms from different countries is affected by the institutional context of the target country. Our theoretical analysis suggests that, as legal systems improve and information asymmetry is reduced, a transition from relational, &ldquo;firm-like&rdquo; arrangements to arm&apos;s length, &ldquo;market-like&rdquo; arrangements takes place. If institutions continue to improve, eventually a threshold is crossed after which arm&apos;s length deals edge out internal firm contracting. We provide an empirical test of the model using the sample of international strategic alliances, joint ventures and cross-border mergers involving US firms. Our empirical findings support the predictions of the theory. In addition, we document that US companies entering organizational structures predicted by our model are associated with greater abnormal returns around deal announcements.
