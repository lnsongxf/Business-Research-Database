Abstract: Combining international business research with the knowledge-based view, this paper examines factors affecting the export orientation and export performance of high-technology Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in an emerging economy. Using a unique, hand-collected dataset of 711 SMEs from Zhongguancun Science Park in China, it argues that export orientation and performance depend not only on the development of capabilities through R&#38;D and technology transfer, but also on entrepreneurial characteristics, such as the founder&apos;s international background and global networks. It is also shown that both export orientation and performance are positively associated with the presence of a &ldquo;returnee&rdquo; entrepreneur.

Abstract: With a 41-society sample of 9990 managers and professionals, we used hierarchical linear modeling to investigate the impact of both macro-level and micro-level predictors on subordinate influence ethics. While we found that both macro-level and micro-level predictors contributed to the model definition, we also found global agreement for a subordinate influence ethics hierarchy. Thus our findings provide evidence that developing a global model of subordinate ethics is possible, and should be based upon multiple criteria and multilevel variables.

Abstract: In this paper we explore the question of why firms offshore particular services to specific geographic locations. We draw on research related to the unique characteristics of services in trade and commerce, and more recent analyses of the transnational unbundling and spatial dispersion of business processes. We move beyond a simple assessment of the cost sensitivity or relative sophistication of offshoring services and develop a typology emphasizing the degree to which offshoring services activities are interactive, repetitive, or innovative. We suggest that the location of offshoring projects will depend on the particular mix of these attributes, and test this assertion using a data set of 595 export-oriented offshore services projects initiated from 2002 to 2005 by US and UK company parents in 45 developed and developing countries. We find that offshore location choices greatly depend on these services characteristics, and in sometimes surprising ways, and draw implications from our findings for international business theory, policy, and practice.

Abstract: Scholars typically view offshore outsourcing as a means of reducing the cost of manufacturing activities for large corporations, yet offshore outsourcing may entail administrative and technical services, and may include activities outsourced by small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Drawing on research in international entrepreneurship and services, we hypothesize and find evidence that offshore outsourcing of administrative and technical services by SMEs is associated with greater extent and scope of internationalization of sales. Offshore outsourcing enhances international competitiveness by enabling SMEs to reduce costs, expand relational ties, serve customers more effectively, free up scarce resources, and leverage capabilities of foreign partners.

Abstract: We contrast the knowledge spillovers perspective, which focuses on the externalities that arise from locating in a cluster, with the social ties perspective, which emphasizes resource flow through ethnic connections, arguing that these factors differentially influence the location decisions of foreign and domestic entrants in the services-offshoring industry in India. We develop a typology of the capabilities involved in the offshoring of services and, using 108 location decisions across 11 city clusters, find that ethnic networks exert greater influence than cluster capabilities on location decisions, although, as expected, the effect is stronger and more widespread in the case of Indian rather than foreign firms.

Abstract: This paper empirically studies determinants of decision by companies to offshore innovation activities. It uses survey data from the international Offshoring Research Network project to estimate the impact of managerial intentionality, past experience, and environmental factors on the probability of offshoring innovation projects. The results show that the emerging shortage of highly skilled science and engineering talent in the US and, more generally, the need to access qualified personnel are important explanatory factors for offshoring innovation decisions. Moreover, contrary to drivers of many other functions, labor arbitrage is less important than other forms of cost savings. The paper concludes with a discussion of the changing dynamics underlying offshoring of innovation activities, suggesting that companies are entering a global race for talent.

Abstract: Some argue that corporate finance and governance practices were among the root causes of the Asian crisis. It is alleged that high and increasing corporate debt ratios were partly to blame. This claim is overstated: only South Korea and arguably Thailand had leverage ratios significantly above the G7 range, and only South Korea had an income-gearing ratio higher than the G7. Although the reliance on short-term debt was high, there was no drastic change in the maturity structure of debt before the crash. However, conventional factors are relatively more successful in explaining leverage for firms that were less closely connected to the relationship-based financing system. Our paper links to ongoing research on investor protection, cronyism, connections between business and government, and business groups. It ends by commenting on the 2008 financial crisis, currently engulfing the world, and highlights some similarities and paradoxes.

Abstract: We examine the relationship between the foreign market entry strategy and the subsequent growth of a subsidiary. We build upon the Penrose theory of firm growth, and on the organizational economics, international management, and foreign market entry strategy literatures. We hypothesize that the post-entry growth of acquisitions is positively associated with weak and codifiable interdependence within the multinational enterprise network, whereas the post-entry growth of greenfield investments is positively related to strong and complex interdependence. Empirical findings from a sample of Japanese subsidiaries in the US lend support to our argument. Journal of International Business Studies (2009) 40, 1046&ndash;1063. doi:10.1057/jibs.2009.1

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the Journal of International Business Studies Special Issue on Offshoring Administrative and Technical Services (ATS). In doing so, we have attempted to locate the topic within the international business research tradition, as well as suggest challenges and opportunities that the phenomenon offers to theoretical and empirical research in the field. We examine the interplay of costs, knowledge, and innovation in the evolution of ATS offshoring from modest beginnings to its current stature as an accepted business practice. We suggest that understanding the continuing evolution of ATS offshoring requires researchers to take into account not only the business imperative of cost-saving, but also a more complex set of underlying factors and potential outcomes. We argue that the rapid growth of ATS offshoring has brought about an accumulation of resources, including financial flows, knowledge, infrastructure and human capital to create new platforms for knowledge creation and innovation. Low costs may characterize the initial conditions for offshoring, but they also provide the basis for up-market moves as firms increasingly pursue innovation-based strategies. We introduce the papers in the Special Issue as integral elements in our discussion, contributing new ideas that stimulated our thinking and, hopefully, will do the same for others seeking to understand this emerging area of globalization and international managerial practice.
