Abstract: Local firms may attract productivity spillovers from foreign investors, yet these vary with local firms&apos; awareness, capability and motivation to react to foreign entry. In consequence, spillovers vary across countries at different levels of economic development. We apply competitive dynamics theory to analyze these contextual moderators of spillovers, and test hypotheses thus derived in a meta-analysis of the empirical literature on spillovers. Our analysis suggests a curvilinear relationship between spillovers and the host country&apos;s level of development in terms of income, institutional framework and human capital.

Abstract: The last decade of work in corporate governance has shown that weak legal institutions at the country level hinder firms in emerging economies from accessing finance and technology affordably. To attract outside resources, these firms must often use external commitments for repayment. Research suggests that a common commitment mechanism is to borrow US securities laws, which involves listing the emerging economy firm&apos;s shares on a US exchange. This paper uses a quasi-natural experiment from Mexico to examine the conditions under which forming a strategic alliance with a foreign multinational firm is actually a superior mechanism for ensuring good corporate governance.

Abstract: This paper provides empirical evidence about born-global firms in the software industry of a small developing country with an open economy: Costa Rica. The paper is based on data collected through interviews with CEOs or founders of 40 Costa Rican software companies. Findings show that there are few born-global firms among Costa Rican software providers. We find that most companies followed a gradual approach to internationalization, and they did not export immediately upon birth. A careful analysis of firms that exported soon after they were born reveals that most firms are actually &ldquo;born regional.&rdquo;

Abstract: This paper proposes a multidimensional index of regional and global orientation that can be used in confirmatory studies with econometric methodologies. Unlike extant measures, the index is objectively scaled, and controls for home country orientation and market size differences. The index is shown to be consistent with models of internationalization that incorporate different assumptions about investment choice and global competition. Preliminary results show that large multinationals follow home region oriented internationalization paths, although much of the regional effect reported by previous studies in fact reflects strong home country biases.

Abstract: This paper examines the linkage effects of foreign direct investment (FDI) on firm-level productivity in Chinese manufacturing. It is found that FDI generates positive vertical linkage effects in Chinese manufacturing at both the national and regional levels, and limited positive horizontal spillovers at the regional level. While OECD firms gain from both vertical and (probably) horizontal linkages, Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwanese firms benefit only from backward linkage effects. In the domestic sector, in which we are most interested, both state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and non-SOEs are hurt by competition from foreign firms in the same industries. While SOEs gain from vertical linkages with foreign firms, non-SOEs are unable to do so. The patterns of productivity spillovers from FDI in Chinese manufacturing seem to be determined by one key factor &ndash; the technological capabilities of the firms involved. Important data limitations and policy implications of this research are discussed.

Abstract: We develop a simple test to assess whether horizontal spillover effects from multinational to domestic firms are endogenous to the market structure generated by the incremental entry of the same multinationals. In particular, we analyze the performance of a panel of 10,650 firms operating in Romania in the period 1995&ndash;2001. Controlling for the simultaneity bias in productivity estimates through semi-parametric techniques, we find that changes in domestic firms&apos; total factor productivity are positively related to the first foreign investment in a specific industry and region, but get significantly weaker and become negative as the number of multinationals that enter in the considered industry/region crosses a specific threshold. These changing marginal effects can explain the lack of horizontal spillovers arising in traditional model designs. We also find these effects to vary between manufacturing and services, suggesting as a possible explanation a strategic change in technology transfer decisions by multinational firms as the market structure evolves.

Abstract: Using a panel data set on Indonesian manufacturers from 1988 to 1996, this paper examines how host-country firms&rsquo; capabilities influence their propensity to benefit from downstream foreign direct investment (FDI). We estimate local suppliers&rsquo; productivity response to multinational entry in downstream industries. We find that firms with stronger production capabilities benefit less than others. In contrast, firms with greater absorptive capacity benefit more. These results are largely robust to the inclusion of firm fixed effects, industry-year and region-year fixed effects, and other controls, and indicate the importance of firm capabilities in moderating the effect of downstream FDI on productivity. Finally, we also find some evidence, though less robust, that firms with greater complementary capabilities (proxied by firm size) also benefit more from downstream FDI.

Abstract: What happens when multinational enterprises (MNEs) face competition in their own home market from imports or through foreign direct investment (FDI)? We provide a differentiated assessment of the influence of these two types of foreign competition on the product and geographic scope of MNEs. We apply the awareness&ndash;motivation&ndash;capability framework to international business (IB), hypothesizing that an increase or decrease in scope depends on the motivation and ability of an incumbent firm to respond to an incursion into its home market, and on the objectives and commitment of the firm that is entering that market. We assessed the scope changes of 407 large US firms between 1987 and 2003, and found that increasing imports led to scope reduction, while increasing FDI had the opposite effect. Our analysis of 95 large German firms for the same period led to similar, but somewhat less consistent, results.

Abstract: We test the relationship between the size of regional trade agreements (RTAs) and openness by using a gravity equation with multilateral trade factors. Our sample includes 11 RTAs, seven with constant membership and four with expanding membership. Regional trade bias declines with the size of the club; three of the four expanding RTAs have already surpassed their &ldquo;optimal&rdquo; size. We also explore the link between openness of the RTA and the geographic strategy of the multinational enterprise. We find strong evidence in favor of the regionalization strategy, which has been enhanced by the presence of RTAs.
