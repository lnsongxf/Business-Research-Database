Abstract: The extent of ownership in foreign market entry is an important topic in the entry mode literature. Yet the determinants of the share of ownership sought in cross-border acquisitions (CBAs) have not received much research attention. Drawing on multiple theoretical explanations, we develop and test hypotheses on factors influencing the share of equity sought by foreign firms in CBAs. Findings based on a sample of CBAs by US firms show that the share of equity sought is influenced by many factors, including the cost of valuing local firm assets, difficulty in integrating local firm managers in culturally distant countries, the cost of separating desired assets from the rest of the local firm, and the cost of resource commitment under exogenous uncertainty.

Abstract: Do headquarters influence the subsidiaries&apos; arrangements of vocational training in foreign countries? Our analyses of the amount of training offered to employees by organizations in 14 countries in which different training systems prevail (either continuing vocational training or initial vocational training) show that the cultural models of training diffuse between training systems in both directions. Independent from their own location, headquarters have the power to export their expectations concerning the training of employees to their subsidiaries that are located in countries with training systems different from those of the headquarters. This result is in accordance with the country-of-origin effect.

Abstract: Our study shows that preferred leadership prototypes held by female leaders differ from the prototypes held by male leaders, and that these prototype differences vary across countries, cultures, and especially industries. In general, female managers prefer participative, team oriented, and charismatic leadership prototype dimensions more than males. Contrary to popular belief, both males and females valued humane-oriented leadership equally. Gender egalitarianism and industry type were important moderators of the gender&ndash;leadership prototype relationship. Gender egalitarianism increased females&apos; desire for participative leadership, while prototype differences between genders were magnified in the finance and food industries.

Abstract: The present study reports two sets of meta-analyses of employee commitment across cultures. First, using three-level hierarchical linear modeling, differences in mean levels of commitment were investigated. We examined the effects of individualism&ndash;collectivism and power distance values and practices (Hofstede, GLOBE) while controlling for study and industry effects. The findings showed that affective commitment (across 48 countries), continuance commitment (31 countries) and normative commitment (30 countries) were influenced by country-level individualism and power distance. Greater collectivism was associated with higher normative commitment, and greater power distance was associated with higher continuance and normative commitment. Economic variables were found to exert a strong influence on affective and normative commitment means. Second, relationships between affective commitment and turnover intentions (across 26 countries) were found to be somewhat stronger in individualistic settings, whereas the normative commitment&ndash;turnover intentions relationships (across 10 countries) were stronger in collectivistic settings. Overall, absolute cross-cultural differences in all analyses were relatively small compared with differences due to study and industry effects, but country-level predictors accounted for substantive proportions of the variance between countries. Implications for commitment and cross-cultural research are discussed, and particular attention is drawn to the need to explore the meaning of commitment across cultural and economic contexts.

Abstract: The primary objective of this study is to examine the value implications of cross-border acquisitions of emerging-market multinationals (EMMs). We examine 433 mergers and acquisitions announcements associated with 58 EMMs during the sample period 1991&ndash;2004. The mergers and acquisitions announcements data come from the Thomson SDC Platinum database. We employ event study methodology to explore the impact of the announcements on the value of acquiring firms. The results show that, on average, cross-border expansions of EMMs through acquisitions do not create value, but point to value destruction for more than half of the transactions analyzed. To explore the factors influencing the direction and magnitude of market reaction, we analyze a cross-sectional sample of firms. While we find that target size, ownership structure of the target (private vs public), and structure of the bidder (diversified vs non-diversified) positively affect the bidder value, high-tech nature of the bidder and pursuit of targets in related industries negatively affect the bidder value. Our empirical findings provide some support for the positive impact of the stake pursued in the target firm and cultural distance, but not for the international experience and enhanced corporate governance.

Abstract: The initial public offering (IPO) is an important stage in the life cycle of privately held and entrepreneurial firms. For innovative firms eager to capitalize on their technological advances, an IPO represents a springboard for a rapid international expansion of sales. However, there is little research on the longer-term, post-IPO strategic evolution of newly listed companies, including their internationalization. We build on international entrepreneurship and dynamic capabilities perspectives and examine interrelationships between R&#38;D, exporting and growth of newly listed firms in the UK, Germany, Italy and France. Using panel data for 1110 IPOs during the period 1985&ndash;2004, we found that R&#38;D intensity is an important antecedent factor for internationalization of sales. Both R&#38;D and export intensities have a positive effect on the sales growth of newly listed firms. However, R&#38;D intensity is path dependent, and is determined by levels of accumulated intangible assets and debt. In terms of time dynamics, the growth of IPO firms is at its highest level just after the float, whereas export intensity increases as IPO firms mature. We conclude that managers and IPO investors need to take into account not only growth opportunities but also past innovation strategies and financial constraints on managers&apos; strategic choices.

Abstract: This study aims to bring together seemingly contradicting arguments in the literature about the role of cultural distance in international acquisitions. We offer a model that postulates that cultural distance relates negatively to international acquisition performance because it taxes integration capabilities during international acquisitions, but that cultural distance also elevates the positive association of integration capabilities and international acquisition performance because it provides more learning opportunities that can only be exploited with strong integration capabilities. Empirical tests with a sample of international acquisitions by 118 US multinational companies provide support for the proposed model. On one hand, we find that cultural distance impedes understandability of key capabilities that need to be transferred, and constrains communication between acquirers and their acquired units, bringing about a negative indirect effect on acquisition performance. On the other hand, we find that cultural distance enriches acquisitions by enhancing the positive effects of understandability and communication on acquisition performance. Acquirers that can overcome the impeding effects of cultural distance on understanding key capabilities and effective communication appear to reap significant performance gains. Our study provides initial support for a double-edged sword effect of cultural differences on acquisition performance, and illustrates the importance of integration capabilities.

Abstract: Localization in the corporate setting is the extent to which expatriate managers are replaced by local employees originally held by expatriate managers. We sampled 229 multinational enterprises (MNEs) in the People&apos;s Republic of China and investigated the antecedents of localization success based on resource dependency theory. We developed a 40-item scale to measure human resource (HR) practices determined to contribute to successful localization. We also identified parent company support and top management&apos;s commitment as two sets of factors that predicted localization success. It was the first study that found a significant relationship between localization success and top management ratings of company performance.

Abstract: Industry participants and observers view venture capital as fundamentally a local business. However, recent data show an increasing share of US venture capital investments flowing overseas. We suggest that cross-border venture capital flows are associated with the formation of &ldquo;transnational technical communities&rdquo; (TTCs), groups of immigrants active in both home- and host-country technical networks. Our results highlight the role of human networks as a mechanism of industry globalization, and support the view that TTCs are emerging economic actors in their own right.
