Abstract: The Uppsala internationalization process model is revisited in the light of changes in business practices and theoretical advances that have been made since 1977. Now the business environment is viewed as a web of relationships, a network, rather than as a neoclassical market with many independent suppliers and customers. Outsidership, in relation to the relevant network, more than psychic distance, is the root of uncertainty. The change mechanisms in the revised model are essentially the same as those in the original version, although we add trust-building and knowledge creation, the latter to recognize the fact that new knowledge is developed in relationships.

Abstract: Both Anderson and Gatignon and the Uppsala internationalization model see the initial mode of foreign market entry and subsequent modes of operation as unilaterally determined by multinational enterprises (MNEs) arbitraging control and risk and increasing their commitment as they gain experience in the target market. OLI and internalization models do recognize that foreign market entry requires the bundling of MNE and complementary local assets, which they call location or country-specific advantages, but implicitly assume that those assets are freely accessible to MNEs. In contrast to both of these MNE-centric views, I explicitly consider the transactional characteristics of complementary local assets and model foreign market entry as the optimal assignment of equity between their owners and MNEs. By looking at the relative efficiency of the different markets in which MNE and complementary local assets are traded, and at how these two categories of assets match, I am able to predict whether equity will be held by MNEs or by local firms, or shared between them, and whether MNEs will enter through greenfields, brownfields, or acquisitions. The bundling model I propose has interesting implications for the evolution of the MNE footprint in host countries, and for the reasons behind the emergence of Dragon MNEs.

Title: The end of the opportunism vs trust debate: Bounded reliability as a new envelope concept in research on MNE governance

Abstract: Modern transaction cost economics (TCE) thinking has developed into a key intellectual foundation of international business (IB) research, but the Williamsonian version has faced substantial criticism for adopting the behavioral assumption of opportunism. In this paper we assess both the opportunism concept and existing alternatives such as trust within the context of IB research, especially work on multinational enterprise (MNE) governance. Case analyses of nine global MNEs illustrate an alternative to the opportunism assumption that captures more fully the mechanisms underlying failed commitments inside the MNE. As a substitute for the often-criticized assumption of opportunism, we propose the envelope concept of bounded reliability (BRel), an assumption that represents more accurately and more completely the reasons for failed commitments, without invalidating the other critical assumption in conventional TCE (and internalization theory) thinking, namely the widely accepted envelope concept of bounded rationality (BRat). Bounded reliability as an envelope concept includes two main components, within the context of global MNE management: opportunism as intentional deceit, and benevolent preference reversal. The implications for IB research of adopting the bounded reliability concept are far reaching, as this concept may increase the legitimacy of comparative institutional analysis in the social sciences.

Abstract: This paper reviews the progress of the research agenda initiated by The Future of the Multinational Enterprise (1976). Focusing initially on the problem of explaining the existence of the multinational enterprise, the agenda soon broadened to encompass the analysis of alternative modes of foreign market entry, the role of international joint ventures, the impact of innovation on corporate growth, and the role of culture in international business. The core philosophy &ndash; based on the Coasian nature of the firm and on rational action modelling &ndash; has remained constant, while the widening range of applications has encouraged synthesis with theories developed in other fields of research. Success in answering any one question invariably generates new questions, which must in turn be answered through a further extension of the theory, and this dynamic continues to drive the development of the theory today. Internalisation theory has retained its validity and its vitality over the past 30 years, and is currently being extended into new fields of international business research.

Abstract: We address a long-standing discrepancy between theory and practice regarding how firms choose, use, and modify their modes of operation in foreign markets. Theory typically treats foreign operation modes as choices between well-specified, discrete alternatives. Observation of business practice reveals a &ldquo;messier&rdquo; reality. We commonly observe mode packages, within-mode adjustments and mode role changes, yet by and large these aspects of international business development have been relatively ignored in the literature, and in theoretical and empirical research. We propose richer and more realistic conceptualisations of foreign operation modes, and look at their implications for theory and practice.

Abstract: Reflecting amplified hazards in cross-border exchange and imperfections in markets for intangibles, internalization has been central in multinational enterprise (MNE) theory. This centrality notwithstanding, the fact is that internalization coheres with lower-powered incentives and carries an implicit drawback, namely, higher realized production costs. With the emergence and deployment of information and communication technology (ICT), modern MNEs are reshaping their transnational governance to address this cost. The modern MNE uses ICT to mitigate transaction costs, and evolves more to arm&apos;s length exchange to incentivize lower production costs. A testable prediction is that MNEs in industries more susceptible to and employing more ICT will exhibit a reduced propensity for transnational integration. We examine this hypothesis using available data from 1982 to 1997 for US MNEs across all manufacturing sectors. Regression results and robustness tests are strongly congruent with the prediction. This study, a first to explore empirically the role of ICT in the evolution of transnational exchange, suggests that MNE theory, until now founded primarily on transaction cost economics and a cross-border control theory of value capture, is more likely to keep pace with developments in MNE practice by opening up to incentive theories of exchange governance and a cross-border coordination theory of value creation.

Abstract: In countries with secure property rights, corporate transparency improves investment efficiency and increases growth by alleviating information asymmetry. However, in countries with insecure property rights, greater transparency can increase the risk of government expropriation. Therefore some firms that would benefit most from transparency cannot take full advantage of it, as they set sub-optimal transparency levels. Using data from 59 industries in 69 countries, we find that in countries with weak property rights protection, industries that would benefit the most from transparency exhibit worse investment efficiency and grow more slowly than industries that can efficiently operate at minimal levels of transparency.

Abstract: This paper examines the effect of global diversification on firm value using a data set of US firms from 1994 to 2002. We document that global diversification enhances firm value. Specifically, we find that Tobin&apos;s q, our proxy for firm value, increases with foreign sales (measured as a fraction of the firm&apos;s total sales), even after we control for well-known determinants of firm value. In contrast, we find no such evidence for industrial diversification. We find evidence of both financial and real effects driving such a value enhancement from global diversification. Furthermore, we find that the valuation benefits from global diversification are higher if the firm diversifies into countries with creditor rights that are stronger than those of the United States. Our results are also robust to controlling for the firm&apos;s endogenous choice to diversify across countries or across industries. Our study is anchored by the theories of both the financial and real dimensions of global diversification, and our results support both theories. Overall, our results provide a unifying view that global diversification benefits are driven by both the real and financial dimensions.
