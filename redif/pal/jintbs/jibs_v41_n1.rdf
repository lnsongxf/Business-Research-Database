Abstract: This study hypothesizes and tests whether the degree to which managers exercise earnings discretion relates to their value system (i.e., culture) as well as the institutional features (i.e., legal environment) of their country. We find that uncertainty avoidance and individualism dimensions of national culture explain managers&apos; earnings discretion across countries, and that this association varies with the strength of investor protection. This study extends prior literature by documenting that both national culture and institutional structure are important factors that explain corporate managers&apos; earnings discretion practices around the world, and that the influences of these factors on earnings discretion are conditional on each other.

Abstract: We examine how firms in an emerging market address their information disadvantage in takeovers. One strategy is to complete the acquisition sequentially rather than as a one-time deal. In contrast to firms in developed economies that enjoy relatively easy access to information, emerging-market firms face differential access to information on target firms, owing to institutional weaknesses and constraints in those markets. Sequential acquisitions are conceptualized as a real-option-based strategy, whereby the sequential acquirer resolves valuation uncertainty through information gathering and learning after making a toehold purchase. The value of a sequential acquisition strategy increases for firms that are at an information disadvantage. Statistical analysis, based on 272 completed acquisitions of Chinese listed firms between 1995 and 2003, shows that the sequential method is more likely to be chosen over a single-transaction mode when the acquirer is a private firm, or when the acquirer is diversifying into a new business area. Thus we offer a new way of viewing real option strategies in emerging economies, by treating sequential acquisitions as information and learning mechanisms as opposed to tools for hedging.

Abstract: This paper examines the boundaries of real options logic, with an application to joint ventures (JVs). We distinguish between forms of uncertainty that are resolved endogenously and those that are resolved exogenously, and theorize that only exogenous uncertainty will have the impact predicted by real options theory on a foreign investor&apos;s choice of how large an equity share to take in a JV. We theorize that macroeconomic and institutional variables generate exogenous uncertainty whereas, by contrast, cultural distance and choices pertaining to corporate scope and product or process development activities involve endogenous sources of uncertainty that investors can both assess and act upon without having to &ldquo;wait and see&rdquo;. Using a sample of 6472 Sino-foreign JVs, we find support for our predictions. We discuss and implement proper methods to test for the existence of null effects, as is relevant to establish the boundaries of a theory such as real options theory. We draw implications for research and practice on JVs &ndash; specifically equity share decisions, which deserve more attention &ndash; and real options, including suitable uses and desirable extensions of the concept.

Abstract: The benefits of openness to trade are well established, but the disadvantages of openness are less well understood. At the firm level trade is the principal source of exposure to exchange rate movements, and exchange exposure can be moderated by a range of hedging techniques. In this paper we ask two questions. First, do firms in open economies bear higher levels of exchange exposure than those in more closed economies? Second, is a strong corporate governance environment &ndash; one in which managers are incentivised to maximise shareholder value by hedging &ndash; associated with reduced firm-level exchange exposure? Using a sample of 3788 firms from 23 developed countries for the period 1984&ndash;2003, we show that the more open the economy, the more exposed are its firms to exchange rate movements, and this relation holds after controlling for firm size, industry and several financial variables. We also find a strong inverse relation between a firm&apos;s exchange exposure and the extent of creditor protection in the country in which it is based. This is consistent with managers acting to reduce the likelihood of financial distress in countries where bankruptcy costs are high, and it underlines the importance of institutional incentives in encouraging value-enhancing risk management activities.

Abstract: Among firms listed in Western Europe and East Asia, when creditor protection is strong, the controlling shareholder trades off retaining control in bad states through pyramiding against retaining the upside in good states via leverage. This result might arise because the controlling shareholder uses both leverage and pyramiding to expand control of resources, but in different circumstances since they have different outcomes under downside shocks. When creditor protection is weak, the controlling shareholder no longer prefers pyramiding in bad states, because creditors will not be able to seize the firm in bad states. Therefore pyramiding and leverage are used together.

Abstract: There is wide consensus that chief executive officers (CEOs) of US firms earn significantly more than their Canadian counterparts. Using a matched sample, we find that the majority of this difference is due to US CEOs earning 50&percnt; more than CEOs of Canadian non-cross-listed firms. We find no such &ldquo;US premium&rdquo; for Canadian cross-listed firms, because the use of options allows the cross-listed firms to keep pace with their neighbors to the south. While firms that list only in Canada compete in the labor market defined by their national boundary, cross-listed firms appear to be competing directly with their US counterparts for executive talent. In investigating alternative explanations for the elimination of the compensation differential for Canadian cross-listed firms, we find evidence consistent with both the bonding and the rent extraction hypotheses.

Abstract: This paper reports on a multimethod study of knowledge transfer in international acquisitions. Using questionnaire data we show that the transfer of technological know-how is facilitated by communication, visits &#38; meetings, and by time elapsed since acquisition, while the transfer of patents is associated with the articulability of the knowledge, the size of the acquired unit, and the recency of the acquisition. Using case study data, we show that the immediate post-acquisition period is characterized by imposed one-way transfers of knowledge from the acquirer to the acquired, but over time this gives way to high-quality reciprocal knowledge transfer.

Abstract: This paper provides researchers in the fields of international business and strategic management with information on the relative importance of home-country, industry, and firm influences on corporate profitability for firms with varying degrees of multinationality. The analysis relies principally on the Compustat Global reports for 1993&ndash;2003. The findings demonstrate that home-country and industry effects are more important to domestic firms than to multinationals. However, home-country influences are important even for firms with high degrees of multinationality. The evidence suggests that multinationals profit from industry-grounded opportunities to distribute activities across the countries in which they operate, but there are tradeoffs associated with internationalization. Multinationals may suffer from less protection afforded by the home-country environment and greater industry-level competition, but gain a broader scope for deploying idiosyncratic, firm-specific advantages through mechanisms enhanced by home-country experience. We conclude that industry effects in single-country studies should be interpreted carefully as influenced by the home countries of the multinational firms that are under study.

Abstract: International acquisitions intended to achieve knowledge transfers and improvements of innovation capacity can only be successful if the acquirer devotes balanced attention to (a) building a unified social community and (b) achieving requisite commonality in dominant logic. The balance between these two dimensions of success depends on the activity class considered: in some activity classes, imposing the acquiring firm&apos;s dominant logic will be dysfunctional, and therefore the post-acquisition managerial focus may need to shift towards social community building. Bresman, Birkinshaw and Nobel&apos;s (1999) acclaimed JIBS paper should be commended for identifying the social community dimension as a critical driver of international acquisition success.

Abstract: In this Retrospective, we summarise and discuss the findings of our 1999 JIBS paper &ldquo;Knowledge transfer in international acquisitions&rdquo;, and we consider how research in this area has evolved over the last decade. The paper&apos;s key contribution was to show how the post-acquisition integration process in a sample of three international acquisitions led to the creation of a &ldquo;social community&rdquo;, characterised by two-way knowledge-sharing between the acquirer and acquired companies. We discuss how the timing of this publication, as an early contribution to the knowledge-based perspective on the firm, helped its visibility; and we consider the boundary conditions around our findings.

Abstract: International acquisitions are today the most important foreign direct investment vehicle, and the ensuing integration processes are notoriously fraught with problems. We situate, discuss, and develop the main results of an early study in the knowledge-based view tradition &ndash; the award-winning Bresman, Birkinshaw, and Nobel (1999) article. To enhance and develop the central contributions regarding social communities, knowledge, and culture, we use the metaphor of unpacking the &ldquo;grey box&rdquo;. We argue that heavy socialization is a rational learning strategy, even if the acquirer aims at appropriating the target&apos;s technology or wishes to impose its dominant logic.
