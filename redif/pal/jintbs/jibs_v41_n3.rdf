Abstract: The re-emergence of the old world: MNEs and the emerging economies of China and IndiaAccording to projections of the National Intelligence Council, a US government think tank, by 2025 China and India will have the world&apos;s second- and fourth-largest economies, respectively. The world is changing before our eyes &ndash; within the memories of many readers of this journal, these economies were known for little other than abject poverty. Today they are the largest of the &ldquo;emerging market economies.&rdquo; Yet to apply this term to China and India is to fail to recognize the cycles of history. These countries have been the prime generators of wealth in the world for millennia, dwarfing even the Roman Empire at its height. As recently as 1820, China and India together accounted for almost half of world output (Maddison, 2001). For China and India, their current appearance on the world economic stage is better understood as re-emergence rather than emergence.While they are currently witnessing accelerating &ldquo;catch up&rdquo; processes with advanced market economies in many sectors (Mudambi, 2008), China and India are almost unique in having organized economies and a thriving tradition of entrepreneurship dating back to antiquity. These historical roots underpin the mainsprings of economic activity in these economies to this day, ranging from the wealthy and widespread Chinese diaspora (Yeung, 2004) to the dynamic Indian business communities (Khanna, 2007).It is important for managers in advanced economy multinational enterprises (MNEs) to recognize these institutional foundations, because as Gupta and Wang point out, in this compelling book, they pass up doing business in and with these two countries at their peril. With the growth of their markets and the increasing sophistication of their enormous workforces, ceding these economies to local or MNE competitors is not an option. In his incisive review of this timely book, Ramamurti highlights the book&apos;s critical message for practicing managers in advanced economy MNEs, while also pointing to significant implied research questions for international business (IB) scholars.Ram MudambiTemple University; JIBS Book Review EditorREFERENCESKhanna, T. 2007.

Abstract: We integrated the resource-, institution-, and industry-based views to investigate the determinants of export propensity and export intensity, and examined performance outcomes of firms&rsquo; export behaviors using the longitudinal data of 18,644 domestic private enterprises and foreign wholly owned subsidiaries in China from 2001 to 2005. We found that institutional environment has significant effects on export behaviors above and beyond the impact of firm competencies and industry factors. Furthermore, firm competencies have differential effects on firms&rsquo; export behaviors. Those firms that do not possess distinct firm competencies and those that have cost leadership competencies only do not benefit financially from exporting.

Abstract: While overseas acquisitions by emerging-economy firms are gaining increased attention from the business press, our understanding of whether and why this inorganic mode of international expansion creates value to acquirer firms is limited. We argue that international acquisitions facilitate internalization of tangible and intangible resources that are both difficult to trade through market transactions and take time to develop internally, thus constituting an important strategic lever of value creation for emerging-economy firms. Furthermore, the magnitude of value created will be higher when the target firms are located in advanced economic and institutional environments: country markets that carry the promise of higher quality of resources, and therefore, stronger complementarity to the existing capabilities of emerging-economy firms. An event study of 425 cross-border acquisitions by Indian firms during 2000&ndash;2007 supports our predictions.

Abstract: We propose that the establishment of a host-country headquarters (HCHQ) in a large emerging market can be viewed as part of a multinational enterprise&apos;s (MNE) political strategy to facilitate its within-country diversifications by reducing institutional intervention of the host government. Using a sample of MNEs in China in the period 1979&ndash;2005, we find that MNEs with an HCHQ had a greater number of subsequent diversifications in China, as compared with those MNEs without an HCHQ. This effect was more prominent when the diversifications were in domains with a higher level of institutional intervention.

Abstract: This paper examines the impact of ownership structures of emerging-market firms, which are shaped by local institutions, on the decision of these firms to undertake outward FDI. Our results suggest that family firms and firms with concentrated ownerships (both ubiquitous in emerging markets) are less likely to invest overseas, and that strategic equity holding by foreign investors facilitates outward FDI. We conclude that organisational forms such as family firms, which are optimal outcomes of institutions prevailing in emerging markets, may be suboptimal in a changing business environment in which outward FDI is necessary for access to resources and markets.

Abstract: In the current study, expansion of foreign investment in transition economies such as China is analyzed as an organizational selection process in a community ecology setting. Insights from organizational ecology are used to explain how institutional forces constrain ecological processes, together driving the evolution of the population size of foreign-invested enterprises (FIEs), privately held domestic firms, and state-owned domestic organizations. We argue that the variation in the relative forces of ecological processes and institutional constraints across FIEs and their domestic rivals accounts for the expansion of FIEs in China. On the one hand, in many transition economies, institutional constraints are imposed on foreign enterprises by regulation that limits FDI opportunities. On the other hand, after entry, foreign enterprises can benefit from their competitive advantages in their ecological struggle against domestic rivals. This logic produces different sets of hypotheses as to foreign enterprises&rsquo; density and sales growth, in interaction with domestic organizations. Using a data set of the Chinese construction industry in 29 provinces over the 1993&ndash;2006 period, estimation of a partial adjustment growth model produces support for our theoretical claim.

Abstract: This paper compares two real options &ndash; within-country growth and across-country operational flexibility &ndash; to examine subsidiary expansion/contraction during times of economic crisis. Specifically, we examine how the real options orientations of individual subsidiaries interact with the general characteristics of multinational enterprise networks. Our main findings are that: (a) economic crises can be detrimental for subsidiaries with stronger within-country orientations, and advantageous for those with stronger across-country orientations; and (b) network characteristics are not the sole determinants of subsidiary expansion/contraction &ndash; what really matters is how the real options orientations of individual subsidiaries mesh with the overall characteristics of the network they belong to.

Abstract: This study investigates an under-researched topic: the relationships between capabilities, resources, and international performance among entrepreneurial firms in an emerging economy. We combine the resource-based view of the firm and the capability-building perspective of rent creation to shed light on the crucial role of firm-specific capabilities that transform key resources into performance outcomes. Employing a large sample of Chinese entrepreneurial firms, our investigation demonstrates that while the resources of institutional capital and managerial ties are important in the internationalization effort, their effects on international performance are channeled through each firm&apos;s adaptive capability. This adaptive capability is the firm&apos;s ability to coordinate, recombine, and allocate resources to meet the different requirements of foreign markets. Specifically, our research is able to demonstrate support for the mediating role of capabilities in the relationship between resources and international performance. The implications of these findings for theoretical development and future research are discussed.

Abstract: Recent research emphasizes that corporate governance becomes critical during economic crises, when the incentives for expropriation of minority shareholders increase. Using the high-profile Asian financial crisis of 1997&ndash;1998 and a sample of 566 firms from eight East Asian countries over 1996&ndash;1999, we examine the link between family control and agency costs evident in the cost of equity financing for firms. We find that, before the crisis, family control is unrelated to firms&apos; equity financing costs, whereas, following the crisis, family control is related to a higher cost of equity. This suggests that the crisis made investors aware of the potential entrenchment of controlling families, prompting them to require a higher-equity premium from family firms. Our results are robust to various models of the cost of equity capital, additional firm- and country-level governance traits, and additional alternative explanations, including the presence of other types of large shareholders and potential survivorship bias. Our study contributes to our understanding of the corporate governance of family-controlled firms, especially during economic crises.

Abstract: The strategic transformation of Asian firms into global players has involved the adoption and adaptation of many organizational practices developed in the West. We build a process model of adaptation by observing how an organizational practice is adapted to a local setting different from its locus of origin, through inductive methods and case studies of Six Sigma implementation in Korean and US firms. Based on these cases, we propose a cascading, sequential pattern to the local adaptation of the conceptual, social and technical dimensions of organizational practices, reconciling conflicting views in the literature on whether or not to adapt. Our theoretical model highlights the importance of considering the different degrees of contextual influence on different underlying dimensions of a practice, and of configuring each dimension accordingly. Further, we suggest that the sequence and configuration of adaptation across different practice dimensions matter to the successful implementation of a practice across borders.

Abstract: In international joint ventures (IJVs), partner firms exert three types of management control: output, process, and social. Since management control critically influences IJV success, it is essential to understand what factors drive the development of the control system. Prior studies have focused mainly on IJVs&rsquo; internal conditions, and have largely neglected external institutional influences on IJV control. In this study we explore how host-country policies affect MNE partners&rsquo; control over their IJVs. Using a sample of IJVs in China, we find that MNE partners tend to exercise less output and process control when minority equity restriction is present, greater process control when they receive government incentives, and less social control when they are required to partner with state-owned enterprises. In contrast, the results of a post hoc analysis show that local partners&rsquo; control activities are not significantly influenced by these policies. Our findings provide new insights into IJV management by demonstrating the impacts of regulatory institutions on partners&rsquo; control activities.
