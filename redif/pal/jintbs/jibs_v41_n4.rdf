Abstract: As firms increasingly use licensing to exploit knowledge-based assets in global technology markets, appropriate structuring of these agreements has become an important line of research inquiry. One area that has received less attention is the nature of rights granted in inter-firm licensing relationships, although it is an important clause that has implications for profit generation from licensing of proprietary assets. Conceptualizing licensing rights in terms of number of licenses granted and exclusivity rights given to a licensee in a foreign market, this paper examines the determinants of these rights based on monopoly rents and transaction costs associated with different types of licensing contracts. Hypotheses are empirically tested through two studies, one based on large US manufacturing firms and the other on a cross-national sample of medium-sized firms actively involved in international technology licensing. Results from both studies show a greater propensity to use non-exclusive/multiple licensing when the licensed technology has greater potential to produce differentiated products, or when there is greater threat of substitutive technologies entering the market. On the other hand, innovative technologies and a higher degree of asset-specific investments required of the licensee for the technology are related to the use of single/exclusive licensing agreements.

Abstract: Global account management (GAM) has become a vital part of many multinational enterprises&rsquo; global marketing. Yet little is known about successful GAM strategies. In this study, we conceptualize GAM strategies, and develop and empirically test an integrated theoretical model that links GAM strategies to their drivers and outcomes. We find that: (1) global strategic priority and globalization are significant drivers of four GAM strategies &ndash; inter-country coordination, inter-organizational coordination, marketing activities standardization, and global integration; (2) inter-country and inter-organizational coordination have significant main effects on GAM performance, while global customer demand positively moderates the effects of marketing activities standardization and global integration on GAM performance; and (3) GAM performance significantly influences relationship continuity. We discuss the theoretical and managerial implications, and provide suggestions for future research.

Abstract: The escalation of international offshoring and outsourcing in recent years has resulted in a proliferation of &ldquo;hybrid products&rdquo; for the typical multinational enterprise, with multiple country affiliations for branding, design, manufacture, assembly and parts sourcing. However, little has been written regarding the impact of consumer animosity on such hybrid activities, or the role of universal values in a hybrid production animosity model. In this paper we extend the consumer animosity literature to a firm&apos;s global integration activities for hybrid products. We posit that consumers&rsquo; willingness to purchase (WTP) a complex hybrid product is negatively affected by partial production shifts to an animosity-evoking country, and that self-reported animosity toward the country predicts lower WTP above and beyond consumer ethnocentrism and perceived product quality. In addition, we hypothesize a negative relationship between conservation values and WTP hybrid foreign products, and a positive relationship between openness values and WTP hybrid foreign products. A study of 319 US consumers revealed consistent support for these hypotheses, with the exception of the conservation values &ndash; WTP relationship. Practical implications and future research directions are discussed.

Abstract: This paper studies multilevel determinants of product innovation by incumbent firms with data from 68 countries, covering over 25,000 firms in eight manufacturing sectors. The author assesses the predictions of interdisciplinary research on firm behavior in different contexts, which have emphasized that product innovation is affected by three sets of factors: the extent of global engagement, information spillovers, and market structure. The empirical model of the probability of observing a product innovation, a probit model, by a firm considers three levels of analysis: firm characteristics, industry characteristics, and the national context. The econometric evidence supports the global engagement and information spillovers hypotheses, but the evidence on the role of market structure is mixed. Regarding global engagement, the evidence suggests that product innovation by incumbent firms is positively correlated with the act of investing in R&#38;D and licensing of foreign technologies, and country-level average import tariffs reduce the probability of product innovation. Regarding information spillovers, the evidence also shows that a country&apos;s patent density is positively correlated with product innovation. In contrast, concerning the market structure hypotheses, country-level indicators of business density and of policy-induced costs of entry are not robustly correlated with product innovation.

Abstract: Extending earlier literature on diffusion of codes of good governance (CGGs) by integrating the effect of national culture, this study offers a novel perspective on cross-national diversity in the worldwide diffusion of corporate governance best practices. We argue that particular cultural dimensions affect the indicators (i.e., total number of codes per country and identity of issuing organizations) of such diffusion. For a sample of 67 countries our analysis reveals that individualist cultures have a stronger tendency to develop CGGs. In cultures with a high receptivity to power differences there is a higher probability that the first issuers are the government, directors&rsquo; or professional associations; whereas with low receptivity, the stock exchange and investors&rsquo; groups of issuers are more likely to initiate the first code. The effects of culture remain significant even after accounting for differences in legal systems and economic institutions, indicating that national culture may serve as a comprehensive indicator of the regulatory stance with respect to good governance. Indeed, the effect size is large enough to give pause (e.g., to a location choice), and possibly has relevance for strategic decision-making by international companies.

Abstract: With the rapid increase in the application of Western HR practices in emerging markets, it is crucial to investigate how non-Western employees react to Western HR practices such as pay for performance (PFP). We investigate employee reactions to PFP in emerging markets using China as a case. Our multilevel analyses, based on data from 574 engineers in 22 domestic firms and eight foreign firms in China, demonstrated that PFP was positively associated with conscientiousness at the individual level. In contrast, PFP was negatively related to employees&rsquo; organizational commitment and interpersonal helping at the organization level. This study suggests that the impact of &ldquo;culture distance&rdquo; associated with Western HR practices may be more likely to manifest itself in the collective entity than at the individual level. Employees of domestic firms reported significantly higher levels of performance appraisal satisfaction and justice perceptions than employees of foreign firms, which might explain why PFP was more widely implemented in domestic firms in China. The present results demonstrated that, in addition to the culture distance, the &ldquo;context distance&rdquo; between domestic and foreign firms may play a critical role in accruing benefits from PFP, indicating that PFP can be more beneficial to domestic firms than to foreign firms. The present findings provide practical implications for foreign firms operating in emerging markets.

Abstract: To obtain more funds from the institutional investors, private equity (PE) fund managers may report inflated valuations of private investee companies that are not yet sold. However, such overvaluations may result in a reputational cost when those investments are realized. Using evidence from 39 countries, we show that there are significant systematic biases in managers&apos; reporting of fund performance. We find that these biases depend on the accounting and legal environment in a country, and on proxies for the degree of information asymmetry between institutional investors and PE fund managers.

Abstract: This paper sequentially addresses a conceptual and an empirical goal. Our conceptual goal was to develop a globally relevant model of the relationship between work role stressors and strain using conservation of resources (COR) theory as our foundation. Stressors included in the model are role conflict and role ambiguity, with three resources &ndash; mastery, optimistic orientation, and self-esteem &ndash; as moderators on the stressor&ndash;strain relationship. With this conceptual framework developed, we explored our empirical goal, a test of the model using both societal-level and individual-level indicators. First, we pan-culturally tested the model across our seven-society sample. Next, we split these societies into high and low gross national income categories. Likewise, we split the respondents in our sample, regardless of their country, into high and low idiocentrism/individualism and allocentrism/collectivism categories and tested at these group levels. Our findings showed that personal resources &ndash; mastery, optimistic orientation, and self-esteem &ndash; generally served to buffer the experienced strain due to work role ambiguity and conflict. This study provides specific information that can assist the global business community in understanding how stress pervades their workforces. Overall, our findings offer substantial evidence that a global model of stress is truly viable, providing direction for future research on stress in the global workforce.

Abstract: Previous research on the role of cultural diversity in teams is equivocal, suggesting that cultural diversity&apos;s effect on teams is mediated by specific team processes, and moderated by contextual variables. To reconcile conflicting perspectives and past results, we propose that cultural diversity affects teams through process losses and gains associated with increased divergence and decreased convergence. We examine whether the level (surface-level vs deep-level) and type (cross-national vs intra-national) of cultural diversity affect these processes differently. We hypothesize that task complexity and structural aspects of the team, such as team size, team tenure, and team dispersion, moderate the effects of cultural diversity on teams. We test the hypotheses with a meta-analysis of 108 empirical studies on processes and performance in 10,632 teams. Results suggest that cultural diversity leads to process losses through task conflict and decreased social integration, but to process gains through increased creativity and satisfaction. The effects are almost identical for both levels and types of cultural diversity. Moderator analyses reveal that the effects of cultural diversity vary, depending on contextual influences, as well as on research design and sample characteristics. We propose an agenda for future research, and identify implications for managers.

Abstract: This paper examines the co-evolution of MNE activities and institutions external and internal to the firm. We develop a theoretical framework for this analysis that draws on the more recent writings of Douglass North on institutions as a response to complex forms of uncertainty associated with the rise in global economic interconnectedness, and of Richard Nelson on the co-evolution of technology and institutions. We link historical changes in the character of MNE activities to changes in the institutional environment, and highlight the scope for firm-level creativity and institutional entrepreneurship that may lead to co-evolution with the environment. We argue that the main drivers for institutional entrepreneurship are now found in the increasing autonomy of MNE subsidiaries. Thus MNE agency derives from more decentralized forms of experimentation in international corporate networks, which competence-creating nodes of new initiatives can co-evolve with local institutions. Unlike most other streams of related literature, our approach connects patterns of institutional change in wider business systems with more micro processes of variety generation and experimentation within and across individual firms. This form of co-evolutionary analysis is increasingly important to understanding the interrelationships between MNE activities and public policy.
