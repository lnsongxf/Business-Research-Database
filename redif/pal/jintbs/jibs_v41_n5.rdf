Abstract: The objective of this study is to advance a theoretical framework pertaining to how interpartner learning in international joint ventures (IJV) may affect IJV instability in emerging economies. The proposed framework expands the interpartner learning theory of IJV instability in the current literature, which is focused on absorptive learning of IJV partners, by incorporating IJV partners&rsquo; joint learning. Using longitudinal dyadic data from IJVs in China, we found that local and foreign IJV parties&rsquo; absorptive learning capacity decreases one party&apos;s dependence on the other, while joint learning capacity in IJV increases both parties&rsquo; dependence on each other. In addition, an IJV partner&apos;s absorptive learning capacity positively moderates the effect of joint learning capacity on its dependence on another partner. These findings lend support to the expanded interpartner learning perspective of IJV instability, and have important theoretical and managerial implications for IJVs in emerging economies. The results underscore the importance of the IJV actively developing organizational rules, procedures, and structures to create and embed new knowledge in order to maintain the stability of the IJV. Finally, we found that IJV partners&rsquo; dependence asymmetry increases IJV instability, whereas their total dependence decreases IJV instability.

Abstract: We examine articles published in the Journal of International Business Studies (JIBS) and introduce a typology to support the relevance of intra-country variation in international business (IB). Based on social network theory, our analysis uses multidimensional scaling to study 53,203 citations from 1158 qualifying JIBS articles to determine the journal&apos;s social structure. The results indicate that three current research clusters (multinational enterprise knowledge development, foreign entry and cultural effects, and the internationalization process and national culture) are based on established IB theory. Then we respond to calls in the literature to improve research concerning intra-country variation, and propose a typology of three dimensions (social, demographic, and geographic) to study the diversity of individual, firm, and economic activity in a country. The social dimension evaluates the importance of modernist and traditionalist values, the demographic dimension proposes differences between urban and rural settings, and the geographic dimension discusses the relevance of border and interior locations. We suggest a nested typology that unifies these three dimensions for continued use in IB. Future research opportunities related to JIBS&apos;s social structure and the intra-country variation typology are recommended.

Abstract: The international business literature measures links between the degree of internationalization (DOI) of a firm&apos;s activities and its performance. Implicit in this literature is the idea that there must be a positive relationship between DOI and performance. This paper argues that if the research design does not address the issue of causality, a positive relationship cannot necessarily be interpreted as meaning that DOI has improved performance. Furthermore, the research design should consider risk exposure. For example, if the riskiness of a firm fell as a result of a move abroad, then one can envision a negative relationship and also conclude that the move abroad paid off. Using detailed quarterly data over the period 1994&ndash;2004 on the distribution of Canadian banks&apos; assets across countries, and broken down by risk category, the analysis simultaneously accounts for endogeneity and risk exposure. The results establish a causal relationship between DOI and performance, but find that the nature of this relationship varies by bank, and also depends upon the riskiness associated with each bank&apos;s foreign asset exposures. These causal relationships are robust to the introduction of two formal risk measures: credit ratings and share price volatility. The authors discuss policy implications of their analysis.

Abstract: In spite of a notable interest surrounding the learning advantages of newness (LAN), centered on the emergent international entrepreneurship literature, we have only limited understanding of how young international new ventures (INVs) acquire learning advantages and avoid the liabilities of newness and foreignness in order to achieve LAN-related performance from early internationalization. In this article, two related but conceptually distinct capability upgrading constructs &ndash; knowledge capability upgrading and network capability upgrading &ndash; are identified to serve as mediating mechanisms that link entrepreneurial proclivity and LAN-related performance. Our findings from a sample of 436 young INVs from China provide supporting evidence for the mediating effect of capability upgrading, particularly among relatively larger new ventures and those operating with cost/price advantages in the international marketplace. This study fills a gap in the under-researched area of literature surrounding INVs from emerging economies, and demonstrates how young international venturing firms can leverage the entrepreneurial dynamics of learning to achieve growth opportunities from early internationalization.

Abstract: This paper investigates the effect of resource nationalism on the value of petroleum (crude oil and natural gas) reserves. We develop a framework for treating resource nationalism as political risk, and utilize data on reserve transactions (from John S. Herold) and political risk ratings (from International Country Risk Guide and Institutional Investor) for the period 2000&ndash;2006. Controlling for other factors that affect reserve value, we demonstrate the value destruction of political risk, and estimate the political risk discount for 37 countries. The paper contributes to both the international business literature and practitioner approaches to political risk analysis in demonstrating use of publicly available market data from real-asset transactions to measure the cost of political risk. We also show that the discount depends on market conditions: the higher expected future petroleum prices are, the larger is the discount at any level of political risk. This insight adds a new dimension to analysis of political risk, which is typically measured and examined without regard to market conditions.

Abstract: Although multinationals operate under cross-border jurisdictions, the relevance of interstate security relations to international business has received little attention. Despite the impressive accumulation of knowledge in international business and international relations, the two intellectual communities have largely ignored the insights from each other. In this article, we seek to bridge this gap. We argue that interstate military conflict and security alliances, as two central features of interstate security relations, often change both government policies toward international business and investor expectations of political risk. From the perspectives of both states and investors, military conflict should reduce bilateral investment whereas security alliances increase it. Our empirical analysis applies the system GMM estimator to a gravity model of bilateral investment flows for 1117 directed dyads among 58 countries from 1980 to 2000. Among 18 countries whose per capita real incomes remain consistently above 12,000 constant dollars, the security factors do not affect bilateral investment; in the high-income/low-income dyads, interstate military conflict and security alliances significantly influence bilateral investment as expected. The findings depict two separate realms in which international politics does and does not interfere with international business, helping us improve political risk assessments and understand the interactions between states and firms.

Abstract: Terrorism threatens international business (IB) through its direct and indirect effects. As governments tighten security at public sites, businesses have become more attractive terrorist targets, with important implications for the operations and performance of multinational firms. While terrorism has been substantially studied in other fields, there has been little scholarly research to address terrorism and the distinctive challenges that it poses for IB. In this article we conceptualize terrorism in relation to IB. We provide background on the dimensions and effects of terrorism, and develop a theoretical grounding for terrorism research by drawing on the literature from IB, economics, political science, and other fields. After discussing findings from the literature review, we offer a comprehensive agenda for future research regarding the relationship between terrorism and IB. Our agenda emphasizes the effects of terrorism, organizational preparedness, company strategy and performance, global supply chain and distribution channels, and human resource issues. Our review helps establish a baseline for future empirical research. Consistent with the early stages of research, IB scholars are encouraged to offer useful perspectives and effective solutions that shed needed light on terrorism and help reduce its destructive effects for IB and multinational firms.

Abstract: This study extends the literature on entrepreneurship in developing countries by offering a two-stage explanation for the paradoxical observation that enterprise activities often flourish under extreme adversity. Our findings complement the base-of-pyramid and peace-through-commerce attention to the growing role of business in international development by fleshing out the functions of enterprise resilience under terrorism. We first explain how terrorism conditions (outbreak, escalation, and reduction) may create psychological incentives for enterprise resilience; then we show that, controlling for ex ante terrorism conditions, enterprise resilience yields more favorable economic payoffs at higher levels of terrorism, especially for informal entrepreneurs.

Abstract: Building on institutional and transaction cost economics, this article proposes that legal enforceability increases the use of contract over relational reliability (e.g., beliefs that the other party acts in a non-opportunistic manner) to safeguard market exchanges characterized by non-trivial hazards. The results of 399 buyer&ndash;supplier exchanges in China show that: (1) when managers perceive that the legal system can protect their firm&apos;s interests, they tend to use explicit contracts rather than relational reliability to safeguard transactions involving risks (i.e., asset specificity, environmental uncertainty, and behavioral uncertainty); and (2) when managers do not perceive the legal system as credible, they are less likely to use contracts, and instead rely on relational reliability to safeguard transactions associated with specialized assets and environmental uncertainty, but not those involving behavioral uncertainty. We further find that legal enforceability does not moderate the effect of relational reliability on contracts, but does weaken the effect of contracts on relational reliability. These results endorse the importance of prior experience (e.g., relational reliability) in supporting the use of explicit contracts, and alternatively suggest that, under conditions of greater legal enforceability, the contract signals less regarding one&apos;s intention to be trustworthy but more about the efficacy of sanctions.
