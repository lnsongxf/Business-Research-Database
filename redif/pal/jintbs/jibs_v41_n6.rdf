Abstract: An empirical analysis of imputed returns on international and domestic sales suggests that neither US nor Japanese manufacturing firms consistently used domestic profits to subsidize foreign operations. Apart from the early 1990s, when the yen was particularly strong, Japanese firms generally realized higher profits in foreign markets than in their domestic market, opposite to the conventional direction for cross-subsidization. US firms also tended to have higher estimated returns from foreign markets after 1985. Our results are consistent with Hymer&apos;s theory of ownership advantage, which posits that firms with successful foreign operations must have specific advantages, relative to local firms.

Abstract: Vulnerability is salient among international managers, who tend to be wary when operating in transition economies like China. Systematic research is lacking, though, on how the local environment influences foreign managers&rsquo; perception of vulnerability, and how foreign managers can develop trust even when their perceived vulnerability is high. We conducted in-depth case studies of two foreign-controlled enterprises in China, and developed a theoretical model that links perceptions of the macro-level environment to micro-level management. Our results illustrate the antecedents and consequences of perceived vulnerability and the processes of trust building in unfavorable environments. Through comparative analysis of the two cases, we found that the foreign managers&rsquo; perceived vulnerability was shaped by the institutional, technological, and market conditions of the local environment, and we learned how this perceived vulnerability influenced their trust in the local workforce and the joint investment in formal and social control they used in building trust. The effect of perceived vulnerability on trust was moderated over time when the implementation of control was combined with active investments in trust, which led to behavioral changes on the part of the local employees, which in turn increased their trustworthiness. The implications of these findings are discussed.

Abstract: Participants in international bargaining include different types (nation states, MNEs, NGOs, and multilateral organizations) and different numbers of these actors. Our theoretical contribution is to extend the bargaining power paradigm with a framework that models bargaining in this complex environment as a network. The configuration of supports and constraints among all participating actors in the bargaining environment is captured in the structure of the network. Antecedents of an actor&apos;s bargaining influence in the network include the actor&apos;s basis of power, network position, bargaining outcome preferences, and motivation to influence bargaining. The network bargaining power (NBP) model uses network theory to build upon and integrate insights from previous literature in a way that allows us to simultaneously apply these different insights to explain bargaining outcomes. These insights include effects of coalitions, strategies of less powerful actors leveraging more powerful allies, integration of international and domestic politics, and applicability to MNE-related issues beyond FDI. Finally, we illustrate NBP in a scenario of privatized utilities in the Dominican Republic, in which the bargaining power outcome predicted by NBP differs from that of the canonical bargaining power perspective.

Abstract: We analyze the US equity holdings of more than 3000 non-US-based mutual funds from 22 countries and find robust evidence that fund managers strongly prefer to invest in stocks of US firms that have presence in their home country. This &ldquo;home bias&rdquo; is independent of the degree of global involvement and visibility of these US firms. While these firms have significantly greater exposure to local equity markets, their local presence offers little information advantage to local fund managers. Our findings suggest that the lack of international diversification is more serious than currently documented in the literature.

Abstract: In this paper a theoretical framework is developed to explain why multinational enterprises invest in infrastructure through the mode of project finance (PF) instead of using corporate finance. Infrastructure assets are susceptible to creeping expropriation from host governments, and to hold-up from concentrated suppliers/buyers. Corporate finance-based foreign direct investment (FDI) cannot fully mitigate these threats. However, PF-based FDI through strategic use of capital structure &ndash; chiefly high leverage and syndicate structure of debt &ndash; improves the bargaining position of firms in ex post recontracting negotiations. High leverage precommits cash flows, serves as a monitoring and early warning mechanism that reveals creeping expropriation, induces lenders to join renegotiations and reduces reported net profits. The syndicate structure of debt creates a reputation effect for host countries. High debt shields wealth from concentrated suppliers/buyers while separate incorporation in PF allows suppliers/buyers to hold equity stakes. This theoretical framework is tested by assembling a database of 200 investments worth &dollar;159.97 billion, by 167 firms, in 128 countries over 17 years. Sample selection bias is controlled for through Heckman probit specification. The hypothesis that PF-based FDI helps mitigate hold-up from concentrated suppliers/buyers finds strong support, while the hypothesis that PF mitigates country risk finds limited support.

Abstract: In this study I propose a general transaction-cost economics (TCE) model of international business institutions, in which cross-border transactions can be conducted at multiple market levels (e.g., output, asset, and equity), and the buyer&ndash;seller relationship can go both ways (A sells to B, and B sells to A). This general model addresses two major gaps in the literature. First, although market failure is the driving force behind the rise of multinational enterprises (MNEs), most researchers have focused on the failure of a single market without exploring the presence of substitute markets for cross-border transactions. Second, many previous studies have begun their analysis with a bilateral setup between an MNE and an indigenous firm (for example, a licensing agreement), but concluded with a unilateral decision made by the MNE to evade the indigenous firm (in the case of direct investment). In bridging the two literature gaps, I propose a general TCE model to integrate all institutional modes available to firms for governing international business, such as licensing, outsourcing, acquisitions, and joint ventures. Built on a multi-market framework, my analysis reveals that the choice of the optimal international business institution is tantamount to the selection of the most efficient market to conduct cross-border transactions. Drawing on a bilateral setup, it explicitly recognizes the power of reciprocity in solving the problem of market failure. This distinct approach points out promising directions for future researchers to advance international business studies, particularly after my transaction-level analysis has been expanded to also consider institutional contexts and firm capabilities.

Abstract: Prior studies have shown that institutional hazards in the form of formal governance deficiencies and informal cultural distance are both negatively related to the amount of foreign multinational activity in countries. We argue that the strength of these negative relationships varies systematically with the type of foreign activity (horizontal or vertical) and the type of institutional hazard (governance or cultural). Because institutional hazards striking vertical affiliates generally also have negative consequences for other parts of a multinational enterprise (MNE) while those striking horizontal affiliates do not, we hypothesize that institutional hazards are more negatively related to vertical foreign activity than to horizontal foreign activity. Since cultural hazards can generally be reduced or resolved once they materialize while governance hazards cannot, we also hypothesize that the impact of governance hazards on each type of foreign activity is more negative than the impact of cultural hazards on that type of activity. A panel data analysis of sales by US foreign affiliates to affiliated and local unaffiliated customers over the period 1996&ndash;2004 lends support to these hypotheses. Our findings thus show that the impact of institutional hazards on foreign MNE activity is more complex than previously assumed.

Abstract: Recent international business research on international joint ventures focuses on how firms can use such ventures for knowledge access and learning to enhance their competitiveness, thereby increasing competition in the industry. By contrast, research in industrial organization economics has observed that firms can also use joint ventures in various ways to attenuate competition. In this paper, we join these two streams of research to investigate the conditions under which joint ventures reduce or enhance competition by empirically testing the effects of different types of joint ventures on industry profitability. Our results suggest that joint ventures can be pro-competitive or anti-competitive, depending on whether or not they are formed between competing firms, represent foreign market entry, and operate in relatively concentrated industries. Our paper shows the importance of adopting a contingent approach to evaluating the competitive implications of joint ventures, and it also points to the value of reinvigorating international business research on the competitive context and consequences of interfirm collaboration.
