Abstract: The study of culture and cultural values continues to be hotly debated among cross-cultural researchers worldwide. Starting with the seminal work of Kluckhohn and Strodtbeck, and Hofstede, and continuing with more recent efforts, researchers have continued to develop and empirically examine cultural value frameworks in an attempt to understand how cultural differences affect work-related behaviors and attitudes. The purpose of this commentary is to briefly describe the interesting &ndash; and counterintuitive &ndash; findings from the Global Leadership and Organizational Behavior Effectiveness (GLOBE) project, summarize the different interpretations of these findings offered by Maseland and van Hoorn, and by Brewer and Venaik, provide a critique of their arguments, and finally offer a list of possible alternative interpretations and explanations for the conflicting findings in the GLOBE study.

Abstract: In spite of the proliferation of research on cultural differences in international mergers and acquisitions, we lack systematic analyses of the impact of cultural factors on knowledge transfer. In this paper, we argue that both national and organizational cultural differences and cultural integration in the form of cultural convergence and crossvergence affect knowledge transfer in acquisitions. We develop specific hypotheses concerning the nature of these effects, and test our hypotheses with data on international acquisitions carried out by Finnish corporations. The analyses performed show that national cultural differences provide great potential for knowledge transfer in international acquisitions. Furthermore, organizational cultural convergence and crossvergence have a significant positive impact on knowledge transfer. In particular, convergence and crossvergence moderate the impact of national cultural differences on knowledge transfer.

Abstract: This interdisciplinary study examines how national culture affects corporate dividend policies. The dividend puzzle is one of the most studied, yet unresolved, issues in financial economics. Prior theoretical and empirical research has suggested several explanations of the dividend puzzle that are rooted mainly in agency, asymmetric information, &ldquo;bird in hand&rdquo;, and pecking order theories. The main intuition behind our analysis is that dividend policy may be determined not only by an objective assessment of the severity of agency and asymmetric information problems within a firm, but also by management&apos;s and investors&rsquo; subjective perceptions of these problems, which hinge on their national culture. Using Schwartz&apos;s national culture dimensions, Conservatism and Mastery, we find that Conservatism is positively related and Mastery negatively related to dividend payouts for a sample of 27,462 firm-years from 21 countries between 1995 and 2007. These effects are robust to controls for a wide variety of other determinants of dividend policy &ndash; including investor protection, stock market performance, financial system configuration, tax advantage, economic development, and dividend catering premium &ndash; and to alternative culture proxies and sub-period windows. Our findings that national culture affects perceptions of and responses to agency and information asymmetry have important implications for policymakers and multinational enterprises.

Abstract: This is a critical summary review of the debate about the Global Leadership and Organizational Behavior Effectiveness (GLOBE) study in JIBS and other journals between November 2006 and the present issue. Several contributors did not realize that GLOBE used three essential constructs taken from my publications in a sense entirely different from mine: values, practices, and organizational culture. Not recognizing the ensuing confusion, they had no answer for the question in my 2006 review: what did GLOBE really measure? If you do not know what you are talking about, you can continue arguing for ever. Beyond the fuzziness of what is measured, the debate leaves us with an even more fundamental question: what is the use of the GLOBE dimensions?

Abstract: The GLOBE study of national cultures identified nine dimensions of culture. These nine dimensions were measured in the form of societal practices (as things are) and societal values (as things should be). The correlations between practices and values for societies, surprisingly, were found to be significantly negative for seven dimensions. Apparently, people&apos;s values are contrary to their practices. A note, which appeared in a recent issue of this journal, proposes that these anomalous correlations result from diminishing marginal utility. The note argues that marginal utility theory applies to cultural dimensions, and that the GLOBE values measure societies&rsquo; marginal preferences for most of the dimensions, rather than total preference weights. Through close analysis of the questionnaire items used by the GLOBE team, we show that this is not the case. We demonstrate that the GLOBE questions, as asked, do not elicit marginal preferences. In fact they elicit values, as claimed by GLOBE, but recognizing that values may well be shaped, in part, by existing practices. We call for further study into the GLOBE scores, as it is likely that different explanations apply to practices/values relationships across different dimensions.

Abstract: This paper compares the Uncertainty Avoidance (UA) dimension of national culture across the Hofstede and GLOBE models, looking at relationships in both data and analysis. Rather than mutual support, we detail major differences and anomalies across the studies. We show how these anomalies are resulting in contradictory explanations in research on national differences across a range of individual-, firm- and country-level phenomena. We clarify the UA measurement in both Hofstede and GLOBE, and find that the two models are measuring different components of the UA construct. We propose a two-component model of UA, namely, UA-stress and UA-rule orientation, and confirm its validity with national culture data from the Hofstede and GLOBE studies, and economic data from the World Bank. We also explain the negative GLOBE UA practices&ndash;values relationship using motivational theories. A way forward in future UA-related research is suggested. The Hofstede UA index, the GLOBE UA practices scores and the GLOBE UA values scores should be used within the specific domains that they represent: that is, stress, rule orientation practices and rule orientation aspirations, respectively. Resolving the contradictions in UA between and within Hofstede and GLOBE will help cross-cultural researchers develop more robust theories and more practical recommendations for international business management.

Abstract: Although foreign equity ownership around the world has increased substantially over the last three decades, there is little evidence on the role of foreign ownership in the host country. Using a large sample of foreign partial acquisitions in the US from 1981 to 1999, we examine the determinants of foreign acquirers&rsquo; governance activities in US targets. We focus on the information asymmetries that foreign acquirers face in the US as a key determinant of their governance activities in US targets, and hypothesize that such information asymmetries provide them with weak incentives to engage in governance activities. Consistent with our hypothesis, we find that foreign acquirers whose countries share a common language and a common culture with the US are more likely to engage in post-acquisition governance activities than are other foreign acquirers. Moreover, the probability of foreign acquirers&rsquo; governance activities is positively related to their previous acquisition activities in the US, but negatively related to the physical distance from the targets and the difference in shareholder rights scores between the US and their home countries. Our results suggest that information asymmetries that foreign acquirers face in the host country are an important determinant of their governance activities in domestic targets.

Abstract: In a recent paper in this journal, Maseland and van Hoorn argued that values surveys tend to conflate values and marginal preferences. This assertion has been challenged by Brewer and Venaik, who claim that the wording of most survey items does not suggest that these elicit marginal preferences. This commentary responds to their claim, and restates our original argument. We stress that the distinction between values and marginal preferences is a conceptual rather than a semantic issue. Conflation of the two is a problem of stated preferences methods in general, regardless of question formats. What is more, we argue that support for the marginal preferences interpretation of values survey data does not come from the specific wording of questions used in surveys, but from a growing number of paradoxical relations between values ratings and outcomes in values research. Implications are twofold. First, we argue that, in order to measure values, we need to look at alternatives to the stated preferences approach, such as revealed preferences and experienced preferences, of which the latter seems most promising. Second, we find that values surveys eliciting marginal preferences are useful for understanding and predicting differences in behavior in a given context.

Abstract: In this paper we address the problem of questionable generalizations from comparing small numbers of countries in international business (IB) research. We illustrate the misleading results that can arise from sparse samples, whether the relationship between national-level variables is strong (economic development and corruption) or weak (population density and trust). We show that 35&percnt; of recent international comparisons in leading IB journals examined just two or three countries, and present an exploratory analysis of 123 variables that reveals typical correlations across countries to be rather moderate (average r&equals;0.24). To help interpret extant study findings, we provide formulas and graphs based on Bayesian analysis, and introduce a method of combining results from multiple international comparisons. We also describe methods for designing studies to give stronger evidence of relationships between variables. Our results suggest that a minimum of 7&ndash;10 countries may support credible international generalizations, but only when overall trends are very strong. A key strategy for improving IB generalizations is to use larger samples of countries, because research based on common sample and effect sizes may lead to generalizations that the findings do not justify.

Abstract: This paper is a cross-national study testing a framework relating cultural descriptive norms to entrepreneurship in a sample of 40 nations. Based on data from the Global Leadership and Organizational Behavior Effectiveness project, we identify two higher-order dimensions of culture &ndash; socially supportive culture (SSC) and performance-based culture (PBC) &ndash; and relate them to entrepreneurship rates and associated supply-side and demand-side variables available from the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor. Findings provide strong support for a social capital/SSC and supply-side variable explanation of entrepreneurship rate. PBC predicts demand-side variables, such as opportunity existence and the quality of formal institutions to support entrepreneurship.
