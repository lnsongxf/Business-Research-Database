Abstract: Research by Dyer and Chu (2000) suggests that trust in exchange varies significantly across borders and influences the level of trust in cross-border exchange dyads. However, while this is a good start, research has yet to develop the concept that not only can the countries of origin of the exchange partners influence the nature and outcomes of dyadic trust but also the country where the exchange dyad is located. Furthermore, such home and host country differences may interact with dyad-level differences in trust creation capabilities and influence trust violation and repair. We develop a framework and propositions along these lines.

Abstract: This study uses reported trade figures from China and Hong Kong to examine the relationships among market impediments, trade figure irregularities, and tax-induced regulatory arbitrage. The empirical findings, consistent with our tax-induced regulatory arbitrage models and the round-tripping phenomenon in China (that is, moving funds across the Mainland Chinese border through trade, typically to Hong Kong or an offshore tax haven, before re-entering China as foreign direct investment), provide support for several conclusions. First, the spurious flows of funds to and from China, via the underreporting of exports and the overreporting of imports, closely follow the preferential tax incentives accorded to foreign investors. Second, the underreporting of exports is negatively related to export tax rebates. Third, the overreporting of imports is negatively related to import tariffs. Finally, both of these two appear to be most prevalent in state-owned enterprises.

Abstract: Using an extensive panel of cross-border M&#38;A transactions between 1990 and 2007, we find that firms from developing countries, compared with those from developed countries, bid higher on average to acquire assets in developed countries. We are interested in why these higher bids occur. We find that bids of firms from developing countries are higher in cases where the transaction displays &ldquo;national pride&rdquo; characteristics, where national pride is identified through a manual examination of media articles. These results, which are robust to numerous specifications (including alternative measures of national pride) and control variables, are both statistically and economically significant, and highlight a source of pride beyond personal hubris that potentially influences corporate decision-makers.

Abstract: Early research on inter-organizational trust drew on theories about social ties among individuals, for example, duration of ties and amount of interaction, yet these proved inadequate to explain the diverse arrangements arising in international business. Dyer and Chu&apos;s award-winning JIBS paper demonstrated that trust was best predicted by organizational processes that developed positive expectations of predictability, reliability, and competence, not only within national boundaries but also in cross-national relationships. This review of recent trust research building on Dyer and Chu draws attention to six themes: (1) new conceptualizations that explore identity, roles, and rules as foundations of presumptive trust at the organizational level; (2) dynamics of trust and distrust over time, how violations of trust are interpreted, and what affects ease of repair; (3) pendulum swings in inter-organizational relationships, arising from plural governance and alternation between modes, but also resulting in the continuous coexistence of positive and negative states; (4) the impact of intra-organizational conflict and inter-organizational coalitions on the establishment and maintenance of trust; (5) the relative impact of nation-level vs organization-level differences in culture as influences on trust; and (6) whether intermediate modes of exchange in between transactional and relational modes are unstable, transitional hybrids or embody complementarities that yield both value and stability.

Abstract: We examine the determinants of trust in 453 supplier&ndash;automaker relationships in the US, Japan, and Korea. We define trust and derive a model of its determinants drawing upon (1) an embeddedness (relationship-based) perspective, (2) a process-based perspective, and (3) an economic (hostage-based) perspective. Our findings indicate strong support for the process-based perspective in all countries; embeddedness was only important in Japan, and the economic hostage-based variable (stock ownership) was not important in any country.

Abstract: Leung, Bhagat, Buchan, Erez, and Gibson provide a review of several advances in research on culture and international business (IB), which is criticized by Gould and Grein as overemphasizing the national culture (NC) approach. This reply clarifies the misinterpretation of Leung et al. by Gould and Grein, and affirms its pluralistic and inclusive position. In response to their critique, we discuss the complex meaning of culture, address the dynamic processes of culture change in a globalizing world, and substantiate the pivotal role of NC in IB research. We encourage diverse perspectives that complement, rather than compete against, each other, and advocate a dual-perspective approach that integrates positivist and interpretative frameworks for theoretical innovation.

Abstract: Successful product innovation leads to the decision by small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to enter the export market. We argue that in addition to a direct effect of innovation on exports, product innovation, through its effect on firm productivity, increases the likelihood of the firm entering the export market. Using a panel of Spanish manufacturing firms, we show that the strong positive association found between firm productivity and exports in the literature relates to the firm&rsquo;s earlier innovation decisions, and that, when controlling for product innovation, the relationship between productivity and exports vanishes for these innovating firms.

Abstract: International entrepreneurship involves the identification and exploitation of opportunities for international exchange. Yet little is known about the entrepreneurial methods used for opportunity recognition. While previous work emphasizes effects operating at the level of the business network, I propose that the recognition of exchange opportunities is a highly subjective process, shaped by entrepreneurs&rsquo; existing ties with others. Based on interview data collected from 41 managers, I develop a comprehensive measure for classifying different methods of opportunity recognition. I then use this measure to classify 665 international exchange ventures set up by entrepreneurs in four Chinese cities. In contrast with past research I find virtually no role for blind luck. Although the majority of exchange opportunities were discovered rather than sought, these discoveries were intentional rather than accidental. I also find that entrepreneurs&rsquo; idiosyncratic connections with others both promote and inhibit international exchange. Tie-based opportunities lead to higher-quality and more valuable exchanges that are constrained in terms of geographic, psychic and linguistic distance. From this I conclude that entrepreneurial networks have distinct opportunity horizons that limit the reach of tie-based exchanges and potentially lead to sub-optimal internationalization trajectories.

Abstract: We investigate the process through which country-level corporate governance facilitates firm-level investment in research and development (R&#38;D). Taking cash flow as one of the main determinants of R&#38;D, we derive an econometric model that introduces a number of corporate governance factors (legal protection, financial system, and control mechanisms) to analyze their impact on R&#38;D-cash flow sensitivity. Using data from nine European Union countries, Japan, and the United States, we show that R&#38;D at the firm level is less sensitive to internal cash flow in countries with effective investor protection, developed financial systems, and strong corporate control mechanisms. Specifically, our analysis suggests that the characteristics of the corporate governance system that facilitate R&#38;D are a common law legal environment, minority shareholder protection, strong law enforcement, a bank-based financial system, effective board control, and a strong market for corporate control. This evidence points to corporate governance as a key element in R&#38;D investment, and contributes to the debate on whether country-level corporate governance systems can facilitate R&#38;D projects and, indirectly, promote economic growth.

Abstract: This retrospective on the Dyer and Chu (2000) article &ldquo;The determinants of trust in supplier&ndash;automaker relationships in the US, Japan, and Korea&rdquo; attempts to accomplish a number of objectives. First, the paper examines the key findings and impact of the original paper, and provides additional insights behind the original research. Notably, we further clarify why interpersonal trust between organizational boundary spanners does not translate into inter-organizational trust &ndash; and why inter-organizational trust is often based upon processes. Second, the paper briefly discusses relevant research on inter-firm trust since 2000, noting that research has shown the contingent value of trust, and notably that it is more important when asset specificity and uncertainty are high. Third, we discuss what has happened in the automotive industry over the past 15 years with regard to trust in supplier&ndash;buyer relationships. We show a correlation between automaker trustworthiness and automaker market-share performance and suggest a causal link, since some automakers (e.g., Hyundai, Kia) have been increasing trust with suppliers and then improving market performance. Finally, the retrospective discusses opportunities for future research on the topic of trust in inter-organizational relationships.
