Abstract: Consumers&rsquo; conceptions of a market&apos;s institutional logic affect mechanisms of firm&ndash;consumer relationships, but are generally neglected in comparative studies of international marketing. This study bridges institutional and relationship marketing theories to examine two questions: do consumers hold meaningful mental models of a market&apos;s institutional logics, and do these mental models explain differentiated patterns of market relationships across international contexts? Building on contract-relational duality, we develop a market-level construct for capturing consumers&rsquo; socially constructed mental models for the institutional logics of market action. We theorize that differences in consumers&rsquo; institutional logics will influence both their evaluation of a firm&apos;s capabilities (first-order effect) and the degree to which they reward a firm through their commitment (second-order effect). These bridging predictions are tested using data from the insurance industry across three international markets. Our results show that the German insurance market is located in the relatively high contracts&ndash;low relational quadrant, whereas the US and Dutch markets are both located in the relatively low contracts &ndash; high relational quadrant. Our results also suggest that consumer commitment conforms to a principle of alignment such that commitment accrues to providers who align their capabilities with consumers&rsquo; prevalent institutional logics of the market, and penalizes those who deviate from it.

Abstract: We identify inward investment as an important impetus to outward investment, supplemental to the impetuses depicted in conventional internationalization frameworks. By incorporating both the spillover and competition effects of foreign entrants, we develop an integrated framework of the inward&ndash;outward investment relationship for different investment modes and different home-country and host-country pairs. Our analysis of venture capital (VC) investments worldwide from 1985 to 2007 shows a positive spillover effect on outward investment for inward co-investments and a negative competition effect on outward investment for inward standalone investments. We find the strongest effects when the host country is a laggard in the VC industry and the home country is a leader.

Abstract: This study examines the implementation of high-performance work systems (HPWSs) in 217 subsidiaries of American-based multinational enterprises operating in 14 countries in Asia, Africa, and Europe. Specifically, this paper explores the effect of host-country institutional factors on the extent of HPWS implementation in subsidiaries, and focuses on &ldquo;strong agency&rdquo; influences and dominance effects. The proposed model was more successful in explaining the effect of HPWSs on rank-and-file employees than on managers. Of particular interest is the strong positive association between host-country economic growth and HPWS implementation, which suggests a possible cyclical sensitivity of subsidiaries regarding human resource management strategy.

Abstract: We study revelation behavior at illegal international cartels. Our hypotheses suggest that a resource advantage induces executives of large multinational enterprises (MNEs) to be more likely to reveal the cartel and to cooperate with the antitrust agency during the prosecution stage. Moreover, we expect the cultural background to influence the firm&apos;s inclination to reveal incriminating evidence. Empirical tests based on data about cartel breakdowns under the EU Leniency Program show that large MNEs are indeed more likely to reveal the cartel. However, they largely fail to explain variation in legal actions along cultural dimensions.

Abstract: Employees&rsquo; prosocial values have been shown to foster helping, cooperating, and volunteering behaviors, which in turn increase firm performance. However, despite the importance of prosocial values, there is a general neglect of this area in the international arena. As more trade occurs globally, interest in cross-cultural prosocial values is growing. We therefore build on socialization theory and introduce national business ideology as a country-level determinant of employees&rsquo; prosocial values. We thus argue that transformational leadership and professional altruism are key elements of a national business ideology&apos;s stimulation of employees&rsquo; prosocial values, while corporate corruption is considered to be an impediment. Based on 19,026 individuals from 17 countries, our cross-level analyses point to the national business ideology explaining national-level variances above and beyond cultural aspects. Results support our hypothesis that national business ideology, including transformational leadership and professional altruism, is positively related to employees&rsquo; prosocial values. The hypothesis on corporate corruption, however, was not supported. Instead, results indicate that employees apply rationalization strategies to justify corruption. With prosocial values being important for organizational performance as well as social welfare in general, we thus draw attention to socialization processes in national corporate work contexts.

Abstract: Despite growing evidence about differences in the attitudes and behaviors of consumers in emerging and developed markets, there is little research on the differences in country of origin (COO) effects on their evaluation, behavioral intentions (BIs), and actual purchase of imported products. This paper introduces a new conceptual framework incorporating consumer ethnocentrism (CET), materialism (MAT), and value consciousness (VC) to hypothesize several differences in the influence of COO effects on consumers from developed and emerging markets. A web-based study with 1752 consumers in four countries representing two developed markets (the UK and the USA) and two emerging markets (China and India) shows significant differences in the moderating influence of CET, MAT, and VC on the effects of COO on the evaluations and BIs for a fictitious passenger car brand, and on the actual choice of car brands owned by them. The findings highlight the importance of looking beyond CET at other relevant psychographic variables to understand the differences in motivations underlying consumer perceptions and behavior towards imported products.

Abstract: We examine how country-level legal and institutional investor protection shapes contractual creditor protection. We examine debt covenant information from foreign corporate bonds issued in the US from more than 50 countries between 1991 and 2007. We find that bonds of firms incorporated in countries with stronger creditor rights use fewer covenants. This finding suggests that creditor protection substitutes for covenants in reducing the agency cost of debt. In contrast, bonds of firms with stronger shareholder rights or firms with stronger firm-level corporate governance use more covenants. These findings support the notion that firms with stronger shareholder control may face an increase in the shareholder&ndash;bondholder conflict and therefore prefer to use more covenants. However, greater shareholder rights are not associated with the use of more covenant restrictions on equity issuance, as firms with greater minority shareholder protection are unlikely to suffer such equity dilution.

Abstract: We examine the effect of offshore outsourcing on the export performance of firms. Building on the theories of international business, the resource-based view and transaction cost economics, we argue that offshore outsourcing helps firms &ndash; directly or indirectly &ndash; to export more. It may reduce their production costs and enhance their flexibility. It may also provide them with new resources and market knowledge. However, the impact of offshore outsourcing depends on the resources and capabilities of firms to manage a network of foreign suppliers, and to absorb foreign knowledge. Using a database of around 2000 manufacturing MNEs in France in 1999, we find that offshore outsourcing increases export performance, the effects being stronger in the export markets where firms import intermediate goods. We also show that the firm size, the organization of intra-firm imports and the export experience moderate the effects of offshore outsourcing positively. These findings have implications for firms and policymakers.
