Abstract: Multinational corporations (MNCs) rely heavily on local employees when conducting their international operations, yet the international business literature provides few instances of true focus on these employees. The commonly used label &ldquo;host-country nationals&rdquo; (HCNs) confers them an identity strongly related to the culture of their country, prompting both researchers and practitioners to &ldquo;know&rdquo; them through the knowledge about the local culture. This paper provides evidence that a more sophisticated view of the culture of HCNs is needed: through an ethnographic exploration of HCNs working in local subsidiaries of American MNCs in Romania, I reveal that HCNs are not always culturally interchangeable with the rest of the host-country population. HCNs can display a variety of cultural profiles more or less reflective of the national culture, depending on their enacted stance towards the native culture and the cultural landscape of the MNCs themselves. The findings call for further specification of theories relying on the assumed localness of HCNs, and should contribute to the ongoing conversation on the interplay between the cultures specific to the MNC and its host countries.

Abstract: Qualitative research in international business has been rare, the main research streams of the field relying more on quantitative methods. This paper first outlines why qualitative research has been scant. It then presents areas, such as theory building, where qualitative research could make a substantial contribution. Third, it reviews approaches to high standards of qualitative research and criteria for evaluating qualitative research. Finally, some possible research areas where qualitative research might prove fruitful are suggested.

Abstract: Ethnographic research in international business studies focuses mainly on small group case studies, ignoring other genres of ethnography and limiting its role. I argue, based on a study of BMW MINI, that holistic ethnography allows multiple perspectives on the organization, making it particularly useful for studying cross-border acquisitions. I analyze cross-cultural relationships in the organization, the interaction of manager and worker perspectives, and the expression of national identities within the firm as its culture is negotiated, allowing for greater understanding of the conflicts that, in its managers&rsquo; view, affected the integration of the acquired subsidiary.

Abstract: Phenomenography is proposed here as a qualitative methodology for investigating how owner-managers practise internationalisation in small firms, and it is applied in an empirical study of internationalising owner-managed small Australian wineries. The findings show a common internationalisation activity cycle but four qualitatively different ways in which these owner-managers practise internationalisation. We reveal that this variation in owner-manager internationalisation practices is determined by their understandings of internationalisation, which produce differences in the ways activities within their internationalisation activity cycle are orchestrated. In particular, phenomenography has enabled new insights into the multiplicity of firm internationalisation practices not able to be captured through other qualitative methodologies such as ethnography or semiotics, as they are not designed to capture such variation. Based on our findings, we propose an understanding-based theory to explain the idiosyncratic nature of owner-managed small firm internationalisation. Furthermore, we suggest that phenomenography, used independently or in conjunction with other qualitative methodologies, also has potential to reveal the varying practices of internationalising large MNEs by enabling an investigation of the collective or shared understanding of firm internationalisation within MNEs. Finally, we point out how phenomenography can be extended beyond firm internationalisation practices to investigate other topics within international business.

Abstract: The complexity of global organizations highlights the importance of members&rsquo; ability to span diverse boundaries that may be defined by organization structures, national borders, and/or a variety of cultures associated with organization, nation-based societal and work cultures, industries, and/or professions. Based on ethnographic research in a Japan&ndash;US binational firm, the paper describes and analyzes the boundary role performance of the firm&apos;s Japanese members. It contributes toward theory on boundary spanning by introducing a &ldquo;cultural identity negotiation&rdquo; conceptual framework. We show boundary spanning as a process shaped through the interplay of the contextual issues that make a boundary problematic; an individual&apos;s multiple repertoires of cultural knowledge; and the individual boundary spanner&apos;s &ldquo;negotiation&rdquo;, through interaction with others, of his/her cultural identities &ndash; the sense of &ldquo;who I am&rdquo; as a cultural being that is fundamental to an individual&apos;s self-concept. At the same time, we make transparent the epistemological and methodological foundations of an interpretive ethnographic approach, demonstrating its value for understanding complex organizational processes. Research findings have practical implications for the selection and training of an organization&apos;s employees, particularly of persons who may be considered &ldquo;bicultural&rdquo;.

Abstract: The literature on case studies, both in the field of international business (IB) and in the social sciences more generally, has tended to focus on the methods of data production and analysis suited to this research strategy. In contrast, in this paper we investigate methods of theorising from case studies. We seek to understand how case researchers theorise, and how future IB research might utilise case studies for theorising. By means of a qualitative content analysis of case studies published in Journal of International Business Studies, Academy of Management Journal and Journal of Management Studies, we construct a typology of theorising from case studies. Two dimensions of the case study, namely causal explanation and contextualisation, form the basis for our typology. We distinguish four methods of theorising &ndash; inductive theory-building, interpretive sensemaking, natural experiment and contextualised explanation &ndash; only the first of which has been widely used in JIBS in the period that we investigate. On the basis of our own qualitative analysis, we show the limitations of inductive theory-building, and argue that greater utilisation of the other methods of theorising would enhance the case study&apos;s explanatory power and potential for contextualisation. We argue for a more pluralist future for IB research.

Abstract: The world&apos;s poor may be the last great frontier in international business. International microlenders are increasingly tapping into this emerging opportunity by extending small business loans to millions of borrowers. However, to date, there is very limited understanding of this domain from an international business perspective. Using qualitative case studies developed in Guatemala and the Dominican Republic we probe the causes and consequences of high performance and business failure for microloan recipients. The analysis of these cases led to the development of six testable propositions focused on the behavior of borrowers whose loans populate the portfolios of international microlenders. Our research aims to lay a foundation in international business for future research on microlending.

Abstract: Longitudinal qualitative research combining grounded theorizing and insights from modern historical methods can generate novel conceptual frameworks that establish theoretical bridges between historical narratives and reductionist quantitative models. To capitalize fully on this potential theory-bridging role, qualitative scholars should seek to study social systems characterized by complexity and nonlinear causation. Effectively serving this theory-bridging role provides a basis for securing a distinctive place for qualitative research in the social sciences in general, and for international business research in particular.

Abstract: Some of the most influential work in international business (IB) is grounded by what looks remarkably like ethnographic fieldwork, in which researchers hang out with the executives of the companies they study and incorporate into their analysis the insights they gain. Valuable as this work is, it often fails to reflect on how these sources have shaped the account, and it projects the subculture of the executive suite onto the entire organization. IB would benefit from complementary &ldquo;serious&rdquo; ethnography that is reflective about sources, builds on the rich ethnographic research literature, and focuses on how the managed struggle to make sense of the directives from the executive suite.

Abstract: As the reach of corporations increasingly extends across borders, a key research question is whether overseas subsidiaries adopt a shareholder-centric orientation, centered on maximizing shareholder wealth, or a stakeholder-centric orientation, centered on creating value for a broader range of stakeholders. Existing theories, addressing the corporate level of analysis, focus on forces exogenous to the firm: local resource pressures, and institutional norms. Using a combination of induction and fuzzy-set analysis, I draw on documentary evidence and 298 interviews with managers and stakeholders to build theory about the conditions that shape subsidiaries&rsquo; stakeholder orientations. Two major findings emerge. First, although theory emphasizes external stakeholders&rsquo; control over resources, internal control through the corporate parent can crowd out the voices of local stakeholders. Second, although institutional theory proposes isomorphism with local norms and standards, some corporations are subject to scrutiny by global stakeholders, and their subsidiaries face higher requirements for social engagement than their peers. These findings are the foundation of a mid-range theory that combines conventional explanations, focused on environmental factors, and an internal-stakeholder perspective, based around the roles of the parent corporation as owner and resource provider, to predict stakeholder orientation.
