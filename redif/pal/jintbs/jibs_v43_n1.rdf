Abstract: Cultural distance is a widely used construct in international business, where it has been applied to foreign investment expansion, entry mode choice, and the performance of foreign invested affiliates, among others. The present paper presents a critical review of the cultural distance construct, outlining its hidden assumptions and challenging its theoretical and methodological properties. A comprehensive framework for the treatment of the construct is developed and concrete steps aimed at enhancing rigor are delineated.

Abstract: Papers challenging institutionalized fields to change are rare, and those not extinguished by neglect are rarer. Shenkar understands his target audience. Those in that target community of IB scholars studying cultural distance&apos;s (CD) associations with foreign direct investment (FDI) might read this paper as relatively radical. Culture scholars sometimes interpret the discussion of cultural friction (CF) as competing with, even slighting by omission, their corpus of work on contact and interaction. Both readings are false, and forced comparison with two later papers reveals retrospective bias at work. It further reveals CF as a metaphor, not theory; it is not a research agenda &ldquo;assigned to the field&rdquo;, even if it becomes a personal project for the author. Rhetorical theory is the basis to compare the reasoning of appeals and emotion. The discussion considers whether academic change agents might consider more use of emotion. Bringing Shenkar into focus enriches our appreciation for its impressive craftsmanship as well as its scholarship. I discuss implications for &ldquo;impact&rdquo; as a concept currently stuck with looking for citation over substance, and offer suggestions for reviewers and editors to lower the barriers for impact.

Abstract: Despite the widespread assumptions of the positive relationship between start-up rates and innovation, the empirical support for this conjecture in the cross-country context is largely lacking. We draw upon recent advances in the entrepreneurship literature to propose that the relationship between start-up rates and innovation is not uniformly positive, as expected by the early scholars of entrepreneurship, but instead depends on the country&apos;s stage of development. The relationship is positive in the developed countries, but negative in countries in early development stages. On balance, there is a weak negative association between start-up rates and innovation. We test our hypotheses on a multi-source dataset that covers 35 countries over the period from 1996 to 2002. The relationships are robust to the choice of three moderators and two dependent variables, as well as a number of post-hoc tests. Our findings indicate that broad-strokes policy efforts that aim at promotion of entrepreneurship as a means to boost country innovativeness may be misguided, and instead suggest a contingency approach.

Abstract: This study explores the effect of coordination needs on alliance governance. We examine coordination needs that arise as a consequence of the characteristics and the context of the alliance. We posit that alliance characteristics and contextual factors influence alliance form and equity investment levels. We evaluate the effects of the complexity of technology transfer and strategic complexity of the alliance. We also study contextual factors, represented by the distance between the intellectual property protection regimes of the home countries of the participants, the focal firm&apos;s prior presence in the alliance country and its primary expertise in the industry. We offer contrasting predictions based on appropriation and coordination perspectives. Our results demonstrate support for a dominant coordination perspective, with alliance characteristics and some contextual factors influencing alliance form. Appropriation concerns play a weaker role and receive less support.

Abstract: My 2001 article provided a critical review of one of the most popular constructs in international business, and in the management and business literature as a whole, namely cultural distance. It listed various illusions, implicit yet unsubstantiated and refutable assumptions that underpinned a construct set to capture the essence of cultural differences. The paper questioned the validity of the measure; the resultant findings obtained in such international business applications as foreign direct investment patterns, sequence, entry mode, and performance; and, ultimately, the wisdom of continuing the use of the measure and its underlying construct. In this retrospective, I review subsequent work that tested some of the original observations, the impact the article has had, and, in particular, how we can redirect research away from the static cultural distance paradigm toward the dynamic interaction of the actual entities that come into contact in international business.

Abstract: Prior studies have found that foreign affiliates of multinational enterprises (MNEs) suffer from liability of foreignness (LOF). Foreign affiliates may be able to improve their social legitimacy and overcome LOF by demonstrating social commitment to host-country constituents through corporate social responsibility (CSR). If LOF is positively related to the distance between the home and host countries, and CSR activities confer social legitimacy benefits on foreign affiliates, we should expect CSR activities and distance to be positively related. However, we argue that, despite this potential motivation, foreign affiliates from more distant home countries are in fact less likely to engage in host-country CSR. Our argument focuses on the ways in which distance affects the MNE&apos;s willingness and ability to engage in CSR abroad. We also predict that host-country CSR reputation negatively moderates this relationship. Using Community Reinvestment Act data for foreign bank affiliates from 32 countries in the United States over 1990&ndash;2007, we find strong support for our hypotheses. The paper enriches our understanding of CSR practices in MNEs, and of when and how MNEs try to overcome legitimacy issues in host countries.

Abstract: In this commentary we build on Shenkar&apos;s (2001) award-winning critique of cultural distance, arguing that most distance constructs, in fact, suffer the same flaws because they oversimplify the relationship between countries, overlook their subjective and context-specific nature, and pay insufficient attention to the mechanisms through which distance operates. The idea of distance, however, has intrinsic value. Moreover, its considerable appeal and undeniable effectiveness have made it a well-entrenched construct. Therefore we see merit in redressing its weaknesses, and offer several suggestions for doing so. These include allowing for the influence of firm-level characteristics that either moderate the effects of distance or render distance &ndash; at least in part &ndash; subjective with varying consequences for different MNEs; maintaining directionality by distinguishing between distance and the tendency toward a particular characteristic and acknowledging asymmetry; and conceptualizing the effects of distance and the mechanisms through which it operates more carefully by drawing on concepts and measures from a variety of disciplines. By offering ways to strengthen both its theoretical foundations and measurement, we hope to enhance the usefulness of one of international business theory&apos;s most central constructs.
