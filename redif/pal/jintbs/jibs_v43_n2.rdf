Abstract: Long-term reversals (LTRs) have been extensively documented as existing in international markets. The predictability of returns opens the question whether investors should continue to diversify across international markets. Such predictability also has implications for the corporate decision of where and when to raise capital. This paper re-examines the international evidence for long-term contrarian profits using a longer time horizon than all previous studies (81 years of data from 1925 to 2005), and finds that the long-term contrarian anomaly disappears when time-varying (conditional) alphas are considered. This is true even without transaction costs. For the marginal trader, conservative transaction costs subsume LTR profits, whether returns are risk-adjusted or not. This suggests that benefits from actual trades on LTRs do not negate a strategy based on diversification. Although time-varying beta has been extensively documented as ineffective in describing LTRs, this paper demonstrates that it is important to control for time variation in alpha. A full conditional capital asset-pricing model captures the LTR premium. This suggests that macroeconomic factors are important for understanding LTRs and their associated risk.

Abstract: The accelerating pace of global capital market integration has provided new opportunities for firms to raise capital abroad through global debt issues, cross-listings, and initial public offerings in foreign stock exchanges. However, existing empirical evidence suggests that foreign firms tend to be at a disadvantage compared with domestic firms, and they often suffer from investors&rsquo; &ldquo;home bias&rdquo;. The objective of this paper is to understand why firms are facing problems when accessing capital in foreign markets, and possible mechanisms that can help to mitigate these problems. It expands the liability of foreignness (LOF) research beyond the product market domain to include liabilities faced by firms attempting to secure resources in foreign capital markets. We identify key differences between product and capital markets related to information environment, time structure of transactions, and linkages between buyers and sellers. We analyze institutional distance, information asymmetry, unfamiliarity, and cultural differences as the main sources of capital market LOF (CMLOF). We suggest possible mechanisms that managers can employ to mitigate CMLOF and overcome investors&rsquo; &ldquo;home bias&rdquo;: bonding, signaling, organizational isomorphism, and reputational endorsements. We also outline directions for further theoretical and empirical development of the CMLOF research.

Abstract: This paper explores the likelihood and consequences of voluntary disclosure (proxied by management earnings forecasts) for a sample of 1005 cross-listed firms in the US from 40 countries over the period 1996&ndash;2005. Our study is grounded in a three-tiered conceptual framework that relies on insights from and implications of institutional theory, agency theory and bonding theory to explain the costs and benefits associated with voluntary disclosure. Consistent with institutional theory and agency theory, our results indicate that disclosure likelihood increases with the strength of cross-listed firms&rsquo; home-country legal institutions, and is also influenced by US listing type, product market internationalization, and ownership structure. Further, our results show that voluntarily committing to US disclosure practice is associated with lower information asymmetry, which supports reputational bonding theory. Overall, our study provides a costs-and-benefits framework to understand voluntary disclosure practices in an international context. Our work also presents evidence that home-country institutions still matter when foreign firms migrate into the US financial market, which highlights the importance of country-level institution development.

Abstract: This paper analyzes the relocations of both corporate and regional headquarters (HQ) in a multi-country setting. On the basis of a dataset of 52 cross-border HQ relocations in Europe during 1996&ndash;2006, we document an increasing trend toward relocation, push and pull factors affecting HQ location choice, and catalyzing factors that affect the relocation decision. High taxes and a high employment rate represent push factors that we find to increase the likelihood of HQ relocation. In particular, at the mean rate of corporate tax, a one percentage point increase in tax translates into a 6.8&percnt; increase in HQ relocation likelihood. In contrast, central location and low taxes represent pull factors that increase the attractiveness of the HQ location. In terms of catalyzing factors, we find that export-oriented companies and regional HQ have a higher tendency to relocate. As a whole, we extend the existing research by putting forward a conceptual framework of HQ relocation decisions, and by providing novel empirical evidence on the HQ relocation phenomenon. Our findings contribute to an improved understanding of the determinants of corporate HQ relocation decisions, and provide important tax policy considerations for public policy decision-makers in individual European countries and in the European Commission.

Abstract: The aim of this study is to investigate factors &ndash; specifically stakeholder pressures &ndash; that may affect the likelihood that firms will respond to violent conflict. Survey and archival data on respondents from 471 multinational and local firms operating in 80 countries were used to explore these issues. Key findings include: (1) local stakeholder pressure is associated with the likelihood that firms will respond directly to violent conflict, collaborating with other organizations or working alone when doing so; and (2) international stakeholder pressure is associated with the likelihood that firms will respond indirectly to violent conflict, collaborating with other organizations or working alone.
