Abstract: Measures of geographic distance are often used to proxy for the impact of spatial separation on firm decisions and performance. We develop a construct, dyad travel time, to measure the friction of interacting and costs of uncertainty from ex post behavioral monitoring across non-collocated sites. We measure the actual time required to travel between 1171 parent&ndash;subsidiary dyads, and show that dyad travel time (but not geographic distance) has significant predictive power in firm governance and location decisions. While prior literature has independently modeled these, we specify a simultaneous model offering stronger support for the interrelation of these decisions.

Abstract: According to transaction cost economics (TCE) reasoning, firms choose equity (as opposed to non-equity) foreign market entry modes to safeguard specific assets. The present paper contextualizes the well-researched relationship between asset specificity and foreign market entry mode choice by introducing knowledge safeguards (international experience, host-country networks, and imitation) and institutional safeguards (property rights protection and cultural proximity) as alternative mechanisms for securing a firm&apos;s specific assets. Testing our hypotheses on a sample of 206 small and medium-sized enterprises, we find that knowledge safeguards and institutional safeguards weaken the effect of asset specificity on the choice of equity foreign market entry modes. Contextualizing the relationship between asset specificity and foreign market entry mode choice helps to enhance our understanding of the scope conditions of TCE-based entry mode studies and beyond.

Abstract: Multiple-level (or mixed linear) modeling (MLM) can simultaneously test hypotheses at several levels of analysis (usually two or three), or control for confounding effects at one level while testing hypotheses at others. Advances in multi-level modeling allow increased precision in quantitative international business (IB) research, and open up new methodological and conceptual possibilities. However, they create new challenges, and they are still not frequently used in IB research. In this editorial we outline some key methodological issues for the uses of MLM in IB, including criteria, sample size, and measure equivalence issues. We then examine promising directions for future multilevel IB research considering comparative opportunities at nation, multiple-nation cluster, and within-nation region levels, including large multilevel databases. We also consider its promise for MNE research about semi-globalization, interorganizational effects across nations, clusters within nations, and teams and subsidiaries within MNEs.

Abstract: Interfirm relationships among partners from institutionally distant environments are subject to governance difficulties, owing to the paucity of shared cognitive and regulatory frameworks. We examine the potential of formal contracting and relational governance developed at the partnership level to overcome the formal and informal institutional gap at the country level. Empirical results from a sample of 184 international partnerships of large US firms support an overall substitutive relationship between informal institutional frameworks and interorganizational relational arrangements whereby the performance benefits of relational governance are reinforced at higher degrees of informal institutional distance. Contrastingly, formal institutional frameworks and contractual governance are found to have a complementary relationship, with performance gains from formal contracting undermined at higher degrees of formal distance.

Abstract: This study addresses an important issue in designing and managing business process offshoring (BPO): process integration between an offshore service provider and its global BPO client. We applied the information-processing lens in global BPO and developed the logic that internationally disaggregated process integration requires a fit between process integration and BPO&apos;s task characteristics (i.e., task complexity and security) and task interdependence (task connectivity, stickiness, and dependency). This alignment is further moderated by the task context, such as the geographic dispersion of the global client&apos;s end-customers and the type of offshore provider (independent vendor vs captive and joint venture). Finally, we suggest that process integration has a positive but curvilinear relationship with the economic returns achieved by offshore providers. Our analysis of 308 BPO companies in India and China supports our propositions. We conclude that international managers monitoring and integrating globally disaggregated activities in BPO should establish a proper alignment with the BPO project&apos;s task traits and task interdependence, and look closely at the conditioning effect of external complexity. By redressing the paucity of research on governing global BPO, this study offers some insights into the integration&ndash;externalization dynamics for growing business/knowledge process offshoring.
