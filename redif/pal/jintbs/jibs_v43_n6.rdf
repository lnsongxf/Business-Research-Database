Abstract: Drawing on the distinction between the ostensive aspects (abstract patterns) and performative aspects (specific actions) of organizational routines, the paper offers a micro-level explanation of capability learning in international new ventures (INVs), that is, firms that internationalize actively from inception. The paper argues that variability in the performative aspects of internationalization routines is associated with improvisational learning and new capability development, whereas variability in the ostensive aspects is associated with trial-and-error learning and existing capability improvement. Furthermore, psychic distance moderates these relationships. Low psychic distance facilitates both improvisation and trial-and-error learning; high psychic distance frustrates learning of both types. Moderate psychic distance makes the success of both learning forms more likely &ndash; but only for more experienced INVs. The paper also argues that social capital may mitigate the negative effects of high psychic distance. It contributes to the extant literature by providing a micro-level explanation of how INVs accomplish capability learning and avoid wasteful learning efforts, and by theorizing the moderating effects of psychic distance on the relationships between routine microprocesses and capability learning.

Abstract: Venture capital (VC) funds have been facing increasing regulatory scrutiny since the 2007 financial crisis, particularly with respect to calls for increased disclosure requirements. In this paper, we examine the effect of more stringent securities regulation on the supply and performance of VC, as well as on new business creation (i.e., entrepreneurial spawning). Using country-level and investment-level data from 34 countries over the years 2000&ndash;2008, we find that more stringent securities regulation is positively associated with the supply and performance of VC around the world. More stringent securities regulation is also positively associated with entrepreneurial spawning induced by VC. Among different forms of securities regulation, disclosure stands out as having the most economically meaningful impact, which casts doubt on the oft-repeated objections to disclosure in VC &ndash; that it would stifle the VC industry, because secrets would have to be revealed to competitors and the public. These findings are robust to numerous robustness checks for endogeneity. The policy implications are clear, however, regardless of endogeneity concerns: VC and entrepreneurship markets are enabled, not curtailed, in countries with better disclosure standards, when one compares the existing differences in disclosure around the world and changes thereto over the 2000&ndash;2008 period.

Abstract: This editorial identifies a number of potential theory-related weaknesses in manuscripts, some more general in nature, others specific to international business (IB) research. It provides a brief critique and suggestions on how to overcome common problems in motivating research, framing contributions, reviewing literature, benefiting from the review process, and other issues of conceptual development. It also addresses questions particularly critical to IB research including multidisciplinarity, utilizing international context and enhancing theoretical impact. We conclude with specific guidelines on how to emphasize theory, thereby enhancing contribution and impact, in crafting and revising submissions to JIBS.

Abstract: We argue that leader-directed voice (i.e., communicating critical suggestions for change to the leader) is a relational phenomenon, and that it is affected by an inherent feature of multinational teams: members&rsquo; (dis)similarities in nationality. We tested our hypotheses in a sample of middle managers who were working in multinational teams. The results of this study show that leaders of multinational teams are more likely to profit from the local know-how of employees from underrepresented nationalities when they are open to their ideas, and when they have the same nationality. The study also shows that the effects of being open to employees&rsquo; ideas and sharing the same nationality are mediated by affective commitment and psychological safety, respectively. We discuss how, even though the current relational demography perspective with its dichotomous understanding of (dis)similarity is not suited to capture the dynamics of cultural differences, it does set the stage for future studies to examine the cultural dynamics behind an individual&apos;s experience of being different from other team members in multinational teams. We also discuss the practical implications of these findings for multinational companies.
