Abstract: An ongoing debate in the interfirm exchange literature concerns whether economic and social governance mechanisms function as substitutes or complements. We advance a more nuanced approach to examining how detailed contracts and centralized control interact with relational governance differentially in curbing local supplier opportunism in emerging markets. We suggest that where legal institutions are weak, detailed contracts are ineffective in containing partner opportunism in contractually specified areas. Under such circumstances, relational governance provides a proxy for legal institutions to ensure contract execution. Meanwhile, relational governance serves as an alternative mechanism to centralized control for ensuring contingency adaptations. Based on a sample of 168 foreign buyer&ndash;local supplier exchanges in China, we find that relational governance complements detailed contracts but substitutes for centralized control in curtailing opportunism. Therefore foreign firms must be cautious in their combinative use of social and economic mechanisms in governing exchanges with local suppliers in emerging markets.

Abstract: We explain the mechanisms through which government impacts the internationalization of emerging-market enterprises (EMEs). Rather than merely viewing internationalization as the result of differences in resource positions, we demonstrate that an important source of variation is the idiosyncratic manner in which EMEs are affiliated with government agencies. Although government involvement has a strong effect on international expansion, this effect is contingent upon the level at which the firm is affiliated with government and the degree of state ownership. Different types and levels of governments have different objectives, exert different institutional pressures on EMEs, and impact their willingness and ability to internationalize differently. Government involvement influences the level of overseas investment, its location (developed vs developing countries) and its type (resource- vs market-seeking). These effects depend on firms&rsquo; own resources and capabilities, suggesting that not all firms possess equal ability to internalize government-related advantages and respond to institutional pressures. By demonstrating that resource-based and institutional constructs are highly dependent on one another, we enhance understanding of how EMEs succeed in expanding overseas, and why governments matter.

Abstract: Received wisdom indicates that, owing to a liability of foreignness, foreign firms exit with greater likelihood than do comparable domestic firms, and that the difference attenuates as firms age and overcome the liability. We posit that foreign firms are also intrinsically more volatile and footloose than domestic ones, and that this leads to an increasing divergence between the exit rates of foreign and domestic firms. Empirically, we find that the difference between exit rates of foreign firms and domestic firms increases with age, as exit of foreign firms increases with age while that of purely domestic firms decreases. Exit rates of domestic-based multinationals do not change significantly with age; they are between those of foreign and purely domestic firms, but are closer to the latter. This suggests that the footlooseness observed for foreign firms is due to foreignness more than to multinationality.

Abstract: Extending research on the institution-based view of international business strategy, this paper posits that the international adoption of technology among firms is distinct from its intra-national counterpart because this process is influenced by the efficiency of the government institutions where each firm is located. Low government efficiency delays investment in unknown technologies by increasing contracting hazards, environmental uncertainty and the difficulty of allocating potential returns; thus requiring greater experience on the part of firms when undertaking investment decisions. Furthermore, government inefficiency accentuates the relative significance of firm-specific drivers of technology adoption, but reverses the positive effect of industry competition in promoting technology adoption. I empirically investigate this phenomenon through hazard models analyzing the factors that affect the timing of the adoption of electronic ticketing by close to 180 airlines operating in 110 different countries. The results imply that government inefficiency in certain countries not only leads to slower technology penetration rates compared with their counterparts, but also exacerbates the technology gaps within countries by providing unwarranted advantages to firms that are already well entrenched.
