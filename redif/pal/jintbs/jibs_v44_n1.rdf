Abstract: In a departure from prior studies presuming a beneficial experience effect in foreign direct investment (FDI), the present paper examines the conditions under which FDI experience may actually harm subsequent subsidiaries. We argue that multinational enterprises (MNEs) may draw erroneous inferences and learn incorrectly from their early expansions when new to a dissimilar culture, because their learning abilities are eroded by cultural differences. We posit that the characteristics of an MNE&apos;s international expansion, including scope, pace, rhythm, and entry mode, moderate this negative experience effect by influencing the MNE&apos;s learning ability in foreign cultures. Using a data set of FDIs by South Korean MNEs between 1990 and 2006, we find a positive relationship between subsidiary mortality and experience when an MNE has a low level of experience in a dissimilar culture. This relationship is weaker if the MNE&apos;s prior FDI has been dispersed across different cultures, is stronger if it expanded internationally at a fast pace, and becomes negative once the MNE has accumulated a high level of experience in the host culture. We conclude that, when expanding into dissimilar cultures, MNEs must establish mechanisms to mitigate incorrect learning and reexamine the correctness of inferences drawn from past experience before applying them.

Abstract: What explains the heterogeneity of foreign subsidiary performance? Previous studies have emphasized the importance of industry, corporate parent, and home-country effects on the variation of foreign subsidiary performance. Building on recent international business and economic geography research, this study examines the extent to which subnational region effects can also explain such performance variation. We empirically decompose the variance of the performance of Fortune Global 500 Corporations&rsquo; subsidiaries in China during 1998&ndash;2006. Results show that not only are subnational region effects statistically significant in explaining the variation of subsidiary performance, but their interactions with industry, corporate parent, and home-country effects are also significant and economically important. We further show that subnational region effects tend to be stronger in the period prior to China&apos;s WTO accession, and in the country&apos;s less-developed subnational regions. Our findings highlight the importance of considering both the direct and indirect roles of subnational region in shaping firms&rsquo; strategy and performance in international business research.

Abstract: Several theoretical and empirical developments in the literature on foreign entry mode and performance, and on (international) strategy more generally, were influenced or prefigured by Brouthers&rsquo; (2002) JIBS Decade Award winning paper. Regarding theory, Brouthers is an archetype of the integration of transaction cost and institutional perspectives. I argue that it is also relevant to the growing literature that aims at synthesizing these and other perspectives. Methodologically, Brouthers (2002) contributed several uniquely direct and rich measures. Furthermore, it not only displayed awareness of endogeneity (specifically self-selection) issues, but also was among the pioneers in the comparative analysis of governance choices for a given firm or transaction. I elaborate on the promising if challenging use of such &ldquo;what if&rdquo; imputation to identify the impact of more or less well-aligned choices. Overall, I argue that such methodological advances cannot be decoupled from the conceptual advances that enable them, and which they reinforce.

Abstract: In this study, we examine foreign market entry mode choice and firm performance for a sample of European Union firms. Examining both financial and non-financial performance measures, we attempt to determine if firms that select their entry mode based on transaction cost, institutional context, and cultural context variables perform better than firms that make other mode choices. We found that mode choice did matter. Firms whose mode choice could be predicted by the extended transaction cost model performed significantly better, on both financial and non-financial measures, than did firms whose mode choice could not be predicted by the extended transaction cost model. Implications for future research are discussed.

Abstract: For several decades researchers have focused on the entry mode decision because it is critically important for firms expanding abroad. Despite this attention we still lack clear tools to help managers make effective entry decisions. In this paper I review past research exploring transaction cost and institutional perspectives of mode choice, provide a critique of this literature, and generate suggestions to move our knowledge forward. In addition, I review the limited research exploring entry mode performance, and emphasize the importance of examining the normative merits of proposed theoretical models. I hope these suggestions will lead to the development of prescriptive tools for managers to make better entry mode decisions that result in improved firm performance.

Abstract: This commentary&apos;s title is not meant to be a rhetorical question. In congratulating Brouthers (2002) for the JIBS Decade Award, we have an opportunity to assess where we are within this field of inquiry, and what is our trajectory. I believe that we have accomplished a lot in this area of study. Nevertheless, I am concerned about its current trajectory, so much so that I think we should seriously question whether we need more entry mode studies &ndash; especially if we are going to get more of the same.
