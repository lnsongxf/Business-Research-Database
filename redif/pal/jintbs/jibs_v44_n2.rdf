Abstract: Despite the emerging consensus that most multinational enterprises (MNEs) are regional, systematic theory explaining regionalization is conspicuously absent, and empirical findings on its implications for MNE performance remain mixed. Drawing on internalization theory, we suggest that technological advantage and institutional diversity determine firms&rsquo; home-region orientation (HRO), and we posit a simultaneous relationship between HRO and performance. We apply insights from the firm heterogeneity literature of international trade to explain the influence of technology on HRO. We predict a negative and nonlinear impact of technological advantage on HRO driven by increasing returns logic, and a negative impact of institutional diversity on HRO driven by search and deliberation costs. We find empirical support for our model using simultaneous equations methodology on longitudinal data on Triad-based MNEs. Performance significantly reduces HRO, but HRO does not have a significant effect on performance.

Abstract: An emerging literature highlights the relationship between competitive intensity and the likelihood that two rival firms will form an alliance. Placing this argument in an international context, we first suggest that the global competitive intensity between two rival multinationals positively affects the likelihood that they will ally in any host country. Additionally, we highlight how a number of host-country contextual factors moderate the relationship between global competitive intensity and alliance formation in a given host country. We test our hypotheses with a sample of 13 global automobile companies operating in 27 countries, and the results largely support our predictions.

Abstract: Import competition has had an enormous impact on the US economy. This paper looks at whether such competition has increased the risk of US firms and is a factor that can partly explain the Fama&ndash;French disappearing dividends phenomenon. We show that firms facing more import competition do face more uncertainty in their future performance, and are less likely to pay a dividend. Import penetration through a risk channel has significant explanatory power, even after we include a variety of controls suggested in the literature, as well as Herfindahl index that controls for market power. Further, we can explain a significant part of the disappearing dividends phenomenon. Finally, we also find evidence that import competition contributes to the substitution of share repurchases for cash dividends. We are the first to document the impact that increased import competition and &ldquo;globalization&rdquo; have had on the dividend policy of US firms.

Abstract: This paper examines the investments of 19 sovereign wealth funds (SWFs) in 424 firms (both public and private) around the world from 1991 through 2010. The data indicate that SWFs, similar to other institutional investors, are less likely to invest in private equity than in public equity internationally. However, the economic significance of this impact is surprisingly low. Unlike other institutional investors, SWFs are more likely to invest in private equity compared with public equity in target nations where investor protection is low, and where the bilateral political relations between the SWF and the target nation are weak. Surprisingly, cultural differences play a marginally positive role in the choice to invest in private equity investment outside an SWF&apos;s own sovereign nation. Comprehensively, we find that SWFs act distinctively from other traditional institutional investors when investing in private equity.
