Abstract: Trust is an important factor in interorganizational relations. Interorganizational trust in cross-border relationships is likely to be influenced by the home countries of both partners. Using data on 165 international joint ventures (IJVs), we show that the perceived trustworthiness of an IJV partner is influenced by the general propensity to trust in the trustor&apos;s home country. Moreover, the trustworthiness perceived by a focal parent firm is also affected by the home country of the other IJV partner. This second effect is mitigated by experience between the partners.

Abstract: Building on economic geography and knowledge-based theory, I argue that pro-market reforms augment the profitability of firms by increasing their competitiveness and market knowledge. However, I propose that this effect is greater for firms that operate internationally, firms that operate in more advanced markets, and firms that become multinationals before reforms are implemented. This is because such firms acquire market knowledge abroad that they can use when responding to reforms at home, giving them a head-start advantage over other local firms. The analyses of a panel of the largest 500 Latin American companies from 1989 to 2008 provide support for these arguments.

Abstract: We examine whether certification by an internationally recognized information intermediary helps emerging-market firms overcome the liability of foreignness in capital markets. Specifically, we ask whether securing a credit rating from Standard &#38; Poor&apos;s (S&#38;P) enables these firms to certify their financial reporting quality. We hypothesize that the unique information demands of lenders motivate firms to provide more conservative financial statements upon securing an S&#38;P rating. We find evidence consistent with this conjecture. Moreover, the rating appears to be part of an international expansion strategy for these firms, and is followed by increased international activity in capital and product markets.

Abstract: We investigate the impact of political institutions on corporate risk-taking. Using a large sample of non-financial firms from 77 countries covering the period from 1988 to 2008, we find that sound political institutions are positively associated with corporate risk-taking, and that this relation is stronger when government extraction is higher. In a subsample of 45 countries, we also find that politically connected firms engage in more risk-taking, which suggests that close ties to the government lead to less conservative investment choices. Our results are economically significant, and are robust to alternative risk-taking measures, various political institution proxies, cross-sectional and country-level regressions, and endogeneity concerns of political institutions. Our results have important implications for governments and corporate managers by providing direct relevance of political institutions to the corporate decision-making process. To encourage investment at the firm level, and hence innovation and overall growth, governments need to undertake the necessary reforms to control corruption and enforce contracts better, and thus decrease government predation and extraction.

Abstract: This study investigates the internationalization of corporate boards, using a sample of 346 non-financial listed Nordic firms during 2001&ndash;2008. Given a high level of international activity, these firms have surprisingly few foreign directors. The picture of international expertise changes considerably, however, if we also count the international experience of national directors. The percentage of foreign directors is related primarily to financial internationalization rather than foreign sales, and thus presumably to the monitoring rather than advisory functions. The international experience of the nationals covaries with foreign sales, and increases with the share of foreign directors. Thus both sources of international expertise should be considered when analyzing board internationalization.
