Abstract: Although biculturals represent a growing demographic, the nascent literature on biculturals has not addressed their cross-cultural leadership capabilities or effectiveness. Attributional patterns and variations across cultures are crucial, and call for higher attributional complexity (AC) and attributional knowledge to reduce cultural distance. This study provides a systematic theoretical connection between biculturals and their higher levels of AC and attributional knowledge, which account for their cross-cultural competence. This connection is then linked to attributional processes, drawing from recent literature on attributional models of leadership. The proposed theoretical model posits that biculturals have higher levels of AC and attributional knowledge, which helps them make more accurate attributions, which are also less culturally biased. Managerial behaviors resulting from these attributions lead to cross-cultural leadership effectiveness, because they absorb uncertainty on the part of subordinates. The proposed model addresses both cognitive and emotional competency elements of cross-cultural leadership. We contribute to the international business literature by providing a theoretical model for examining factors critical to the cross-cultural leadership effectiveness of leaders who have more than one cultural profile. Managerial implications for selection and training of international executives are discussed in the context of culture-specific and culture-general capabilities. Contributions, limitations, and boundary conditions are also discussed.

Abstract: Studies examining the competitive implications of geographic scope have largely focused on creating competitive advantage. In an attempt to investigate a less-illuminated role of geographic scope &ndash; that of sustaining competitive advantage &ndash; this paper investigates the sources of and relationships among the causal factors leading to creation of isolating mechanisms or barriers to imitation. This paper first distinguishes two sources of causal factors linked to the creation of isolating mechanisms, intrinsic characteristics of knowledge, and geographic scope of knowledge acquisition, and then investigates the relationships among the causal factors from the two sources. Employing the fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis method, this paper examines equifinality and functional equivalence of causal factors from the two sources. Empirical analyses with United States Patent and Trademark Office patent data of the semiconductor industry corroborate the main thesis of the paper that multiple paths can lead to the creation of isolating mechanisms and, in these paths, causal factors from the two sources of isolating mechanisms can be functionally equivalent. The results also provide managerial implications that firms with different sets of resources and capabilities can implement different types of isolating strategies to sustain their competitive advantage.

Abstract: This paper extends and builds on Ronen and Shenkar&rsquo;s synthesized cultural clustering of countries based on similarity and dissimilarity in work-related attitudes. The new map uses an updated dataset, and expands coverage to world areas that were non-accessible at the time. Cluster boundaries are drawn empirically rather than intuitively, and the plot obtained is triple nested, indicating three levels of similarity across given country pairs. Also delineated are cluster adjacency and cluster cohesiveness, which vary from the highly cohesive Arab and Anglo clusters to the least cohesive Confucian and Far Eastern clusters. Exploring predictors of cluster formation, we draw on the ecocultural perspective and other inputs, and examine the combined role of language, religion, and geography in generating cluster formation. We find that these forces play a prominent yet complex role: for instance, the religion and language brought by the Spanish fail to create a singular, cohesive Latin American cluster akin to the Anglo cluster. The role of economic variables is similarly considered. Finally, comparing the current map with that of 1985, we find strong support for the divergence (vs convergence) argument. Implications for international business are delineated.

Abstract: Paternalistic leaders provide care, nurturance, and guidance to employees in their professional and personal lives in a parental manner, and, in exchange, expect loyalty and deference from employees. This study aims at investigating how the paternalistic leadership (PL) prototype converges and diverges with prototypes of transformational, authoritarian, participative, and nurturant-task leadership (NTL) in six countries representing high power distance and collectivism (China, Turkey, and Pakistan) and low power distance and individualism (the United States, Germany, and the Netherlands). A total of 1272 employees from six countries participated in this study. Findings revealed that the PL prototype converged more strongly with authoritarian leadership and NTL in hierarchical and collectivistic cultures than in egalitarian and individualistic ones. The relationship of the PL prototype with that of transformational and participative leadership was similar across cultures. Theoretical and managerial implications of these findings for international business are discussed.

Abstract: Various studies have explored how headquarters (HQ)&ndash;subsidiary geographic distance affects HQ decisions about subsidiaries, arguing that such distance causes some strategic options to be selected over others to limit ex post communication costs. These studies have implicitly assumed that a multinational&rsquo;s HQ is spatially concentrated, even though multinationals have increasingly disaggregated their HQ internationally. We examine how such HQ disaggregation changes the role that HQ&ndash;subsidiary geographic distance plays in HQ decisions about subsidiaries. We argue that HQ disaggregation yields multiple HQ&ndash;subsidiary geographic distances, all of which are a likely source of ex post communication costs, and hence are likely to co-determine HQ decisions about subsidiaries. We discuss several approaches for dealing with these multiple distances, and recommend that the first-best approach be adopted by future studies to avoid the biased geographic distance effects possibly present in prior studies.

Abstract: We argue that a multinational enterprise&rsquo;s (MNE&rsquo;s) location choice for its host-country headquarters (HCHQ) in the geographic space of the host country is determined by the interplay between the strategic roles of HCHQ in the organizational space of the MNE and the institutional space external and internal to the MNE. We focus on the location choice between Beijing and Shanghai. We test our arguments using data for a sample of Fortune Global 500 corporations in China (1979&ndash;2005). This study contributes to international business (IB) research by reinvigorating research on HCHQ. We also complement economic geography research on subnational agglomeration by using an IB perspective with a focus on the institutional idiosyncrasies of cities.
