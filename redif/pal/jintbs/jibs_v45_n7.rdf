Abstract: This article adopts a cognitive neuroscience perspective to develop theory about the consequences of foreign language use in organizational settings. In contrast to previous work that has focused on the interpersonal effects of foreign language use, we focus on intra-personal, cognitive processes that affect employee performance. Our model delineates how foreign language processing depletes cognitive resources, which can ultimately result in biased decision-making and reduced self-regulation. We discuss theoretical and practical implications of our model for international business research in the context of an increasing number of organizations that have adopted a common corporate language.

Abstract: The treatment of translation in the international business (IB) literature has been predominantly concerned with research methodology and back-translation. Arguing for a less microscopic concept of translation in IB research, we advocate a more expansive perspective, whereby translation is understood as cross-border interplay of entire terrains of corporate contexts and experience linking multiple mental and social frames of reference. We apply three notions from linguistics and translation studies &ndash; equivalence, ambiguity and cultural interference &ndash; to problematize the translation of management terms and concepts across languages and to highlight the importance of historical and cultural embedding in the translation process. We substantiate the core argument through analysis of fragments from Russia&rsquo;s first Handbook of Knowledge Management, a text composed of 23 contributions translated from English into Russian, a language in restless regeneration, struggling arduously with Western management terms and concepts after 70 years of communism. This knowledge management text constitutes the essence of an entire corpus of modern management thought and action which is largely unfamiliar to the Russian business and scholarly community. We demonstrate how acts of translation serve as an analog for the cross-cultural transfer of knowledge and how these insights can advance IB translation research into new and rewarding directions.

Abstract: Emerging markets experience institutional and social changes over time that present different stakeholder expectations for multinational corporations (MNCs). MNCs are often accused of social misdeeds and experience public crises during the changes, leaving questions on how they adapt to the local social transition to sustain operations. Conventional adaptation strategies put too much emphasis on maximizing economic returns by arbitraging national differences and catering to local market and consumer characteristics. The economic orientation may fail to address evolving and diverse stakeholder expectations, easily leading to public crises. This study conceptualizes economic adaptation and social adaptation as two sets of knowledge and capabilities that would have equally important impacts on MNCs&rsquo; sustainable operations in emerging markets. The empirical testing examines consumer rights-related public crises experienced by 180 MNCs in China. The results suggest that MNCs&rsquo; social adaptation activities have significantly positive effects in mitigating public crises while certain aspects of economic adaption, such as early entry into China, reliance on local leadership, and speedy expansion of local employees, lead to public crises. The significant interaction effects confirm that MNCs need to follow a balanced approach, paying attention to both economic and social components to avoid public crises and sustain growth in emerging markets.

Abstract: We examine the role of cultural and language skills as resources for individuals&rsquo; boundary spanning ability in multinational corporations. Our combined qualitative and quantitative analysis shows that cultural and language skills influence the extent to which individual boundary spanners perform four functions: exchanging, linking, facilitating, and intervening. Boundary spanners with both cultural and language skills perform more functions than those with only cultural skills, and language skills are critical for performing the most demanding functions. Key boundary spanners have properties that potentially make them not only valuable organizational human capital, but also rare and difficult to imitate. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.

Abstract: We explore how the interconnected nature of global finance affects corporate risk taking. We show that a common global factor known to be associated with fluctuations in cross-border banking is also strongly associated with common co-movements in corporate risk-taking across a diverse universe of international firms. Our study contributes to the international business literature as the first comprehensive investigation of how global financial conditions induce greater synchronization of risk-taking across regions and sectors.

Abstract: In this editorial, we assess the cross-disciplinary connections of JIBS by examining its citation network, which spreads across no less than 36 disciplines or fields. Using a citation network of 166 citing and 645 cited journals, we investigate JIBS&rsquo; interdisciplinarity using the intermediation and integration approaches of network analysis. Our analyses of citation patterns for a 12-year time period (2001&ndash;2012) suggests that JIBS is helping bridge disciplines that do not often otherwise talk to each other &ndash; a task of critical importance for new knowledge creation. We also find that JIBS is enabling integration of knowledge from a diverse set of disciplines in comparison to other prominent leading management journals.

Abstract: Does &ldquo;born-global&rdquo; internationalization enhance or threaten a firm&rsquo;s chances for survival in the export market? Despite the ongoing debate about born-global firms, we know little about what drives their survival in the export market. In particular, different theories yield conflicting predictions regarding whether born-global internationalization is superior or inferior to born-regional internationalization or gradual internationalization. Analyzing a longitudinal data set (from 1997 to 2005) of 1959 newly established Canadian small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), we show that no single strategy is superior per se but that internationalization strategy moderates the relative importance of resources to SMEs&rsquo; survival abroad. Although resources are important for the survival of all SMEs, the relative importance of slack resources and innovation resources are most important for born-global firms followed by born-regional firms, and are the least important for gradual internationalizers.
