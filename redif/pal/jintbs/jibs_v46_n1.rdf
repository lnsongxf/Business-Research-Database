Abstract: Our study explores the source of improvement in the information environment from cross-listing shares on US stock exchanges. Are the improvements from cross-listing in the United States achieved more through public or private information channels? While we find evidence that US cross-listing is significantly associated with improvements in both public and private information precision, the association is stronger between cross-listing and improvements in private information precision. This suggests that the improvement in the information environment for cross-listed firms is largely due to analysts expending more effort on firm-specific information discovery as opposed to broader improvements in overall public disclosure. This research should influence international business scholars that improvements in the information environment do not occur solely through public information channels. They also occur through investors&rsquo; private information search activities.

Abstract: In a recent commentary published in this journal, Shaver raises the provocative question of whether we need more entry mode studies. After assessing the reasons for Shaver&rsquo;s doubts and further developing his broad research suggestions, we conclude that this question should be answered affirmatively. We derive three important questions for future entry mode research: (1) What determines the evolution of operations resulting from suboptimal mode choices? (2) What causes the replication of past mode choices? (3) How is the entry decision process structured? Focusing on these questions should assure a bright future for entry mode research.

Abstract: Knight and Cavusgil&rsquo;s award-winning article has played an important role in the development of the growing body of research on companies that internationalize early and rapidly. These &ldquo;born global&rdquo; firms represent important contributors to many economies, often as key players in ecosystems that support large multinational enterprises. Despite their growing importance, our understanding of how and why these firms develop and implement their internationalization strategies, and what makes them successful, remains incomplete. Addressing such questions has contributed substantially to the development of the research domain of international entrepreneurship (IE), which focuses on entrepreneurial aspects of doing business across borders, in the context of both small and large firms. While IE is much broader than born globals, these firms are central to the IE domain and the impact of the Knight and Cavusgil paper has helped to develop a stronger awareness of the important linkages and intersections between IE and the wider international business research community. We reflect on the important contribution of this paper, and suggest some directions for the future development of research into firms that choose to operate internationally practically from the start of their operations.

Abstract: Research and development (R&#38;D) internationalization is on the rise for advanced economy multinationals (AMNEs) as well as emerging economy multinationals (EMNEs). We study EMNE R&#38;D internationalization by comparing it to that by AMNEs in the context of an emerging, knowledge-intensive industry. We find that these two are fundamentally different processes. While the internationalization of AMNEs&rsquo; R&#38;D activities can largely be explained in terms of the twin strategies of competence exploitation and competence creation, EMNE R&#38;D internationalization is rooted in the firms&rsquo; overall catch up strategy to get on par with industry leaders. An in-depth comparison of knowledge flows reveals that within AMNEs, headquarters often serves the primary source of knowledge for R&#38;D subsidiaries. In contrast, within EMNEs, headquarters accesses knowledge from R&#38;D subsidiaries in advanced economies for innovation catch-up. Within this dichotomy, the innovative capabilities of EMNE headquarters develop more slowly and with greater difficulty than those of AMNE subsidiaries.

Abstract: Do international or non-international differences between members matter most for multinational corporation (MNC) teams? We consider two types of international differences, arising from geographic locations and national origins, and two types of non-international differences, arising from structural affiliations and demographic attributes. Examining the barriers to knowledge seeking between MNC team members, we argue that whether international or non-international differences create greater barriers depends on whether they are position-based or person-based. Using the Social Relations Model to analyze 13,616 dyadic interactions among 2090 members of 289 teams in a large MNC, we find that, for both international and non-international differences, those that are position-based (i.e., geographic and structural differences) created greater barriers than those that are person-based (i.e., nationality and demographic differences). In addition, familiarity from a prior team reduced the barriers created by international and non-international differences that are position-based more than those that are person-based. We discuss the implications of our study for understanding the micro-foundations of knowledge flows in MNCs.

Abstract: The nature of global business today increases the complexity of multinational companies and highlights the challenges of managing headquarters&ndash;subsidiary (HQ&ndash;Sub) relationships. We identify key unresolved issues in HQ&ndash;Sub relations including closing the gap between headquarters&rsquo; expectations and subsidiary performance, managing the nested hierarchical relationships across multiple organizational layers, and aligning these relationships across diverse subunits embedded in different social contexts. We propose that agency theory, particularly its more recent progressions, can advance our understanding of these issues and we offer a perspective to guide such research. We discuss several research implications of the static bilateral, static multilateral, dynamic, and social and contextual streams of agency theory.

Abstract: Our 2004 Journal of International Business Studies article, &ldquo;Innovation, Organizational Capabilities, and the Born Global Firm&rdquo; provided a framework for the phenomenon of early and rapid internationalization among young, entrepreneurial firms. This work can be characterized as an integration of marketing, entrepreneurial, and capability-based thinking around exporting, positioned as the born global exporter. The article also reported findings from a national study of start-up firms that expanded abroad early in their evolution. In the present commentary, we reflect on the contributions of the 2004 article, review the scholarship on the topic over the past decade, and offer suggestions for future inquiry. While the incidence of early internationalization by firms was a novel concept two decades ago, today such firms are found in abundance in many countries. Yet many unresolved research questions remain, including the crucial topic of what happens to &ldquo;born global&rdquo; firms as they grow and mature over time. Similarly, the issue of why some firms internationalize early, others late in their evolution, and still others choose to remain local, is a fundamental question for international business scholarship.

Abstract: Knight and Cavusgil&rsquo;s Journal of International Business Studies Decade Award-winning article offers numerous contributions to international business research. As one example, it advances cross-disciplinary conversation about entrepreneurial internationalization. A critical review of their study reveals, however, that certain findings require reinterpretation. This commentary does so, discussing the resultant implications and the question of when it is (in)appropriate to use the term &ldquo;born global&rdquo;. Parts of Knight and Cavusgil are then used as a foundation to identify research questions at the level of the firm. Finally, points from Cavusgil and Knight&rsquo;s retrospective are used to argue that we need greater understanding of the individual(s) that are central to the firm&rsquo;s internationalization behaviour. Suggestions for research are made by drawing on concepts and theory from the entrepreneurship, innovation and psychology literatures.
