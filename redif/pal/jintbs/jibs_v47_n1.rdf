Abstract: Using the before&ndash;after natural experiment occasioned by the Arab Spring in Libya, we explore how market and non-market activity affect foreign firm legitimacy in times of political turmoil. Although all MNEs in Libya had to cultivate strong ties to Qadhafi to succeed during his 40 years of rule, we found that those that also invested in social-benefit projects and in social ties with families with few ties to the Qadhafi family earned a broad-based legitimacy that helped them survive Qadhafi&rsquo;s overthrow. Our findings contribute to the political risk and political behavior literature the notion that the pursuit of firm legitimacy in general, and especially in the eyes of social-sector actors, is an effective hedge against political risk. More theoretically, our findings support the addition of a social-sector-based path to firm legitimacy in the host country that complements and may at times substitute for, the government-based path to foreign firm legitimacy. Practically, our findings suggest that MNEs&rsquo; facing severe political risk can improve their prospects for survival by investing in relationships with influential social groups and by offering goods or services that are perceived as socially valuable.

Abstract: The field of international business (IB) is in need of more theory development. As such, the main focus of our manuscript was to provide guidance on how to build IB specific theory using grounded theory (GT). Moreover, we contribute to future theory development by identifying areas within IB where GT can be applied and the type of research issues that can be addressed using this methodology. Finally, we make a noteworthy contribution by discussing some of GT&rsquo;s caveats and limitations, particularly those relevant to IB. This effort is intended to spur further interest in the development of IB theory.

Abstract: I analyze differences in the innovativeness of domestic firms and subsidiaries of foreign firms operating in the same country. I argue that domestic firms suffer a liability of localness in innovation, or a competitive disadvantage in product innovation relative to subsidiaries of foreign firms. I propose that this liability of localness is driven by the relatively lower levels of multiculturalism in employees of domestic firms in comparison with subsidiaries, which limit the identification, transfer, and integration of a large diversity of knowledge that supports product innovation. I also propose that managers of domestic firms can compensate for this liability of localness in two ways: by investing in the training of their employees and by exporting. Training modifies the mindsets and abilities of employees and enables them to become more cognitively multicultural, which facilitates product innovation. Exporting changes employees&rsquo; mindsets as they become exposed to new ideas available abroad, which also facilitates product innovation. I test these arguments on a sample of manufacturing firms and find that, although domestic firms introduce fewer new products than subsidiaries of foreign firms, they introduce more new products than subsidiaries at the same level of investment in language training and of exports.

Abstract: Meyer and Peng&rsquo;s Decade Award article and Retrospective integrate economic and sociological theories of transaction costs, firm resources, and institutions and apply them to firms in Central and Eastern Europe in ways that can inform and be informed by culture theory. Culture theorizing in IB typically uses dimensions of values and norms to analyze the IB implications of the underlying logics that characterize patterns of thought, action and interaction of countries and other large societies. Transaction cost theorizing helps explain the social forces that link cultural group boundaries with country boundaries. Firm resource theory can be informed by the toolbox metaphor to understand cultural patterns in the resources that firms in a particular locale have most readily available. Neo-institutional theory, particularly its political science thread, cautions IB scholars to represent governmental arrangements and policies as arising from cultural norms and values rather than as independent variables that spring de nova from government leaders. Integrative analyses, like the Decade Award article and Retrospective, point out links and complementarities among diverse theories, but need to take care lest superficial similarities in how terms like institution and culture are used in different theories mask fundamental conceptual differences.

Abstract: In this commentary we provide an assessment of the JIBS Decade Award-winning article by Meyer and Peng and its impact on the field of international business (IB). We highlight Meyer and Peng&rsquo;s focus on a relevant and important phenomenon &ndash; the emergence of transition economies in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) as a new class of markets. We address the CEE focus within the context of Meyer and Peng&rsquo;s insightful organizing framework built on three organizational archetypes (foreign entrants, local incumbents, and new start-ups) and the applications of four theories in CEE research (transaction cost economics, agency theory, resource-based view, and institutional theory). Importantly, we suggest that the Meyer and Peng article can serve as a foundation for further expansion and refinement of IB research in non-Western contexts, including transition economies and the increasingly important emerging markets. To advance the literature, we also propose a set of ideas of how to push this research forward by expanding Meyer and Peng&rsquo;s analysis of contexts, organizational forms, and theoretical perspectives. Regarding context, we discuss the risks of overgeneralization and aggregation and the need to follow a more precise categorization of national economies based on central theoretical characteristics. Regarding organization type, we expand the original set by focusing on state-owned or state-controlled enterprises and family firms. Similarly, we propose a more comprehensive and in-depth treatment of theories employed in research on transition economies and emerging markets to better explore the developments in these theoretical perspectives and utilize the unique framework of such contexts.

Abstract: In &ldquo;Probing Theoretically into Central and Eastern Europe: Transactions, Resources, and Institutions,&rdquo; we outlined the contributions of research in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) to theoretical debates in business research. In this retrospective, we reflect upon the evolution of the field over the past decade. With the fading impact of CEE&rsquo;s distinct shared history, we suggest that CEE best be analyzed as emerging economies, rather than as a distinct geographic entity. Emerging economy business research is converging on common themes and shared theoretical ideas, while identifying critical variations that constrain generalizations among and beyond emerging economies. This research thus highlights the need to develop a better understanding of the boundary conditions of scholarly theories of business knowledge. Over the past decade, the institution-based view has emerged from distinct intellectual traditions in institutional economics, organizational theory, and the analysis of business&ndash;government bargaining. Research in these converging lines of theorizing places contextual variations at the center of explanations of business phenomena around the world. We suggest that the institution-based view is evolving toward a paradigm, and offer suggestions on how to advance this research agenda further, in particular by exploring how firms engage with different sets of potentially conflicting institutions at multiple levels and locations.
