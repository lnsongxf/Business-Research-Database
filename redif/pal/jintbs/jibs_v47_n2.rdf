Abstract: Using a large hand-collected database of 605 privatized firms from 48 countries, we examine the relationship between the collectivism measure of culture and residual state ownership in privatized firms. We find that the continued role of government in privatized firms is positively related to collectivism. This result is robust to using alternative measures of collectivism and government control, as well as when we address the endogeneity of collectivism. Finally, we examine the economic outcomes of culture at the firm level, focusing primarily on performance, efficiency, risk-taking, and valuation measures. We report that privatized firms with high residual state ownership exhibit lower performance, valuation, efficiency, and risk-taking in collectivist societies. Our results suggest that formal institutions are not, as sustained by previous studies, the main/exclusive constraints on the privatization reform.

Abstract: The article extends research on the contingency of fit in international management at the level of managerial tasks. Foreign firms&rsquo; managerial tasks are embedded in two environments with different profiles, and different managerial cultures fit them to ensure task success. Study 1 analyzes 18 critical incidents, summarizes Chinese and Japanese managerial cultures, and identifies three types of managerial tasks. We hypothesize that task success depends on the fit between task type and the chosen managerial culture, such that foreign firms can have their operational, local, and people tasks successfully completed using home, host, or integrated managerial cultures respectively. Study 2 tests our hypotheses using 112 critical incidents. The fit pattern at the level of managerial tasks advances the contingency perspective in international management and equips managers with cultural agility to confront international challenges.

Abstract: Although the original model of expatriate adjustment proposed by Black and colleagues has received substantial empirical support, it has come under increased academic scrutiny, due to both the conceptual overlap among its dimensions and its limited applicability for global professionals who interact with individuals from diverse cultures. Drawing on role theory, we conceptualize and develop a multidimensional scale of the work- and family-role adjustment of global professionals. We assess this scale through five interlocking studies using data from a total of 1231 corporate and self-initiated expatriates, international business travelers, and global domestics. After confirming the scale&rsquo;s dimensionality, we provide evidence for convergent, discriminant, nomological, and predictive validity. We also demonstrate differences in levels of adjustment and in relationships between work and family demands and resources and their respective forms of adjustment across various types of global professionals. We contribute to international business research, and the organizational behavior and work&ndash;family literatures, by offering a theoretically based scale that assesses adjustment to both work and family roles for a wide range of global employees. Our scale further lends itself as a diagnostic tool during the selection, training, and support of global professionals and their families.

Abstract: We identify a variety of R&#38;D alliance modes in a knowledge-intensive industry (e.g., Pharmaceuticals), and classify them into four ordered categories which go beyond the traditional binary equity vs non-equity alliance classification. This enriches our understanding of alliance governance structures and broadens the application of alliance modes in what is today a more complicated international R&#38;D collaboration setting. We then explore national, industry and firm factors that determine the selection of an appropriate R&#38;D alliance governance mode, using a sample of 237 international alliance deals. The likelihood of using a more-integrated alliance governance mode decreases as the difference or &ldquo;distance&rdquo; between nations of the partner firms increases in terms of human capital and cultural distance. On the other hand, a greater geographic and institutional difference is positively associated with the selection of more integrated alliance governance modes. Furthermore, firms in the research stage are more likely to use a more-integrated governance mode, as opposed to firms in the development stage. These findings advance research on alliance governance structure. They reveal the factors affecting the R&#38;D alliance governance mode choice.

Abstract: We examine cross-border syndication in investments led by foreign venture capitalists (VCs) focusing on the potential correlation between cultural differences and the formation of VC syndicates. Contrary to the risk-sharing motive, we find that a greater cultural disparity between the countries of investors and their companies is actually associated with smaller VC syndicates. This is driven largely by lesser local investor representation in foreign VC-led syndicates. However, certain cultural disparity-related syndication strategies, such as the involvement of locally experienced foreign VCs or syndicate members from culturally similar countries, are associated with greater presence of local VCs who provide valuable monitoring services. We further show that these culture-linked syndication approaches are significantly correlated with VC financing and monitoring strategies in cross-border investments and their eventual success.

Abstract: Investor time horizon varies by company, industry and economic system. In this article we explore the importance of this variation by studying the impact of shareholder time horizon on the investment decisions of the firms they own, and externalities on the wider market. We demonstrate theoretically that short-term shareholders cause Boards to care about the path of the stock price, rationalising firms&rsquo; pursuit of investments for signalling reasons at the expense of long-term value. We demonstrate that short-termism has spillover effects, leading to higher costs of equity capital; bubbles in the price of input assets; and predictable excess returns. We build testable cross-country hypotheses and evaluate these using existing evidence coupled with a new dataset on owner duration of US and Germanic firms.
