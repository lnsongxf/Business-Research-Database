Abstract: Selecting appropriate samples in cultural distance research is vital to producing valid empirical results. Over 80&percnt; of empirical cultural distance studies use a sample comprised of either a single home country with varying host countries or a single host country with varying home countries. When difference scores are used in the calculation of cultural distance based on single-country samples the resulting cultural distance measures typically are highly correlated with one or more of the varying countries&rsquo; underlying national culture dimensions, making it impossible to determine whether findings are due to cultural distance or to varying countries&rsquo; national culture effects. This is referred to as a confounded variables problem and means that for an overwhelming number of cultural distance studies, we cannot with certainty have confidence in the verity of their findings. To resolve this uncertainty we propose that cultural distance scholars select samples comprised of at least two home/host countries. We empirically demonstrate that two-country samples where most of the national culture dimensions for the two countries differ create certitude with respect to results, eliminating the cultural distance confounded variables problem. We describe the single-country sample problem, illustrate the proposed a priori two-country solution, and suggest avenues for future research.

Abstract: The question that motivated this editorial was, &ldquo;where are the IB experiments?&rdquo; The short answer is that experiments are largely absent from the IB literature; and we argue that they shouldn&rsquo;t be. Experimental methods offer the opportunity to significantly improve the evidence for the causal relationships in international business research in a variety of ways. In this article we highlight the value and limitations of experiments in IB research, and explain the basic tenets of experimental design and thinking with the goal of encouraging the submission of more papers with an experimental design to JIBS.

Abstract: Cultural friction posits that cultural differences may be either synergistic or disruptive, but does not specify when or how synergies or disruptions emerge. We theorize that synergies will emerge in foreign-invested enterprises (FIEs) when cultural differences in leadership beliefs are less central to the host nation&rsquo;s cultural identity; while disruption will occur when differences are in more culturally central leadership beliefs. Analyzing survival data from 274 FIEs in China, we found support for these hypotheses with five of the six GLOBE leadership dimensions. As predicted, differences in the Participative and Team-Oriented dimensions were associated with higher firm death, while differences in the Charismatic, Autonomous and Self-Protective dimensions were associated with firm survival. Our results indicate that while there are areas where differences may indeed need to be accepted or minimized, there are other areas where differences can be beneficial. This requires that managers identify more central aspects of local culture to determine whether to minimize differences or to leverage their synergistic potential.

Abstract: This study investigates the impact of language barriers on multilingual virtual teams members&rsquo; choice between different communication media in their inner-team interactions. Through interviewing team leaders and members in both mono- and multilingual virtual teams, we discover discrepancies in media choice and media performance between these two settings and identify foreign language-induced cognitive load as a key reason for these divergences. Our study advances research on communication and knowledge exchange in multilingual virtual collaboration by showing how language barriers alter the process of converging different viewpoints through team interaction, by suggesting language-related modifications to the seminal media synchronicity theory, and by demonstrating the benefits of new media in multilingual settings. It also broadens the disciplinary scope of language research in international business by introducing theories from communication studies and cognitive research. In practical terms, it highlights the benefits of redundant communication, the need for an adequate media infrastructure in multinational corporations and the importance of motivating team members to use new media.

Abstract: Social tolerance refers to the extent of recognition and acceptance of differences, willingness to grant equal rights, and refraining from openly intolerant attitudes. Utilizing World Value Survey (WVS) data (56 countries, 83,000 usable respondents), we develop a Global Social Tolerance Index (GSTI) that incorporates gender, minority, immigrant, and religion tolerance dimensions. We develop this index using a multi-step data-driven procedure involving five data standardizations, seven weighting approaches, and five aggregation methods. They generate 124 replications for each country&rsquo;s index and rank, yielding a median overall position and several measures of rank sensitivity/robustness to different weighting, standardization, and aggregation approaches. It builds on prior social tolerance indexes in terms of scope and dimensionality, and avoids problems associated with equal or subjective weighting. The GSTI index/rankings provide a tool for IB scholars to examine nations&rsquo; overall tolerance or tolerance regarding each dimension relative to other external criteria. Our procedure can be used to develop other indexes and rankings of nations or organizations within a country or region. In practice, any such non-participatory method should always serve as a starting point to facilitate deliberations of experts and/or decision-makers for policy recommendations.

Abstract: We adopt a resource dependence approach to explain the effect of state participation on the dissolution of international joint ventures (IJVs). While resource dependence theory (RDT) has been used to explain the formation of IJVs, we propose an extension of the theory to explain their dissolution. We do so by highlighting the match between foreign firms&rsquo; resource needs (resource hierarchy) and the resource provision roles of state-controlled vs private local partners (resource profiles). We further argue that the effect of state participation on the dissolution of IJVs is moderated by foreign firms&rsquo; host country experience and IJV age. We test our hypotheses by using data on 623 IJVs in China. Our results show that state participation reduces the risk of IJV dissolution and that the strength of this effect differs depending on the type of state-controlled actor that is involved in an IJV. We also find that host country experience and IJV age moderate the effect of state participation on IJV dissolution. These findings enhance our understanding of IJV dissolution and contribute to the development of RDT.
