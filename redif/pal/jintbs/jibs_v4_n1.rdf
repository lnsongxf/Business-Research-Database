Abstract: Personalismo is a behavioral norm which is generally accepted as an important Latin American Cultural trait.11John P. Gillian, &ldquo;The Middle Segments and Their Values&rdquo; in Latin American Pollitics. ed. Robert D. Tomasek (Garden City: Doubleday and Company, 1996), pp. 23&ndash;40. It has been discussed as having a primary influence on the political and business systems of this area. Its influence on a business system and trade credit is the concern of this article.Parts of a diagnostic research study on the operational problems of the trade credit system in El Salvador22John J. Brasch, A Descriptive Analysis of the Trade System of El Salvador, Doctoral Dissertation (St. Louis, Graduate School of Business Administration&mdash;Washington University), 1970. serve as the primary basis for the discussion that follows. The relevant findings of this El Salvador study with respect to personalismo were subsequently confirmed through lengthy interviews in Mexico, Guatemala, Costa Rica, and Honduras, thus warranting in subsequent comments, guarded generalization for all of Latin America.&copy; 1973 JIBS.

Abstract: The University of Wisconsin&apos;s experience with the MBA Export Expansion Program have been favorable. It has been a good supplementary education vehicle for students, participating firms seem to have gained from it, and the faculty coordinator has gained useful insights regarding business behavior.The University of Wisconsin Business School has been participating in the Bureau of International Commerce&rsquo;s MBA Export Expansion Program since its inception in 1970. This is a report of our experiences with it, and a discussion of some of the issues raised by these experiences.&copy; 1973 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (1973) 4, 15&ndash;29

Abstract: According to a questionnaire survey, the forward-exchange market easily accommodated the demand of U.S. firms for forward cover of transactions with German firms during the 1971 floatation of the mark.. The U.S. firms employed a variety of hedging techniques.The recent experiments with quasi-floating exchange rates have produced new evidence on some old questions about exchange-rate flexibility. One of these questions is whether substantial flexibility disrupts international trade by stimulating more demand for forward-exchange cover than the market can easily satisfy.1For affirmative answers to this question, see the following: H.S. Houthakker, &ldquo;Exchange Rate Adjustment,&rdquo; in U.S. Congress, Subcommittee of the Joint Economic Committee, Factors Affecting the United States Balance of Payments, 87th Cong., 2d. sess., Washington, 1962, pp. 292&ndash;93: Robert V. Rossa in The Balance of Payments: Free Versus Fixed Exchange Rates, by Milton Friedman and Robert V. Rossa (Washington, D.C.: American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research, 1967), pp. 39&ndash;41; and Giuliano Pelli, &ldquo;Why I Am Not in Favor of Greater Flexibility of Exchange Rates,&rdquo; in Approaches to Greater Flexibility of Exchange Rates, ed. by Geroge N. Halm (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton Univ. Press, 1970), pp. 203&ndash;08. Those who answer this question in the affirmative usually reason along the following lines. Substantial exchange-rate flexibility leads business management to expect greater exchange-rate variations. Therefore, management seeks to cover more of its foreign-exchange explosure (i.e., seeks to &ldquo;insure&rdquo; against the greater exchange rate risk by purchasing or selling foreign currency forward. &copy; 1973 JIBS.

Abstract: Indications are that advertising, consulting, and low firms are rapidly becoming as entrenched in the global market arena as their predecessors. The manufacturing and extractive industries.One of the most significant global developments of post World War II is the massive growth of multinational business operations. Although most of this growth is concentrated in the manufacturing and extractive industries, U.S. Service firms increasingly are establishing beachheads of their own abroad. This development raises questions relating to the underlying motives of and problems encountered in the multinationalization of U.S. service firms. To address these and other issues, a mail survey of multinational advertising, consulting, and law firms was conducted in 1971. A three-page questionnaire, consisting of open-ended questions, served as the survey instrument.&copy; 1973 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (1973) 4, 61&ndash;66

Abstract: This article represents the AIB Presidential Address given at the annual meeting in Toronto, December, 1972. it notes certain developments affecting education for international business and considers some possible responses to them.Two years ago, Richard Robinson asked the question &ldquo;Does international business have a future?&rdquo;11Richard D. Robinson, &ldquo;The Future of International Management,&rdquo; Journal of International Business Studies, II (Spring, 1971), 60&ndash;71 He went on to discuss provocative issues raised by the Club of Rome report. Following on such pontifical considerations, our present remarks will deal with a more parochial or diocesan concern, i.e., the future of the international business professor.&copy; 1973 JIBS.

Abstract: Although there is some literature on the general phenomenon of corruption, one is hard pressed to find any references&mdash;much less elaborations of it&mdash;in articles, books and programs in the area of international business administration. This paucity of treatment is difficult to comprehend. On the one hand, we are in an age when the public is increasingly emphasizing the need for corporations to exercise social responsibility. On the other, we have assertions by individuals that multinational enterprises are among the foremost practitioners of corruption, particularly in the less-developed nations where they operate. In view of these parallel developments, it would appear that there would be much more research and, thereafter, discussion of multinational corruption in the programs and literature of international business than presently exists. Some possible reasons for the lack of treatment given to this area may be (1) the difficulties in defining the phenomenon; (2) the delicacy of the research which characterizes the area; (3) the problems of obtaining data; and (4) the lack of agreement on the political, social, and economic effects of corruption.&copy; 1973 JIBS.
