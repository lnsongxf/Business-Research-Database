Abstract: Many of the less-developed countries have required foreign companies to settle nationalization claims on a basis of book values. These book values are based on generally accepted accounting principles that tend to make book values lower than current far values. As a result, nationalization claims that are settled on the basis of book values are biased against the owners of the nationalized companies. Accountants should disclose, in notes to the financial statements and in the auditors' reports, that book values do not reflect current fair values, so that it will be evident that the financial statement do not provide an appropriate basis for settling nationalization claims.&copy; 1973 JIBS.

Abstract: Planning is the intermediate step between forecasting and tactical day-to-day decision making. The planning process develops long range strategies by which an enterprise mobilizes its human and physical resources to maximize its operational efficiencies and performance within the frame work of the forecasts. The authors analyze how three variables unique to the international planning process, greater uncertainty, socio-political and cultural conditions, and market conditions, act as constraints in shaping the long-range models of multinational enterprises.&copy; 1973 JIBS.

Abstract: The author presents a cyclical model to conceptualize the impact that a single manufactured commodity has on the lending country&apos;s balance of payments as the product traverses the course of its life-cycle. The model depicts the relationship that exist among the different international accounts at different stages of the product cycle. Some macro-economic implications of this micro-economic model are then explored.&copy; 1973 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (1973) 4, 51&ndash;64

Abstract: Education for international business management must be as dynamic as the management decision making process. The traditional three approaches all suffer from serious weaknesses. Most important, learning is separated from real decision making under constantly, and rapidly, changing environmental influences. The &ldquo;Fourth Dimension&rdquo;of international business education takes place through graduate seminars composed of class-teams assigned the responsibility of studying an aspect of real management in depth with their results being considered and/or used by the firm that provided the problem for study.&copy; 1973 JIBS.

Abstract: A survey of academic experts on international business reveals a variety of approaches to internationalizing the core curriculum of all business students. Micro as well as macro international topics are considered worthy of inclusion in the common body of knowledge of all business students. Although few schools now require some minimum education in international business of all graduates, such requirements may be more widespread in the future.&copy; 1973 JIBS.

Abstract: The problem considered is that of the firm that must choose from a set of feasible borrowing sources that includes foreign as well as domestic sources. Expressions are developed for the effective cost of borrowing under conditions of inflation and devaluation and under the condition of either local or foreign ownership of the firm. One simple decision rule is shown to be sufficient for choosing an international borrowing source, and this rule is compared with-a rule from the literature.&copy; 1973 JIBS.
