Abstract: Foreign direct investments in the United States have become a highly controversial topic, particularly in the past year. This article presents some preliminary findings of the most recent, major research investigation of foreign direct investments in U. S. manufacturing, mining and petroleum sectors, and points out some problems encountered in conducting research in this area.&copy; 1974 JIBS.

Abstract: Although U.S. firms operating abroad must hire managers largely from the same labor force as host country companies, this study indicates that the profile of the subsidiary managers differs substantially from that in the local companies.&copy; 1974 JIBS.

Abstract: The experience of expatriate selection and assignment has been a mixed success for multinational firms. Several selection strategies have been used, but failure situations in individual assignment cases are known to be in nearly every multinational firm. New research has indicated that the problem of insuring success for an expatriate is quite different from the problem of avoiding failure. A different set of factors is critical to each of these two problems. When this distinction is made, the variables related to the expatriate selection and assignment problem are considerably more ordered and operable.&copy; 1974 JIBS.

Abstract: This paper provides a brief review of the past research dealing with the feasibility of standardizing advertising on a multinational basis. It offers an analytic framework for dealing with this major problem which incorporates the use of current attitude measurement techniques available to the advertising manager.&copy; 1974 JIBS.

Abstract: Theories from several disciplines are integrated into a general model for the prediction of a national propensity to expropriate foreign private direct investments in less-developed host countries. A discriminant analysis is used to test the hypothesis that the presence of such instability combined with a high level of foreign (American) investments will result in a high propensity to expropriate. The model is tested empirically on Latin American data from the 1968&ndash;71 period, and the main hypothesis confirmed.&copy; 1974 JIBS.

Abstract: The aim of this study was to examine the growth rates of Swedish multinational corporations. An attempt was made to answer the question of whether the MNCs have grown faster than has the Swedish manufacturing industry and, if so, to investigate the extent to which this can be explained by differences in multinationality. In order to separate the effect of that factor, technology-intensity, size, and profitability were included in the model; according to theory, these factors are correlated with multinationality and possibly with rates of growth.&copy; 1974 JIBS.

Abstract: This study profiles export decision-makers in both exporting and nonexporting firms, in terms of their perceptions of the risks and cost/benefit trade-offs associated with exporting, and their reactions to various types of stimuli to export. It concludes an export stimulus (e.g., an unsolicited order from a foreign customer) is a significant but not sufficient condition for a positive export decision, and that important variations between exporters and nonexporters in cost, profit, and risk perceptions may well account for different responses to similar stimuli by these two groups. Present public policies to promote exports are critiqued in light of the findings.&copy; 1974 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (1974) 5, 107&ndash;117

Abstract: This article reports the results of an exploratory study comparing U.S. and Japanese consumers&apos; perceptions of various foreign and national &ldquo;made in&rdquo; product images. &ldquo;Made in&rdquo; profiles of products originating in England, France, Germany, U.S.A., and Japan were constructed using semantic differential responses from U.S. and Japanese consumers. Profile differences are analyzed statistically and implications discussed.&copy; 1974 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (1974) 5, 119&ndash;127
