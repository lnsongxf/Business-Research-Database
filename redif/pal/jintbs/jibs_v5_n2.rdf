Abstract: Foreign managers with United States international companies perceive that they are effectively excluded from the so-called better jobs and that United States nationals generally receive better treatment and opportunity, especially when cross-national transfers may be involved. This could in the future affect the ability to attract qualified local managers abroad.&copy; 1974 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (1974) 5, 25&ndash;40

Abstract: Price-level and exchange-rate changes compound the problems of evaluating the performance of the foreign subsidiaries of a U. S. company. If the parent firm is to evaluate subsidiary performance properly, it must recognize and account for these changes in corporate evaluation and control procedures. This can be accomplished best through a variance analysis in the budgeting process.&copy; 1974 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (1974) 5, 41&ndash;56

Abstract: At a time when increasing attention is being paid to the international comparison of the cost of living, this article begins with a catalog of the limitations of existing comparisons. The authors then analyze the major problems of estimation and interpretation. These problems include the determination of patterns of consumption and setting weights and prices; making monetary and fiscal adjustments; and, finally, accounting for international differences in the standard of living.&copy; 1974 JIBS.

Abstract: A basic understanding of various legal rules and the legal environment of international business operations is required as part of the education of the international business executive. This should not be a mere repetition of a general business law course, but a tailor-made course for the international business major, on both the graduate and undergraduate levels.&copy; 1974 JIBS.

Abstract: The fifteenth anniversary of the founding of our association is a fitting moment to record its early days. And there is a practical reason for setting down this record now. Much of the history has been stored only in the memories of those of us who were part of the founding process. So it is sensible to pull the pieces together now before they fade yet further beyond the point of recall.&copy; 1974 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (1974) 5, 69&ndash;80

Abstract: The importance of the study of the international legal environment for international business majors cannot be disputed. The only question to be raised is the extent to which international law should be incorporated in every international business student&apos;s curriculum (i.e., as a required course or as a portion of one or more existing international business courses). Most textbooks on international business, international marketing, or international management rightly devote at least a chapter to this topic.&copy; 1974 JIBS.
