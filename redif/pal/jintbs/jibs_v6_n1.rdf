Abstract: This article explores the forecasting accuracy of the &ldquo;random walk&rdquo; and other models of exchange rate behavior. Under present conditions of floating exchange rates, it is argued, anticipations of future demand and supply determine fluctuations in exchange rates. The authors present results consistent with the notion that, for the world&apos;s major currencies, the foreign exchange market is an &ldquo;efficient market&rdquo; and exchange rate forecasting is not profitable.&copy; 1975 JIBS.

Abstract: This paper presents the results of an exploratory survey of the applicability of discriminant analysis to the determination of the medium-term (two-year) exchange rate changes. Using a discriminant function developed on observations drawn from 1961&ndash;1964 and 1965&ndash;1968, the authors have correctly predicted the devaluation or nondevaluation of 86 percent of the countries tested for the period 1971&ndash;1972. These results indicate predictive power at the .001 level of significance. A reduction of 36 percent in classification error is achieved by the method.&copy; 1975 JIBS.

Abstract: Features of the U.S. taxation of the income of multinational corporations are shown to affect the minimum rate of return required on the unremitted profits of foreign subsidiaries. The article develops criteria that should be used by the firm as the minimum required return on reinvested earnings as the result of fiscal devices such as tax deferral, the foreign tax credit, and the special tax treatment of subsidiaries in less developed countries.&copy; 1975 JIBS.
