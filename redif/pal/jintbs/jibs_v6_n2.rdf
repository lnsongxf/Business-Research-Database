Abstract: Rutgers University assumes with enthusiasm responsibility for publishing the Journal of International Business Studies. Through this statement the University&apos;s Graduate School of Business Administration tells its academic, business and government colleagues the world over that it will execute this responsibility diligently. The School does not make this commitment lightly, nor without recognizing that during the next decade universities will be under great pressure to cut costs and to economize in other ways. But, the School also recognizes that journals of quality are essential to scholarship, teaching and the advancement of knowledge. We will, therefore, support the Journal to the best of our ability.&copy; 1975 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (1975) 6, 3&ndash;4

Abstract: The authors contrast the approaches advocated by major power blocks for lessening the gap between the economic levels of industrialized and developing countries. The LDC&apos;s are seeking resource transfers favorable to them. The industrialized nations are willing to help but in ways that avoid doing undue harm to their internal economies and to the security of their direct investments. Hopefully, negotiations rather than confrontations will be used to resolve the conflict.&copy; 1975 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (1975) 6, 5&ndash;14

Abstract: This article examines the extent and quality of corporate financial disclosure among the largest publicly-held corporations in seven countries during the 1963 to 1972 period. The evidence presented suggests that the generalization of American superiority in annual report disclosure is a tenuous one at best.&copy; 1975 JIBS.

Abstract: This paper presents a methodology for determining the true costs of alternative sources of financing for the multinational corporation when the risk of exchange rate changes is present and different tax rates and regulations are in effect. The cost formulas presented can then be used to calculate the cheapest financing source given the expected exchange rate changes.&copy; 1975 JIBS.

Abstract: This paper explores the behavior of the foreign exchange markets for the floating rate period since 1973 and the immediately preceding fixed rate period. The author presents evidence showing that the cost of forward cover and the gains from speculation in the forward market for the major currencies has not changed significantly between the two periods and, in fact, the forward rate has been an unbiased predictor of the future spot rate for the floating rate period.&copy; 1975 JIBS.

Abstract: This paper suggests a new look at corporate pricing policies in developing countries. Because of conditions discussed in the paper, the price elasticity of demand curves in individual markets may be much greater than companies assume. A shift to a low price/high volume may both increase profits and satisfy social needs to which host country governments are sensitive.&copy; 1975 JIBS.

Abstract: This paper presents the results of a study concerned with the need satisfactions of Americans who are assigned to international managerial positions. The results of the study indicate that regional location and prior international work experience influence the job satisfaction of overseas managers. It is suggested that jobs in different parts of the world may be viewed differently because of previous international work experience, career aspiration and control exerted by the parent organization.&copy; 1975 JIBS.

Abstract: Conventional wisdom holds that every academic discipline should undergo continuous evaluation regarding curriculum, course content, and research focus. Many inputs could be used for such purposes: opinions of specialists (e.g., as revealed by surveys of university courses), consulting experience and research on international business problems. This note presents data on one input&ndash;the demand for higher level personnel in international business as reflected by advertisements. The methodology involved clipping advertisements of &ldquo;positions available&rdquo; in international business from The Wall Street Journal during the eighteen month period, October 1973 through March 1975. Then they were classified according to the qualifications specified. It should be noted that such advertisements tend to be for experienced persons rather than for newly graduated students. They do not indicate what the market looks for when recruiting students with training in International Business. Rather, such advertisements suggest what qualifications will be needed for advancement in the international activities of firms so long as future business requirements continue the same as at present. In other words, an analysis of advertisements provides information on only one dimension, albeit an important one, of the market for persons trained for international business. Attention also should be given to trends in international business problems and activities that, in the future, may create a demand for different skills than at present. One can list other methodologies needed.&copy; 1975 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (1975) 6, 75&ndash;78
