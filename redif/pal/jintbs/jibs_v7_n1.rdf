Abstract: This article examines the characteristics of takeovers by foreign governments of 170 American firms in the post-war period. The dimensions observed include the frequency by subperiod; industry of the firm; degree of discrimination against foreign and U.S. firms of the takeovers; the form of the takeover; and the political circumstances in the host country at the time of takeover. Summary measures for each of the characteristics and their changes through time are presented.&copy; 1976 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (1976) 7, 3&ndash;16

Abstract: This article examines some of the key characteristics of technical entrepreneurs in Canada and compares these findings with similar studies conducted in the United States and the United Kingdom. Three areas are examined: the background of the entrepreneurs, the circumstances surrounding the establishment of their first ventures, and their perception of the environment for entrepreneurship.&copy; 1976 JIBS.

Abstract: This article reports the results of an exploratory study comparing the managerial beliefs and needs of Mexican nationals employed by U.S. subsidiaries in Mexico and those of U.S. and Mexican managers employed by U.S. and Mexican-owned firms. It concludes that the managerial belief and need patterns of local Mexican subsidiary managers fall between those of U.S. and Mexican managers of local firms where the belief and need patterns of these latter two groups of managers differ significantly, Industry, enterprise, and personal characteristics influence belief and need patterns and the extent that they differ. The implications of these findings are discussed.&copy; 1976 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (1976) 7, 39&ndash;56

Abstract: The effects of communications between subsidiaries and home offices are evaluated in this study of sixty-three multinational corporations. Chief executives of Brazilian subsidiaries of MNCs headquartered in Europe, Japan and North America were interviewed to determine the volume of home office-subsidiary communications and its impact on home-office understanding. Results indicate that home offices might well devote greater effort to procedures for handling subsidiary reports and to the relevance of outgoing communications. Japanese MNCs, being relatively new to overseas manufacturing, experience far more problems with communications than either Americans or European companies.&copy; 1976 JIBS.

Abstract: This paper reports on some evidence from an international consumer survey in Germany and the United States which suggests the existence of an information-sensitive consumer-elite which transcends national boundaries. These Cosmopolitan Information Seekers, far higher in education, income, and social prestige than &ldquo;average&rdquo; consumers, represent a growing nucleus of &ldquo;professional&rdquo; consumers in the industrially advanced countries. The article also explores some of the implications which this segment has for the multinational corporation and the design of its marketing mix.&copy; 1976 JIBS.

Abstract: One of the advantages of the multinational firm is that markets products in several countries. Several methods exist for a firm to determine which of these countries are similar for marketing purposes. This article explores the possibility of another method&ndash;clustering countries in which the firm operates on the basis of the perceptions of the firm&apos;s marketing managers.&copy; 1976 JIBS.
