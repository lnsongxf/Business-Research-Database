Abstract: This paper evaluates alternative explanations of the industrial structure of U.S. Direct Investment in the U.K. on a cross-sectional basis, using multiple regression analysis. The most successful approach, in terms of explanatory power, is that based on industrial organization theory, although useful adjuncts are found in the market servicing approach and traditional investment determinants.&copy; 1976 JIBS.

Abstract: The traditional pattern of direct capital outflows from Britain to the Commonwealth has recently been broken in favor of investments in Europe and the United States. The reasons for this marked shift in direction are examined in this paper. The erstwhile preference for Commonwealth Investments can be interpreted principally in terms of a firm&apos;s strength or lack of it relative to world competition. Accession to the E.E.C. combined with a growing acceptance of the need to build positions of strength in the richest, most advanced markets in order to ensure long-run profitable survival has fundamentally altered British perspectives on investment priorities. The changes can be understood only if conventional models of foreign investment are modified by political considerations and by the personal preferences of the senior managers involved.&copy; 1976 JIBS.

Abstract: This article uses the techniques of quantitative cross-national research to explore the relationship between foreign direct investment (FDI) and the economic, social, and political aspects of the environment. Although a strong relationship is found between FDI and variables based upon political event data. The findings are consistent with a view of political discontinuities as necessary but not sufficient conditions for business risk.&copy; 1976 JIBS.

Abstract: Industrial concentration seems to have stimulated the initial phase of recent direct foreign investment in the United States by European and Canadian firms. Increased industrial concentration seems to cause a clumping of direct foreign investment entries after investment by the leading firm in the industry has occurred. This research defines and examines the functional relationship between entry concentration and industrial concentration in European and Canadian industries which have made investments in the United States since World War II.&copy; 1976 JIBS.

Abstract: The authors develop a framework for analyzing the response of MNEs to social issues in a discontinuous multinational environment, drawing on &ldquo;organization-environment&rdquo; theory and Fayerweather&apos;s scheme of unification-fragmentation in multi-country operations. The recent behavior of North American and Western European &ldquo;pollution-intensive&rdquo; MNEs in regard to the issue of pollution control is then reported, and the observed pattern of fragmentation is explained and interpreted by use of the analytical framework.&copy; 1976 JIBS.

Abstract: It is possible for multinational firms to reduce the risk of their profits by engaging in foreign operations (F/T). Empirical rests show that the (F/T) variable is inversely related to risk after allowing for size, industry classification, and other factors. This implies that international diversification offers to a multinational firm significant risk reduction advantages that are not available to a nonmultinational.&copy; 1976 JIBS.

Abstract: An increasing number of cross-national studies are being reported in the consumer behavior literature. However, a review of this research suggests that many of the methodological issues involved in the conduct of cross-national research are being ignored. This paper presents some of the most fundamental considerations that are involved in studies of cross-national consumer behavior and suggests methods of incorporating them into research projects.&copy; 1976 JIBS.

Abstract: This article examines two basic aspects of the exchange risk policies of a sample of Canadian firms under floating rates, namely the extent of risk coverage and the means of coverage. The analysis shows that whereas the 1970 floating of the Canadian dollar had relatively limited impact, the subsequent and more general floating of key currencies (from early 1973 on) has had widespread and pronounced effects on the firms&apos; exchange risk policies with respect to both extent and means of coverage.&copy; 1976 JIBS.
