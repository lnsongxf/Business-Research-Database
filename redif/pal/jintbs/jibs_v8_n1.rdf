Abstract: This article examines the historical strategic adjustment process of ten apparel manufacturers as they reacted to high levels of import competition. The companies were divided into three groups according to their success and a series of propositions are offered linking adjustment strategies to performance. The article concludes by offering a series of public policy recommendations aimed at improving adjustment assistance to U.S. firms facing similar competitive pressures in the future.&copy; 1977 JIBS.

Abstract: On the basis of empirical research, a model of the internationalization process of the firm is developed. The model focuses on the gradual acquisition, integration and use of knowledge about foreign markets and operations, and on the incrementally increasing commitments to foreign markets. In particular, attention is concentrated on the increasing involvement in the individual foreign country.&copy; 1977 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (1977) 8, 23&ndash;32

Abstract: This article reports upon a study of personnel problems encountered by expatriate and Japanese managers and executives in international companies and joint ventures operating in Japan. The findings are based upon the results of interviews and questionnaire responses from four subsamples of respondents. The major finding was that although both expatriates and Japanese managers identify a number of real personnel problems, with few exceptions, the problems are different for the two groups. An understanding of the essential elements of the Western and Japanese management systems helps us to understand the results. Secondary findings were that problems for expatriate managers were more apparent in international firms than joint ventures, and for expatriate American-owned firms than their Western European counterparts.&copy; 1977 JIBS.

Abstract: This study presents the results of an investigation designed to examine the perceptions of American expatriate managers held with respect to the managerial qualifications of their superiors and subordinates in overseas operations of three American multinational companies. The results of the study indicate that regional location and length of time worked overseas were related to the managers&apos; perceptions.&copy; 1977 JIBS.

Abstract: These comments are in reference to Nathaniel Leff&apos;s article entitled &ldquo;Multinational Corporate Pricing Strategy in the Developing Countries.&rdquo;Professor Leff suggests that marketing executives should reduce the price of a company&apos;s products in order to earn higher profits. In defense of this seemingly trivial suggestion, Professor Leff claims that &ldquo;there are special reasons why a strategic pricing policy along these lines might be expected to have particularly fruitful effects in the conditions of the less-developed countries&rdquo;. He adduces that in these countries, the multinational firms underestimate the price-elasticity of demand and hence set prices that are higher than the profit maximizing prices. He offers four reasons for this behavior:&copy; 1977 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (1977) 8, 99&ndash;102

Abstract: Professor Leff proposed in a recent article11Nathaniel H. Leff. &ldquo;Multinational Corporate Pricing Strategy in the Developing Countries.&rdquo; Journal of International Business Studies, Fall 1975. pp. 55&ndash;64. that multinational corporations and their host countries would gain mutually if the former reduced their prices. The rationale for this thesis deserves careful examination since the economic implications are far reaching.&copy; 1977 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (1977) 8, 103&ndash;104
