Abstract: This paper discusses the role of machinery and equipment imports from the U.S. in achieving the goals of the Soviet Ninth and Tenth Five-Year Plans. The analysis utilizes both import data and signed agreements for future purchases to determine the extent to which the Soviets are seeking to increase efficiency of production by importing foreign technology and to identify those industries and their technologies which seem to be most critical for plan fulfillment. Finally, the paper discusses what insights this analysis provides for U.S. policy-makers and American businessmen.&copy; 1977 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (1977) 8, 31&ndash;48

Abstract: Although there are numerous techniques which are used in determining market potentials, when the data are scarce one of these becomes more readily useful than others. This technique is called the multiple factor analysis. In this paper an attempt is made to determine the market potential of East Europe by using this particular technique. This approach converts the unknown East European market conditions into the known U.S. market conditions by using a series of criteria as common denominators.&copy; 1977 JIBS.

Abstract: The objective of this study is to evaluate the various aspects of the business opportunities and peculiarities of negotiating in the People&apos;s Republic of China as viewed by businessmen who attended the recent Canton Trade Fairs. Many of the peculiarities still remain, as attested to by respondents of the self-administered questionnaires that were mailed to 218 businessmen. However, these businessmen indicate that the Chinese are becoming more flexible in their negotiations and are sincerely interested in expanding their trade with the United States.To date, trade between the two countries is limited in volume and value; and it has been characterized by a negative balance with the United States. Businessmen feel that as the United States&apos; demand for many of their resources and labor intensive products increases and the trade position of the Chinese improves, their demand for American capital equipment and other goods will result in increasing business opportunities with the People&apos;s Republic of China.&copy; 1977 JIBS.

Abstract: This paper substantiates the intuitive argument for international portfolio diversification&mdash;diversification that is not limited to the developed markets, but also includes the corporate securities of less developed countries (LDCs). Such diversification, in light of all available evidence, appears to be desirable from the standpoint of the investor.Capital flows resulting from international diversification can tremendously improve liquidity position of the developing countries and provide a major development impact by increasing the probability of success of the capital market development programs being pursued by many LDCs, e.g., Brazil, Venezuela, Colombia, Indonesia, Nigeria, and Korea.&copy; 1977 JIBS.

Abstract: This article estimates exports of machinery and chemical products to Eastern Europe by U.S. subsidiaries located in Western Europe and compares such exports with direct exports from the United States. It suggests one way of quantifying the dimensions of the involvement of U.S. subsidiaries in Europe in East-West trade, with the hope it will spark further study of the problem.&copy; 1977 JIBS.
