Abstract: This article presents a technique for optimal hedging decisions for a general set of international financial problems, specifically within the context of a floating exchange rate regime. The techniques discussed are designed specifically to require neither exchange rate projections nor the specification of a utility function for the decision-maker. Rather, the decision-maker is encouraged to analyze the implications of a given financial strategy over a reasonable range of future exchange rates, choosing the strategy that best meets corporate financial goals in the light of possible (and uncertain) exchange rate fluctuations.&copy; 1978 JIBS.

Abstract: This article examines of the nature and extent of disclosure of forecasts by EEC multinationals. The overall level of disclosure is low and largely of a qualitative nature. While there are some intercountry differences in the European context, these do not, in general, provide support for the hypothesis that the extent of disclosure is correlated with national equity market efficiency. An attempt is made to explain this situation and to examine current developments bearing on this controversial disclosure issue.&copy; 1978 JIBS.

Abstract: The bid-ask spread on forward contracts determines, in part, the effectiveness of the foreign exchange market as a vehicle for hedging exchange risk. The purpose of this paper is to try to explain the variation in the spread over time and across currencies by examining the costs and risks banks face when dealing in foreign exchange. The paper also attempts to define the proper risk measure for open forward position in foreign exchange.&copy; 1978 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (1978) 9, 33&ndash;41

Abstract: Accounting earnings data have been considered to possess information useful to investor decision making. If is so, then stock prices may be expected to react to the release of earnings data under certain circumstances. This article extends is the test of market price reaction to earnings announcements to the Toronto and Johannesburg stock exchanges. Unusual price activity at or near the time of the release of earnings information was found and considered to be a possible result of the earnings announcement.&copy; 1978 JIBS.

Abstract: Global production rationalization typically leads to a heavy volume of intercompany fund flows. By transferring only a netted amount of these payments, significant savings can be realized in the form of reduced foreign exchange spreads, float, and other transaction costs. However, if this netting is done by paper and pencil, opportunities to reduce transfer costs may be missed, especially where there is a complex pattern of cross-border transactions. The purpose of the paper is to show how mathematical programming can be used to design a netting system capable of minimizing the total costs involved in setting interaffiliate accounts.&copy; 1978 JIBS.

Abstract: This paper empirically investigates three questions concerning currency futures traded on the International Monetary Market (IMM) of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange: 1) Are currency future prices consonant with the interest rate parity theorem? 2) Does a characteristic bias exist in the currency futures prices? 3) What has been the holding period return experience of currency futures since their inception on the IMM?&copy; 1978 JIBS.

Abstract: This paper investigates the behavior of foreign exchange rates. Empirical tests indicate that the distribution of the underlying stochastic process for foreign exchange rate changes was stable paretion during fixed rate periods while a Student model provides a relatively better description on floating rates. These findings point to an important direction for further work on the appropriate distribution for foreign exchange rates and estimates of parameters.&copy; 1978 JIBS.

Abstract: This article surveys the reactions of financial executives (accountors) and professional accountants to the recent Financial Accounting Standards Board&apos;s recent pronouncement on foreign currency translation. CPAs were found to be generally supportive of the FASB and the provisions of its controversial standard. Financial executives, in stark contrast, were generally opposed to major provisions of FASB 8.Managerial implications of the survey findings are discussed in the article&apos;s conclusions. A major concern is that executives of multinational companies may increase their attention to hedging accounting-induced financial statement effects which may have little to do with the economic effects of fluctuating foreign exchange rates.&copy; 1978 JIBS.

Abstract: This study reports the response of 103 financial managers of United States multinational corporations to the Financial Accounting Standards Board &num;8 with regard to foreign currency translation. A sizeable majority of financial managers felt that FAS &num;8 was inferior to their prior translation method and should be modified or eliminated. The article examines reported reasons for these responses.The effect of FAS &num;8 upon exposure management is examined, with emphasis upon the fact that 23.3% of those respondents indicated that action intended to reduce accounting exposure has the direct effect of increasing economic exposure. Finally, consideration is given to implications of the financial officers expressed that financial analysts do not always assess properly the significance of translation losses and gains; this perception may not be true, in light of efficient markets considerations, but the actions of the corporate treasurers appear to be influenced by it.&copy; 1978 JIBS.
