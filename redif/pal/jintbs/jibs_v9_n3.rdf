Abstract: Results of a cross-cultural, repeated measures study of advertising attitudes among subscribers toward product test magazines are presented. The subscriber of the product test magazines, seen as an important group of purchasers and trend setters, were found to have less favorable attitudes to all aspects of advertising studied in 1976 than 1970, both in the U.S and West Germany. Differences in attitudes among age groups are much more clearly structured in 1976, with young subscribers showing consistently lower attitudes. Differences are shown between countries, particularly in varied views of economic and social dimensions. Implications are discussed and future research suggested.&copy; 1978 JIBS.

Abstract: This paper reports on the extent to which differential authority, host country risk, host country supplier, and host country perceptions exist among U.S-based and foreign-based purchasing managers who belong to the same multinational manufacturing firm. Differential perceptions were found to exist in the authority, supplier, and product areas, but not in risk area. Managerial and theoretical implications are discussed.&copy; 1978 JIBS.

Abstract: This article presents an empirical study of foreign investment board and of its real decision-making process. The analysis, based on more than 200 interviews of government officials and company executives and on a study of 25 foreign investment proposals reveals the existence of a large gap between screening regulations and administrative facilities; a series of propositions offered to explain this gap. The article concludes by giving an assessment of the Colombian foreign investment screening process and by suggesting implications for the MNC negotiation strategy.&copy; 1978 JIBS.

Abstract: Forty-four economic, social, political and policy variables are tested for their significance in discriminating among three groups of developing countries designated &ldquo;unattractive,&rdquo; &ldquo;moderately attractive,&rdquo; and &ldquo;highly attractive&rdquo; with respect to foreign investment in manufacturing. Among the six essential discriminators, the only policy variable to emerge is the corpoarte tax level.&copy; 1978 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (1978) 9, 81&ndash;94

Abstract: An inquiry into the determinants of U.S. private manufacturing investments in Africa shows that decisions to undertake manufacturing investments aboard are essentially determined by the expected rate of return on investment, the size of the domestic market, the presence of needed raw materials, the sufficiently developed infrastructure, a political stability and a favorable investment climate, and good prospects for the growth of private enterprise in the host country. On the other hand, the rate growth of the domestic market, relatively low overseas wages, and tax concession and tariff protection offered by the host governments have nonsignificant influence on the foreign investment decision.&copy; 1978 JIBS.

Abstract: This article reports on an exploratory field study on manufacturing technology transfers within MNCs. A research design was developed that differentiates among MNCs according to their maturity with respect to International involvement. Trends in technology transfers were analyzed using number of countries with manufacturing subsidiaries and years of involvement in international business as predictor variables. We analyzed total technology exports and imports, new technologies transferred, and the level at which these transfers took place.&copy; 1978 JIBS.

Abstract: Survey of U.S. firms manufacturing &ldquo;intermediate&rdquo; agricultural technology and U.S. aid organizations operating aboard suggests possibilities for expansion in developing nations. Although a need for technology transfer has been perceived, objections to the use of business must be overcome if there is to be meaningful transfer of technology.&copy; 1978 JIBS.

Abstract: In the past, governments in advanced countries have generally considered that direct foreign investment (DFI) in less developed countries (LDCs) had beneficial, or at least neutral, effects on their own developed national economies. This view has recently come under attack from advanced-country unions concerned with &ldquo;job loss&rdquo;, businessmen concerned with competition from LDCs, and government officials concerned with relative declines in technological strengths.This paper argues that DFI in LDCs has been much exaggerated as a cause of what are undeniable, deep-seated, structural problems in several advanced countries. It concludes with some policy options for adaptive, as opposed to restrictive or protectionist, solutions to the advanced countries&apos; problems.&copy; 1978 JIBS.

Abstract: Multinational enterprises are able to affect the profits reported by their subdivisions by altering transfer prices of goods shipped between affiliates. This paper shows that the profit maximizing price is a function of the level of ownership in the subsidiary, the dividend payout ratio of the subsidiary, the effective marginal tax rates in both parent and subsidiary countries, and the tariff on the goods transferred. In general, it is found that Multinational Enterprises appear to set transfer prices to Canadian subsidiaries so as to maximize the overall profits of the enterprise.&copy;1978 JIBS.
