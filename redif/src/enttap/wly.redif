Title: Entrepreneurial Founder Teams: Factors Associated with Member Entry and Exit
Author-Name: Ucbasaran, Deniz
Author-Name: Lockett, Andy
Author-Name: Wright, Mike
Author-Name: Westhead, Paul
Abstract: This exploratory study provides a review of the neglected area of entrepreneurial founder team turnover. A novel distinction is made between entrepreneurial founder team member entry and team member exit. Ninety owner-managed ventures were monitored between 1990 and 2000. Presented hypotheses relating to a team's human capital were explored using multivariate logistic regression analysis. Variables associated with entry were found not to be the same as those associated with exit. The size of the founding team was significantly negatively associated with subsequent team member entry. The link between team turnover and entrepreneurial team heterogeneity was mixed. Functional heterogeneity was weakly significantly positively associated with team member entry. Heterogeneity of prior entrepreneurial experience was significantly positively associated with team member exit. In addition, family firms were significantly negatively associated with team member exit. The average age of the team was not significantly associated with team member entry or exit. Additional insights in future research may be gathered if a broader definition of team turnover (i.e., considering team member entry and exit) is considered. Practitioner awareness of the different factors associated with team member entry and exit may encourage them to provide assistance, which facilitates the team building process over time in developing firms. Promising areas for additional research are highlighted.

Title: Enterprise Education: Influencing Students’ Perceptions of Entrepreneurship
Author-Name: Peterman, Nicole E.
Author-Name: Kennedy, Jessica
Abstract: This research examines the effect of participation in an enterprise education program on perceptions of the desirability and feasibility of starting a business. Changes in the perceptions of a sample of secondary school students enrolled in the Young Achievement Australia (YAA) enterprise program are analysed using a pre-test post-test control group research design. After completing the enterprise program, participants reported significantly higher perceptions of both desirability and feasibility. The degree of change in perceptions is related to the positiveness of prior experience and to the positiveness of the experience in the enterprise education program. Self-efficacy theory is used to explain the impact of the program. Overall, the study provides empirical evidence to support including exposure to entrepreneurship education as an additional exposure variable in entrepreneurial intentions models.

Title: The Boundaries and Limitations of Agency Theory and Stewardship Theory in the Venture Capitalist/Entrepreneur Relationship
Author-Name: Arthurs, Jonathan D.
Author-Name: Busenitz, Lowell W.
Abstract: The dynamic ownership arrangements surrounding the venture capitalist–entrepreneur (VC-E) relationship inherent in new ventures make the examination of principals’ or venture capitalists’ (VCs) and agents’ (entrepreneurs) governance arrangements interesting to explore. This article examines the limitations of agency theory and then stewardship theory in explaining the behaviors of individuals in the VC-E relationship. Our analysis points out the potential problems inherent in each theory's explanatory ability as it relates to the VC-E relationship. Lastly, theoretical gaps in the VC-E relationship are discussed along with suggestions for new theory surrounding this important and intriguing relationship.

Title: SME Survey Methodology: Response Rates, Data Quality, and Cost Effectiveness
Author-Name: Newby, Rick
Author-Name: Watson, John
Author-Name: Woodliff, David
Abstract: Cost effective data collection is an important methodological issue for small and medium enterprise (SME) researchers. There is a generally held view that mail surveys are the most efficient means of collecting empirical data, despite the potential difficulties associated with low response rates. To enhance the usefulness of mail surveys, researchers have suggested a variety of strategies aimed at improving response rates. While previous studies have examined the effect on response rates of many of these strategies, their impact on data quality and on the cost effectiveness of data collection is less well understood. This study evaluates four response-inducing strategies (printing the survey instrument on colored paper, telephone pre-notification, payment of a monetary incentive, and a follow-up mailing) in terms of their effect on data quality, response rates, and cost effectiveness for a population of SMEs.

Title: Zandinger!
Author-Name: Tompson, George H. (Jody)
Abstract: Most cases in entrepreneurship address strategic or operating difficulties of recently formed organizations. The case study presented here addresses an organization in its earliest stage of the life cycle: pre start-up. The case is about an entrepreneur who is planning to create a new venture based on a board game invented by his uncle. Accordingly, the case requires students to prioritize the tasks to create a venture from ground zero. The entrepreneur in this case already owns another successful business, has good marketing skills, and has received accolades from an expert in the toy industry. He seems to have a potentially successful product but is uncertain about what to do next. The case presents information for assessing industry structure and competitiveness, manufacturing options, and target marketing.

Abstract: The failure of past “entrepreneurial personality”—based research to clearly distinguish the unique contributions to the entrepreneurial process of entrepreneurs as people, has created a vacuum within the entrepreneurship literature that has been waiting to be filled. Recently, the application of ideas and concepts from cognitive science has gained currency within entrepreneurship research, as evidenced by the growing accumulation of successful studies framed in entrepreneurial cognition terms. In this article we reexamine “the people side of entrepreneurship” by summarizing the state of play within the entrepreneurial cognition research stream, and by integrating the five articles accepted for publication in this special issue into this ongoing narrative. We believe that the constructs, variables, and proposed relationships under development within the cognitive perspective offer research concepts and techniques that are well suited to the analysis of problems that require better explanations of the contributions to entrepreneurship that are distinctly human.

Title: The Relationship Among Biases, Misperceptions, and the Introduction of Pioneering Products: Examining Differences in Venture Decision Contexts
Author-Name: Simon, Mark
Author-Name: Houghton, Susan M.
Abstract: Although biases influence the decision to take entrepreneurial actions, studies have not differentiated among entrepreneurial decision environments. These environments vary greatly and affect which biases arise and their context-specific consequences. Focusing on the role of firm size, age, and type of product introduction, we propose that entrepreneurs in smaller, younger, firms, who are considering pioneering, are more likely to exhibit illusion of control, law of small numbers, and reasoning by analogy. These biases contribute to underestimating competition, overestimating demand, and overlooking requisite assets. We hope to spur researchers to examine information processing across different types of entrepreneurial firms and actions.

Author-Name: Keh, Hean Tat

Abstract: Even though the entrepreneurship literature places much emphasis on opportunity recognition, little is known about how entrepreneurs actually evaluate opportunities. This study uses a cognitive approach to examine opportunity evaluation, as the perception of opportunity is essentially a cognitive phenomenon. We present a model that consists of four independent variables (overconfidence, belief in the law of small numbers, planning fallacy, and illusion of control), a mediating variable (risk perception), two control variables (demographics and risk propensity), and the dependent variable (opportunity evaluation). We find that illusion of control and belief in the law of small numbers are related to how entrepreneurs evaluate opportunities. Our results also indicate that risk perception mediates opportunity evaluation.

Title: Inventors and New Venture Formation: the Effects of General Self‐Efficacy and Regretful Thinking
Author-Name: Markman, Gideon D.
Author-Name: Balkin, David B.
Author-Name: Baron, Robert A.
Abstract: This research assesses two individual differences—general self-efficacy and regretful thinking—in the context of technological innovation. Results, obtained from a random sample of 217 patent inventors show that both general self-efficacy and regretful thinking distinguish inventors who started a business (i.e., technological entrepreneurs) from inventors who did not start a new business (i.e., technological nonentrepreneurs). More to the point, patent inventors, who at the time of our survey were actively involved in new business formation, tended to have significantly higher self-efficacy. Also, while technological entrepreneurs tended to have stronger regrets about business opportunities, technological nonentrepreneurs tended to have stronger regrets regarding career and education decisions. The two groups did not differ in terms of the quantity of these regrets. Implications for theory, practice, and future study of individual differences in entrepreneurship are discussed.

Title: An Intentions‐Based Model of Entrepreneurial Teams’ Social Cognition*
Author-Name: Shepherd, Dean A.
Author-Name: Krueger, Norris F.
Abstract: Research has identified crucial antecedents of corporate entrepreneurship. Research has also identified crucial antecedents of entrepreneurial thinking. This article uses lessons from social cognition to explicitly link these two issues. We adapt an intentions-based model of how to promote entrepreneurial thinking from its original domain of individual entrepreneurship and translate that model to the domain of corporate entrepreneurship. From our intentions-based model of the social cognition of entrepreneurial teams, we emphasize the importance of perceptions of desirability and feasibility and that these perceptions are from the team as well as the individual perspective. This leads to three propositions about entrepreneurial teams and an outline of the opportunities for future research.

Abstract: Research to date has not adequately explained the role that expectancy of entrepreneurial performance based on perceived ability plays in motivating persons to persevere on an entrepreneurial task. This study investigated the entrepreneurial expectancy, effort-performance linkage via a World Wide Web–based experiment involving 179 undergraduate business students at a large midwestern university. Results indicated that the type of feedback (positive versus negative) that individuals received regarding their entrepreneurial ability (regardless of actual ability) changed expectancies regarding future business start-up, but did not alter task effort or quality of performance. Individuals receiving positive feedback about their entrepreneurial abilities had higher entrepreneurial expectancies than individuals receiving negative feedback. We also found that males had higher expectancies regardless of experimental condition than females.

Title: Competitive Strategy and Performance of Exporting SMEs: An Empirical Investigation of the Impact of Their Export Information Search and Competencies
Author-Name: Julien, Pierre–André
Author-Name: Ramangalahy, Charles
Abstract: The SMEs’ limited capacity to acquire information and use sources is a major factor explaining their low level of involvement and performance on export markets. Nonetheless, a small amount of applied research has been undertaken on this subject. We present the results of an inquiry into the impact of information search and competencies on the competitive strategy and export performance of 346 exporting manufacturing SMEs. The research model postulates that the performance of these SMEs is determined by their general competitive strategy, which in turn is explained by the ability of the business to acquire and manage foreign market information. The results of an analysis using a PLS method confirm three of the four hypotheses.

Title: What Do They Think and Feel about Growth? An Expectancy–Value Approach to Small Business Managers’ Attitudes Toward Growth
Author-Name: Wiklund, Johan
Author-Name: Davidsson, Per
Author-Name: Delmar, Frédéric
Abstract: This study focuses on small business managers’ motivation to expand their firms. More specifically, we examine the relationships between expected consequences of growth on the one hand, and overall attitude toward growth on the other. Data were collected in three separate studies over a ten–year period using the same measuring instrument. The results suggest that noneconomic concerns may be more important than expected financial outcomes in determining overall attitude toward growth. In particular, the concern for employee well–being comes out strongly. We interpret this as reflecting a concern that the positive atmosphere of the small organization may be lost in growth. We conclude that this concern may be a cause for recurrent conflict for small business managers when deciding about the future route for their firms.

Abstract: Initial public offerings (IPOs) have been a prominent focus of academic and popular press attention, especially in recent years. Much of this attention can be attributed to the increase in IPO activity as a function of the “dot com” phenomenon. Of particular interest to both academics and practitioners is IPO underpricing. Review of existing research suggests little consensus regarding those factors associated with underpricing. We provide a meta–analysis of published studies. Our findings reveal a number of significant relationships, many of which are opposite that predicted by signaling theory. Implications of these findings for practice and future research are discussed.

Title: Help One Another, Use One Another: Toward an Anthropology of Family Business
Author-Name: Stewart, Alex
Abstract: Anthropological kinship theory is explored for potential contributions to a theory of family business. This article considers the costs and benefits of a role for kinship in business. Both derive from the discrepancy between the normative orders of kinship and markets; respectively, long-term generalized reciprocity and short-term balanced reciprocity. Because the former reflects the morality of society as a whole, kinship integrates social fields more readily than more specialized orders like markets.

Abstract: Few studies in the mainstream management literature have included the family as a variable. The focus of this article is to describe (1) why there is a dearth of research using family as a variable; (2) how failing to use the family as a variable in organizational research can lead to incomplete or misleading findings; (3) the issues and concerns related to using the family as a variable in organizational research; and (4) options in research design for using the family as a variable. Given that the vast majority of organizations can be classified as “family firms,” including the family as a variable in research designs will provide researchers with theories that are more robust and that can be generalized to a larger population of organizations.

Title: Social Networks and Entrepreneurship

Author-Name: Salaff, Janet W.
Abstract: We study network activities of entrepreneurs through three phases of establishing a firm in four countries. Entrepreneurs access people in their networks to discuss aspects of establishing and running a business. We find that entrepreneurs build networks that systematically vary by the phase of entrepreneurship, analyzing number of their discussion partners, and the time spent networking. Entrepreneurs talk with more people during the planning than other phases. Family members are present in their networks in all phases, particularly among those who took over an existing firm. However, women use their kin to a larger extent than men, and even more than men when they take over an existing firm. Experienced entrepreneurs have the same networking patterns as novices. Moreover, these networking patterns are the same in all countries. However, there are country differences in size of discussion networks and time spent networking.

Abstract: The goal of this interdisciplinary study is to analyze the entrepreneurial personality in the context of resources, environment, and the startup process based on a configurational approach. The study focuses on the startup process. A questionnaire was developed to measure the configuration areas of personality, personal resources, environment, and organizing activities. A representative sample of 1,169 nascent entrepreneurs and new business owner-managers was examined. Three startup configurations were found which reveal different patterns of personality characteristics. These patterns are interpreted in the context of aspects of the environment, the resources, and the startup process.

Title: Professional Employer Organizations and Their Role in Small and Medium Enterprises: The Impact of HR Outsourcing
Author-Name: Klaas, Brian S.
Abstract: While effective HR services and programs can help firms gain competitive advantage, small and medium enterprises (SMEs) often lack the internal resources required to develop and deliver these services and programs. As a result, SMEs increasingly are outsourcing HR activities to professional employer organizations (PEOs). Questions remain, however, about the conditions under which SMEs will benefit from outsourcing HR to a PEO, as well as about the type of benefits that are potentially available. The very nature of many HR activities raises questions about the risks associated with market governance and a PEO's ability to ensure service quality for SMEs. In order for these questions to be addressed, it is necessary to understand the process by which PEO utilization affects SME outcomes. In this article, we use transaction cost economics, social exchange theory, and the strategic HR literature to develop a framework for understanding the factors and conditions likely to affect whether and how an SME will benefit from using a PEO.

Abstract: This study examines the relationship between firm absorptive capacity and organizational responsiveness in the context of growth-oriented small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). By testing the different dimensions of absorptive capacity, external knowledge acquisition and intrafirm knowledge dissemination were found to be positively related to organizational responsiveness. In addition, the relationships between absorptive capacity and organizational responsiveness were moderated by environmental dynamism and the SMEs’ strategic orientation. Results demonstrate that the responsiveness of growth-oriented SMEs is expected to increase if (1) they have well-developed capabilities in external knowledge acquisition and intrafirm knowledge dissemination; (2) they have a well-developed external knowledge acquisition capability and adopt a more proactive strategy, such as being a prospector; (3) they face a turbulent environment and have a well developed internal knowledge dissemination capability. Implications and future research directions are provided.

Author-Name: Evans, Anne G.

Abstract: This case describes Anne Evans’ search for a market opportunity in the biotechnology industry, and examines the feasibility of establishing a new venture to exploit this opportunity. The drug development process in the biopharmaceutical industry spans three critical phases: pharmaceutical discovery, pharmaceutical development, and product marketing. The drug development process is a very capital-intensive process with expenditures averaging $800 million per drug and with very high failure rates—only one out of 5,000 compounds that emerge from discovery and preclinical testing will make it into the market. The drug development process therefore contributes to very high cash burn rates and corporate failures in the biotechnology industry.

Abstract: The premise of this article is that the management team of a small firm plays a key role in internationalization outcomes. Specifically, it is hypothesized that a greater degree of behavioral integration within a small firm's management team enables it to manage the complexity of foreign sales growth more effectively, leading to greater overall firm growth. Findings, based on data collected from two different industries (software products, food processing), support the hypothesis and indicate that the behavioral integration of the management team moderates the relationship between foreign sales growth and overall firm growth.

Abstract: Scholars (e.g., Burgel & Murray, 2000; Jones, 1999; Zacharakis, 1997) have suggested that small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) international entry mode selection is an important new research area. In this study we attempt to determine if a model of large firm entry mode selection can be applied to SME entry mode choice. Using Dunning's eclectic framework, we examined SME entry into Central and Eastern Europe (CEE). We found that Dunning's eclectic framework did a good job of predicting SME entry mode selection in CEE markets. Managerial implications and suggestions for future research are discussed.

Title: Early Retirees As the Next Generation of Entrepreneurs
Author-Name: Singh, Gangaram
Author-Name: DeNoble, Alex
Abstract: In this article, we combine perspectives from labor economics and entrepreneurship to examine early retirees’ decision to become self-employed. Many individuals leave career employment before the traditional age of 65 and return to the labor market for a period of time before they fully retire. This phenomenon is referred to in the labor economics literature as bridge employment. Initial research of bridge employment has identified entrepreneurial activities to be common. The authors argue that first early retirees have to make the decision whether to permanently retire or to continue their labor force participation. If they decide to return to work, then self-employment is one option. Using the theoretical foundations of entrepreneurship, the authors outline the factors that would influence the self-employment choice and the types of entrepreneurial paths emanating from that choice.

Title: Competitive Strategy and Performance of Exporting SMEs: An Empirical Investigation of the Impact of Their Export Information Search and Competencies
Author-Name: Julien, Pierre‐André
Author-Name: Ramangalahy, Charles
Abstract: The SMEs’ limited capacity to acquire information and use sources is a major factor explaining their low level of involvement and performance on export markets. Nonetheless, a small amount of applied research has been undertaken on this subject. We present the results of an inquiry into the impact of information search and competencies on the competitive strategy and export performance of 346 exporting manufacturing SMEs. The research model postulates that the performance of these SMEs is determined by their general competitive strategy, which in turn is explained by the ability of the business to acquire and manage foreign market information. The results of an analysis using a PLS method confirm three of the four hypotheses.

Title: What Do They Think and Feel about Growth? An Expectancy‐Value Approach to Small Business Managers’ Attitudes Toward Growth
Author-Name: Wiklund, Johan
Author-Name: Davidsson, Per
Author-Name: Delmar, Frédéric
Abstract: This study focuses on small business managers’ motivation to expand their firms. More specifically, we examine the relationships between expected consequences of growth on the one hand, and overall attitude toward growth on the other. Data were collected in three separate studies over a ten-year period using the same measuring instrument. The results suggest that noneconomic concerns may be more important than expected financial outcomes in determining overall attitude toward growth. In particular, the concern for employee well-being comes out strongly. We interpret this as reflecting a concern that the positive atmosphere of the small organization may be lost in growth. We conclude that this concern may be a cause for recurrent conflict for small business managers when deciding about the future route for their firms.

Abstract: Initial public offerings (IPOs) have been a prominent focus of academic and popular press attention, especially in recent years. Much of this attention can be attributed to the increase in IPO activity as a function of the “dot com” phenomenon. Of particular interest to both academics and practitioners is IPO underpricing. Review of existing research suggests little consensus regarding those factors associated with underpricing. We provide a meta-analysis of published studies. Our findings reveal a number of significant relationships, many of which are opposite that predicted by signaling theory. Implications of these findings for practice and future research are discussed.

Title: Managing Resources: Linking Unique Resources, Management, and Wealth Creation in Family Firms
Author-Name: Sirmon, David G.
Author-Name: Hitt, Michael A.
Abstract: The appropriate resources are necessary but insufficient to achieve a competitive advantage. Resources must also be managed effectively. Herein, we develop a resource management process model composed of three components that can lead to a competitive advantage. These components include the resource inventory (evaluating, adding, and shedding), resource bundling, and resource leveraging. We examine resource management in family firms and thus explore the unique characteristics of five resources and attributes of family firms that provide potential advantages over nonfamily firms. The resources are human capital, social capital, patient capital, survivability capital, along with the governance structure attribute.

Title: Agency Problems in Large Family Business Groups
Author-Name: Morck, Randall
Author-Name: Yeung, Bernard
Abstract: Greater managerial ownership in family firms need not mitigate agency problems, especially when each family controls a group of publicly traded and private firms, as is the case in most countries. Such structures give rise to their own set of agency problems, as managers act for the controlling family, but not for shareholders in general. For example, to avoid what we call “creative self-destruction,” a family might quash innovation in one firm to protect its obsolete investment in another. At present, we do not know whether these agency problems are more or less serious impediments to general prosperity than those afflicting widely held firms.

Abstract: Effective competitive analysis (CA) is important for success in today's marketplace. CA may be particularly important to new ventures that may lack experience in their industries and knowledge of their rivals. Using survey data from 228 new ventures, this study concludes that the formality, comprehensiveness, and user orientation of CA activities are positively associated with new venture performance. Strategic uncertainty and venture origin also significantly moderate the relationship between CA and new venture performance.

Title: Is Extraordinary Growth Profitable? A Study of Inc. 500 High‐Growth Companies
Author-Name: Markman, Gideon D.
Author-Name: Gartner, William B.
Abstract: This research note tests whether extraordinary high growth (e.g., sales growth rates of 500 percent to 31,000 percent over five years) is correlated to firm profitability. Using longitudinal data from three separate cohorts of Inc. 500 firms (from 1992 to 1996; 1993 to 1997; and 1994 to 1998), firm growth was operationalized in terms of sales and number of employees. Controlling for industry sector and ranking on the Inc. 500 lists, analyses found that extraordinary high growth—in terms of sales and number of employees—was not related to firm profitability. Firm age, however, was significantly, and inversely, related to profitability; younger firms experience slightly higher profitability rates. Implications for management and future study of extraordinary high-growth firms are discussed.

Title: Institutional Determinants of Macro‐Level Entrepreneurship
Author-Name: Valdez, Michael E.
Author-Name: Richardson, James
Abstract: This multicountry study empirically explores the institutional determinants of macro-level entrepreneurship. Findings suggest that a society's normative, cultural-cognitive, and regulative institutions are related to entrepreneurial activity. Normative and cultural-cognitive institutions’ descriptive power in explaining entrepreneurial activity is higher than regulative institutions' or per capita gross domestic product. This suggests that differences in values, beliefs, and abilities may play a greater role than purely economic considerations of opportunity and transaction costs. Specific attention is given to opportunity- and necessity-motivated entrepreneurship due to their relationship to economic development.

Author-Name: Reed, Richard
Abstract: Research on organization slack has focused mainly on its effect in large publicly traded firms, but little work exists on the value of slack resources for other firms. Therefore, here, we address the question: Do slack resources matter in the case of initial public offerings (IPOs)? We argue that firms that possess financial, innovational, and managerial slack resources are sending a positive signal to potential investors regarding the quality of the IPO. Using a sample of high-tech IPOs, we find support for that contention.

Abstract: Applying insights from the generational perspective, this study explores when strategic planning and succession planning are most conducive to privately held family firm growth. The results show that the degree to which strategic planning and succession planning are associated with family firm growth depends on the generation managing the firm. Both forms of planning are most conducive to the growth of first-generation firms; however, neither form of planning confers much growth for second-generation firms. For third-and-beyond-generation firms, the benefits of succession planning appear to reemerge. However, strategic planning is negatively associated with their level of growth.

The company's three main sets of investors have different priorities: (1) a quick cash sale now, (2) delay sale for about a year if returns are greater, and (3) delay sale for 2 years, build company value, and retain autonomy. What choice would be best for the company, for its investors—and for Ken himself? And when would be the best time to implement the exit strategy?

Abstract: Metaphors are powerful tools for sensemaking, sensegiving, and theory development, but they are often concealed in academic writing. This paper uncovers two metaphors underlying entrepreneurship discourse and research—elixir and mutagen. The elixir metaphor is uncovered by examining critiques of entrepreneurship research, and serves as a compact description of problematic aspects entrepreneurship scholars should be mindful of. The mutagen metaphor is uncovered by examining evolutionary frameworks, focusing on the role entrepreneurship plays in them. The paper illustrates how the mutagen metaphor can be used to reframe entrepreneurship, and uses the metaphors to interest, inform, and provoke.

Title: Return on Recent VC Investment and Long‐Run IPO Returns
Author-Name: Michel, Jean‐Sébastien
Abstract: This paper examines the return on recent venture capital (VC) investment and its impact on the long-run stock market performance of initial public offerings (IPOs). Firms with higher return on recent VC investment underperform firms with lower return on recent VC investment by 32 to 43% in the 3-year period following the offer. This effect is robust to various risk-adjustment procedures. Market conditions at the time of the VC valuation and changes in these market conditions thereafter are the main drivers of this result, suggesting that investors are too optimistic or do not properly understand the informational content of the recent return on VC investment.

Abstract: Little is known about the drivers of entrepreneurial decisions during war. We empirically examine the effects of perceived danger, entrepreneurial self-efficacy, and resilience on entrepreneurial intentions in adverse conditions with primary survey data from Afghanistan. Our findings suggest that perceived danger is negatively related to an individual's entrepreneurial intentions, but marginally less so among highly resilient individuals. Our findings also suggest that even under conditions of war, individuals develop entrepreneurial intentions if they are able to grow from adversity (resilience) and believe in their entrepreneurial abilities (entrepreneurial self-efficacy). Practical implications for role modeling and entrepreneurship training are then discussed.

Author-Name: Meuleman, Miguel
Abstract: This paper studies the role of entrepreneurs in investment tie formation in science-based entrepreneurial firms. Specifically, we address why investment tie formation is path dependent for some firms but more amenable to intentional management for others. Using longitudinal case studies, our evidence suggests that early investment tie formation is path dependent because scientific entrepreneurs typically approach only one or a few prospective investors from within their institutional context. Differences in experience between early investors affect the professionalization of entrepreneurial teams (or lack thereof), which influences the extent to which subsequent investment tie formation becomes more amenable to intentional management or remains path dependent.

Title: Using Resource‐Based Theory to Help Explain Plural Form Franchising
Author-Name: Gillis, William E.
Author-Name: Combs, James G.
Author-Name: Ketchen, David J.
Abstract: Agency theory is the dominant explanation for entrepreneurs' decisions about how much to grow through franchising vis-à-vis company ownership. We introduce a resource-based explanation and submit that the proportion franchised is influenced by efforts to organize franchisor-owned and relational strategic assets so that their value can be best leveraged to meet key strategic goals. Using data from 168 franchisors, we found that relational (i.e., interfirm trust and knowledge-sharing routines), but not franchisor-owned (i.e., brand reputation and operating routines), strategic assets influence the proportion franchised. The study offers preliminary evidence that resource-based theory has merit as a complementary explanation for franchising.

Abstract: Access to resources is a key challenge facing entrepreneurs during early venture development. Entrepreneurs' networks serve as a principal means of identifying and acquiring needed resources. However, different stages of venture development may address different resource dependencies, suggesting entrepreneurs' networks may need to change to meet changing resource requirements. By employing network theory and resource-dependence theory, we investigate how entrepreneurs may use networks to address changing resource needs during early venture development. Results illustrate how structural characteristics of entrepreneurs' networks at venture launch are associated with network structure and content in early venture development in ways that may promote access to newly needed resources.

Abstract: This case takes place in Russia in 2008, not quite 20 years into the post-Soviet developing economy. DiPaul was an authorized dealer of electronic instruments, equipment, and materials for the production and assembly of printed circuit boards as well as soldering equipment. Its core business was supplying measurement instruments and process equipment. In the summer of 2008, the chief executive officer, who was also the majority stockholder, decided to reassign authority in a formal organizational transition so that he could become more engaged in policy and leadership of the Association of Russian Producers of Electronic Appliances and Instruments. The protagonist's concerns were as follows: How to carry out such a management transition? Who among the top management team could fit the position best? How must the organizational structure of the company be changed to accommodate the shift in leadership? And importantly, what should his own future role be?

Author-Name: Werner, Arndt
Abstract: Entrepreneurs are expected to profit from network relationships. Research addressing the link between entrepreneurs' network characteristics and their performance, however, has so far produced inconclusive results. In an attempt to explain these inconsistencies, we investigate the resource returns connected to network size and relationship quality. Based on a sample of 379 nascent entrepreneurs, we find that increasing network size and relationship quality results in diminishing marginal returns in terms of access to financial capital, knowledge and information, and additional business contacts. Additionally, we observe that the returns vary strongly by resource type.

Author-Name: Drover, Will

Author-Name: Payne, G. Tyge
Abstract: Drawing on agency and configurations theories, this study examines how perceived level of control over the entrepreneur influences venture capitalist (VC) decision making. We model the direct effects of perceived control and the interactive effects of control with entrepreneurial prestige and opportunity attractiveness to determine how various combinations of factors influence VCs’ willingness to invest. We test our conceptualizations using conjoint analyses of 552 VC investment decisions. The results show that perceived control is directly related to investment likelihood, but different configurations of control, entrepreneur prestige, and opportunity attractiveness result in different outcomes. Our findings support a configurational perspective of VC decision making.

Title: On the Theory of Entrepreneurial Incentives and Alertness
Author-Name: McCaffrey, Matthew
Abstract: This paper analyzes the theory of “entrepreneurial incentives” in the work of Israel Kirzner. It argues that there is a logical problem with the notion of profit opportunities as exogenous causal agents: Without additional assumptions, the existence of opportunities alone does not sufficiently explain the alertness of entrepreneurs. The paper considers both stronger and weaker versions of this problem. It also questions the relation between entrepreneurial incentives and the tendency toward entrepreneurial success. Finally, it provides some commentary on the relevance of entrepreneurial incentives for an overall theory of the entrepreneur, and identifies several potential solutions to the problems discussed.

Author-Name: Chrisman, James J.

Author-Name: Misra, Kaustav
Abstract: We explain why family-centered noneconomic goals and bounded rationality decrease the willingness and ability of small- and medium-sized family firms to hire and provide competitive compensation to nonfamily managers even in a labor market composed of stewards rather than agents. Family-centered noneconomic goals attenuate the ability to attract high-quality, nonfamily managers by promoting inferior total compensation packages, fewer opportunities for advancement, idiosyncratic strategies, and higher performance expectations. Furthermore, bounded rationality limits nonfamily managers' ability to meet performance expectations when hired. The result is the “winner's curse,” where neither the economic nor noneconomic goals of family owners are fully achieved.

Abstract: This analysis has evaluated the impact of mergers on new entrepreneurial firm entry in the territories of firms making up the local exchange sector of the United States telecommunications industry. An analysis of first and second mergers undertaken by the local exchange companies has revealed that where mergers occurred there was significantly lower entrepreneurial entry. The results have implications for policy, since the approval of mergers has been shown to lead to lower entrepreneurial entry where mergers occur, and the approval of mergers may serve to impede entrepreneurship. Hence, greater thought should be given to merger approvals so that entrepreneurship and the process of economic growth are not compromised as a result.

Abstract: Our research begins with a theoretical critique of the social capital literature, and then focuses on Old Harbor, Alaska. In this remote outpost, mainly populated by Alutiiq people, all entrepreneurs self-identified as Euro-Americans or multi-ethnic, not Alutiiq. Although Alutiiq people have abundant social capital, which they employed for economic purposes, they did not employ their social capital for commercial entrepreneurship. Our findings suggest that social capital promotes entrepreneurship only when supportive cultural capital is in place.

Abstract: Entrepreneurship is a perilous endeavor. Contextual changes, such as nascent technology emergence or new industry creation, can spawn entrepreneurial opportunities; however, these changes do not instantaneously create the resources and structures that new firms need to survive. This study examines the creation and configuration of the contextual infrastructure necessary for nascent technology entrepreneurship in new industries. Using the case of nanotechnology, I show how the elements of infrastructure emerge and configure through systemic coevolution. The data highlight how boundary crossing and obfuscation induces the configuration of separate elements into a cohesive infrastructure through heightened interaction and interdependence of organizations and institutions, both private and public.

Abstract: We advance and test an institutional anomie theory of opportunity entrepreneurship for understanding the combinative effects of selected cultural values and social institutions to explain national differences in rates of opportunity entrepreneurship. We theorize opportunity entrepreneurship as a creatively deviant response to anomic conditions in societies, i.e., when social institutions block traditional means of achievement. Using 10 years of data for a pooled time series cross-sectional analysis, we examined a unique mixture of cultural and institutional variables and their interactions as predictors of nation-level opportunity entrepreneurship rates. We found support for most hypotheses showing that specific institutional contexts mitigate or enhance the effects of cultural drivers of opportunity entrepreneurship.

Title: Entrepreneurship, Social Capital, and Institutions: Social and Commercial Entrepreneurship Across Nations
Author-Name: Estrin, Saul
Author-Name: Mickiewicz, Tomasz
Author-Name: Stephan, Ute
Abstract: We model and test the relationship between social and commercial entrepreneurship drawing on social capital theory. We propose that the country prevalence rate of social entrepreneurship is an indicator of constructible nation-level social capital and enhances the likelihood of individual commercial entry. We further posit that both social and commercial entrepreneurial entry is facilitated by certain formal institutions, namely strong property rights and (low) government activism, albeit the latter impacts each of these types of entrepreneurship differently. We apply bivariate discrete choice multilevel modeling to population-representative samples in 47 countries and find support for these hypotheses.

Title: Wham‐O's Offer to Buy Sprig Toys: Selling In or Selling Out?
Author-Name: Sarason, Yolanda
Author-Name: DeTienne, Dawn R.
Author-Name: Bentley, Catherine
Abstract: Sprig Toy's mission was to deliver eco-friendly, battery-free, paint-free, kid-powered toys. The company had seen a meteoric rise since its beginning in 2007. Now, however, the founders were at a crossroads. They needed an immediate influx of capital, and on the table was a purchase offer from Wham-O®. As social entrepreneurs, their decision was not purely financial. They had wanted to start a company that would change both the market (how kids played) and the industry (how toys were manufactured)—but now, they had to make a decision regarding the offer to buy their company, and they worried whether they were “selling out.”

Title: Organizational Social Capital, Formalization, and Internal Knowledge Sharing in Entrepreneurial Orientation Formation
Author-Name: De Clercq, Dirk
Author-Name: Dimov, Dimo
Author-Name: Thongpapanl, Narongsak (Tek)
Abstract: This study considers the mediating role of internal knowledge sharing in the relationship between two critical aspects of organizational social capital (trust and goal congruence) and entrepreneurial orientation (EO), as well as how this role might be moderated by the firm's level of formalization. It shows that higher levels of internal knowledge sharing relate to stronger EO, and such knowledge sharing in turn results from higher levels of trust and goal congruence. This study further provides a nuanced picture of the role of formalization in this process. The authors discuss both the study's implications and future research directions.

Title: Entrepreneurial Behavior of Academic Scientists: Network and Cognitive Determinants of Commitment to Grant Submissions and Award Outcomes
Author-Name: Haller, Megan K.
Author-Name: Welch, Eric W.
Abstract: We employ the individual-opportunity nexus perspective to conceptualize entrepreneurial commitment of academic scientists as the pursuit and attainment of external grant funding. We develop and test a model of network characteristics and cognitive biases that predict the likelihood that scientists will commit to a grant opportunity and the likelihood of receiving an award. Using data from our national survey of faculty, we find that the illusion of control and overconfidence reduce grant submissions but increase awards. Collaboration network size increases submissions and awards. Strong ties are positively related to submissions and smaller networks of strong, highly capable collaborators receive more awards.

Title: A Signaling Perspective on Partner Selection in Venture Capital Syndicates
Author-Name: Hopp, Christian
Author-Name: Lukas, Christian
Abstract: This paper analyzes the factors impacting partnering decisions in venture capital syndicates using a unique data set of 2,373 venture capitalist (VC) transactions in Germany. We employ a signaling perspective to partner-selection strategies within VC syndicates. By including time-varying information about industry experience and cooperation patterns, we explicitly take into account not only the changing social context for partner selection, but also the dynamic nature of signals sent and received. Our analysis documents that the informativeness of investment experience as a signal depends on the existence and frequency of previous joint deals with the lead VC. Experience becomes a much stronger signal if previous invitations to syndicates are bilateral rather than unilateral. The willingness to invite others to deals signals the ability to reciprocate through one's own deal flow. Moreover, we show how the value of signals erodes over time, that is, information from the previous year carries more informational value than signals from more distant years. In sum, the data reveal that different signals carry weight for lead VCs, and that the frequency of signals sent and the stage of development of the portfolio firm positively moderate the value and relevance of signaling behavior. While early stage investments are mainly characterized by need to diversify and to spread risks, value-added advice is necessary in later rounds, and hence, the strength of the signals sent and received gain in relevance and in value.

Abstract: We develop and examine a framework for the knowledge spillover theory of entrepreneurship in alliances. Our framework regards entrepreneurial opportunity as endogenous, and entrepreneurial firms as heterogeneous. The empirical findings show that partners' knowledge protection, which is regarded as a knowledge filter, can increase knowledge spillovers in an alliance. Moreover, this relationship is contingent on the strength of a focal firm's entrepreneurial orientation and on alliance type (equity joint venture versus nonequity joint venture). Results also reveal that knowledge spillovers in an alliance enhance alliance performance more significantly than they enhance firm performance.

Abstract: In this study we draw on the social network and international entrepreneurship literatures to examine the role of structural and relational embeddedness of international networks in firm internationalization. Based on a sample of 169 small- and medium-sized enterprises in the Czech Republic, we found that firms with chief executive officers who had developed strong and diverse international networks exhibited greater knowledge of foreign markets prior to internationalization. However, contrary to our expectations, no relationship was found between network density and such knowledge. In addition, our findings indicate that foreign market knowledge prior to the first international venture had a positive impact on venture performance.

Abstract: This paper examines the role of negative emotions in the social processes of entrepreneurship. Drawing on a study of Russian entrepreneurs, we develop a model of the emotional effects of social interactions between entrepreneurs and state officials. We found that negative emotions were elicited by these interactions and, in turn, fueled three forms of shame-related corrective appeasement behavior (reactive, anticipatory, and sporadic), which served to corrode entrepreneurial motivation and direct attention and energy away from business growth and development.

Abstract: The amount of research conducted on the topic of international entrepreneurial orientation (IEO) has grown exponentially in recent years, thus inviting an analysis of the scholarly conversations taking place. This paper is a review and commentary on how the construct of entrepreneurial orientation (EO) has been leveraged within the international entrepreneurship literature. The possible distinctiveness of the EO and IEO constructs are considered, and the major themes of IEO research are summarized. Several measurement-related issues particularly pertinent to the assessment of EO as a generalizable/universalistic phenomenon are considered. The paper concludes with the identification of research foci whose pursuit promises to advance IEO knowledge along productive paths.

Title: Bureaucratic Systems' Facilitating and Hindering Influence on Social Capital
Author-Name: Saparito, Patrick A.
Author-Name: Coombs, Joseph E.
Abstract: This study demonstrates how banks' bureaucratic systems (i.e., formalization, management continuity, customer orientation) are associated with social capital's relational and cognitive dimensions. We collected survey data from a matched sample of 884 small- and medium-sized enterprises (SME) executives and 217 bank managers across 22 banks to test hypothesized relationships. Our results showed that formalization is negatively associated with both dimensions of social capital, while management continuity and customer orientation are positively associated with them. These results are a first step in answering calls in the literature to study bureaucratic systems' influence on social capital. Theoretical and future research implications are discussed.

Abstract: Despite an abundance of research on entrepreneurial orientation and various dimensions of firm financial performance, very little is known about the specific influence of proactiveness on performance. In the current research, we explore the role of proactiveness in firms' interaction with the external environment. In particular, we examine the influence of proactiveness in stakeholder–firm power difference. Further, we investigate the extent to which stakeholder–firm power difference affects product safety and quality. Using a sample of 144 Chinese small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), we found that proactiveness can decrease government– and media–firm power differences. Government–firm power difference reduces product concerns, yet media–firm power difference deteriorates the purported product strengths for Chinese SMEs.

Abstract: Focusing on a firm's signaling of social capital through their alliances, we explore how socially constructed signals convey legitimacy and enable greater initial public offering (IPO) proceeds. We examine the concepts of absolute and relative social capital signals with a sample of 266 biotechnology IPOs from 1980 through 2006. Leveraging a dynamic framework, we uncover that the interpretations of quality signals vary over time and are nonadditive; rather, affiliating with prestigious underwriters limits the positive reward of signaling alliance-based social capital. These relationships vary according to whether social capital is evaluated relative to the industry norms and according to the alliance's vertical position.

Abstract: The deal-making process requires entrepreneurial actors to create and maintain wide networks of weak ties while simultaneously developing stronger collaborative ties that will enable opportunities to be realized. We currently lack an adequate account of how these activities are integrated by deal-makers under conditions of risk and uncertainty. In an empirical study of deal making in early-stage technology ventures, we find that deal-makers rely on different forms of trust in the early and later phases. Based on this study, we develop a process model and propositions on the role of trust in integrating strong and weak ties in deal making.

Title: Networking Behavior and Contracting Relationships Among Entrepreneurs in Business Incubators
Author-Name: Ebbers, Joris J.
Abstract: Many studies focus on the relationship between social networks and performance. I study networking behavior as an antecedent of tie formation among entrepreneurs in business incubators. I distinguish between two types of networking behavior: individual networking orientation or building potentially valuable ties for personal gain, and tertius iungens orientation or facilitating tie formation between others. I find that both types of networking behavior are positively related with the number of business partners to whom entrepreneurs give business assignments. Contrary to expectations, I find no relationship between networking behavior and the number of business partners from whom entrepreneurs receive business assignments.

Abstract: This study examines the differential application of mechanisms that venture capitalists use to mitigate the risks of portfolio company internationalization. We investigate differences in round size, round interval, and round syndication between new ventures that internationalize (with a fraction of revenue from abroad) and solely domestic new ventures, using longitudinal data of 962 investing rounds in 334 venture capital-backed technology companies. While opportunistic internationalizers (ratio of foreign sales to total sales less than 10%) receive less funding per round by smaller syndicates over longer intervals than domestic ventures, higher intensity strategic internationalizers receive their funding in shorter intervals.

In exchange for cash donations, attendees take home the bowl to recall all the empty bowls in the world. Monies raised are donated to community-based organizations working toward food security. The founders subsequently formed the nonprofit Imagine Render and now are considering their succession and future direction.

Abstract: In this study, we seek to understand how four dimensions of national business systems surrounding the corporate headquarters of multinational firms influence corporate technological entrepreneurship (CTE). After controlling for fairly well-established antecedents of corporate technological entrepreneurship at the firm and industry levels, we find that national-level predictors explain considerable variance above and beyond our control variables. Furthermore, we find that various national-level dimensions influence different measures of CTE. Overall, our study points to the remarkably strong role of home institutional context for understanding two types of technological entrepreneurship pursued by relatively large, multinational firms based in 24 different economies.

It finds important areas where the two diverge, implying a possible mismatch between expenditure priorities and political rhetoric. This approach is then extended beyond Sweden to include Poland, Austria, and the Flanders region of Belgium to demonstrate the application of the approach to other countries and regions.

Title: Riding the Practice Waves: Social Resourcing Practices During New Venture Development
Author-Name: Keating, Andrew

Author-Name: McLoughlin, Damien
Abstract: This paper investigates how early venture entrepreneurs engage in socially embedded practices to resource their firm. We contribute to an emerging literature that calls for a shift in perspective from “resource” as an object to “resourcing” as a practice. This shift entails a focus away from whom entrepreneurs know toward how they engage with their venture's social contexts. Through the analysis of an in-depth longitudinal case study of a life-science venture, we show that social resourcing practices are more reminiscent of a creative coping with ambiguous and ever-changing environments over time than of “heroic” strategizing. We explore how entrepreneurs mobilize and creatively combine their social resources at hand, seek resources through engaging with other practice nets, negotiate differences between practice nets, and reflectively adapt their resourcing practices toward emerging resource contexts in ways that we describe as “riding the practice waves” of social resourcing.

Abstract: This study examines how founders can manage changes in their network ties during firm founding.

Furthermore, entrepreneurial intensity mitigates the negative relationship between an increase in tie strength and founding activities; and social competence reinforces the positive relationship between an increase in the number of ties and founding activities. Our study contributes to the social capital literature by theorizing and testing how changes in a founder's network structure can be beneficial to founding activities.

Title: Motives and Outcomes in Family Business Succession Planning
Author-Name: Gilding, Michael

Abstract: The family business succession planning literature routinely assumes two main motives on the part of incumbents: family business continuity across generations and family harmony. The cross-tabulation of these motives produces a typology consisting of four distinct combinations of motives for succession planning. In turn, these combinations suggest four outcomes of succession planning, framed as institutionalization, implosion, imposition, and individualization. The first two outcomes—institutionalization and implosion—are fully elucidated in the literature. The other two—imposition and individualization—are routinely overlooked. The proposed typology highlights the repertoire of motives that inform succession planning, and how they promote distinct succession outcomes.

Abstract: The purpose of this article is to extend the existing research on the relationship between eight different types of marketing capability and social enterprise performance. More specifically, we examine third-sector organizations that have transformed their traditional business model to become more business-like social enterprises and how these marketing capabilities influence the success of this transformation in both the UK and Japan. We identify, among other things, that not all marketing capabilities are positively associated with social enterprise performance. These findings challenge the conventional wisdom that market-driven organizations must develop all types of marketing capability. We suggest that social entrepreneurs should develop their marketing capabilities selectively according to their specific performance objectives.

Abstract: We examine theory and evidence on agents in private-market entrepreneurial financings. After controlling for the endogenous issuer–agent matching and a whole host of other controls, the empirical findings in this paper indicate that agents attract more investors, broaden the geographic investor and capital base, and increase the percentage of investors and capital from investors that are more vulnerable to the costs of information asymmetry. We also find that more capable agents generally provide more valuable benefits to private entrepreneurial firm financings than less capable agents, and that increasing the number of agents in a financing further increases value to issuing firms.

Abstract: Family ties are an important conduit of resources for entrepreneurs, but both positive and negative outcomes can arise. Building upon a family embeddedness perspective, we develop hypotheses about curvilinear relationships between the proportion of family ties in entrepreneurs' networks and venture growth. We test them on entrepreneurs from China, France, Russia, and the United States. These effects appear to be related to the type of entrepreneurs' social network (business advice, emotional support, and business resources). Our results confirm effects specific to each network: an inverted U-shape for advice and emotional support networks but a U-shape for the business resource network, measuring what proportion of kin in each entrepreneurial network type is valuable to or, conversely, undermines new venture growth.

Abstract: Research surrounding how entrepreneurs identify opportunities focuses on the impact of affective valence on entrepreneurs' cognitive processes. Extending this body of research, we theorize how affective valence and affective activation work together to impact opportunity identification. We emphasize that to understand affective influences, both valence and activation should be included because they each influence active search effort and knowledge integration. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of our study and suggest that future research should include more dynamic relationships among affect and entrepreneurial outcomes.

Title: Different Strokes for Different Folks: Entrepreneurial Narratives of Emotion, Cognition, and Making Sense of Business Failure
Author-Name: Byrne, Orla
Author-Name: Shepherd, Dean A.
Abstract: This multiple case study of eight entrepreneurial narratives of failed businesses examines how narratives that express different emotional states (folks) reflect different efforts to make sense of failure experiences (strokes). Our comparisons of the narratives' emotional content (describing emotional states at the time of business failure and presently) revealed some new insights. First, high negative emotions motivate making sense of a loss, while high positive emotions provide cognitive resources to facilitate and motivate making sense of the failure event. Second, emotion-focused coping helped deal with negative emotions. Finally, sensemaking was also facilitated by cognitive strategies that focused attention on the failure event and promoted self-reflection.

Abstract: How does previous entrepreneurial failure influence future entrepreneurship? More specifically, under what conditions do entrepreneurs who rebound from failure do better in the next round? Drawing on the cognitive literature in attribution and motivation, we focus on entrepreneurs' reaction to failure and the growth of their subsequent ventures. Leveraging a survey database of new-venture founders with failure experiences, we investigate how their internal attribution of the cause of failure, their intrinsic motivation to start up another business after failure, and the extent of their failure experiences impact the growth of their subsequent ventures.

Title: Finding Practical Knowledge in Entrepreneurship
Author-Name: Kenworthy, Thomas
Author-Name: McMullan, W. Edward
Abstract: Research in the pre-paradigmatic, applied scientific field of entrepreneurship is characterized mainly as exploratory. This article advocates for a considerable shift toward a more effective applied research agenda. An applied research program is proposed based on modifications to a Lakatosian research program. The agenda extends beyond typical calls for more replication work to include a focus on practical outcomes, practical significance, and surprising findings among other things. The intent is to produce substantially more practical knowledge—knowledge that is useful to entrepreneurs, policy makers, educators, and scholars.

Title: Bifurcating Time: How Entrepreneurs Reconcile the Paradoxical Demands of the Job
Author-Name: Miller, Danny
Author-Name: Sardais, Cyrille
Abstract: Entrepreneurs have been portrayed in paradoxically contrasting ways in the literature. On the one hand, they are said to be intrepid optimists who venture forth with great persistence even in the face of considerable uncertainty and multiple failures; on the other hand, they are held to be realists who are quick to acknowledge the negative realities of their initiatives and adapt very quickly. In order to reconcile these contrasting views, this study tracks in real time the frequent confidential communications of an entrepreneur and his closest consultant and partner during the last 6 months of a failing venture. We are able to gain insight into how by adopting a positive “frame” or consistent mindset about the future, the entrepreneur is able to sustain confidence in the face of significant challenge while at the same time acknowledging and reacting to significant problems in the present. We propose that an intrinsic quality of an entrepreneur is this ability to integrate or reconcile these seeming opposites—to manage paradox, largely by bifurcating time—by making temporal distinctions, and we show how that person simultaneously can be optimistic and realistic, and persistent and adaptive.

Abstract: Franchisees' affective organizational commitment refers to the degree to which franchisees experience an emotional attachment to their franchise organization. Using a social exchange theory perspective, this research reports four studies that explore the relationship between franchisee's affective commitment and franchisee outcomes. We found that affective commitment to the franchise organization was positively related to franchisee objective performance (Study 1) and intent to acquire additional units (Study 2), and negatively related to franchisee opportunism (Study 3) and intent to leave the franchise organization, particularly when continuance commitment (i.e., commitment based on the cost associated with membership to the franchise) was low (Study 4). The implications of these findings are discussed.

Title: Do Social Capital Building Strategies Influence the Financing Behavior of Chinese Private Small and Medium‐Sized Enterprises?
Author-Name: Du, Jun

Author-Name: Newman, Alexander
Abstract: Using data from 65,485 Chinese private small and medium-sized enterprises over the period 2000–2006, we examine the extent to which firms can improve access to debt by adopting strategies aimed at building social capital, namely entertaining and gift giving to others in their social network, and obtaining political affiliation. We find that although entertainment and gift-giving expenditure leads to higher levels of total and short-term debt, it does not enable firms to obtain greater long-term debt. In contrast, we demonstrate that obtaining political affiliation allows firms greater access to long-term debt.

Abstract: This study examines the antecedents of different bases of organizational commitment and intention to stay of later-generation family members who are currently working in their family firm. Evidence from 199 Canadian and Swiss firms indicates that when these individuals' identity and career interests are aligned with their family enterprise, they experience affective commitment. Family expectations are associated with normative commitment. Individuals who are concerned about losing inherited financial wealth or who perceive a lack of alternative career paths stay with the family enterprise because of continuance commitment. Finally, individuals driven by desire or obligation exhibit low turnover intentions.

Abstract: Although many studies have assessed the effects of networking and government assistance programs on small business success, little attention has been paid to the opportunities afforded by technology for owner–managers in the same industry to offer “soft” support, such as advice, to one another. Here we examine arts and crafts e-commerce, a context conducive to comparing distinct types of advice and support, and where a great deal of peer assistance is exchanged via formal and informal networks. Survey results from 343 artisan entrepreneurs show that motivational differences influence which types of advice and support they value and which they are most likely to provide to others.

Abstract: The universe of family firms is heterogeneous, and findings gleaned from publicly listed firms may not apply to the ubiquitous, but less frequently studied, privately held family firm (PFF). As PFFs are insulated from capital market pressures, owner-managers have greater latitude in setting strategic goals, which may result in different strategic choices and performance outcomes. By employing meta-analytical techniques on 48 studies conducted in nine countries, we synthesize prior PFF research. We show that PFFs prefer more conservative strategies, but contrary to received wisdom, this risk aversion does not hurt their performance. We conclude with an agenda for future research.

Abstract: While sustainable entrepreneurs face market barriers that require them to become politically active, how to accomplish this has not yet been explored. This paper seeks to address this research gap based on an exploratory study of the Dutch clean energy sector. Findings suggest that sustainable entrepreneurs are politically active but pursue these activities using collective action. This raises issues because they face the presence of incumbents in industry associations that seek to thwart their political influence. The paper concludes with propositions about the conditions for sustainable entrepreneurs to realize political access and influence through collective action.

Abstract: This analysis demonstrates the relevance and robustness of the theory of planned behavior in the prediction of business start-up intentions and subsequent behavior based on longitudinal survey data (2011 and 2012; n = 969) from the adult population in Austria and Finland. By doing so, the study addresses two weaknesses in current research: the limited scope of samples used in the majority of prior studies and the scarcity of investigations studying the translation of entrepreneurial intentions into behavior. The paper discusses conceptual and methodological issues related to studying the intention–behavior relationship and outlines avenues for future research.

Title: “Bouncing Back” From a Loss: Entrepreneurial Orientation, Emotions, and Failure Narratives
Author-Name: Wolfe, Marcus T.
Author-Name: Shepherd, Dean A.
Abstract: In this study, we explore how failure in the form of the first lost game of the college football season for a team influences specific content within the narratives constructed regarding that loss and how those narratives are associated with subsequent performance. Building on theoretical perspectives regarding sports management, entrepreneurial orientation (EO), emotions, and the use of narratives for sensemaking, we develop and test an EO-related sports management model of failure narratives. Using computer-aided text analysis of transcripts from head coaches' press conferences directly following their team's first loss of the season as well as regression analysis, we found that the narrative's EO content has a U-shaped relationship with subsequent (i.e., next game) performance. Additionally, negative emotional content had a similar U-shaped relationship with subsequent performance. Finally, positive emotional content exhibited an inverse U-shaped relationship with subsequent performance. We discuss the implications of these results on the literatures regarding EO, emotions, and sports management as well as possible avenues for future research.

Title: Start‐Up Difficulties in Early‐Stage Peripheral Clusters: The Case of IT in an Emerging Economy
Author-Name: Kasabov, Edward
Abstract: This paper studies the link between firm-level predicaments in high-technology start-ups and collective, cluster-level dynamics in early-stage peripheral locations. We investigate, first, the manner in which high-technology start-ups in early stage peripheral clusters accumulate and utilize resources; second, ways in which managers in start-up businesses and public sector officials work around inadequacies in order to move forward clusters composed mostly of high-technology start-ups; and third, the influence of such experiences on the development of clusters. Empirical findings from three IT clusters in Vietnam reveal resource inadequacies, private sector actors' inability to resolve such shortcomings, entrepreneurial passivity, risk aversion, and lack of confidence in governmental initiatives. These findings and the comparison with earlier studies about start-up difficulties in other high-technology peripheral locations form the basis for a theoretical framework of high-technology start-up difficulties in early-stage peripheral clusters.

Title: Internal Corporate Venture Operations Independence and Performance: A Knowledge‐Based Perspective
Author-Name: Garrett, Robert P.
Author-Name: Covin, Jeffrey G.
Abstract: Internal corporate ventures (ICVs) are entrepreneurial initiatives originated within a company and intended from inception as new businesses for the parent. The literature suggests that parent–ICV structural separation positively affects ICV performance. However, the literature also suggests that ICVs can be nurtured within the parent's existing organizational structure. Our model explores ICV operations independence as a knowledge flow impediment affecting ICV performance. Primary data from 145 ICVs suggest that operations independence is not associated with ICV performance, but that parent–venture market familiarity, venture opportunity identification mode, and venture planning autonomy moderate the relationship between operations independence and ICV performance.

Author-Name: Jones, Marian V.
Author-Name: Casulli, Lucrezia
Abstract: In this paper, we suggest that individual experience and reasoning, as applied to new endeavors in internationalization, are concepts with high potential to advance conceptual and empirical research in international entrepreneurship (IE). Experience is known to be important in internationalization, but the logic or reasoning with which it is applied is insufficiently understood. Cognitive, comparison-based reasoning theories explain how individuals draw on experience to make sense of uncertain, novel, and complex situations. Drawing on two such theories, heuristics and analogical reasoning, we delineate the logic of experience and advance speculative propositions on its utility in the context of internationalization research.

Abstract: We explore how social entrepreneurship (SE) research extends the field of international entrepreneurship (IE) to affect global sustainable well-being. Well-being is a multidimensional concept that includes financial, social, and environmental wealth creation. Much of IE research thus far has been based primarily on assumptions of economic opportunity recognition, evaluation, and exploitation. We use the SE perspectives of blended value and international governance to revise the definition, assumptions, and boundaries of IE at the firm and international policy levels. We propose a broader vision for the IE field based on an expanded set of assumptions beyond traditional economic thinking.

Abstract: While there is a substantial body of literature exploring the influence of business incubation upon early stage firms, this debate remains almost entirely gender blind. This article challenges this assumption by adopting a feminist perspective to reveal business incubation as a gendered process shaping the identity work undertaken by women seeking legitimacy as technology venturers. In so doing, we critically evaluate prevailing normative analyses of the business incubation process and entrepreneurial legitimation. To illustrate this argument, we draw upon empirical evidence which reveals technology incubation as a legitimating induction process encouraging women to reproduce masculinized representations of the normative technology entrepreneur.

Abstract: We briefly reflect on the theoretical contributions of the ongoing series of special issues on theories of family enterprise and discuss the contributions of each article and commentary in the current special issue. We observe that the meta-themes—the unique goals, governance, and resources of family firms—are not only primary sources of heterogeneity but key determinants of outcomes such as the continuation of family involvement, firm survival and renewal, and financial performance. We conclude that the importance and interrelationships of goals, governance, and resources suggest that a configuration approach to studying their interactions in family firms might be useful.

Title: Goal Setting in Family Firms: Goal Diversity, Social Interactions, and Collective Commitment to Family‐Centered Goals
Author-Name: Kotlar, Josip
Author-Name: De Massis, Alfredo
Abstract: Goal setting in family firms is very complex due to the interplay between family and business systems. However, this topic is largely overlooked in family business research. In this qualitative study of goals and goal formulation processes among 76 organizational members across 19 family firms, we identify goal diversity as a direct consequence of the overlap between the family, ownership, and business systems. We found that goal diversity is expressed more strongly in the proximity of generational transitions, triggering social interaction processes through which organizational members contrast their goals. Our findings suggest that different types of social interactions lead to different behaviors, with familial social interactions being more effective than professional social interactions in managing goal diversity toward the formation of collective commitment to family-centered goals.

Author-Name: Luthans, Fred
Abstract: Kotlar and De Massis found that membership assortment and the number of organizational members, as well as the imminence of succession, influence goal diversity in family firms. They also showed that goal diversity can be managed and family-centered goals can be stabilized through professional and familial social interactions, driving the formation of collective commitment to family-centered goals (CCFG). Using this research as a point of departure, we propose that CCFG may impact family firm economic and noneconomic performance. Furthermore, we introduce to the family firm literature the organizational psychological capital (OPC), consisting of hope, efficacy, resilience, and optimism. We also suggest that OPC may be more prevalent in family firms than in nonfamily firms. Moreover, OPC of family firms may play an important role in the link between CCFG and economic as well as noneconomic performance.

Title: Exit Strategies in Family Firms: How Socioemotional Wealth Drives the Threshold of Performance

Abstract: Although research has shown the ability to exit from both successful and unsuccessful ventures is important to founders, families, firms, industries, and overall economic health, exiting from a family firm can be especially challenging. In this paper, we examine exit strategies in the context of the family firm and the family firm portfolio. Drawing upon threshold theory and the socioemotional wealth perspective, we develop a model that provides guiding theoretical explanations for exit strategies. We address two questions: (1) why do family owners develop specific exit strategies, and (2) how do these strategies differ within family firms and family firm portfolios? In doing so, we contribute to family business, portfolio entrepreneurship, and exit literatures.

Abstract: We investigate factors that influence family business owners' choice between passing ownership within the family or to new external owners. Taking an embeddedness perspective focusing on owner-family structure and involvement, we hypothesize that ownership dispersion, number of potential heirs, multigenerational involvement, and whether the chief executive officer is a family member influence the choice of an internal or external transition of ownership. We build a longitudinal data set from a sample of 3,829 family firms and their ownership transitions. Our theorizing and findings regarding ownership transitions complements the abundant research on management succession and therefore constitutes an important contribution to the literature.

Author-Name: Naldi, Lucia

Abstract: We ask whether choices aimed at preserving socioemotional wealth (SEW) represent an asset or a liability in family-controlled firms. Specifically, we consider one major SEW-preserving mechanism—having as chief executive officer (CEO) a member of the controlling family—and hypothesize that this choice is (1) an asset in business contexts, such as industrial districts, in which tacit rules and social norms are relatively more important, but (2) a potential liability in contexts like stock exchange markets, where formal regulations and transparency principles take center stage. The results from our empirical analysis confirm these hypotheses.

Title: Explaining Performance Differences Between Family Firms With Family and Nonfamily CEOs: It's the Nature of the Tie to the Family That Counts!
Author-Name: Jaskiewicz, Peter
Author-Name: Luchak, Andrew A.
Abstract: Drawing on regulatory focus theory, we advance a microtheory for Naldi, Cennamo, Corbetta, and Gómez-Mejía's findings suggesting that family ties as well as the career aspirations that derive from them trigger relatively higher prevention and relatively lower promotion goal orientations of family when compared with nonfamily chief executive officers (CEOs). Our conceptualization offers an alternative theory for why family firms with family CEOs outperform those with nonfamily CEOs in contexts such as industrial districts where conservation strategies are more valuable, but underperform in contexts such as publicly listed firms where market-driven strategies are more valuable. Our commentary highlights the need for future research to examine variance in the self-regulatory mindsets of family and nonfamily CEOs, and to link these differences to firm strategies and performance.

Abstract: We explore the vexing question of whether family firms are more likely to survive than nonfamily firms, focusing on the role of board composition. Utilizing a unique data set of over 700,000 private family and nonfamily firms in the U.K. during 2007–2010, we find that family firms are significantly less likely to fail than nonfamily firms. We identify the board characteristics associated with survival/failure in all firms and determine that it is these characteristics that are important in explaining the lower failure probability of family firms. We conclude with an agenda for further research on boards and family firm survival.

Abstract: The differences among family firms can be as telling as their overall distinctiveness from other forms of enterprise. In order to advance and condition the arguments of Wilson, Wright, and Scholes, we employ a typology of family firm evolutionary development to illustrate how changes in patterns of family involvement in the business can influence several socioemotional wealth priorities and how these in turn can shape the board composition required to enhance firm survival. We conclude by arguing how public listing and environmental competitive circumstances can condition these relationships.

Title: Familiness and Innovation: Resource Bundling as the Missing Link
Author-Name: Carnes, Christina Matz
Author-Name: Ireland, R. Duane
Abstract: Using resource-based logic, we integrate and extend theory and research on familiness and innovation in family firms. Supporting our efforts to do this is the suggestion that recent mixed results regarding the ability of family firms to innovate are at least partially accounted for by the failure to fully consider the importance of resource bundling processes as a mediator of the relationship between familiness as a unique organizational resource and innovation. Specifically, we suggest that the individual components of the resource bundling process—stabilizing, enriching, and pioneering—each mediate the relationship between familiness and innovation, and that these mediation effects account for at least part of the previously reported inconsistent results. Using theory and by integrating insights about familiness, innovation, and resource bundling, we seek to provide a more complete model of conditions affecting family firms' ability to innovate.

Our larger purpose, however, is to offer a small example of the kind of theory building that we believe will be necessary for family businesses researchers to fully leverage insights from family science.

Author-Name: Pollack, Jeffrey M.
Author-Name: Coy, Anthony E.
Author-Name: Green, Jeffrey D.
Author-Name: Davis, Jody L.
Abstract: Prevailing wisdom across the body of research regarding social ties suggests that quantity matters. However, this logic is less applicable in formal networking groups, which have a bounded (and stable) membership. In such a setting, we argue that the quality of an entrepreneur's relationship with the networking group is what matters. Accordingly, we suggest that the networking group setting is one in which core tenets of the literature need refining. Consistent with our predictions, findings from a sample of 279 entrepreneurs across 25 separate networking groups demonstrated that entrepreneurs' affective commitment to the group mediated the relations among (1) satisfaction with their group, (2) investment in their group, and (3) perceptions of alternatives to their group with the outcome of percentage of revenue generated from the networking group. These data provide insight into the psychological and behavioral antecedents of performance for entrepreneurs in networking groups: entrepreneurs who are more affectively committed to their networking groups are more likely to experience gains in revenue attributed to the group. We discuss the implications of these findings as well as offer multiple directions for future work.

Title: The Accidental Internationalists: A Theory of Born Globals
Author-Name: Hennart, Jean‐François
Abstract: The distinguishing characteristic of international new ventures/born globals (INVs/BGs) is that they have foreign sales from the outset, or very quickly afterward. I argue that this is due to their business model. INVs/BGs sell to spatially dispersed customers distinctive niche products that incur low communication, transportation, and adaptation costs. In contrast to the firms described by the Uppsala model, selling to foreign customers does not require additional time or effort for INVs/BGs. Thus INVs/BGs can be seen as accidental internationalists.

Title: International Entrepreneurship and the Theory of the (Long‐Lived) International Firm: A Capabilities Perspective
Author-Name: Al‐Aali, Abdulrahman
Author-Name: Teece, David J.
Abstract: This paper expands on the Oviatt–McDougall framework of sustainable international ventures. It does so by relating the elements of the framework to existing scholarship on the multinational enterprise (MNE), a category that encompasses foreign direct-invested new ventures (FDINVs). The paper then incorporates entrepreneurship and capabilities into MNE theory and applies them to the FDINV. Strong dynamic capabilities coupled with good strategy work together to generate and sustain superior enterprise performance in fast-moving global environments. The resulting framework is used to revisit key questions in MNE/FDINV research such as the timing and mode of FDI.

Title: Entrepreneurial Opportunities and Poverty Alleviation
Author-Name: Alvarez, Sharon A.
Author-Name: Barney, Jay B.
Abstract: Entrepreneurial activity does not always lead to economic growth. While improvements have been made to human capital, property rights protection, and access to financial capital in abject poverty contexts with the assumption that they will increase entrepreneurial activity, the results have been mixed. More recently, many entrepreneurs interested in poverty alleviation are crossing borders to engage in initiatives aimed at reducing poverty internationally. These efforts have also had mixed results. This paper posits that one reason is that entrepreneurial opportunities and their wealth creation potential vary, and the impact of exploiting these opportunities on economic growth in poverty contexts can also vary. This paper identifies self-employment opportunities, often exploited in abject poverty, that do not lead to sustainable growth solutions. Alternatively, discovery and creation opportunities while difficult to exploit in poverty contexts hold the greatest potential for significant economic impact.

Title: Shouting From the Ivory Tower: A Marketing Approach to Improve Communication of Academic Research to Entrepreneurs
Author-Name: Steffens, Paul R.

Author-Name: Isaak, Lauren
Abstract: Evidence-based practice in entrepreneurship requires effective communication of research findings. We focus on how research synopses can “promote” research to entrepreneurs. Drawing on marketing communications literature, we examine how message characteristics of research synopses affect their appeal. We demonstrate the utility of conjoint analysis in this context and find message length, media richness, and source credibility to have positive influences. We find mixed support for a hypothesized negative influence of jargon, and for our predictions that participants’ involvement with academic research moderates these effects. Exploratory analyses reveal latent classes of entrepreneurs with differing preferences, particularly for message length and jargon.

Title: What Do You Have to Say About That? Performance Events and Narratives' Positive and Negative Emotional Content
Author-Name: Wolfe, Marcus T.
Author-Name: Shepherd, Dean A.
Abstract: The current study explores how the failure of innovative projects and positive organizational performance influence specific content within narratives. Building on theoretical perspectives regarding the sensemaking of failure events and emotions, we develop and test a performance event model of narratives. Using computer-aided text analysis of annual reports, we found that project failure rates have a positive relationship with narratives' negative emotional content. Additionally, narratives' positive emotional content is associated with reduced negative emotional content. Finally, positive organizational performance magnifies the negative association between narratives' positive and negative emotional content. We discuss the implications for these results on the literatures regarding the failure of entrepreneurial projects, narratives, and emotions.

Title: Should Small, Young Technology‐Based Firms Internalize Transactions in Their Internationalization?
Author-Name: Li, Lee

Abstract: Small, young entrepreneurial firms' governance structure across countries has generated an interesting debate in recent years. That is, should these firms internalize or externalize transactions in their internationalization? Existing studies suggest that there are advantages and disadvantages to both structures, but the findings are mixed. This study explores the factors that determine the governance structure of small, young technology-based entrepreneurial firms (SYTEFs). Evidence collected in this study indicates that choice of governance structure by SYTEFs is determined by a specific set of conditions, specifically, their choice of governance structure depends on their strategic assets, industry dynamism, and business scope.

Title: The RICH Entrepreneur: Using Conservation of Resources Theory in Contexts of Uncertainty
Author-Name: Lanivich, Stephen E.
Abstract: This research was designed to extend the scope and conversation of conservation of resource theory (COR) to contexts of uncertainty, including entrepreneurship. In doing so, the resource-induced coping heuristic (RICH) construct is introduced, developed, and validated. Results from two investigations, involving three samples and a total of 813 participants, indicated strong reliability, and internal validity for the theoretically justified, three-factor measure. Also, results of validity tests show the RICH as a robust predictor of factors pertaining to entrepreneurial success, including financial performance and perceived entrepreneurial success. Practical and academic implications, strengths and limitations, and directions for future research are discussed.

Abstract: Theoretical explanations for family firm underinvestment in R&D relative to nonfamily firms remain nascent. We revisit this question using a refinement to the behavioral agency model (BAM)—the mixed gamble—that allows us to examine the socioemotional trade-offs that R&D represents for the family firm and how this differentiates their R&D investment decision from nonfamily firms. We do so in an empirical context where R&D investment is of greatest importance—high-technology industries. Moreover, we examine three contingencies that allow us to explore heterogeneity across family firms in their R&D decisions due to their effect upon the family's socioemotional wealth mixed gamble: institutional investor ownership, related diversification, and performance hazard.

Abstract: We take a first step to explore how organizational factors influence individual entrepreneurial behavior at work, by investigating the role of job design variables. Drawing on multiple-source survey data of 179 workers in a Dutch research and consultancy organization, we find that entrepreneurial behavior, indicated by innovation, proactivity, and risk-taking items, is a higher order construct. Job autonomy is positively related with entrepreneurial behavior, as well as its innovation and proactivity subdimensions, while job variety is not. This suggests that interventions related to the vertical scope of jobs will promote entrepreneurial behaviors more than horizontal job expansion.

Title: The Impact of Entrepreneur‐CEOs in Microfinance Institutions: A Global Survey
Author-Name: Randøy, Trond

Abstract: Microfinance is a global high-growth industry, in which entrepreneurship is prevalent and substantial. Based on the theoretical argument that microfinance entrepreneur-chief executive officers (CEOs) are “motivated agents” with a unique ability to hire and socialize mission-oriented staff, we hypothesize that these CEOs produce more sustainable microfinance institutions (MFIs) with better social performance and lower costs. This study utilizes data from 295 MFIs in 73 developing countries, assessed between 1998 and 2010. Our empirical evidence suggests that entrepreneur-managed MFIs feature higher social performance, greater financial sustainability, and lower costs.

Title: Founding a Business Inspired by Close Entrepreneurial Ties: Does It Matter for Survival?

Abstract: Founding a business may be inspired by close entrepreneurial ties, that is, business-owning relatives or friends. We analyze if and when such inspiration is associated with post-entry survival. Drawing on longitudinal data on 942 founders, we find a positive relationship only if founders start by taking over an existing business, or spend considerable time at start-up. Moreover, the impact of close tie inspiration is negative for founders with prior entrepreneurial experience, revealing a dark side to serial entrepreneurship. Our findings show that new firm survival can be better understood by modeling contingency variables.

Title: Determinants of Entrepreneurial Intent: A Meta‐Analytic Test and Integration of Competing Models
Author-Name: Schlaegel, Christopher
Author-Name: Koenig, Michael
Abstract: Increasing interest in the development of entrepreneurial intentions has elevated the importance of theories that predict and explain individuals' propensity to start a firm. The purpose of this study is to meta-analytically test and integrate the theory of planned behavior and the entrepreneurial event model. We summarize the findings of 98 studies (123 samples, n = 114,007) and utilize meta-analytic structural equation modeling to examine the empirical fit of the competing theories and the integrated model. Our results demonstrate support for the competing theories and indicate the moderating role of contextual boundary conditions in the development of entrepreneurial intent. Furthermore, our findings suggest that the integrated model provides additional explanatory power and a fuller understanding of the process through which entrepreneurial intent develops.

We then present an illustrative case study from India that provides an intriguing comparison with the most recent modification of the Uppsala model to integrate with effectuation theory. Finally, we offer four provocative possibilities for future research at the intersection of IE and effectuation research.

Title: Entrepreneurial Passion as Mediator of the Self‐Efficacy to Persistence Relationship

Abstract: What makes some entrepreneurs persist in their venture efforts while others quit? Self-efficacy has robustly been found to drive persistence, yet recent work suggests that affect, in particular entrepreneurial passion, may also enhance persistence. We empirically examine the possibility that the long-standing relationship between self-efficacy and persistence might be mediated by entrepreneurial passion. Using data from 129 entrepreneurs, we find that the self-efficacy to persistence relationship is mediated by passion for inventing and for founding but not by passion for developing firms. The passion of entrepreneurs appears to help explain the relationship between entrepreneurial self-efficacy and sustained entrepreneurial action.

Abstract: The purpose of this special issue on international entrepreneurship (IE) is to explore concepts, phenomena, and theories with high potential to advance the field. Rather than identify concepts from the extant IE literature, we took the more novel approach of challenging leading researchers to write about IE-relevant issues through the perceptual lenses of their own, or other scholarly domains. Through this process of cross-fertilization, our intention was to generate new topics and fresh insights, alternative arguments, and constructs. The issue's seven articles enrich concepts and theories for IE; advance complementary, or competing arguments that underpin IE thinking; and open the IE dialogue to issues of current global significance.

Abstract: Social entrepreneurs have a dominant social mission and generate revenue to ensure financial viability. However, most research treats the extent to which social entrepreneurs actually adhere to social and economic mission as a black box. Performing higher order confirmatory factor analysis on a sample of social enterprises (N∼270), this study identifies dimensions and validates measures for understanding and delineating social and economic missions, and shows how the two constructs relate to each other. The theoretical untangling and the empirical validation of social and economic missions as distinct constructs—and multiple potential constellations of attached relative importance—opens up opportunities for quantitative hypothesis-testing research in social entrepreneurship.

Author-Name: Romme, A. Georges L.
Abstract: To develop a body of evidence-based knowledge on entrepreneurship, findings and contributions from the positivist, narrative, and design research traditions in this area need to be combined. Therefore, a framework for research synthesis in terms of social mechanisms, contextual conditions, and outcome patterns is developed in this paper. Subsequently, a synthesis of the existing body of research findings on entrepreneurial opportunities serves to illustrate how this framework can be applied and provides results that inform entrepreneurial action. Finally, we discuss how this synthetic approach serves to systematically connect the fragmented landscape of entrepreneurship research, and thus gradually build a cumulative and evidence-based body of knowledge on entrepreneurship.

Abstract: Most research in evidence-based entrepreneurship builds on quantitative designs, which is unfortunate because qualitative studies provide a unique contribution to the domain of entrepreneurship. They look at distinctive phenomena in their specific time period and context in one way or another, and can help generate and test new theories. We, therefore, suggest using a systematic synthesis of case studies to aggregate the findings of qualitative research. Moreover, as a first step, we developed an example to demonstrate how this approach can advance evidence-based entrepreneurship. Specifically, we synthesized 13 cases to examine how business clusters increase the performance of firms within clusters.

Abstract: The research on entrepreneurship education–entrepreneurial intentions has yielded mixed results. We meta-analyzed 73 studies with a total sample size of 37,285 individuals and found a significant but a small correlation between entrepreneurship education and entrepreneurial intentions (  r ^  = . 1 4 3 ). This correlation is also greater than that of business education and entrepreneurial intentions. However, after controlling for pre-education entrepreneurial intentions, the relationship between entrepreneurship education and post-education entrepreneurial intentions was not significant. We also analyzed moderators, such as the attributes of entrepreneurship education, students' differences, and cultural values. Our results have implications for entrepreneurship education scholars, program evaluators, and policy makers.

Abstract: This study shows how the repertory grid methodology can be used to understand entrepreneurs' cognitive construction of business models and evidence of entrepreneurs' differential cognition of high-profit and low-profit business models. We show that entrepreneurs are more cognitively complex and more nuanced in constructing high-profit business models than low-profit business models. Furthermore, although they are perceived as meaningful, low-profit business models are characterized by relatively less clear cognitive constructions. This study suggests that the repertory grid technique may be useful for future research and entrepreneurship practice to understand the entrepreneurial cognition of business models.

Abstract: The relationship between entrepreneurial orientation (EO) and firm performance is among the best-researched topics in entrepreneurship research. These studies have been conducted in various national contexts. While a first meta-analysis by Rauch et al. finds no significant difference between EO's effects based on the continent in which the firm is based, the present study considers how national cultural and macroeconomic drivers impact the EO–performance relationship. Building upon 177 studies with data from 41 countries, the meta-analysis consolidates this literature stream, contributing to the evidence-based entrepreneurship research.

Abstract: This study sheds light on the evolution of the specialized marketing capability, pricing.

Using a sample of 420 technology-based ventures, we examine the relationship between pricing capabilities and firm performance, with a particular focus on how age and uncertainty impact these relationships to determine how entrepreneurial firms can profit. We deconstruct pricing capability into four dimensions—price discrimination, dynamic orientation, performance goal orientation, and value delivery—to show, for example, that young companies should focus on their price discrimination capability to improve performance.

Abstract: Guided by the upper echelons theory, this research examines the relationship between chief executive officer (CEO) overconfidence and a firm's entrepreneurial orientation (EO). The study theoretically establishes and empirically validates an increasing effect of CEO overconfidence on EO, although at a decreasing rate. Empirical results are based on a multisource secondary data set for high-tech S&P 500 firms from 2005 to 2007. Findings further indicate that the proposed relationship between CEO overconfidence and EO is moderated by market dynamism. A theoretically established moderating effect of market concentration could not be validated empirically.

Title: SME Entrepreneurial Orientation, International Performance, and the Moderating Role of Strategic Alliances
Author-Name: Brouthers, Keith D.

Author-Name: Dimitratos, Pavlos
Abstract: International entrepreneurship research maintains that firms with strong entrepreneurial orientations expand to international markets to enhance performance. Yet these firms can suffer from resource constraints as they move abroad. To alleviate this problem, previous research has suggested participation in strategic alliances. We developed and tested a theoretical perspective that merged these ideas, maintaining that firm-level entrepreneurial orientation is associated with higher international performance both directly and in combination with participation in foreign market research or marketing alliances. Based on surveys of U.S. and U.K. firms, our findings indicate that small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) have higher international performance when they possess greater entrepreneurial orientation (EO) and when the type of alliance (research or marketing) used is aligned with the capabilities of the firm. Further we find that participating in alliances strengthens the relation between EO and international performance. These results have important implications for managers and policy makers interested in improving SME international performance.

Author-Name: Tan, Justin

Author-Name: Wang, Liang
Abstract: This study contributes to the bonding–bridging debate in the social capital literature by examining the conditioning effects of collective social capital. Data generated from simulation reveals that network density, a measure of network-level social capital, negatively moderates the impacts of firm-level social capitals, measured separately by degree centrality and structural hole, on a firm's innovation performance. Specifically, in low-density networks, degree centrality and structural holes are complementary at enhancing innovation performance. In high-density networks, the positive impact of degree centrality weakens and structural holes turn out to be detrimental. The findings not only advance our understanding of the cross-level dynamics of social capital, but also provide a possible explanation for the mixed empirical results found in previous studies.

Author-Name: Ozdemir, Salih Zeki

Author-Name: Bliemel, Martin J.
Abstract: Entrepreneurs have two key aims in managing their ego-networks: extending reach to valuable resources and facilitating resource acquisition. This study provides a synthesis of the brokerage, cohesion, and embeddedness literatures to develop and present a multilevel theoretical framework and analytical model that treat both aims jointly. It makes three contributions. First, it highlights a trade-off that entrepreneurs face in allocating their available networking time and energy while pursuing these two aims. Second, it explores the central role of two types of embeddedness—relational and structural—in resolving this trade-off. Third, it helps entrepreneurs decide when to embed a particular dyadic connection relationally or structurally. We show that entrepreneurs can better balance their dual aim by structurally embedding some ties rather than trying to relationally embed all. The resultant network is one that meshes characteristics of brokerage and cohesive ego-network structures.

This article highlights the major discrepancies between theory and practice and points out potential avenues for further research.

Title: International Analysis of Venture Capital Programs of Large Corporations and Financial Institutions
Author-Name: Da Gbadji, Luc Armel G.
Author-Name: Gailly, Benoit
Author-Name: Schwienbacher, Armin
Abstract: In this article, we investigate what drives large companies (nonfinancial corporations and financial institutions) worldwide to run venture capital (VC) programs, specifically targeting Fortune Global 500 companies. Such a decision involves trade-offs between expected strategic and financial benefits and costs of managing and financing a portfolio of ventures, which are influenced by the institutions and regulations that affect innovation-oriented entrepreneurship. We determine that companies are more likely to run a program if they are based in countries in which the market for early-stage investments is well developed and innovation-related resources are more widely available. Moreover, companies based in countries with costly personal bankruptcy regulations are less likely to run a VC program, which is consistent with the prediction that these regulations discourage entrepreneurial initiatives. These findings emphasize the importance of favorable local conditions for an affiliated VC program. We observe no evidence, however, that unfavorable local conditions affect the degree of internationalization of programs, suggesting that running international programs entails significant extra costs. Finally, no significant difference emerges between U.S.-based and Western European-based companies.

We extend extant work by specifying the practices within developed regions from which entrepreneurs arguably pursue liberation and then developing hypotheses pertaining to the incidence, determinants, and outcomes associated with departure from such norms. Our survey findings offer evidence to question not only the prevalence with which entrepreneurs in such contexts deviate from the status quo, but also the characteristics of those who enact greater departure. On average, women are not more likely to do so; moreover, they tend to be less satisfied overall when they do deviate highly.

Title: The Context of Social Capital: A Comparison of Rural and Urban Entrepreneurs in Uganda
Author-Name: Rooks, Gerrit
Author-Name: Klyver, Kim
Author-Name: Sserwanga, Arthur
Abstract: Classical network theory states that social networks are a form of capital because they provide access to resources. In this article, we propose that network effects differ between collectivistic and individualistic contexts. In a collectivistic context, resource sharing will be “value based.” It is expected that members of a group support each other and share resources. In contrast, in an individualistic context, resource sharing will be more often based on reciprocity and trust. Hence, we hypothesized that networks will be more beneficial in individual contexts compared with collectivistic context. We found partial support for our hypotheses.

Abstract: Microloans garnered from crowdfunding provide an important source of financial capital for nascent entrepreneurs. Drawing on cognitive evaluation theory, we assess how linguistic cues known to affect underlying motivation can frame entrepreneurial narratives either as a business opportunity or as an opportunity to help others. We examine how this framing affects fundraising outcomes in the context of prosocial lending and conduct our analysis on a sample of microloans made to over 36,000 entrepreneurs in 51 countries via an online crowdfunding platform. We find that lenders respond positively to narratives highlighting the venture as an opportunity to help others, and less positively when the narrative is framed as a business opportunity.

Abstract: This paper aims to contribute to the emerging perspective on organizational entrepreneurship by outlining how resistance to managerial policies and decisions can give birth to alternative organizational styles. Drawing on an in-depth analysis of a personal narrative of an R&D team manager opposition to hierarchical decisions, we link studies on resistance and organizational entrepreneurship to suggest that active resistance, which we define as the capacity to live beyond managerial control to create spaces of creativity and solidarity and alternative modalities of work in an organizational context, can actually contribute to the entrepreneurial process.

Title: The Effect of Virtuous and Entrepreneurial Orientations on Microfinance Lending and Repayment: A Signaling Theory Perspective
Author-Name: Moss, Todd W.
Author-Name: Neubaum, Donald O.
Author-Name: Meyskens, Moriah
Abstract: The availability of capital for microenterprises has grown rapidly due to microfinancing platforms such as Kiva. The investment decisions of microlenders are challenged due to the limited information about the microenterprises' characteristics and behavioral intentions. Extending signaling theory, we suggest that microenterprises' narratives on microfinancing platforms are an important means to signal valuable characteristics and behavioral intentions to prospective lenders. Results indicate that microenterprises, which signal autonomy, competitive aggressiveness, and risk-taking, are more likely to receive funding, and to receive it more quickly. Microenterprises that signal conscientiousness, courage, empathy, and warmth are less likely to get funded. Rhetorical signaling proactiveness, conscientiousness, courage, warmth, or zeal is negatively associated with loan repayment.

Abstract: There have appeared of late numerous important articles elaborating on and researching the concept of socioemotional wealth, within the last year in Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice, others published in journals ranging from Administrative Science Quarterly to Family Business Review. Given the increasing popularity and generality of the concept, it is perhaps worth revisiting it to assess its potential for enhancing our understanding of family firms. We shall examine the socioemotional wealth concept and the challenges it poses for researchers, and propose some conceptual and methodological notions for increasing its utility.

Author-Name: Ingram, Amy E.

Abstract: Scholars stress that family firms are inherently paradoxical, and that tensions, such as tradition versus change, family liquidity versus business growth, and founder control versus successor autonomy, can both inhibit and foster innovation. Further, theorists propose that firms led by paradoxical thinkers are more likely to manage these tensions and fuel innovative behavior. Leveraging family business and organizational paradox literatures, this multi-stage exploratory study develops measures of paradoxical tensions and paradoxical thinking in family firms, and tests these propositions. Findings indicate that paradoxical tensions may stymie innovative behavior, but that leaders' paradoxical thinking is positively related to innovative behavior.

Abstract: Understanding the forces that support and inhibit product development (PD) in family firms is central to explaining their long-term success and survival. Our study reveals that social capital and relational conflict among family members do not affect PD directly, as existing theory suggests, but only through the internalization of knowledge among family members. In contrast, family members’ affective commitment to the family firm is so powerful that it has both a mediated and a direct effect on PD. These results differ across generations of the controlling family, therefore offering an extension of existing theories of knowledge and PD in family firms.

Abstract: Scholars have argued that informality is driven by the degree to which it is expensive or difficult to operate in the formal economy. In contrast, we argue that firms choose to be informal or formal partly driven by industry conditions. We examine informal firms that are not registered with a governmental authority. Based on a large data set of Brazilian businesses, we find that firm informality is positively associated with dynamism, yet negatively associated with munificence and concentration. Our findings suggest that informality is a decision driven by both cost of registering and risk reduction for entrepreneurs depending on industry conditions.

Abstract: Although previous research has extolled the importance of business failure as a precursor to transformational learning, few studies have explored the conditions under which such learning occurs or the content of the resulting knowledge. We explore several cognitive moderators of the relationship between failure experiences and a specific type of opportunity identification knowledge—the use of structural alignment processes. Results indicate that learning from failure is facilitated for entrepreneurs who possess a cognitive toolset that consists of opportunity prototypes and an intuitive cognitive style. Moreover, we found that prior professional knowledge negatively moderates this relationship.

Author-Name: Balachandra, Lakshmi
Abstract: In this study, we examine whether female entrepreneurs are held to a different standard than male entrepreneurs in obtaining financing from banks. To test this idea, we draw from the literature on signaling theory to propose that characteristics specific to the firm and the entrepreneur act as a means to communicate (i.e., signal) the inherent quality of the venture and thus impact the amount of capital the entrepreneur is able to obtain. We then explore the moderating role of gender based on gender role congruity theory to argue that capital providers reward the business characteristics of male and female entrepreneurs differently to the disadvantage of women.

Title: Internal Social Capital and the Attraction of Early Contributions in Crowdfunding

Abstract: The nascent crowdfunding literature has highlighted the existence of a self-reinforcing pattern whereby contributions received in the early days of a campaign accelerate its success. After discussing what sustains this pattern, we maintain that the internal social capital that proponents may develop inside the crowdfunding community provides crucial assistance in igniting a self-reinforcing mechanism. Results of an econometric analysis of a sample of 669 Kickstarter projects are consistent with this view. Moreover, the effect of internal social capital on the success of a campaign is fully mediated by the capital and backers collected in the campaign's early days.

Title: Cutting Microfinance Interest Rates: An Opportunity Co‐Creation Perspective
Author-Name: Sun, Sunny Li
Author-Name: Im, Junyon
Abstract: Microfinance is a social innovation to alleviate poverty by providing small, unsecured loans to local indigent entrepreneurs. Many borrowers use microfinance loans to seed their small entrepreneurial businesses. However, high interest rates charged by microfinance institutions (MFIs) are likely to increase the financial burden of those borrowers. In this study, we adopt an opportunity co-creation perspective to analyze the factors that affect microfinance interest rates. We argue that new opportunities in a social venture could be co-created by multiple stakeholders, including MFIs, borrower communities, female borrowers, governments, MFI managers, and employees. We tested our hypothese on interest rate setting of MFIs by using 4,187 organization-year observations from 2003 to 2011 across 93 countries, and the empirical results largely support the hypotheses. Our opportunity co-creation perspective extends the current understanding on microfinance and provides important managerial implications.

Abstract: In order to identify shifts and trends in the entrepreneurship literature over the past 25 years, we conduct a bibliometric study involving new data from the 2000–2009 era building on 1985–1999 data to study entrepreneurship research published in the major management journals. Our findings indicate that entrepreneurship articles now have a significant presence in the mainline “A” journals. Furthermore, we contend that this presence signals legitimacy and, more importantly, a growing exchange among researchers studying entrepreneurship. The area of entrepreneurial opportunities and nascent ventures is showing signs of growth and in our view represents an area where entrepreneurship is contributing back to the broader research conversation in organizational studies.

Title: Perceptions of Adverse Work Conditions and Innovative Behavior: The Buffering Roles of Relational Resources
Author-Name: De Clercq, Dirk

Author-Name: Belausteguigoitia, Imanol
Abstract: This study investigates how employees' perceptions of adverse work conditions might discourage innovative behavior and the possible buffering roles of relational resources. Data from a Mexican-based organization reveal that perceptions of work overload negatively affect innovative behavior, but this effect gets attenuated with greater knowledge sharing and interpersonal harmony. Further, although perceived organizational politics lead to lower innovative behavior when relational resources are low, they increase this behavior when resources are high. Organizations which seek to adopt innovative ideas in the presence of adverse work conditions thus should create relational conduits that can mitigate the associated stress.

Title: Dead Money: Inheritance Law and the Longevity of Family Firms
Author-Name: Carney, Michael

Abstract: “Dead money” refers to the potential for the division, reduction, and misallocation of family firm assets during intergenerational wealth transfers. We consider the effects of inheritance law provisions on property transfers and the potential impact on family firm vitality in four jurisdictions: Germany, France, Hong Kong SAR, and the United States. These jurisdictions have divergent legal origins and inheritance law regimes that generate distinct patterns of transformation and continuity in family firms. The contribution of the paper is to identify external institutional factors that determine the central tendencies on family firm longevity in a literature that has hitherto focused on internal factors such as the efficacy of adopting professional management and succession planning.

Recognition is given to the fact that the dynamics of family firms is inextricably linked to the life cycle of families, and that governance mechanisms need to react to changes and developments during the life cycle if the family firm is to be conserved.

Title: Are Family Firms Really More Socially Responsible?
Author-Name: Cruz, Cristina

Author-Name: Berrone, Pascual
Abstract: This paper conducts an empirical study as to whether family firms are more socially responsible than their nonfamily counterparts and explores the conditions in which this difference in social behavior occurs. We argue that family firms, given their socioemotional wealth bias, have a positive effect on social dimensions linked to external stakeholders, yet have a negative impact on internal social dimensions. Thus, family firms can be socially responsible and irresponsible at the same time. We also suggest that institutional and organizational conditions act as catalysts in the relationship between firm type and corporate social responsibility (CSR). General support for our thesis that family firms neglect internal social dimensions came from the study of a sample of 598 listed European firms over a period of 4 years. Moreover, while national standards and industry conditions influence the degree of CSR in nonfamily firms, these factors do not affect family firms. However, family firms' social activities are more sensitive to declining organizational performance.

Title: Socioemotional Wealth Conflict in Family Firms
Author-Name: Vardaman, James M.
Author-Name: Gondo, Maria B.
Abstract: While Cruz, Larraza-Kintana, Garcés-Galdeano, and Berrone demonstrate how SEW can simultaneously elicit good and bad behavior in regard to corporate social responsibility, their findings also give rise to the idea that maintaining control and influence over day-to-day operations (internal socioemotional wealth [SEW]) and maintaining positive assessments of the firm's reputation (external SEW) may at times be in conflict. This commentary builds upon this notion by highlighting the need to explicitly examine SEW conflict, as well as offering initial theorizing on how family firms will pursue SEW preservation in these situations. Drawing on image theory, we theorize a process where preserving internal SEW is generally used as the guiding script in family firms because it is more salient on an everyday basis. However, we propose that if its preservation threatens the organization's identity and reputation, the script will be disrupted, precipitating a shift to preserving external SEW. The article concludes by discussing the broader theoretical implications of SEW conflict for family firms.

Abstract: We examine the relationship among structural social capital, resource assembly, and firm performance of entrepreneurs in Africa. We posit that social capital primarily composed of kinship or family ties helps the entrepreneur to raise resources, but it does so at a cost. Using data drawn from small firms in Kampala, Uganda, we explore how shared identity among the entrepreneur's social network moderates the relationship between social capital and outcomes. A large network contributed a higher quantity of resources raised, but at a higher cost when shared identity was high. We discuss the implications of these findings for the role of family ties and social capital in resource assembly, with an emphasis on developing economies.

The propensity for moral hazard associated with each network type is explicated, and mechanisms for mitigating the cost/benefit of such dysfunctions are addressed.

Abstract: One of the most significant challenges facing family firms is how to successfully manage succession from one generation of leaders to the next.

Building on a case study of Alessi, a family-owned Italian design firm, we draw on the literature on organizational narratives to develop a framework for understanding family business succession narratives and present a typology of some of the narrative strategies that can be used during succession. We conclude with a discussion of the theoretical and practical ramifications of a narrative view of succession in family firms.

Title: A Downside to the Entrepreneurial Personality?
Author-Name: Miller, Danny
Abstract: The literature on entrepreneurship bears a distinctly positive cast, often with good reason. Entrepreneurs and their innovations have contributed enormously to national wealth, and so scholars have examined the personalities, capabilities, and contexts underlying these contributions. However, despite some early work, the negative aspects of the entrepreneurial personality have been largely ignored. We shall argue that given the nature of the challenges facing many entrepreneurs and the consequent demands of their jobs, certain personality traits will be quite valuable to them. These, however, tend to be Janus-faced in that positive attributes, such as energy, self-confidence, need for achievement, and independence, may sometimes devolve naturally into aggressiveness, narcissism, ruthlessness, and irresponsibility. Given the costly repercussions of the latter characteristics, we urge more study of their nature and causes among entrepreneurs.

Abstract: This study examines how angel investor–entrepreneur task conflicts are related to portfolio company innovativeness and how this relationship is moderated by the level of agreement on priorities, diversity of entrepreneurial experience, and the level of communication. Using survey data gathered from 54 teams of angels and entrepreneurs in Belgium and the United States, we show that the negative relationship between task conflict and innovativeness is more severe when the teams have lower levels of agreement on priorities, when there is less diversity of experience in the team, and when the teams communicate more frequently.

Abstract: This case concerns Bio3 Research, a small biotechnology company established in Italy in 2001 that focuses on cardiovascular disorders, connective tissue regeneration, and renal disorders. The case reports on Dr. Pilato, founder and chief executive officer of Bio3 Research, while reflecting with his chief operating officer on the investments required to finance his patents and products pipeline. The case offers a discussion around the entrepreneurial process of Bio3 Research, from opportunity identification to opportunity development and exploitation. The case then reveals Bio3 Research's business model and examines its activities and management practices in the patent market. In a recessive world economy, Bio3 Research has an exciting portfolio of patents and products in high-growth markets but must decide between financial options, as the company cannot exploit all of these opportunities on its own.

Abstract: Self-employment is often seen as an attractive alternative to wage employment, despite lower welfare protection, higher risks, and more required effort than in the latter. It is then important to investigate why individuals choose self-employment. In addition to potential earnings, other factors may be considered, including displacement, uncertainty, unemployment risk, and dissatisfaction. Building on a job quits model, we propose an empirical representation of transitions to self-employment, which includes subjective evaluations of pecuniary and nonpecuniary satisfaction on the previous job. Additionally, we focus on the dynamics of job satisfaction, highlighting the role played by shocks in subjective evaluations.

Title: CLIFTEX Theatre: Balancing Technology and Sustainability
Author-Name: Brunson, Rochelle R.
Author-Name: Reed, Marlene M.
Abstract: Phyllis Gamble and her business partner, Mechelle Slaughter, had purchased the CLIFTEX Theatre in Clifton, Texas, in 2008 and had spent a great deal of time and money restoring this historic venue. The theater had been founded in 1916 and was the oldest continually operating theater in the state of Texas. The primary purpose for the purchase and restoration of the theater by the two women had been to give something back to a community which they had grown to love. They had never expected it to be profitable as long as they operated it; however, they had envisioned an exit strategy in which they would be able to achieve sustainability at some point for the theater so that they could hand it over to a member of the community who could use the business for his/her own livelihood. An immediate question they were facing in 2011 was whether or not to spend $75,000 to replace reel-to-reel with digital projection. The transformation would provide better sound and picture quality but would be very expensive to implement. There was the related issue of whether the digital equipment might allow them to host other events that might make the theater profitable.

Abstract: Although similarity attraction theory is often utilized to explain why people form relationships with similar others, we utilize diversity research to look beyond surface-level demographic characteristics similarity to explain situations when angels form interpersonal relations with angels with dissimilar deep-level personal characteristics due to a strong desire to receive information and cognitive benefits. We use data collected from a chapter of one of the largest angel organizations in the United States. Our results show that although individuals often form relations with similar others, conditions exist when angels exert the extra effort required to form relations with dissimilar others.

Title: Human Capital and Entrepreneurship Research: A Critical Review and Future Directions
Author-Name: Marvel, Matthew R.
Author-Name: Davis, Justin L.
Author-Name: Sproul, Curtis R.
Abstract: Human capital has emerged as a highly utilized theoretical lens through which scholars can better understand entrepreneurship. To synthesize the progress of this stream and promote its use, we review 109 articles in leading management and entrepreneurship journals over two decades. We organize our discussion in terms of multi-theory approaches, methods and analyses, constructs, and study focus. A number of research gaps and promising areas for inquiry are put forward. We develop a typology of human capital and discuss how future investigations of types of human capital related to the entrepreneurship process can benefit research and practice.

Title: Stratification, Economic Adversity, and Entrepreneurial Launch: The Effect of Resource Position on Entrepreneurial Strategy
Author-Name: Perry‐Rivers, Patrice
Abstract: This paper analyzes whether or not the simple theory of income choice, which indicates there is a positive relationship between economic adversity and entrepreneurship, is applicable to all groups and may have been overgeneralized in entrepreneurship research. Using social stratification theory and the resource-based view, I explore how accumulated resource position differences between advantaged and disadvantaged entrepreneurial actor groups could result in their employing different strategies when exposed to economic adversity. I find that economic adversity has no relationship with entrepreneurship (self-employment rates) in advantaged or disadvantaged groups, and these groups use resources divergently due to their converse resource positions.

Title: Productivity Growth in Private‐Equity–Backed Family Firms
Author-Name: Croce, Annalisa
Author-Name: Martí, José
Abstract: We study the reluctance of family firms to accept private equity (PE) investors and the impact of PE on family firms' performance. We analyze the productivity growth in a sample of 257 PE-backed family firms, 143 of which were run by the founding generation. We compare these firms with both non-PE-backed family firms and non family PE-backed firms. We find that family firms accessing PE show lower productivity growth before the initial PE round, which is driven by an imbalance between inputs and output, especially in founder-controlled firms. Our results also confirm the positive impact of PE involvement on productivity growth in founder-controlled firms.

Title: Does the Possibility to Make Equity Investments in Crowdfunding Projects Crowd Out Reward‐Based Investments?
Author-Name: Cholakova, Magdalena
Author-Name: Clarysse, Bart
Abstract: Despite crowdfunding's increasing popularity as a vehicle for financing early-stage ventures, we still know relatively little about the mechanisms that drive individuals to pledge and invest via such online platforms. We explored the extent to which financial or nonfinancial motivations determine the decision to invest for equity or to pledge. In addition, we also looked at whether having invested for equity can crowd out individuals' motivation to keep a pledge into the same project. Our results show that nonfinancial motives play no significant role. Furthermore, we find that having invested for equity is a positive predictor of keeping a pledge.

Title: Long‐Term Orientation in Publicly Traded Family Businesses: Evidence of a Dominant Logic
Author-Name: Gentry, Richard

Author-Name: Kim, Jaemin
Abstract: Drawing from the behavioral theory of the firm, we examine the role of a long-term orientation in decision making at publicly traded, family-influenced firms (FIFs). We advance a view of the family as part of a firm's dominant coalition and the resulting effects of a family-influenced coalition on the FIF's decision making. Using a sample of publicly traded firms, our findings indicate that FIFs' decision making reflects a focus on a long-term orientation, manifested in the greater accumulation of slack resources, less strategic risk taking, and lower bankruptcy risk than non-FIF firms.

Abstract: Early stage high-tech firms are confronted with a number of challenges related to the homogeneous and technical nature of the start-up team. Attracting outside board members can alleviate these challenges and consequently enhance firm performance. Building on team production and human capital theory, we study how outside board human capital affects technological and market performance. Our results, based on a longitudinal panel data set consisting of 562 firm-year observations in 80 young high-tech ventures in Belgium, show that outside board-specific experience, diversity, and tenure are important determinants of firm performance. We discuss implications for research and practice.

Abstract: We analyze partner selection decisions in the formation of borrowing groups in joint liability-based microcredit. We do so within the context of a framed field experiment with the owners of small businesses in rural Bangladesh. We find that when, irrespective of their project status, borrowers are required to make joint liability payments, risky borrowers will offer side payments that are sufficiently large to attract safe borrowers, leading to the formation of heterogeneous risk-matched groups. We discuss the implications of heterogeneous risk matching for the survival and success of small enterprises, and their financiers, in countries with a weak institutional environment.

Abstract: New financing alternatives, such as microfinance, crowdfunding, and peer-to-peer lending, have expanded rapidly. To date, few studies have investigated the antecedents and consequences of these financing mechanisms. This special issue provides an academic foundation for understanding new financial options that entrepreneurs can now use to start and grow ventures. In the introductory article, we integrate strands of the literature on emerging innovations in entrepreneurial finance and provide a framework for a systematic approach to new research questions. We conclude with a discussion of the six papers in the special issue and demonstrate how they contribute to the framework.

Abstract: This case presents challenges facing a student-run venture accelerator at a major university in the United States. The student-run model has attracted much media attention for its uniqueness, but it has also raised questions about its sustainability. Signals from a new dean, not invested in the student model, are putting much pressure on the student-chief executive officer to change course—to tweak the student-run model and fight for its future or cave in to pressures to “professionalize” it and let students take a backseat in management. The case highlights challenges in entrepreneurial leadership of a student-run accelerator at the point of initial growth.

Abstract: We draw on the institutional logics perspective to understand different approaches that family firms can use to manage the process of succession. Based on the analysis of 21 case studies of family firms in Germany, we identify four different ways of managing potentially conflicting family and commercial logics that are associated with four different succession processes. Our findings contribute to the family firm literature by improving our knowledge of the heterogeneity of family firms and by explaining different ways that the family logic can influence firm behavior. Moreover, we contribute to institutional theory by showing the importance of filtering mechanisms for organizations that must respond to coexisting logics.

Abstract: Corporate entrepreneurship managers often need to terminate projects to maximize their innovation portfolios' commercial prospects. Drawing on the attention-based view of the firm, we develop a model for how past project failure experience, the firm's growth rate, and their hierarchical level impact managers' attention to a project's fit with the corporate portfolio strategy and the balance of the portfolio when terminating projects. Using data from a conjoint study with 6,944 assessments of project terminations made by 217 managers, we provide insights into corporate entrepreneurship decision making and how portfolio-level, individual-level, and firm-level aspects interact in explaining project termination.

Author-Name: Walgenbach, Peter
Abstract: This article explores the effects of changes in the initial venture team on a firm's failure risk by considering firm age. The results show that founder exits are especially critical for firm survival in the first years of a firm's existence, whereas the entry of a new team member is more beneficial in later years. Further, an investigation of multiple founder exits shows that the time that elapses between two exits has a U-shaped relationship with a firm's hazard risk. Discussing these findings in terms of imprinting and the liability of newness, we contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of venture team dynamics and firm survival.

Abstract: In mid-2012, Charles Gilman, the founder and sole owner of the custom fixture manufacturer/installation company CustomFittings, was approached by a local competitor, Jack Miller, with an offer to buy his company for $9.5 million. This tangible offer forced Charles to decide what to do with CustomFittings, as he and his wife, Christine Gilman, were approaching retirement age. Although their son, Bill Gilman, was keen on taking over the company, Charles and Christine were depending on the firm to fund their retirement—but Bill did not have enough capital to buy the firm and thus provide them with a suitable retirement sum. While accepting the offer from Jack would put the couple in a comfortable position financially, the move might jeopardize their son's career, their employees' jobs, and the family's legacy and reputation.

Abstract: The current research investigates how entrepreneurial orientation changes during a chief executive officer (CEO)'s tenure in family and nonfamily firms. Based on secondary data collected from 210 firms representing five industries, the results show an inverse U-shaped relationship between CEO tenure and entrepreneurial orientation, consistent with the executive life cycle literature. Moreover, in family firms the shape of the inverse U is less pronounced and the level of entrepreneurial orientation peaks considerably later in the CEO's tenure when compared with nonfamily firms.

Abstract: This paper discusses the influence of Israel Kirzner on the field of entrepreneurship research. We review Kirzner's work and argue that it contains two distinct approaches to entrepreneurship, termed Kirzner Mark I and Kirzner Mark II. Mark I with its focus on alertness and opportunity discovery has exerted a strong influence on entrepreneurship research in the last decade, and helped catapult the field forward. We propose that Mark II, with its emphasis on time, uncertainty, and creative action in pursuit of imagined opportunities, complements the discovery view and can provide an alternative conceptual grounding for the decade to come.

Title: Much Ado About Nothing? The Surprising Persistence of Nascent Entrepreneurs Through Macroeconomic Crisis
Author-Name: Davidsson, Per
Author-Name: Gordon, Scott R.
Abstract: We hypothesize that a major macroeconomic crisis triggers four alternative responses among nascent entrepreneurs: disengagement, delay, compensation, and adaptation. We also suggest that commitment and ambition (or “high potential”) moderate these responses. Our most important finding is the relative absence of behavioral crisis responses. However, crises may make high-tech founders become more likely to disengage, whereas the opposite holds for founders far into the process. Our study sheds light on the mechanisms behind aggregate effects of crises on the number and type of start-ups in an economy, and can guide future research on the effect of crises on nascent entrepreneurship.

Title: Attracting New Talent to Family Firms: Who Is Attracted and Under What Conditions?
Author-Name: Hauswald, Hannes

Author-Name: Patzelt, Holger
Abstract: In making a decision to enter into a long-term employment relationship with a firm, job seekers often compare their needs and values with the perceived organizational characteristics of the firm. In the case of family firms, the communication of family influence can be a unique factor in shaping beliefs about firm attributes. Family influence is often associated with trustworthiness, security, and stability. However, family influence is also associated with inflexibility and resistance to change. Using the idea of person–organization fit, we hypothesize that although family influence attracts job seekers in general, applicants who value conservation or self-transcendence are particularly attracted, while applicants who emphasize openness to change or self-enhancement are less attracted. Furthermore, we propose that the attractive effects of family influence are more pronounced in more hostile economic environments. We find evidence for our hypotheses using a conjoint experiment and 5,600 assessments of family influence nested within 175 job seekers.

Title: Venture‐Backed Firms: How Does Venture Capital Involvement Affect Their Likelihood of Going Public or Being Acquired?
Author-Name: Ragozzino, Roberto
Author-Name: Blevins, Dane P.
Abstract: This paper investigates how venture capitalists' involvement in new ventures affects the likelihood of entrepreneurial exit, either via an acquisition or via an initial public offering. We examine the prominence of venture capitals (VCs), the number of VCs invested in a company, as well as the timing, duration, and magnitude of their investments in new ventures. We find that each of these dimensions directly explains entrepreneurial exit, although their effects tend to differ depending on whether the exit occurs via an acquisition or an initial public offering (IPO). These results withstand several robustness checks and offer a more precise account of how the relationship between new ventures and VC firms unfolds in the early years of the entrepreneurial cycle.

Abstract: We supplement the recent work by Miller and Le Breton-Miller by evaluating more closely two related theoretical aspects of the socioemotional wealth concept: (1) the stocks and flows of noneconomic benefits and how they influence family firm behavior; and (2) the use of prospect theory as an umbrella concept. We, thus, contribute to family business research by delineating a number of important research questions related to these two theoretical aspects that need to be addressed if theories of family firm behavior and performance are to move forward.

Author-Name: Chrisman, James J.
Abstract: Family firms' decisions to hire nonfamily managers are influenced by agency costs, socioemotional wealth concerns, and the availability of high-quality nonfamily managers in the labor pool. We hypothesize that owing to these factors, family ownership and intrafamily succession intentions will be negatively associated with the proportion of nonfamily managers in private small- and medium-sized (SME) family firms. However, firm size is hypothesized to positively moderate those relationships because as family firm size increases, the benefits of hiring nonfamily managers rise faster than the costs. Tobit regression analyses of 7,299 private SMEs support our hypotheses.

Abstract: This paper presents a first-ever empirical examination of the effectiveness of signals that entrepreneurs use to induce (small) investors to commit financial resources in an equity crowdfunding context. We examine the impact of venture quality (human capital, social [alliance] capital, and intellectual capital) and uncertainty on fundraising success. Our data highlight that retaining equity and providing more detailed information about risks can be interpreted as effective signals and can therefore strongly impact the probability of funding success. Social capital and intellectual capital, by contrast, have little or no impact on funding success. We discuss the implications of our results for theory, future research, and practice.

Is this the right moment for venture capital funding, or is it better to wait to improve the company's financial performance? What are the risks of growing slowly?

Abstract: Recent evidence suggests that successors do not simply inherit their parents' firm, but have to pay a certain price. Building on institutional logics literature, we explore successors' family discount expectations, defined as the rebate expected from parents in comparison to nonfamily buyers when assuming control of the firm. We find that family cohesion increases discount expectations, while successors' fear of failure and family equity stake in the firm decrease discount expectations. Higher education in business or economics weakens these effects. On average, in our study comprised of 16 countries, successors expect a 57% family discount.

Author-Name: Gohmann, Stephan F.
Abstract: Most southern states have fewer breweries per population than the rest of the country. This paper examines why. The main outcome is that in the South, the number of breweries is negatively associated with higher campaign contributions from big breweries, the number of beer distributors per capita, and the Southern Baptist adherence rate. In the non-South, these associations are insignificant or positive. The limited number of breweries in the South follows the idea of bootleggers and Baptists where those who gain economically from limited competition—large breweries and distributors—side with groups morally opposed to alcohol to keep breweries out.

Abstract: The commercialization of university-held research discoveries is increasingly seen as a promising source of revenue, and a growing number of universities are adding policies and incentives in an attempt to encourage commercialization activities. The effectiveness of these efforts is in jeopardy, however, because these changes can unintentionally create an environment ripe for misalignment between policies and incentives and university scientists' work identity. We develop a conceptual model that suggests such changes trigger moral and hedonistic cognitive dissonance, and in reaction scientists can engage in identity adaptation via distinct pathways, leading to different levels of commercialization engagement intensity.

Author-Name: Domurath, Anne
Author-Name: Patzelt, Holger
Abstract: Drawing on the literature on social ties, we develop a model toward entrepreneurs' assessments of early international entry. We argue that social ties in foreign markets trigger entrepreneurs' assessed attractiveness of exploiting potentially valuable opportunities contingent on their perceptions of the venture's absorptive capacity and their generalized trust in others. We test these hypotheses using a metric conjoint experiment, and data on 4,352 international entry assessments nested within 136 entrepreneurs. Our findings reveal significant cross-level interactions between the characteristics of entrepreneurs' social ties, venture absorptive capacity, and entrepreneurs' trust in others in explaining how they assess international entry.

Abstract: This study examines the relationship between prenatal testosterone exposure (PTE) and selection into entrepreneurship. We argue that the relationship between PTE and entrepreneurial intent is positive and mediated by general and domain-specific risk-taking related to financial investment and professional career. Using the second-to-fourth digit ratio (2D:4D) as noninvasive retrospective marker for PTE, we identify two-step mediation effects of PTE on entrepreneurial intent through both general and domain-specific risk-taking. To account for possible socialization-based effects, we control for gender and parental self-employment. Applying ordinary least squares (OLS) regression analyses and structural equation models, we provide empirical evidence for a biological association between 2D:4D and entrepreneurial intent.

Two long-standing theories, prospect theory and self-efficacy, seem to develop opposite predictions in this context. To reconcile these conflicting predictions, we theorize a moderating model and test the boundary conditions of both theories. Relying on two experimental studies, we find that prospect theory explains reentry intentions of entrepreneurs who have lost money when their self-efficacy is moderate or low. Thereby, we provide an explanation for the puzzling empirical finding that so many failed entrepreneurs reenter entrepreneurship even if failure has undermined their self-efficacy.

Title: The Relational Organization of Entrepreneurial Ecosystems
Author-Name: Spigel, Ben
Abstract: Entrepreneurial ecosystems have emerged as a popular concept to explain the persistence of high-growth entrepreneurship within regions. However, as a theoretical concept ecosystems remain underdeveloped, making it difficult to understand their structure and influence on the entrepreneurship process. The article argues that ecosystems are composed of 10 cultural, social, and material attributes that provide benefits and resources to entrepreneurs and that the relationships between these attributes reproduce the ecosystem. This model is illustrated with case studies of Waterloo, Ontario, and Calgary, Alberta, Canada. The cases demonstrate the variety of different configurations that ecosystems can take.

Title: The Effects of Founder and Family Ownership on Hired CEOs’ Incentives and Firm Performance
Author-Name: Jaskiewicz, Peter
Author-Name: Block, Joern H.
Author-Name: Combs, James G.
Author-Name: Miller, Danny
Abstract: Although large owners monitor managers effectively, they differ in important ways. Whereas founder owners focus on firm performance, family owners also pursue socioemotional goals. We leverage this distinction to theorize that family owners offer hired CEOs more incentive pay—to attract nonfamily CEOs, signal good governance, and achieve better firm performance. Without socioemotional wealth distractions, founder owners do not need high incentives and overusing them is counterproductive. Bayesian regressions using a panel of 335 S&P 500 firms support our theory. A key implication is that founder and family owners approach governance differently and these differences affect firm performance.

Abstract: The founder, Bill Walsh, with a background in law and a passion to protect the natural environment, has built a nonprofit venture that has pioneered the awareness of toxicity issues in the building industry. He finds himself at a crossroads because he needs an infusion of cash to bring to market the database on building product toxicity that he has developed. The options include whether to radically change the way he manages his nonprofit in order to grow or to change the company status to a Benefit Corporation. Bill is unsure whether he is the right person to implement either alternative.

Title: Determinants of Social Entrepreneurial Intentions
Author-Name: Hockerts, Kai
Abstract: This article tests the model proposed by Mair and Noboa (2006) who identify four antecedents which they suggest predict social entrepreneurial intentions. The study extends the model by including prior experience with social problems as an additional variable. Findings show that prior experience predicts social entrepreneurial intentions. This effect is mediated by the antecedents suggested by Mair and Noboa. Social entrepreneurial self-efficacy has both the largest impact on intentions as well as being itself most responsive to prior experience. Lastly, the study shows that the amount of optional social entrepreneurship electives students enroll in is predicted by social entrepreneurial intentions.

Title: The Transitional Nature of the Multifamily Business
Author-Name: Brigham, Keith H.
Author-Name: Payne, G. Tyge
Abstract: Family firms are heterogeneous and often transitioning. To advance our understanding of how and why family firms change, we draw upon and extend the work of Pieper, Smith, Kudlats, and Astrachan by more closely considering the nature of the multifamily business, which is the focal type of organization in their study. Specifically, we explore how initial founding conditions and ongoing organizational and environmental factors may influence the formation, sustainability, and dissolution of the multifamily business, relative to single-family firms or other organizational forms. We argue that multifamily forms may be more common than generally believed, but tend to be a transitory organizational form.

Author-Name: Carr, Jon C.
Author-Name: Hmieleski, Keith M.
Abstract: This study examined the effects of work and family conflict on work tension for founders of family versus nonfamily businesses. Drawing on a model of conflict between work and family roles, it was predicted that founders of family businesses would experience significantly greater work tension from family–work conflict than for founders of nonfamily businesses. Conversely, it was predicted that work–family conflict would exert more negative effects on founders of nonfamily businesses than for those running family businesses. Results from a national (United States) sample of business founders supported these predictions. Implications for the management of work and family conflict in family versus nonfamily businesses are discussed.

Abstract: This commentary extends the work of Zellweger and Kammerlander by describing how the relationships they hypothesize might be operationalized and tested. It more clearly defines and provides suggestions for how to measure the heterogeneity and complexity of family members and family relationships. It discusses how to operationalize the scope, scale, and complexity of assets controlled by the family, and the characteristics of agents who manage the process. In addition the commentary discusses outcome measures for the family such as family wealth, family communication, family happiness, and family functionality. It describes financial and operational measures of performance for the businesses controlled by the family. The commentary concludes by discussing outcome measures for individual family members and for the agents they employ.

Abstract: Researchers and advisors in the field of family business have focused on a sequence of topics over the 30 years since the first dedicated conferences and the emergence of Family Firm Institute, Inc. (FFI) and family business review. This essay reviews the issues that have received the most attention from family business advisors across this time period (succession, governance, and intergenerational family dynamics). Then the author proposes a particular focus for intervention in the coming decade—family human capital utilization—and discusses four areas of consultation that may be increasingly valuable to client families.

Title: The Arts and Family Business: Linking Family Business Resources and Performance to Industry Characteristics
Author-Name: Le Breton‐Miller, Isabelle
Author-Name: Miller, Danny
Abstract: There has been a good deal of debate regarding the performance of family firms. Explanations for divergent findings have ranged from variations in governance arrangements to particular organizational practices. One avenue that has not been much explored is the role played by industry. We theorize that market requirements, when coupled with firm-specific behaviors and resources, can account for why some family businesses do well in particular industries. More precisely, due to their long-term orientation and the intimate connection among family members, some family firms are especially adept at accumulating human capital, passing on tacit knowledge, protecting and leveraging reputation, and building strong relationships and slack resources. These capacities promote success in industries with high levels of uncertainty regarding product quality, product value, and demand. The arts-related industries, we shall argue, are one such environment, and we use it to demonstrate our thesis that family firms, if oriented appropriately, can thrive where relationships, tacit knowledge, and reputation are demanded.

Abstract: Family business and human resource management scholars suggest that firms whose leaders experience affective commitment are more likely to achieve their goals. Building on self-determination theory, we propose a model in which parent-founders promote affective commitment in child-successors by supporting their psychological needs for competence, autonomy, and relatedness within the family business. We conclude by exploring the ethical implications of different parenting approaches in encouraging intrafamily succession.

Author-Name: Pieper, Torsten M.

Author-Name: Kudlats, Jerry
Author-Name: Astrachan, Joseph H.
Abstract: This study focuses on a particular form of family businesses—businesses with at least two unrelated founding families—and how their organizational form of a multifamily business persists over several generations. Using an inductive approach to study five multifamily cases, we discovered that these firms did not meet complexity with complex structures and processes. Instead, four cases developed and utilized simple rules imprinted by the founders and pulled through to current generations, enabling effective mutual monitoring and persistence of the multifamily organizational form. The lack of simple rules development is associated with one multifamily business to abandon this organizational form.

Abstract: We use the articles and commentaries in this special issue to reinvigorate the theme of family business governance and extend its scope beyond the single business, single-family approach that has traditionally dominated the family business literature. Through a discussion of the implications of the articles and commentaries included in this special issue we begin to chart a new and expanded research program for governance that addresses the challenges of the large and complex multifamily and/or multibusiness family enterprise. We hope to encourage research in a direction that will add significantly to our understanding of business families’ contributions to the global economy.

Abstract: This essay offers a counterpoint to Le Breton-Miller and Miller's argument that family firms are the ideal organizational form for arts-based businesses and creative work.

Title: Family, Wealth, and Governance: An Agency Account
Author-Name: Zellweger, Thomas
Author-Name: Kammerlander, Nadine
Abstract: Family firms often evolve into ownership constellations with multiple family owners. Building on agency theory, we argue that the growing complexity within a group of family blockholders gives rise to what we label family blockholder conflicts, defined as conflicts within a group of family owners. To curb family blockholder conflicts, families often separate the family from its assets and install intermediary governance structures. We explore four frequently applied structures (uncoordinated family, embedded family office, single family office, and family trust), which vary in their degree of separation between family owners and assets and consequently the extent to which the firm might incur family blockholder costs and the double-agency costs associated with appointing agents to oversee agents. We conclude with a discussion of the distributive effects of the four family governance constellations for family wealth over time.

Author-Name: Klotz, Anthony C.
Author-Name: Neubaum, Donald O.
Abstract: While the personality of entrepreneurs can be cast in positive and negative lights, it is essential that researchers understand the complex process through which personalities shape behavior and influence outcomes. Building on Miller's observations on downsides of entrepreneurs’ personalities, we present five broad lines of inquiry derived from the organizational behavior literature to guide future research on the role of personality in entrepreneurial phenomena. These streams of research have implications for how personality is conceptualized in the entrepreneurship literature, and we urge researchers to examine interactions among different personality traits, and between traits and contextual and affective variables which play a critical role in personality–outcome relationships. Finally, we encourage scholars to consider the personality of new venture team members, and how some traits may serve important resource-conservation roles.

Author-Name: Yong, Kevyn
Abstract: We use creativity theory to analyze the effects of occupational job variety and industry variety on invention quality, and entrepreneurial earnings. We test our ideas with survey data from 770 inventor–entrepreneurs who commercialized their own inventions. Results suggest that occupational and industry variety substitute for each other in positively affecting invention quality whereas a lack of industry variety is associated with greater entrepreneurial earnings. Results are consistent with the idea that high levels of both occupational and industry variety enables the generation and discovery of inventions, but these ideas are usually not technically feasible or financially viable.

Abstract: We focus on the role of the opportunity cost in the choice for entrepreneurship in favor of wage employment, that is, the wages given up as an employee. We argue that just like outside observers, potential entrepreneurs will face great difficulty to predict their earnings from entrepreneurship. The focus on earnings forgone may help to solve the lack of robust empirical support for the effect of financial incentives on the decision to become an entrepreneur. We find, consistent with standard theory, that a higher mean, lower variance, and higher skew in the relevant wage distribution reduce the likelihood of entrepreneurship.

Title: Skill Balance and Entrepreneurship Evidence from Online Career Histories
Author-Name: Chen, Li‐Wei

Abstract: Lazear's jack-of-all-trades theory suggests that individuals with balanced skills are more likely to become entrepreneurs, and that balanced skills can be accumulated by studying a varied curriculum, working in a variety of functions, and working for a variety of employers. We reexamine the theory using a matched case-control sample, constructed from a professional networking website that controls for unobserved heterogeneity in employer and job characteristics. We find evidence that variety predicts entry into entrepreneurship, largely through its positive association with the likelihood of having certain specific skills. However, our analysis also demonstrates that attempts to identify the effects of skill variety on entrepreneurship are likely to be highly sensitive to sample construction and regression specification.

Title: Do the Self‐Employed More Likely Emerge From Sequential or Parallel Work Experience in Business‐Related Functions?
Author-Name: Hsieh, Chihmao
Abstract: Recent theory suggests generalists are more likely than specialists to become self-employed. However, little research examines whether different career paths of generalists are equally effective. I argue those experiencing business-related functions in parallel rather than sequentially more likely become self-employed—as a career proceeds over years—because “connections” detected across domains during parallel work experience are particularly valuable in discovery of future opportunities. Yet, positive effects of experiencing domains sequentially are more strongly amplified when individuals are analytically disposed. Analyzing careers of scientists and engineers, SESTAT data broadly support the hypotheses but mostly for male, incorporated, and/or nonacademic entrepreneurial self-employment.

Author-Name: Thébaud, Sarah
Abstract: This article theorizes and evaluates the relationship between inflexible organizational practices, family factors, and gendered pathways into entrepreneurship. Using novel survey data collected by the Harris Poll, I evaluate how a decision to pass up a job that lacks flexibility is associated with self-employment, and examine how this relationship varies by gender, family status, and educational attainment. Findings suggest that passing up a job is associated with women's, but not men's, self-employment. Moreover, motherhood and a spouse's employment status predict women's self-employment, but only if they have sacrificed a job opportunity.

Author-Name: Frederiksen, Lars

Author-Name: Balachandran, Chanchal
Abstract: Knowledge-based theories of entrepreneurship infer transfer of knowledge from the effect of labor mobility on entrepreneurial entry. Yet, simple selection or situational mechanisms that do not imply knowledge transfer may influence entrepreneurial entry in similar ways. We argue that the extent to which such alternative mechanisms operate, labor mobility predicts entry but not subsequent performance for entrepreneurs. Analyses of matched employee–employer data from Sweden suggest that high rates of geographical and industry mobility increase individuals’ likelihood of entrepreneurial entry but have no effects on their entrepreneurial performance. This indicates that the relationship between labor mobility and entrepreneurial entry do not necessarily imply knowledge transfer.

Abstract: We study earnings of individuals who exit entrepreneurship for paid employment. We find mean (median) positive rewards from entrepreneurship in subsequent paid employment relative to matched employees. Rewards are higher for former entrepreneurs hired in highly innovative sectors. We also find that the performance of the exited firm is a strong predictor of the earnings premium for former entrepreneurs when the firm performed well, while we do not find median discounts for entrepreneurs exiting low performing firms. We use registry data that encompass the population of firms and individuals in the Norwegian economy.

Title: Roads Leading to Self‐Employment: Comparing Transgenerational Entrepreneurs and Self‐Made Start‐Ups
Author-Name: Blumberg, Boris F.
Author-Name: Pfann, Gerard A.
Abstract: This article studies the event history of business foundation. Three theoretical concepts—human, financial, and social capital—are linked to investigate how entry into self-employment varies over time. Data from a cohort of Dutch inhabitants born in 1939/1940 who have been interviewed three times during their lives (in 1952, 1983, and 1993) allows for testing hypotheses that state clear differences between two different roads toward business ownership. Empirical results show that the baseline hazard decreases with time for transgenerational entrepreneurs with self-employed parents, but increases for self-made start-ups. Social capital is a better predictor for starting an enterprise than human capital.

Abstract: Scholars of entrepreneurship have focused mostly on founder entrepreneurs, new ventures, venture capital, and entrepreneurial initiatives in larger firms. However, family firms, which account for a majority of new ventures, have received far less prominent attention from the field. Although family businesses, often rightly, have been portrayed as being conservative and even stodgy, many of them are successful and enduring, and enjoy advantages in the business founding, growth, and maturity phases of the life cycle. We discuss the resources that may be responsible for these advantages in successful family firms, and the lessons that may be drawn from such firms for quintessential topics in entrepreneurship such as effectuation, new ventures, venture capital, opportunity platforms, and entrepreneurial orientation.

Title: Family Firm Challenges in Intergenerational Wealth Transfer
Author-Name: Carr, Jon C.
Author-Name: Chrisman, James J.
Author-Name: Chua, Jess H.
Author-Name: Steier, Lloyd P.
Abstract: Family firm owners accumulate economic and noneconomic wealth that they may wish to transfer to the next generation. Their challenges in doing so include: what, to whom, when, and how to transfer this wealth. The decisions made and actions taken will impact behavior and performance as well as the type and amount of wealth eventually transferred. The articles and commentaries in this special issue address some of these challenges, specifically the what of family firm legacy, the who of willing intra-family successors, and the how of both family and business destabilization and re-stabilization after a major strategic move as illustrated by internationalization.

Title: The Quagmire of Legacy in Family Firms: Definition and Implications of Family and Family Firm Legacy Orientations
Author-Name: Hammond, Nathan L.
Author-Name: Pearson, Allison W.
Author-Name: Holt, Daniel T.
Abstract: Family firm scholars often reference the legacy concerns or intentions of families when explaining strategic decision making in family firms. Yet, the concept of family legacy is not clearly defined or delineated in the literature. As such, we define and explore the family legacy construct from the integrated perspectives of psychosocial development and sense-making literatures. We identify three forms of family legacy: biological, material, and social. Further, we present the family and family firm legacy orientations as unique constructs, offering a theoretical model that proposes the linkages from these distinct orientations to strategic decision making and behavioral outcomes in family firms.

Title: Family Firms and the “Willing Successor” Problem
Author-Name: Parker, Simon C.
Abstract: Many family business owners want their offspring to continue the family business after they have retired. However, they may lack “willing successors.” Drawing on resource-based logic, this paper proposes parental business strategies which enhance the attractiveness of continuation by offspring. These strategies include investment in intangible capital, which is less valuable if offspring sell the firm, and high levels of parental effort. As a by-product, these strategies enhance the financial performance and longevity of those family firms which adopt them, and might help explain the global prevalence of family firms as an organizational form.

Title: An Assemblage‐Theoretic Perspective on the Internationalization Processes of Family Firms
Author-Name: Reuber, A. Rebecca
Abstract: Much scholarly attention has been paid to the internationalization of family firms. In this paper, I contend that our knowledge remains limited because of a dominant focus on decision making. I problematize this dominant focus in the literature, propose assemblage theory as a new lens through which to examine family business internationalization, and draw attention to new research questions constructed around the conceptualization of internationalization as a destabilizing influence on family firm logics and routines. In doing so, I pay particular attention to processes associated with internationalization triggers, geographic distance, cultural differences and the family firm as an unfamiliar market actor, and to temporal considerations associated with these processes.

Title: Toward the Validation of Family Legacy Orientation
Author-Name: Rutherford, Matthew W.
Author-Name: Kuratko, Donald F.
Abstract: Family legacy orientation (FLO) and Family firm legacy orientation (FFLO) are novel and compelling constructs for the field of family business. In the paper, the authors introduce these constructs and offer implications for strategic decision making in the firm. They also note that, while FLO and FFLO could have a substantial impact on the field of family business, the constructs must be measured. We concur, because while more theorizing is necessary, part of this theorizing should include the development of observable and measurable phenomena for the construct in question (Schwab, 1980). In addition, by engaging in the steps to gauge construct clarity and validity, important considerations, concerns, and value will certainly come to light.

Abstract: Although there has been abundant research on the positive personality and environmental qualities that stimulate entrepreneurship, we argue that negative personal circumstances of an economic, sociocultural, cognitive, and physical/ emotional nature may have an equally powerful role to play in getting people to become effective entrepreneurs. These challenges create conditions and experiences that motivate particular adaptive requirements which in turn foster outcomes such as work discipline, risk tolerance, social and network skills, and creativity.

Author-Name: Josefy, Matthew

Author-Name: Fitza, Markus A.
Abstract: Despite increased interest in examining the factors that influence crowdfunding success, the effects of community context have been relatively unexamined. We address this void by examining the role of cultural context in crowdfunding success. Our unique data set of crowdfunding projects to “save the local theater” are homogenous in their goal, allowing us to test whether crowdfunding campaigns in certain communities lead to better funding outcomes than others. Theoretically, our results suggest the need for further integration of community and cultural constructs into models of venture funding, as such variables may have more relevance than previously believed.

Author-Name: Courtney, Christopher
Author-Name: Dutta, Supradeep
Author-Name: Li, Yong
Abstract: This article draws on information economics to examine when signals and endorsements obtained from multiple information sources enhance or diminish one another's effects. We propose that signals through start-up actions (use of media) and characteristics (crowdfunding experience) can mitigate information asymmetry concerns about project quality and founder credibility, enhancing the project's likelihood of attaining funding. Further, we posit that while start-up–originated signals offset each other's effects, third-party endorsements (sentiment expressed in backer comments) validate and complement start-up–originated signals. Empirical analyses based on a comprehensive dataset of crowdfunding projects on the Kickstarter website during 2009–2015 confirm our predictions.

Title: Crowdfunding Innovative Ideas: How Incremental and Radical Innovativeness Influence Funding Outcomes
Author-Name: Chan, C. S. Richard
Author-Name: Parhankangas, Annaleena
Abstract: We investigate the effect of innovativeness on crowdfunding outcomes. Because crowdfunding campaigns characterized by greater incremental innovativeness are more comprehensible and generate more user value for typical crowdfunders, incremental innovativeness may result in more favorable funding outcomes. By comparison, campaigns that feature greater radical innovativeness are riskier to develop, harder for crowdfunders to understand and result in less favorable funding outcomes. This negative effect of radical innovativeness may be mitigated by incremental innovativeness, which may help crowdfunders to understand and appreciate radical innovativeness more. A sample of 334 Kickstarter campaigns provides support for our hypotheses.

Abstract: The explosion of crowdfunding within entrepreneurial circles is attracting increased academic interest in the nature of crowdfunding, its antecedents, and its consequences. In an effort to help researchers concentrate their inquiry on the most promising questions and theories involving crowdfunding, we surveyed key thought leaders within the entrepreneurship field—the Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice editorial review board—regarding what inquiry they believe is needed. Their responses offer implications for crowdfunding research. For example, cross-disciplinary work is one approach that board members believe holds high potential. In response, we outline a cross-disciplinary research agenda that can inform scholarly efforts.

Abstract: Crowdfunding is a rapidly growing phenomenon wherein entrepreneurs seek funding for their entrepreneurial activities from a potentially large audience of interested individuals. Crowdfunding has exploded in popularity over the last decade and now accounts for tens of billions of dollars annually. But despite the importance and growth of crowdfunding, little scholarly knowledge exists about the topic. To address this gap, this special issue includes five articles that each advance knowledge about crowdfunding in important ways. We briefly review past work on crowdfunding in leading entrepreneurship and management journals. We then highlight the diverse contributions offered in the special issue articles.

Title: Serial Crowdfunding, Social Capital, and Project Success
Author-Name: Butticè, Vincenzo
Author-Name: Colombo, Massimo G.
Author-Name: Wright, Mike
Abstract: In this paper, we focus attention on serial crowdfunders, that is, entrepreneurs who repeatedly turn to crowdfunding to finance their projects. We argue that serial crowdfunders take advantage of the social contacts with those that backed their previous campaigns. This internal social capital developed within the platform, which is not available to “normal” serial entrepreneurs, makes serial crowdfunders' campaigns more successful than those launched by novice crowdfunders. However, this type of social capital is a substitute for the internal social capital built by backing other campaigns, and has a limited lifespan. Econometric results on a sample of 31,389 Kickstarter campaigns confirm our contentions. Implications for research, practice, and policy are discussed.

Abstract: Interactions between project creators and backers on the crowdfunding platform represent the linchpin of every campaign. However, the resulting internal social capital has received little academic attention. To address this topic, we frame how internal social capital can develop through project track record and how internal social capital can spill over to external online communities. Focusing on the long-term implications of these manifestations of social capital, we empirically assess whether they can increase funding success beyond a single campaign. We test our hypotheses with two data sets derived from platform and survey sources and find support for the proposed relationships.

Title: Feuding Families: When Conflict Does a Family Firm Good
Author-Name: Kellermanns, Franz W.
Author-Name: Eddleston, Kimberly A.
Abstract: Using the conflict theory lens and insights from the family business literature, we develop a theoretical model concerning the effects of task, process, and relationship conflict in family firms. Family firms are characterized by different control structures and generational involvement. Accordingly, we discuss the expected effect control concentration has on task, process, and relationship conflict, and propose that generational involvement affects the importance of task and process conflict to a family firm's performance. Furthermore, our model suggests that relationship conflict moderates the outcomes of task and process conflict. The degree of relationship conflict in family firms is in turn influenced by altruism, which characterizes interactions among family members.

Abstract: Although small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) account for a significant portion of international trade, little is know about how they make international entry mode decisions. Transaction cost theory has been widely used to study entry mode selection for large firms. Here we apply the theory to SME mode choices. Further, we set out to determine if SME transaction cost mode choices provide superior performance to other mode choices. We found that transaction cost theory did a good job of explaining SME mode choice and that SMEs that used transaction cost–predicted mode choices performed significantly better than firms using other modes.

Abstract: Many organizations, ranging from small entrepreneurial start-ups to large, multi-business and multi-national enterprises, exhibit a family dimension. Although there is much evidence that this familial dimension is pervasive in organizing economic activities, it remains understudied. The articles in this special issue further our understanding of family businesses and how they might be usefully managed and organized at operational and policy levels. They examine important topics—management succession, agency costs in family versus non-family firms, the effects of culture, and family elites in rent-seeking societies—and improve our understanding of the role of family in entrepreneurial wealth creation at both firm and societal levels. Importantly, these papers further our understanding of the contingencies and contexts wherein family based approaches to organizing enterprise might yield advantages or disadvantages.

Abstract: Given that less than 10% of family owned businesses (FOBs) survive into the third generation, the issue of top executive succession has received a good deal of attention. Unfortunately, the literature on the topic is fragmented, as it deals with different parts of the elephant. This synthetic effort tries to put together the pieces to (1) derive a more encompassing model of what it takes for a succession to succeed, (2) determine the trends, consensus findings, as well as the gaps in our conceptual and empirical knowledge, and (3) suggest areas for further research.

Abstract: Family involvement in a business has the potential to both increase and decrease financial performance due to agency costs. In this article we discuss the different nature of agency costs in family firms and specify the combination of conditions necessary to determine the relative levels of agency costs in family and non-family firms through the impacts of agency cost control mechanisms on performance. We also present exploratory results based on a study of 1,141 small privately held U.S. family and non-family firms that suggest the overall agency problem in family firms could be less serious than that in non-family firms.

Author-Name: Zahra, Shaker A.

Author-Name: Salvato, Carlo
Abstract: Organizational culture is an important strategic resource that family firms can use to gain a competitive advantage. Drawing upon the resource-based view (RBV) of the firm, this study examines the association between four dimensions of organizational culture in family vs. non-family businesses and entrepreneurship. Using data from 536 U.S. manufacturing companies, the results show a nonlinear association between the cultural dimension of individualism and entrepreneurship. Further, there are positive linear relationships between entrepreneurship and an external orientation, an organizational cultural orientation toward decentralization, and a long- versus short-term orientation. With the exception of an external orientation, each of these dimensions is significantly more influential upon entrepreneurship in family firms when compared with non-family firms.

Title: Family Control and the Rent‐Seeking Society
Author-Name: Morck, Randall
Author-Name: Yeung, Bernard
Abstract: A high level of trust within a small elite, like a low level of trust in society at large, may be a serious impediment to economic development. This is because such concentrated high trust among the elite promotes political rent seeking, known to retard growth. We propose that entrusting the governance of a country's great corporations to a few wealthy families promotes this undesirable distribution of trust. Preliminary empirical evidence and arguments grounded in game theory support this view.

Title: Does Entrepreneurship Capital Matter?
Author-Name: Audretsch, David B.
Author-Name: Keilbach, Max
Abstract: Economics has identified three types of capital as the drivers of economic growth—physical capital, human capital, and knowledge capital. This article introduces the concept of entrepreneurship capital and suggests that it is also an important factor shaping the economic performance of an economy. We define entrepreneurship capital as those factors influencing and shaping an economy's milieu of agents in such a way as to be conducive to the creation of new firms. The hypothesis that entrepreneurship capital is positively linked to economic growth is then tested by examining the relationship between several different measures of entrepreneurship capital and regional economic performance, measured as per-capita income for Germany. The empirical evidence suggests that there is indeed a positive link between entrepreneurship capital and regional economic performance. These results suggest a new direction for public policy that focuses on instruments to enhance entrepreneurship capital.

It considers the extent to which regional differences can be accounted for by (i) variations in industrial structure, with some regions having a greater or lesser share of sectors where the formation rate tends to be high; and (ii) variations across regions in the formation rate in the same sector. The article shows wide variations across regions and over time in the relative importance of these two factors. The article explores some policy implications of this decomposition.

Title: The Role of Dissatisfaction and per Capita Income in Explaining Self‐Employment across 15 European Countries
Author-Name: Noorderhaven, Niels
Author-Name: Thurik, Roy
Author-Name: Wennekers, Sander
Author-Name: Stel, André van
Abstract: This article deals with explaining the sizable differences in the rate of self-employment (business ownership) across 15 European countries in the period 1978–2000, within a framework of occupational choice, focusing on the influence of dissatisfaction and of per capita income. Using two different measures of dissatisfaction, in addition to the level of economic development and controlling for several other variables, we find that, in addition to a negative and significant impact of per capita income, dissatisfaction at the level of societies has a positive and significant influence on self-employment levels. Both dissatisfaction with life and dissatisfaction with the way democracy works are found to influence self-employment. It is concluded that these are proxies for job dissatisfaction and at the same time represent other negative “displacements” known to promote self-employment. The findings indirectly point at the potential importance of push factors within the incentive structures of modern economies.

Title: Effects of Childcare Activities on the Duration of Self‐Employment in Europe
Author-Name: Williams, Donald R.
Abstract: This article examines the determinants of success in self-employment, with a focus on the effects of the time spent caring for children. Many public policies are designed to encourage self-employment, especially among women. In addition, it has been argued that one of the reasons individuals, and women in particular, choose self-employment over wage and salary sector employment is to spend more time with their children. The effect of time spent with children on the probability of continuing in self-employment has not been studied in previous work, however. This study analyzes spells of self-employment among workers in eight European nations. Using data from the European Community Household Panel survey for 1994–1999, we estimate the effect of time spent caring for children on the duration of self-employment, controlling for other factors that affect self-employment success rates. The estimates indicate that caring for children significantly reduces the duration of self-employment ventures, for both males and females, and in most countries studied. The results suggest that policy makers need to consider child care policies in conjunction with self-employment policies.

Title: Making It Happen: Beyond Theories of the Firm to Theories of Firm Design
Author-Name: Sarasvathy, Saras D.
Abstract: Current theories of the firm provide no explanation for entrepreneurial success except in terms of firm success. Even when the focus is on the entrepreneur, s/he is entirely cast as a bundle of traits/behaviors or heuristics/biases that serves to explain firm performance. In this article, I suggest putting the entrepreneur center stage, adopting an instrumental view of the firm. Drawing upon the work of Simon in symbolic cognition and Lakoff in semantic cognition, I explore how we can go beyond explanations based on economic forces and evolutionary adaptation to entrepreneurial effectuation; I end with specific research questions pertaining to firm design.

Title: The Role of Mental Simulations and Counterfactual Thinking in the Opportunity Identification Process
Author-Name: Gaglio, Connie Marie
Abstract: The process of identifying, shaping, and pursuing market opportunities is emerging as a focal point in the field of entrepreneurship. Scholarly efforts to date have considered what happens during this process; it is time to turn attention to how and why. This article examines one such “how” question: how do entrepreneurs think and reason such that they identify innovative opportunities? Specifically, the cognitive processes of mental simulation and counterfactual thinking are proposed as mechanisms by which entrepreneurs identify and develop innovative opportunities. Propositions regarding the application of these cognitive processes to opportunity identification are presented and discussed.

Title: Expanding Entrepreneurial Cognition's Toolbox: Potential Contributions from the Field of Cognitive Science
Author-Name: Baron, Robert A.
Author-Name: Ward, Thomas B.
Abstract: Several measures and methods developed by the field of cognitive science may prove useful to researchers investigating various aspects of entrepreneurial cognition. These techniques include ones that have not, as yet, been applied to entrepreneurial cognition, such as reaction time, priming, measures of working memory, and measures of creative cognition. Because the questions addressed by any field are shaped, to an important degree, by the tools at its disposal, incorporating these measures into the study of entrepreneurial cognition may help to broaden the scope of this ongoing work. Specifically, these techniques may provide researchers with tools useful in exploring issues that have not previously been investigated in detail (e.g., the nature of entrepreneurs’ knowledge structures; their characteristic modes of thought). This, in turn, may enhance our understanding of the cognitive factors that influence key aspects of the entrepreneurial process.

Title: Choosing Qualitative Methods for Entrepreneurial Cognition Research: A Canonical Development Approach
Author-Name: Hindle, Kevin
Abstract: This article presents a structured, manageable approach to the complex problem of how to choose, from the vast arsenal loosely labeled “qualitative methods,” sets of techniques appropriate to advancement of the emerging field of entrepreneurial cognition. Summary consideration is given to four key issues of philosophical context as a necessary predicate to presentation of a “canonical development” approach, stylized in diagrammatic form. The approach is able to accommodate due regard for both methodological controversy and operational complexity without being overwhelmed by either. Three illustrative examples indicate how use of the approach can stimulate a researcher to create productive matches between questions evolved from the entrepreneurial cognition canon and techniques selected from the complex array of qualitative methods.

Title: Signaling in Venture Capitalist—New Venture Team Funding Decisions: Does It Indicate Long‐Term Venture Outcomes?
Author-Name: Busenitz, Lowell W.
Author-Name: Fiet, James O.
Author-Name: Moesel, Douglas D.
Abstract: According to signaling theory, new venture teams (NVTs) can communicate to venture capitalists and other potential investors both a “value” signal and a “commitment” signal, based on the level of personal investment in a venture. Venture capitalists (VCs) typically want to know if a NVT is really committed to a venture and if its members truly believe that a venture has wealth creating potential. Team members can convey signals via their investment behavior. We test our hypotheses based on a sample of 183 VC-backed ventures that we tracked over a ten-year time period. These data indicate that the signals sent to VCs in the early stages of the funding process do not appear to have any significant relationship with long-term venture outcomes. We explore possible explanations for these findings, as well as their implications for signaling theory and future research.

Title: Four Bases of Family Business Successor Commitment: Antecedents and Consequences

Author-Name: Irving, P. Gregory
Abstract: Although successor commitment toward family business has been identified as a key desirable attribute, commitment has been treated as a unidimensional construct in family business research. Drawing on the organizational commitment literature, we propose four bases of successor commitment to family firm—affective (based on perceived desire), normative (based on perceived sense of obligation), calculative (based on perceived opportunity costs involved), and imperative (based on perceived need). A model of antecedents and expected behavioral outcomes of each of these bases of commitment is developed. Related propositions are presented, as are the contributions to the literature, research and practical implications.

Abstract: In this article, we study the constructs of perceived environmental munificence and carrying capacity as they relate to potential for starting a business in samples taken from thirteen Anglo-Saxon, East Asian, and South Asian countries. Seven politico-economic dimensions represent perceived munificence and carrying capacity: financing available, supportive government regulation, market opportunities, access to support services, supply of skilled labor, connections needed, and competitive conditions. Perceived market opportunities, supply of skilled labor, and supportive government regulation (negatively) relate most consistently to start-up feasibility and desirability in the full sample. In regional subsamples, the only dimensions to associate with both feasibility and desirability are market opportunities in Anglo-Saxon countries and supply of skilled labor in South Asia.

Author-Name: Reuber, A. Rebecca

Abstract: This article explores how young firms, across different competitive contexts, signal reputation through their customers. Four distinct competitive contexts were differentiated based on whether the complexity of the customer's purchase process was high or low and whether the product/service was customized or standardized. CEOs of young firms operating in each of the four contexts were interviewed to discern patterns, both within and across contexts, in the reputational signals conferred by customers. Analysis of the interview data yields suggestions for how current theory on the exchange partners of young firms can be refined and extended, as well as propositions related to customer-derived reputation in different competitive contexts.

Abstract: There are millions of homemakers in the United States, but there is scant research on the entrepreneurial activities of this important segment of the population. Using data collected through the Panel Study of Entrepreneurial Dynamics (PSED), this article explores and discusses the significant differences between full-time homemakers who intend to start businesses and a comparison group of non-homemakers who intend to start businesses. In addition to providing a revealing look at this subset of future entrepreneurs, this study illustrates the power of the PSED to allow exploration of unique entrepreneur groups. Following our data analyses, we discuss implications and future research directions to better understand this unique subset of entrepreneurial individuals who are pursuing new ventures.

Abstract: This article simultaneously explores the constructs of potential financial reward and prior knowledge of customer problems to provide a deeper understanding of the identification of opportunities. Results suggest that while prior knowledge of customer problems leads to the identification of more opportunities and opportunities that are more innovative, it also moderates the relationship between potential financial reward and opportunity identification. We found that the less knowledgeable an individual was about customer problems, the more positive the effect that potential financial reward had on the number of opportunities identified and the innovativeness of those opportunities.

Title: Evolutionary Processes and Paths of Relationally Embedded Network Ties in Emerging Entrepreneurial Firms
Author-Name: Hite, Julie M.
Abstract: Relationally embedded network ties influence the economic decisions of emerging firms and evolve over time. Evolutionary processes and paths of these ties are examined based on two research questions: How do components of social relationships facilitate the evolution of relational embeddedness? What are the different paths to relational embeddedness? Findings from qualitative case study methods suggest three evolutionary processes (network entry, social component leverage and trust facilitation), four evolutionary paths, and the conclusion that ties entering the network through personal relationship may evolve more quickly toward full embeddedness. Strategic implications for emerging firms are suggested regarding entrepreneurial opportunity recognition, resource acquisition and effective governance of relationally embedded ties.

Title: News and Nuances of the Entrepreneurial Myth and Metaphor: Linguistic Games in Entrepreneurial Sense‐Making and Sense‐Giving
Author-Name: Nicholson, Louise
Author-Name: Anderson, Alistair R.
Abstract: This article describes a social construction of entrepreneurship by exploring the constructionalist building blocks of communication, myth, and metaphor presented in a major British middle range broadsheet newspaper with no particular party political allegiance. We argue that the sense-making role of figurative language is important because of the inherent problems in defining and describing the entrepreneurial phenomena. Myth and metaphor in newspapers create an entrepreneurial appreciation that helps define our understanding of the world around us. The content analysis of articles published in this newspaper revealed images of male entrepreneurs as dynamic wolfish charmers, supernatural gurus, successful skyrockets or community saviors and corrupters. Finally, this article relates the temporal construction of myth and metaphor to the dynamics of enterprise culture.

Title: Government Discourses on Entrepreneurship: Issues of Legitimization, Subjugation, and Power
Author-Name: Perren, Lew
Author-Name: Jennings, Peter L.
Abstract: The belief in market-driven ideology and the assumption that new business ventures create jobs and foster innovation has embedded entrepreneurship into political discourse. Academics have analyzed government policies on entrepreneurship, but they have tended to share the same underlying beliefs in the function of entrepreneurs within the economic machine. This article explores selected dimensions of the impact of those beliefs by using critical discourse analysis to show how government websites around the world portray entrepreneurs and their role in society. Discourses of government power and self-legitimization are revealed that manifest themselves in a colonizing discourse of entrepreneurial subjugation. The article concludes by challenging government rhetoric on entrepreneurship and questioning the motives underpinning the agenda of government involvement in supporting entrepreneurs.

Title: The Social Construction of Entrepreneurship: Narrative and Dramatic Processes in the Coproduction of Organizations and Identities
Author-Name: Downing, Stephen
Abstract: A social dimension to business development and inertia is currently acknowledged in several accounts of learning, business models, vision building, and innovation, and through more general concepts of networking, social capital, and embeddedness. Here a constructionist perspective is developed to improve our understanding of the interactions between entrepreneurs and stakeholders in all of these areas. This identifies narrative and dramatic processes that describe how notions of individual and collective identity and organization are coproduced over time. A framework is created to show how selective and emotional processes that produce storylines, emplotment, and narrative structure support sense making and action making.

Title: Schumpeter's Legacy? Interaction and Emotions in the Sociology of Entrepreneurship
Author-Name: Goss, David
Abstract: Joseph Schumpeter's work has long been regarded as a seminal contribution to entrepreneurship theory. However, relatively little attention has been given to exploring the sociological implications of his insights. This article examines Schumpeter's early writings on the entrepreneur and focuses on the apparent contradiction between his understanding of the inhibitory effect of social control and the entrepreneur's strength of will. This tension is resolved by recourse to contemporary social theory of interaction and emotion. A synthesis of these works produces two hypothetical modes of entrepreneurial action. These are elaborated and their implications for the understanding of entrepreneurship discussed.

Title: Corporate Governance and Competitive Advantage in Family‐Controlled Firms
Author-Name: Carney, Michael
Abstract: Recent attempts to identify the basis of family-controlled firms’ competitive advantage have drawn upon the resource-based view of the firm. This article supplements these efforts and advances the argument that family-controlled firms’ competitive advantage arises from their system of corporate governance. Systems of corporate governance embody incentives, authority patterns, and norms of legitimation that generate particular organizational propensities to create competitive advantages and disadvantages. For comparative purposes, the characteristics of managerial, alliance, and family governance are reviewed. The impact of a family's control rights over a firm's assets generates three dominant propensities (parsimony, personalism, and particularism). These propensities give advantages in scarce environments, facilitate the creation and utilization of social capital, and engender opportunistic investment processes. The experience of family-controlled firms in emerging markets is drawn upon to illustrate the argument.

Abstract: While some researchers propose that the combination of family and business creates a need for trade-offs in family and business demands, we argue that the social system of the family creates a synergy in the top management team (TMT) that is not present in TMTs with less “familiness.” We argue that the unique dynamics created by the social aspects of the family-owned firm will result in higher cohesion, potency, task conflict, and shared strategic consensus than those TMTs with less “familiness.” Discriminant analysis of three groups of TMTs (parental, familial, and nonfamily) was conducted on a sample of 224 TMTs of new ventures to explore our propositions.

Abstract: Timely acquisition and divestment of resources is essential for sustaining the competitive advantage and longevity of family firms. A combination of past successes, emotional attachments, and path dependencies can lead to extensive inertia toward divestment in these firms. This article develops a framework to understand the influence of community culture and family structure on divestment decisions in family firms. Propositions on the varying levels of inertia to divest—depending on the values held by the owning family and the culture prevailing in their community—are developed. Research and practical implications are discussed.

Abstract: For a solution to the family business definition dilemma, we propose the application of a scale that assesses the extent and the quality of family influence via the measurement of three dimensions: Power, Experience, and Culture. The Family Influence on Power, Experience, and Culture (F-PEC) scale is tested rigorously, utilizing a sample of more than 1,000 randomly selected companies, through the application of exploratory and confirmatory factor analytic techniques. The scale demonstrates high levels of reliability. F-PEC has been applied in a number of studies, contributing to theory development, particularly in terms of the impact of family influence on distinct resources, and as a source of competitive advantage.

Abstract: In this commentary, we provide suggestions for further establishing the validity of the multidimensional degree of family influence construct and the reliability of the family influence on power, experience, and culture (F-PEC) measurement instrument. We also delineate a number of creative ways in which future researchers can incorporate this rigorous, relevant, and rich construct into their own research agendas.

Title: Entrepreneurial Learning: Researching the Interface Between Learning and the Entrepreneurial Context
Author-Name: Harrison, Richard T.
Author-Name: Leitch, Claire M.
Abstract: The context for the research presented in this article arises from increasing interest, by academics and practitioners, in the importance of learning and knowledge in the knowledge-based economy. In particular, we consider the scope for applying concepts of learning within the field of entrepreneurship. While it has gained currency within the field of management, the application of these concepts to entrepreneurship has been limited. In this Introduction to the Special Issue, we review the development of the field of entrepreneurship as a context for the emergence of learning as an area of scholarly attention, summarize a number of key themes emerging from the organizational learning literature, and outline the article selection process and summarize the key elements of each of the included articles. The article concludes with some reflections on future research at the interface between learning and the entrepreneurial context.

Title: Toward a Dynamic Learning Perspective of Entrepreneurship
Author-Name: Cope, Jason
Abstract: This conceptual article introduces a dynamic learning perspective of entrepreneurship that builds upon existing “dominant” theoretical approaches to understanding entrepreneurial activity. As many aspects of entrepreneurial learning remain poorly understood, this article maps out and extends current boundaries of thinking regarding how entrepreneurs learn. It presents key conclusions from emergent empirical and conceptual work on the subject and synthesizes a broad range of contributory adult, management, and individual learning literature to develop a robust and integrated thematic conceptualization of entrepreneurial learning. Three distinctive, interrelated elements of entrepreneurial learning are proposed—dynamic temporal phases, interrelated processes, and overarching characteristics. The article concludes by demonstrating how a “learning lens” can be applied to create further avenues for research in entrepreneurship from a learning perspective.

Title: The Process of Entrepreneurial Learning: A Conceptual Framework
Author-Name: Politis, Diamanto
Abstract: The present article seeks to advance the theoretical knowledge of entrepreneurial learning by reviewing and synthesizing available research into a conceptual framework that explains the process of entrepreneurial learning as an experiential process. The framework identifies three main components in the process of entrepreneurial learning: entrepreneurs’ career experience, the transformation process, and entrepreneurial knowledge in terms of effectiveness in recognizing and acting on entrepreneurial opportunities and coping with the liabilities of newness. Based on the arguments in the article, five major propositions were developed to refine our understanding of entrepreneurial learning. Finally, theoretical and practical implications were discussed.

Title: The Nature of Entrepreneurial Opportunities: Understanding the Process Using the 4I Organizational Learning Framework
Author-Name: Dutta, Dev K.
Author-Name: Crossan, Mary M.
Abstract: In this article, we drew upon insights from two rather disparate streams of literature—entrepreneurship and organizational learning—to develop an informed understanding of the phenomenon of entrepreneurial opportunities. We examined the nature of entrepreneurial opportunities from two contrasting views—Schumpeterian and Kirznerian—and delved into their ontological roots. By applying the 4I organizational learning framework to entrepreneurial opportunities, we were able to not only resolve the apparently conflicting explanations of opportunities arising out of the contrasting ontological positions but also to achieve a level of pragmatic synthesis between them. In highlighting the article's contributions to theory and practice, we suggest that just as research on entrepreneurial opportunities benefits from applying organizational learning theory, so is organizational learning informed by research arising within the field of entrepreneurship studies.

Title: The Role of Organizational Learning in the Opportunity‐Recognition Process
Author-Name: Lumpkin, G.T.
Author-Name: Lichtenstein, Benyamin Bergmann
Abstract: Firms engage in entrepreneurship to increase performance through both strategic renewal and the creation of new venture opportunities. Organizational learning (OL) has become an effective avenue for strategic renewal. But what of creating venture opportunities—can OL enhance the process of recognizing and pursuing new ventures? This article argues that OL can strengthen a firm's ability to recognize opportunities and help equip them to effectively pursue new ventures. First, we identify three approaches to OL—behavioral, cognitive, and action. Then, we introduce a creativity-based model of opportunity recognition (OpR) that includes two phases—discovery and formation. Next, we show how each of the three types of learning is linked to the two phases of OpR. We suggest propositions that support our claim that OL enhances OpR and offer examples of firms that have used these organizational-learning approaches to more effectively recognize and pursue venture opportunities. These insights have important implications for entrepreneurial firms seeking to advance the venture-creation process.

Title: Experiential Learning Within the Process of Opportunity Identification and Exploitation
Author-Name: Corbett, Andrew C.
Abstract: The article uses experiential learning theory to magnify the importance of learning within the process of entrepreneurship. Previous research details the contributions of prior knowledge, creativity, and cognitive mechanisms to the process of opportunity identification and exploitation; however, the literature is devoid of work that directly addresses learning. The extant research assumes learning is occurring but does not directly address the importance of learning to the process. To fully understand the nature of the entrepreneurial process, researchers must take into account how individuals learn and how different modes of learning influence opportunity identification and exploitation. This article makes connections between knowledge, cognition, and creativity to develop the concept of learning asymmetries and illustrates how a greater appreciation for the differences in individual learning will fortify entrepreneurship research.

Abstract: This study examines the antecedents of explorative and exploitative learning of technological knowledge from external corporate ventures. We compare different forms of external corporate venturing, namely corporate venture capital investments, alliances, joint ventures, and acquisitions, as alternative avenues for interorganizational learning. Furthermore, we test the effects of multiple relational characteristics on the type of learning outcomes. Our empirical analysis is based on citations in patents filed by a sample of 110 largest U.S. public information and communications technology companies during the years 1992–2000. We find that corporate venturing mode and technological relatedness have significant effects on the likelihood of explorative learning.

Author-Name: Sapienza, Harry J.
Abstract: In this study, we examine when venture capital firms (VCFs) learn from their portfolio companies (PFCs). Relying primarily on learning and behavioral theories, we develop hypotheses regarding the effects of prior experience, knowledge overlap, trust, and PFC performance on learning by VCFs. We use a combination of primary and secondary data from 298 U.S.-based VCFs to test the hypotheses. Interview data are used to illuminate the results and to guide our discussion of implications.

Abstract: This article provides a reformulated definition of international entrepreneurship. Consistent with the new definition, a model is presented of how the speed of entrepreneurial internationalization is influenced by various forces. The model begins with an entrepreneurial opportunity and depicts the enabling forces of technology, the motivating forces of competition, the mediating perceptions of entrepreneurs, and the moderating forces of knowledge and networks that collectively determine the speed of internationalization.

Title: The Emergence of Entrepreneurship Education: Development, Trends, and Challenges
Author-Name: Kuratko, Donald F.
Abstract: Entrepreneurship has emerged over the last two decades as arguably the most potent economic force the world has ever experienced. With that expansion has come a similar increase in the field of entrepreneurship education. The recent growth and development in the curricula and programs devoted to entrepreneurship and new-venture creation have been remarkable. The number of colleges and universities that offer courses related to entrepreneurship has grown from a handful in the 1970s to over 1,600 in 2005. In the midst of this huge expansion remains the challenge of complete academic legitimacy for entrepreneurship. While it can be argued that some legitimacy has been attained in the current state of entrepreneurship education, there are critical challenges that lie ahead. This article focuses on the trends and challenges in entrepreneurship education for the 21st century.

Title: The Effects of Strategic Decision Making on Entrepreneurial Self‐Efficacy
Author-Name: Forbes, Daniel P.
Abstract: This study builds on the construct of entrepreneurial self-efficacy (ESE), which measures the degree to which individuals believe they are capable of performing the tasks associated with new-venture management. I examined whether entrepreneurs’ levels of ESE are influenced by the ways in which their ventures make strategic decisions. Results show that entrepreneurs exhibit a stronger belief in their own abilities when their ventures make decisions in ways that involve other employees, that are more comprehensive, and that incorporate more current information. Exploratory analyses also provide preliminary evidence that ESE enhances firm performance.

Title: Determinants of Board Participation in the Strategic Decisions of Small Corporations
Author-Name: Fiegener, Mark K.
Abstract: Agency, strategic choice, and cognitive perspectives are used to examine the conditions under which chief executive officers (CEOs) of small private corporations involve the board of directors in strategic decisions. Logistic regression results (2,382 respondents to a cross-industry mail survey) indicate that board strategic participation is not the dominant practice in these firms but that boards are more likely to participate in strategic decisions when the firm is larger, the board has a critical mass of outside directors, the strategic issue under consideration involves an organizational transition or potential downturn, or CEO power (ownership) is low.

Title: Untangling the Intuition Mess: Intuition as a Construct in Entrepreneurship Research

Abstract: Entrepreneurs often use intuition to explain their actions. But because entrepreneurial intuition is poorly defined in the research literature: the “intuitive” is confused with the “innate,” what is systematic is overlooked, and unexplained variance in entrepreneurial behavior remains high. Herein we: (1) bound and define the construct of entrepreneurial intuition within the distinctive domain of entrepreneurship research; (2) apply a levels-of-consciousness logic and process dynamism approach to; (3) organize definitions, antecedents, and consequences; and (4) produce propositions that lead to a working definition of entrepreneurial intuition. Our analysis renders intuition more usable in entrepreneurship research, and more valuable in practice.

Author-Name: Utsch, Andreas
Abstract: The purpose of this study was to explore how three different human resource variables affect employment growth of small-scale enterprises: human capital of business owners, human capital of employees, and human resource development and utilization. The literature suggests different models of how these human resource variables affect business outcomes. Longitudinal data from 119 German business owners provided support for a main effect model indicating that owners’ human capital as well as employee human resource development and utilization affect employment growth. Moreover, human resources development and utilization was most effective when the human capital of employees was high. We conclude that human resources are important factors predicting growth of small-scale enterprises.

Title: All Credit to Men? Entrepreneurship, Finance, and Gender
Author-Name: Marlow, Susan

Abstract: Availability of, and access to finance is a critical element to the start-up and consequent performance of any enterprise. Hence, any barriers or impediments to accessing appropriate levels or sources of funding will have an enduring and negative impact upon the performance of affected firms. Although findings have been somewhat inconsistent, there is support for the notion that women entrepreneurs entering self-employment are disadvantaged by their gender. This argument is evaluated through a theoretical analysis of gender using the example of accessing both formal and informal sources of business funding to illustrate how this concept impacts upon women in self-employment.

Abstract: The venture capital (VC) industry started in the United States and then spread worldwide. As it spread into other countries, there was a conscious attempt to copy industry practice from the U.S. However, venture capitalists in other countries are subject to different institutional forces that can impact their behavior. This article uses an institutional perspective to develop testable propositions on the impact of various institutions on venture capitalists’ behavior. The article concludes with a discussion of the implications of an institutional theory perspective for VC research and public policy.

Title: Shifting Imperatives: An Integrative View of Resource Scarcity and Agency Reasons for Franchising
Author-Name: Castrogiovanni, Gary J.
Author-Name: Combs, James G.
Author-Name: Justis, Robert T.
Abstract: Alternative explanations of franchising offer contrasting predictions as to how the proportion of franchised outlets changes as franchisors age. We propose that two dominant views—resource-scarcity and agency theory—can be integrated by delineating when each is most relevant. Data from 102 franchisors over a 21-year period suggest that resource-scarcity considerations take precedence when franchisors are young, but that agency considerations prevail as franchisors age. Thus, the proportion franchised exhibits a cubic pattern as franchisors age—increasing rapidly at first, decreasing, and then increasing again. Future researchers and practitioners alike can benefit from understanding how the relative influences of resource and agency considerations shift over time.

Abstract: Entrepreneurship—the recognition and exploitation of opportunities—is valuable within organizations as well as in the establishment of new ventures. Some studies have addressed the issue why some individuals take advantage of opportunities and some do not. While some studies find that psychological variables, personality traits and demographic factors may distinguish entrepreneurial activity, these findings are equivocal. Other research has looked to the importance of social capital and network ties to new venture creation. Yet, there is little discussion regarding the possibility that social capital and personal factors interact and influence entrepreneurial behavior.

Abstract: This research examined the effects of three strategic process variables—strategic decision-making participativeness, strategy formation mode, and strategic learning from failure—on the entrepreneurial orientation (EO)–firm sales growth rate relationship. Results based on a sample of 110 manufacturing firms indicated a positive effect of EO on sales growth rate. Moreover, the relationship between EO and sales growth rate was more positive among firms that employ autocratic decision making and that exhibit an emergent strategy formation process. Perceptions of proficiency at learning from strategic mistakes differentially affected the growth rates of firms at different ends of the EO continuum, but in manners inconsistent with the hypothesized relationship.

Abstract: This case focuses on the decisions confronting Sally Bennett, the new Director of Market Risk Management (MRM), a unique department created within the Marketing Division of a large, diversified energy conglomerate. MRM played a crucial role in supporting the trading and marketing operations in a complex, competitive environment. Bennett was facing important challenges as the demand for MRM's service exploded. She wondered if a more formalized approach to risk assessment might be better and if so, who should design the new system. The proper organizational arrangement for MRM was also unclear. Overlaid upon these issues were larger questions of when and how the department should transition from an entrepreneurially oriented to professionally managed department.

This case highlights the difficulties and trade-offs involved in making the transition from one stage of organizational development to another. A complicating factor in this case is the matter of scaling up a new venture involving a novel computer application that promises a significant competitive advantage, but may create large organizational upheaval.

Abstract: Financial theory, access to deal flow, selection, and monitoring skills are used to explain syndication in venture capital firms in six European countries. In contrast with U.S. findings, portfolio management motives are more important for syndication than individual deal management motives. Risk sharing, portfolio diversification, and access to larger deals are more important than selection and monitoring of deals. This holds for later stage and for early stage investors. Value adding is a stronger motive for syndication for early stage investors than for later stage investors, however. Nonlead investors join syndicates for the selection and value-adding skills of the syndicate partners.

Title: Adverse Selection and Capital Structure: Evidence from Venture Capital
Author-Name: Cumming, Douglas
Abstract: Venture capitalists (VCs) in all non-U.S. countries around the world have consistently reported the use of a variety of securities, including common equity, preferred equity, convertible preferred equity, debt, convertible debt, and combinations (in the U.S., VCs typically use convertible preferred equity, and there is a tax bias in favor of that instrument in the U.S.). The types of entrepreneurial firms that receive venture finance may be defined by a variety of characteristics, such as stage of development, type of industry, and capital requirements. Given this broad context observed in practice, previous research has not considered the extent to which different securities, among the complete class of forms of finance, attract different types of entrepreneurial firms. In this article, we investigate the empirical tractability of the adverse selection risks associated with capital structure from 4,114 first-round Canadian venture capital investments. We first characterize the nature of uncertainty (in terms of the risk of financing a lemon or a nut) facing investors for different types of entrepreneurial firms. We then show that VC syndication significantly mitigates problems of adverse selection.

In view of the increased focus on venture capital firms (VCFs) as important stakeholders for entrepreneurial ventures, in this study we examined the relationship between VCFs' investment strategies and their portfolio failure rates. We examined two aspects of a VCF's investment strategy: (1) the extent to which the VCF develops specialized expertise and (2) the extent to which the VCF undertakes investments in cooperation with other investors through syndication. We tested our hypotheses on longitudinal data of the realized strategies of 200 U.S.-based VCFs over a 12-year period. We found that a VCF's specialized development stage expertise had a negative effect on the proportion of defaults in the VCF's portfolio. We also found that the level of syndication positively—rather than negatively—affected the proportion of defaults. We discuss our findings from both theoretical and practical points of view.

Abstract: We explored in this article the process of entrepreneurial team formation. As theory specific to this topic is scant, we drew first on disparate views of team formation and its correlates; we then called upon in-depth interviews to provide deeper, nuanced insights into this dynamic process of creation. Our focus is team member addition. We identified resource-seeking and interpersonal attraction as primary alternative motivators for new teammate addition; however, we also illustrated how these motivations may be complementary in practice. Finally, we considered in some depth how new member identification and selection processes may unfold as new ventures are formed.

Abstract: This article examines the dynamics of entrepreneurial teams as they evolve through the different stages of a spin-out process. Using a unique, hand-collected set of data covering all team members in 10 cases, an in-depth analysis of the heterogeneity of team members' experience and perception of the strategic orientation needed to attain different milestones in the spin-out process was performed. Our findings suggest that teams evolve over time and change in composition, and therefore, they cannot be studied as immutable entities. At the start of the venture formation, we introduced a new team role, the privileged witness, potentially specific for spinouts. Analysis of the teams indicates that the team's heterogeneity changes as it evolves through the different stages of the spin-out process. In particular, we found that new team members brought in different kinds of experience; however, they did not introduce a different view on doing business from the initial team members.

Title: Interorganizational Commitment in Syndicated Cross‐Border Venture Capital Investments
Author-Name: Mäkelä, Markus M.
Author-Name: Maula, Markku V.J.
Abstract: Cross-border venture capital has become increasingly common in recent years. Little is known, however, about the antecedents of venture capitalists' commitment to portfolio firms in international settings. We used a multiple case study to build a grounded model of interorganizational commitment in cross-border syndication networks. The model proposes that changes in a venture's prospects influence investors' commitment levels. This relationship is amplified by the remoteness of the investor and is mitigated by the investor's embeddedness in local syndication networks and the relative investment size. The model contributes to the literature on cross-border venture capital and interorganizational commitment in international settings.

Title: Venture Capital in Emerging Economies: Networks and Institutional Change
Author-Name: Ahlstrom, David
Author-Name: Bruton, Garry D.
Abstract: Emerging economies are characterized by fundamental and comprehensive institutional transformations as their economies begin to mature. How venture capitalist functions in environments that differ so fundamentally from those of the mature markets where venture capital was initially developed has only begun to be addressed. This article builds a framework to further the understanding of venture capital practice in emerging markets. Specific attention is focused on the impact of networks in the model, in particular, how networks and other informal institutions can act to supplement or replace formal institutions when they are weak. The article goes on to examine what the implications are for venture capital and the role of informal institutions in emerging economies as formal institutions become more established. The research and resulting model is grounded in 65 semistructured interviews with venture capitalists in emerging economies around East Asia. This article contributes to the literature by drawing attention to the impact of networks and changing institutional environments on venture capital during different phases of an economic transition process in emerging economies. The findings have implications for understanding institutional impact on venture capital activity as well as entrepreneurs and entrepreneurial ventures that seek venture capital financing in emerging economies.

Abstract: This special issue is devoted to understanding the scientific structure of entrepreneurship research. Research in entrepreneurship has grown rapidly, encompassing multiple theoretical and methodological traditions. Articles in this issue use bibliometric techniques to find linkages among published entrepreneurship scholars. These analyses show that research in the entrepreneurship field contains: multiple but disconnected themes; dominant themes that reflect the disciplinary training and lens of their authors; and considerable dynamism and change in key research themes over time. These special issue articles provide rich opportunities for identifying insightful, influential, and creative research niches in the entrepreneurship field.

Abstract: Conceptual convergence is often seen as a holy grail in entrepreneurship research. Yet little empirical research has focused specifically on the extent and nature of this convergence. We address this issue by content-analyzing the networks of co-citation emerging from the 20,184 references listed in the 960 full-length articles published in the Frontiers of Entrepreneurship Research series between 1981 and 2004. Our results provide evidence for the varying levels of convergence that have characterized entrepreneurship research over the years, as well as the evolution of the conceptual themes that have attracted scholars' attention in different periods. In addition, we provide evidence that the field relies increasingly on its own literature, something that points toward the unique contribution that it makes to the management sciences.

Abstract: A debate persists about the distinctiveness of entrepreneurship research. Entrepreneurship research is seen as fragmented and its results are considered noncumulative, handicapping the evolution of the field as a respected scholarly discipline. In this article we conduct a bibliometric analysis to shed light on these issues. We analyze co-citation patterns of entrepreneurship-related articles published in the years 2000 to 2004 and identify the 25 most central research streams in entrepreneurship. We describe these groups and investigate their mutual relationships. Although the United States represents by far the greatest source of entrepreneurship articles, other countries represent significant sources of research in specific streams.

Title: The Social and Collaborative Nature of Entrepreneurship Scholarship: A Co‐Citation and Perceptual Analysis
Author-Name: Reader, Diana
Author-Name: Watkins, David
Abstract: This article explores the structure of the “metafield” of entrepreneurship in two related ways. First, author co-citation analysis establishes a collective view of the structure of the entrepreneurship literature as perceived by its research-active members. The co-citation frequencies of 78 prominent entrepreneurship researchers were analyzed using multivariate techniques. Cluster analysis and multidimensional scaling were used to explore the intellectual structure of entrepreneurship research by identifying groups of scholars whose work falls into similar areas. Factor analysis was then used to identify the underlying themes that characterize and define the field. Finally, the scholars within these nominal groupings were approached using individualized questionnaires to explore what social interactions might parallel, reflect, or underpin the intellectual ones. The study has given empirical support to a number of oft-quoted beliefs about entrepreneurship as a field of study, such as: (1) the occurrence of fragmentation from an early stage in its development; (2) that the difficulty of categorizing subfields unambiguously mirrors that in the metafield itself; (3) that there is a relative paucity of scholarship cited across—as opposed to within—these subfields; and (4) that there is evolution within the meta-field of national differences in the topics studied and citation patterns thereto. In addition, the study demonstrates that there are real and robust social and collaborative networks underlying the generation of the work which is cited jointly by third parties. The latter authors may be unaware of these networks. Equally, the co-cited authors, while recognizing overlapping interests, may have difficulty in categorizing this commonality in their contributions. Entrepreneurship research is shown to be very much a social activity, although this may be invisible to outsiders or novitiates.

Title: Entrepreneurs, Effectual Logic, and Over‐Trust
Author-Name: Goel, Sanjay
Author-Name: Karri, Ranjan
Abstract: This article complements extant literature on entrepreneurship and trust by proposing a model of over-trust (the tendency to trust more than what is warranted) using entrepreneurial characteristics and effectual logic. We trace how entrepreneurs following effectual processes may tend to over-trust. More formally, we propose that specific personality characteristics of the entrepreneur interact with effectual logic to make the entrepreneur more susceptible to over-trust. The proposed model is value neutral in that we do not imply that over-trust has negative consequences for entrepreneurs. In fact, it may be part of the overall risk that entrepreneurs assume in a new venture creation.

Title: Trust within Entrepreneur Bank Relationships: Insights from Italy
Author-Name: Howorth, Carole
Author-Name: Moro, Andrea
Abstract: Previous research has focused on economic factors that influence relationships between entrepreneurs and banks. Trust is relevant because it can reduce agency problems. A conceptual framework is developed from previous literature and from a study of entrepreneurs and bank managers from two regions of Northeast Italy. Testable propositions are derived regarding determinants of trust and the process of development in the entrepreneur–bank relationship. Within close-knit communities, information from third parties and community involvement affect the build up of trust. The implications are that bestowing trust may increase trustworthy behavior leading to a spiral of trust. Heavy monitoring may lead to lower levels of trust in a bank and lower demand for finance and/or less trustworthy behavior.

Abstract: This article examines the role of trust and government agency in the creation and evolution of interorganizational cooperation among entrepreneurial ventures in general and the influence of trust on development trajectories in particular. The multiple-case approach used draws on five in-depth case studies adopting a focal firm perspective. Trust is shown to play a critical role in the formation, maintenance, and transformation of interorganizational cooperative relationships; whereas its absence results in discontinuation. Moreover, the results suggest that government agency may unintentionally destroy existing, well-functioning, interorganizational cooperative arrangements.

Title: How Much Do You Trust Me? The Dark Side of Relational Trust in New Business Creation in Established Companies
Author-Name: Zahra, Shaker A.

Author-Name: Ucbasaran, Deniz
Abstract: Entrepreneurship in established companies centers on new business creation that is essential for profitability and growth. Yet, it is a complex process that is riven with technical, organizational, and political uncertainties. In this article, we explore the role of trust in the new business creation process in established companies. While there is agreement that trust is conducive to entrepreneurial activities in these companies, research on the dysfunctional effects of trust on new business creation initiatives has been sparse. We contribute to the literature by discussing the various stages of the business creation process (focusing on opportunity recognition, evaluation, refinement, championing, and implementation) in established companies, examining the positive effects of relational trust on each of these stages, and analyzing the negative effects of overreliance on relational trust for each stage. We conclude by highlighting the key managerial and theoretical implications of our analyses and by outlining promising avenues for future research.

In 2000 and 2001, it appeared that this success would be short-lived. Increased competition, declining demand, and an economic recession all combined to threaten Razorfish's future. This case chronicles the rise of Razorfish and the Internet industry, as well as the challenges presented by a changing industry and economic context. In the spring of 2001, Razorfish management faced options that appeared as either high-risk or highly distasteful.

Title: Why Research on Women Entrepreneurs Needs New Directions
Author-Name: Ahl, Helene
Abstract: Research articles on women's entrepreneurship reveal, in spite of intentions to the contrary and in spite of inconclusive research results, a tendency to recreate the idea of women as being secondary to men and of women's businesses being of less significance or, at best, as being a complement. Based on a discourse analysis, this article discusses what research practices cause these results. It suggests new research directions that do not reproduce women's subordination but capture more and richer aspects of women's entrepreneurship.

Abstract: We examine how establishing a mixed-sex entrepreneurial founding team may benefit women entrepreneurs in male-dominated cultures and industries. We contend that as a result of sex-based stereotypes, women entrepreneurs face unique obstacles in securing access to resources for their ventures. We argue that one way for women entrepreneurs to overcome these obstacles is to partner with a man. Drawing upon institutional, resource-based, and network theories, we theorize how partnering with a man may help provide women entrepreneurs in male-dominated contexts with enhanced legitimacy, access to a larger number of resources, and a stronger, more diverse social network.

Abstract: This work examines gender differences among Canadian small and medium enterprise (SME) owners seeking external financing, including commercial debt, leasing, supplier financing, and equity capital after controlling for size and industry sector. The work also examines potential gender differences in owners' strategic choices (application rates) and financiers' evaluative responses (turndown rates). Contrary to previous work that did not control for size and sector of firm, women business owners were equally likely as men to seek all types of external financing, except for external equity capital. Business in which women held majority ownership were significantly less likely to seek equity capital even after controlling for systemic factors. Male and female business owners that do apply for financing were equally likely to obtain capital. When asked the reasons for not seeking financing, the majority of respondents, male and female, specified that financing was not needed. Recommendations about future research are advanced.

Abstract: This study investigates the possible funding gap for women-owned compared with men-owned new businesses. With longitudinal data from new businesses in Norway, gender differences in funding perceptions and behaviors, as well as in actually obtained amounts of funding, are explored. While there are few detected gender differences with respect to funding perceptions and behavior, women obtain significantly less financial capital to develop their new businesses. Moreover, the results indicate that the lower levels of financial capital that women business founders achieve are associated with lower early business growth compared with their male counterparts.

Abstract: Building on Global Entrepreneurship Monitor research, this study examines the impact of specific norms supporting women's entrepreneurship on the relative rates of women to men engaged in entrepreneurship in different countries. These specific norms are themselves related to both a country's general support for entrepreneurship and its level of gender equality. Countries with higher overall levels of entrepreneurial activity also tended to evidence higher relative proportions of female participation. These findings are still seen when controlling for the substantial effect of countries’ economic development in shaping patterns of entrepreneurial activity.

Title: Personalism, Particularism, and the Competitive Behaviors and Advantages of Family Firms: An Introduction
Author-Name: Chrisman, James J.

Author-Name: Chua, Jess H.
Abstract: Fundamental assumptions of any theory of the family firm are that family firms will behave in ways that differ from nonfamily firms, and that the behaviors of family firms will also exhibit substantial variations. This special issue includes a set of articles and commentaries that study such differences. This introduction synthesizes these articles using the concepts of personalism and particularism. We argue that the set of articles contained in this special issue contributes to the literature by explaining how the ability and willingness of family firms to behave in an idiosyncratic fashion leads to advantages and disadvantages that distinguish between family and nonfamily firms and between different types of family firms.

Title: Why Do Some Family Businesses Out‐Compete? Governance, Long‐Term Orientations, and Sustainable Capability
Author-Name: Le Breton‐Miller, Isabelle
Author-Name: Miller, Danny
Abstract: This article seeks to link the domains of corporate governance, investment policies, competitive asymmetries, and sustainable capabilities. Conditions such as concentrated ownership, lengthy tenures, and profound business expertise give some family-controlled business (FCB) owners the discretion, incentive, knowledge, and ultimately, the resources to invest deeply in the future of the firm. These long-term investments accrue from particular governance conditions and engender competitive asymmetries—organizational qualities that are hard for other firms to copy, and thus, if tied to the value chain, create capabilities that are sustainable. Investments in staff and training, e.g., create tacit knowledge and preserve it within the firm. Investments in enduring relationships with partners enhance access to resources and free firms to focus on core competencies. And devotion to a compelling mission dedicates most of these investments to a core competency. When such investments are farsighted, orchestrated, and ongoing, capabilities will tend to evolve in a cumulative trajectory, making them doubly hard to imitate and thereby extending competitive advantage. Arguments are supported by making reference to the literature on corporate governance and agency theory and to emerging research on FCBs.

Title: Family Businesses Can Out‐Compete: As Long as They Are Willing to Question the Chosen Path
Author-Name: Ensley, Michael
Abstract: This commentary extends the discussion of whether CEO tenure will lead to strategies that have a longer-term orientation by examining the moderating role of task conflict which may either foster a decision-making context in which a long-term orientation represents a superior approach to decision making, or foster one which leads to strategic inertia, depending upon its intensity. The findings indicate that family firms that persist with the same CEO tend to persist with the same strategy when the level of executive team task conflict is high.

Title: Interorganizational Familiness: How Family Firms Use Interlocking Directorates to Build Community‐Level Social Capital
Author-Name: Lester, Richard H.
Author-Name: Cannella, Albert A.
Abstract: We draw on the concept of community-level social capital and apply it to the situation of a family-controlled public corporation. While traditional agency theory argues that agency costs are minimized in a family-controlled business (FCB) due to an improved alignment of owner and manager interests, we argue instead that FCBs endure additional agency costs uniquely related to the family firm organizational structure. To mitigate these additional costs, we propose that FCBs use board interlocks to build and maintain community-level social capital. That is, the intercorporate network of FCBs generates shared understandings, values, problem solving techniques, and approaches to dealing with family issues. Further, the network generates a level of social support for family business owners and managers grappling with challenges endemic to family control of public corporations. We generate a number of propositions that can be used in future research to test the theory developed here. We conclude with the assertion that the community-level social capital generated by the network of FCBs is an important reason for the survival and persistence of individual family firms, despite the existence of additional family-related costs.

Title: Family Firms and Social Responsibility: Preliminary Evidence from the S&P 500
Author-Name: Dyer, W. Gibb
Author-Name: Whetten, David A.
Abstract: Little is known about the impact of family ownership and management on corporate social performance. Some scholars have suggested that family firms are not likely to act in a socially responsible manner, while others have indicated that socially responsible behavior on the part of the family firm protects the family's assets. This preliminary study compares the degree to which family and nonfamily firms are socially responsible using data from 1991 to 2000 from the S&P 500. Two hundred sixty-one firms (202 nonfamily and 59 family) appeared in the S&P 500 for the 10-year period. Findings show that family firms are more socially responsible than nonfamily firms along several dimensions. This is likely due to family concern about image and reputation and a desire to protect family assets.

Title: Commentary: “Family Firms and Social Responsibility: Preliminary Evidence from the S&P 500”
Author-Name: Wiklund, Johan
Abstract: This commentary focuses on four themes: (1) empirical relevance of corporate social responsibility (CSR) in family firms; (2) complementary theoretical explanations to CSR behavior in family firms; (3) the need for stringent definitions in family business research; and (4) the potential for dual causality between family ownership and more generous CSR policies. Specifically, I argue that agency theory can lead to additional valuable insights about CSR in family firms.

Title: Corporate Entrepreneurship in Family Firms: A Family Perspective
Author-Name: Kellermanns, Franz W.
Author-Name: Eddleston, Kimberly A.
Abstract: Entrepreneurship has been recognized as an important factor contributing to firm success. Despite the potential benefit of corporate entrepreneurship to sustain the family firm across generations, corporate entrepreneurship has been underresearched in the family firm literature. We investigate how generational involvement, willingness to change, and the ability to recognize technological opportunities impact corporate entrepreneurship in family firms. We also examine strategic planning in family firms as a facilitating process. Our findings suggest that willingness to change and technological opportunity recognition are positively related to corporate entrepreneurship in family firms. We further found strategic planning to significantly moderate the relationships between (1) generational involvement and (2) technological opportunity recognition and corporate entrepreneurship. These findings and implications for management and research are discussed.

Title: The Complicating Factor of Life Cycles in Corporate Venturing
Author-Name: Hoy, Frank
Abstract: Does family matter in corporate venturing? Converting the question, can a family firm survive without corporate venturing? Life cycle theory contends that it is normal for an organization to form, grow, mature, decline, and die. Long-term survival, especially through multiple generations, would require renewal through innovation to avoid decay and death. Strategic corporate venturing may be the answer for many family firms. To innovate and prosper, a family enterprise must contend with multiple life cycles, rarely synchronized, any one of which may be in a decline stage at any point in time. This commentary examines how life cycles complicate the ability of families to plan strategically for corporate entrepreneurship.

Title: Are We Family and Are We Treated as Family? Nonfamily Employees' Perceptions of Justice in the Family Firm
Author-Name: Barnett, Tim
Author-Name: Kellermanns, Franz W.
Abstract: The importance of justice perceptions in fostering positive job attitudes and value-creating behaviors in organizations is well established in the literature. Despite this, only a handful of studies have addressed justice in family firms, and none have presented a theoretical model illustrating how nonfamily employees' justice perceptions may be influenced by family involvement in family firms. Here, we suggest that the level of family influence impacts the justice perceptions of nonfamily employees primarily through its effect on the human resource (HR) practices within family firms. Specifically, we propose that low levels of family influence tend to have little impact on the fairness of HR practices, that moderate levels of family influence tend to have positive effects on the fairness of HR practices, and that high levels of family influence tend to have negative effects on the fairness of HR decision processes and outcomes. Accordingly, we present and provide a conceptual support for a model that outlines the proposed relationships among family influence, family firms' HR practices, and the justice perceptions of nonfamily employees.

Author-Name: Karra, Neri

Author-Name: Phillips, Nelson
Abstract: This article examines the relationship between altruism and agency costs in family business through an in-depth case study of a family firm. We found that altruism reduced agency costs in the early stages of the business, but that agency problems increased as the venture became larger and more established. Moreover, we suggest that altruistic behavior need not be confined to family and close kin, but may extend through networks of distant kin and ethnic ties. We thus present a more complex view of the agency relationship in family business than is often portrayed in the existing literature.

Title: Commentary: A Framework for Managing the Familiness and Agency Advantages in Family Firms
Author-Name: Habbershon, Timothy G.
Abstract: This article uses a family-influenced, international, new venture creation case as a platform for addressing the importance of context when exploring entrepreneurship in start-up and growth companies. I raise crucial issues about how agency relationships and costs are evaluated in family firms, arguing that the competitiveness implications of agency can only be fully assessed in light of the larger context considerations. I suggest that agency is best evaluated as inputs and outputs in a contextual ecosystem. I utilize a family business ecosystems model to show that family is a distinct context for entrepreneurship and that it generates an idiosyncratic bundle of resources and capabilities that provide a potential agency advantage in new venture creation. Since the case findings indicate that the agency inputs and outputs change over time, I conclude by placing the potential agency advantages and constraints into an organizational life cycle framework. The goal of the article is to further the discussion on how families find their advantage in the entrepreneurial process.

Subscribing to a logic that good scholarship should inform what is taught in business schools, the article further establishes family business as a field of study by developing a research-based heuristic useful for ongoing curriculum inquiry and development.

Abstract: In this article, we take note of advances in the entrepreneurial cognition research stream. In doing so, we bring increasing attention to the usefulness of entrepreneurial cognition research. First, we offer and develop a central research question to further enable entrepreneurial cognition inquiry. Second, we present the conceptual background and some representative approaches to entrepreneurial cognition research that form the context for this question. Third, we introduce the articles in this Special Issue as framed by the central question and approaches to entrepreneurial cognition research, and suggest how they further contribute to this developing stream. Finally, we offer our views concerning the challenges and opportunities that await the next generation of entrepreneurial cognition scholarship. We therefore invite (and seek to enable) the growing community of entrepreneurship researchers from across multiple disciplines to further develop the “thinking–doing” link in entrepreneurship research. It is our goal to offer colleagues an effective research staging point from which they may embark upon many additional research expeditions and investigations involving entrepreneurial cognition.

Abstract: Based on survey responses from 159 owner-managers in small high-technology firms, we examined the association among specific individual characteristics, firm characteristics, and the individual outcomes of satisfaction and intentions to exit. Regression analyses indicated higher satisfaction and lower intentions to exit for owner-managers whose dominant decision-making style complemented the levels of formalization and structure in their firms. In addition, we found that both satisfaction and intentions to exit were significantly associated with actual turnover over a 5-year period. The theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed.

Abstract: How do new firms first develop reputations among their stakeholders? Past studies offer insights on positive signals that a new firm can send, but say little about how stakeholder group members process such signals and come to share beliefs that a new firm possesses a desirable set of attributes. This process is particularly important to understand given that both negative and positive signals are often received about new firms. Our article draws on social cognition theories to develop insights regarding the process by which stakeholder groups develop reputational beliefs about new firms and to identify factors that facilitate or impede the development of reputations.

Title: Collective Cognition: When Entrepreneurial Teams, Not Individuals, Make Decisions
Author-Name: West, G. Page
Abstract: New venture success often depends on how the founding team collectively understands its world, estimates effects of possible actions, makes decisions, and allocates appropriate resources. Drawing on recent work in managerial cognition and entrepreneurship, this article argues for the importance of examining cognition at the team level. New venture strategy is used as a springboard to discuss collective cognition, although other important critical decision domains in new ventures may also be used to illustrate the arguments. In this and other such decision domains, collective cognition mediates between individual cognitions and firm actions and performance. A method for assessing entrepreneurial top management team cognition is developed and then tested in an exploratory study of technology-based new ventures. Two structural characteristics of collective cognition (differentiation and integration) are strongly related to firm performance, suggesting interesting opportunities for future entrepreneurship research in cognition.

Title: The Conflicting Cognitions of Corporate Entrepreneurs
Author-Name: Corbett, Andrew C.
Author-Name: Hmieleski, Keith M.
Abstract: Research in the entrepreneurial cognition domain has demonstrated that entrepreneurs tend to draw from similar sets of event schemas when considering to start a new venture. The social cognition literature also explains that role schemas affect how individuals encode, process, and use information. In this article, we examine the interplay and divergence between the role schema of individuals in corporations and the event schemas necessary to launch a new venture. By examining these schemas together, we show how the corporate context can create tension between corporate entrepreneurs' role schemas and the event schemas necessary for entrepreneurship. We then construct a theoretical framework for explaining why this tension results in corporate entrepreneurs emphasizing certain event schemas in a manner that is distinct from independent entrepreneurs. Important implications regarding the relationship between context and entrepreneurial cognition are outlined for researchers, entrepreneurs, corporate managers, and educators.

Abstract: Cognitive developmental psychology and constructivism offer possibilities for the future of entrepreneurial cognition research to explore: (1) deeply seated beliefs and belief structures that ultimately anchor entrepreneurial thinking and (2) how they change as entrepreneurs move toward a more professional, expert mind-set. Such insights aid the field in identifying those developmental experiences that are the sources of those critical deep beliefs intrinsic to our mental models regarding entrepreneurship. As a field, entrepreneurship is lauded for the effectiveness of its teaching, and this essay offers strong theory to explain that our pedagogical best practices reflect important, well-known cognitive phenomena.

Abstract: In this article, we examine the impact of virtual embeddedness—the establishment of interorganizational connections through the use of electronic technologies—on the likelihood of new venture survival. We explore the effects of recent technological and social changes on traditional conceptions of the liabilities of newness. We argue that virtual embeddedness positively affects new venture survival by decreasing the liabilities of newness associated with a new venture's need to create and manage new roles and systems, lack of extant trust relationships, lack of social capital, and lack of economic capital. This argument has important implications for both the study and management of contemporary new ventures.

Author-Name: Miles, Morgan P.
Abstract: Corporate venturing (CV) is said to be most productive as a path to superior corporate performance when practiced in a strategic manner. Unfortunately, considerable ambiguity exists concerning what it means in an organizational practice sense to strategically pursue CV. The result is a failure of many companies to fully leverage CV for strategic purposes. Based on a review of the CV literature and findings from a field study of 15 Swedish, U.K., and U.S. corporations, this article describes several models that depict the ways in which CV and business strategy coexist as organizational phenomena. Empirically derived propositions are offered to suggest how some companies are strategically engaged in their CV efforts.

Title: The Status of Women in Corporate Governance in High‐Growth, High‐Potential Firms
Author-Name: Nelson, Teresa
Author-Name: Levesque, Laurie L.
Abstract: Surveys of the largest U.S. corporations routinely demonstrate that the role of women in corporate governance is acutely limited. In this research we examine how high-growth entrepreneurial sectors of the economy compare to that standard. We posit that high demand labor markets, enhanced higher education of women, and dynamic industry and firm conditions could result in a greater participation of women executives in firms moving toward major corporate status through initial public offering. However, our study results show few significant differences between women's participation in high-growth, high-potential firms versus the Fortune 500. Several of the findings directly contradict our hypotheses, with lower rates of women as board directors and a greater likelihood of the executive team being composed exclusively of men in high-growth, high-potential firms. Women are not present in the top leadership spots of Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Board Chair in either sector, and within high-growth firms are significantly less likely to be found on the boards of venture capital backed companies. The implications of these findings for companies, for policy, and for women and men planning careers in business are discussed.

Employing a sample of 190 U.S.-based firms, this study measures the service content characterizing a venture's output, and found (1) the service content of the outputs of international young ventures is significantly different than the service content of domestic young ventures; and (2) the service content of the outputs of international young ventures is significantly different in different overseas locations.

Author-Name: Wijbenga, Frits H.

Author-Name: Stratling, Rebecca
Abstract: Venture capitalists (VCs) contribute to entrepreneurial firms by engaging in governance activities, such as providing services and monitoring the entrepreneurial firm's operations and performance. This study examines the role and influence of the VC's governance activities on 93 Dutch entrepreneurial firms. Results suggest that while the VC's governance activities may help to stimulate the use of the entrepreneurial firm's control systems, they also moderate the relationship between the entrepreneurial firm's use of control systems and its financial performance. It appears in particular that cost control systems contribute positively to the entrepreneurial firm's financial performance when the VC provides service activities. However, the use of cost control systems tends to be negatively related to the entrepreneurial firm's financial performance when the VC is highly focused on monitoring.

Abstract: This article explores the variables that drive small firms to choose quasi-integration as an alternative to vertical integration in situations of high asset frequency. Drawing on transaction cost theory and institutional approaches, we develop and test several hypotheses regarding quasi-integration among homebuilders and land developers in a major Canadian city. Our focus is on the preferences of small, vulnerable firms operating in an environment where quasi-integration has been institutionalized as a trusted form of governance. The findings indicate that the preference for quasi-integration is driven by asset specificity, bargaining power, and opportunistic expectations, supporting a paradoxical view that small, vulnerable firms pursue both efficiency and institutional legitimacy in making governance choices regarding large dominant suppliers.

Title: The Entrepreneurial Propensity of Women
Author-Name: Langowitz, Nan
Author-Name: Minniti, Maria
Abstract: Entrepreneurship is becoming an increasingly important source of employment for women across many countries. The level of female involvement in entrepreneurial activity, however, is still significantly lower than that of men. We take a behavioral economics approach and, using a large sample of individuals in 17 countries, we investigate what variables influence the entrepreneurial propensity of women and whether those variables have a significant correlation with differences across genders. In addition to demographic and economic variables, we include a number of perceptual variables. Our results show that subjective perceptual variables have a crucial influence on the entrepreneurial propensity of women and account for much of the difference in entrepreneurial activity between the sexes. Specifically, we find that women tend to perceive themselves and the entrepreneurial environment in a less favorable light than men across all countries in our sample and regardless of entrepreneurial motivation. Our results suggest that perceptual variables may be significant universal factors influencing entrepreneurial behavior.

Title: The Role of Gender in Opportunity Identification
Author-Name: DeTienne, Dawn R.
Author-Name: Chandler, Gaylen N.
Abstract: Opportunity identification is rapidly becoming a key focal point of research in the entrepreneurship domain. This study is the first to explore gender differences in opportunity identification. Utilizing two distinct samples (95 senior undergraduate students, 189 entrepreneurs in two high-technology industries), we found that women and men utilize their unique stocks of human capital to identify opportunities and that they use fundamentally different processes of opportunity identification. However, we did not find any difference in the innovativeness of the opportunities identified. This research contributes both to the opportunity identification literature and to theories of social feminism by showing empirically that although women and men utilize different processes to identify opportunities, neither process is inherently superior.

Title: Gender, Entrepreneurial Self‐Efficacy, and Entrepreneurial Career Intentions: Implications for Entrepreneurship Education
Author-Name: Wilson, Fiona

Author-Name: Marlino, Deborah
Abstract: The relationships between gender, entrepreneurial self-efficacy, and entrepreneurial intentions were examined for two sample groups: adolescents and adult master of business administration (MBA) students. Similar gender effects on entrepreneurial self-efficacy are shown for both groups and support earlier research on the relationship between self-efficacy and career intentions. Additionally, the effects of entrepreneurship education in MBA programs on entrepreneurial self-efficacy proved stronger for women than for men. Implications for educators and policy makers were discussed, and areas for future research outlined.

Title: The Differential Effect of Men and Women Entrepreneurs' Human Capital and Networking on Growth Expectancies in Bulgaria

Abstract: Based on expectancy theory and social psychology perspectives, this study looks at the differential effects of men and women entrepreneurs' human capital and networking on their growth expectancies in the context of a transitional economy. Survey data from men and women new venture owners in Bulgaria (n = 544) suggest that growth expectancy among men is significantly and positively associated with outside advice achieved through networking. Among women entrepreneurs, growth expectancy is significantly and positively associated with perceived benefits from prior experience. A Chow test for coefficient differences reveals that the determinants of growth expectancy for women entrepreneurs are significantly different than those for men, rendering support for perspectives from social psychology, which suggest that women have different socialization experiences and, as a result, conceive of their new venture growth differently. Implications for managerial practice and public policy are discussed.

Title: Gender, Entrepreneurship, and Bank Lending: The Criteria and Processes Used by Bank Loan Officers in Assessing Applications
Author-Name: Carter, Sara
Author-Name: Shaw, Eleanor
Author-Name: Lam, Wing
Author-Name: Wilson, Fiona
Abstract: Previous research provides unequivocal evidence that women-owned businesses start with both lower levels of overall capitalization and lower ratios of debt finance. Structural dissimilarities between male-owned and female-owned businesses explain most, but by no means all, of these contrasting funding profiles. Explanations of residual differences, viewed in terms of supply-side discrimination or demand-side debt and risk aversion, remain controversial. Using experimental and qualitative methodologies, this study explores the role of gender in bank lending decisions, focusing on the criteria and processes used by male and female loan officers. Results reveal similarities in the criteria used to assess male and female applicants but show modest differences in the emphasis given to certain criteria by male and female lending officers. The processes used by male and female lending officers to negotiate loan applications revealed the greatest differences.

Title: Does Gender Matter? Women Business Angels and the Supply of Entrepreneurial Finance
Author-Name: Harrison, Richard T.
Author-Name: Mason, Colin M.
Abstract: There is a substantial literature on the relationship between gender and access to finance. However, most studies have been concerned with access to debt finance. More recently, the focus of this research has broadened to examine women and venture capital. This article extends the focus further by examining the role of women in the business angel market, which is more important than the formal venture capital market in terms of both the number of ventures supported and total capital flows. Based on a detailed analysis of business angels in the U.K., the study concludes that women investors who are active in the market differ from their male counterparts in only limited respects. Future research into women business angels, and the possible existence of gender differences, needs to be based on more fully elaborated standpoint epistemologies that focus on the experience of the woman angel investor per se, and center on the examination of the role of homophily, social capital, networking, and competition in investment behavior.

Author-Name: Bierly, Paul E.
Author-Name: Daly, Paula S.
Abstract: This study examines the relationship between knowledge strategy (exploration or exploitation) and performance, and the possible moderating role of external environment variables. Results from a sample of small manufacturing firms indicate that exploration and exploitation are distinct and complementary constructs. The relationship between exploration and performance is linear and positive, while the relationship between exploitation and performance is concave, indicating that there is a point at which focusing on exploitation leads to reduced returns. Additionally, we find that the competitive environment moderates the relationship between exploitation and performance, such that exploitation has a stronger impact on performance in stable and high-tech environments than in dynamic and low-tech environments. Exploration also has a stronger impact on performance in high-tech environments than in low-tech environments.

Abstract: While we have gained considerable knowledge since the late 1980s regarding the phenomena of international new ventures, less is known about the influence of industry structure on these ventures. In the present paper, we draw on literature from industrial economics, international business and entrepreneurship to identify industry structure variables that fit within the theoretical framework of international new ventures. We then offer propositions as to how the identified industry structure variables individually and jointly influence the likelihood of new venture internationalization.

Author-Name: Kirchhoff, Bruce A.
Author-Name: Newbert, Scott L.
Author-Name: Hasan, Iftekhar
Author-Name: Armington, Catherine
Abstract: Since new firms generally lack the resources necessary to compete with their larger, older counterparts in the knowledge development process, we argue that they often rely on spillovers to fuel their own innovative efforts. Thus, we hypothesize that new firms will tend to form in areas characterized by high levels of university research and development (R & D) expenditures and that these births will in turn stimulate the local economy by generating increases in employment level and growth. We test our hypotheses at the U.S. labor market area level using secondary data from various government sources for the years 1990 through 1999. Our results demonstrate that university R & D expenditures are positively related to new firm formations, and that these new firm formations are positively related to employment level and change. These findings suggest that university R & D expenditures are an important indirect contributor to overall economic growth by encouraging primary and secondary firm births.

Title: From Opportunity Insight to Opportunity Intention: The Importance of Person‐Situation Learning Match
Author-Name: Dimov, Dimo
Abstract: Within the context of opportunity development as a learning process, this paper explores the intentionality that drives the early stages of this process, from the initial occurrence of an idea to its further exploration and elaboration by a potential entrepreneur. It establishes that the specific situations that induce opportunity insights also affect the roles that individuals' prior knowledge and learning approaches play for the formation of opportunity intentions. The likelihood of acting on their initial opportunity insights depends not only on how much prior knowledge individuals have of the opportunity domain, but also on whether their learning style matches the situation at hand. The results from an experiment show that domain-specific knowledge enables action when there is a person–situation match and impedes it when such a match is lacking.

We present a set of propositions suggesting that the determinants of the two types of initiatives are different. We conclude with implications for both practitioners and researchers studying entrepreneurship in large MNEs.

Abstract: Competent data analysis is essential to entrepreneurship research and to the discipline's progression. A three-study design was used to evaluate quantitative analytic trends and the adequacy of entrepreneurship doctoral training. First, trends were identified by assessing hypothesis-testing techniques in Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice and the Journal of Business Venturing. Second, top entrepreneurship scholars were surveyed regarding the importance of various quantitative analytical techniques to future research and their expectations regarding doctoral training. Third, newly minted entrepreneurship PhDs were queried regarding their perceived competence with these same techniques. These studies provide a past, present, and future perspective on data analysis techniques and competencies in entrepreneurship.

Abstract: This article makes two contributions to our understanding of the core entrepreneurial activity of assembling resources to pursue an opportunity. First, a conceptual framework is presented to organize the research on resource mobilization. Second, a study is presented based upon interviews with a random sample of 48 entrepreneurs to identify the supporters whom the entrepreneurs considered to have been key to their success and the resources obtained from these individuals. Results indicate that maximizing the overall effectiveness of resource combinations is a complex undertaking involving trade-offs between the quantity and quality of available resources and the efficiency versus effectiveness of supporters.

Abstract: This article examines the relevance of the two main theories used to understand business format franchising—resource scarcity theory and agency theory—for social venture franchising through an in-depth case study of one of the United Kingdom's first and most high-profile social franchises. We posit that both theories can be reframed to take account of the distinctive characteristics of social franchise systems. In developing our arguments, we present four findings that, taken together, move us closer toward a theory of social venture franchising.

Title: Correlates of Board Empowerment in Small Companies
Author-Name: Gabrielsson, Jonas
Abstract: This study seeks to advance the understanding of board empowerment in small companies. Predictions based on agency and resource dependency theories were used to examine how contingency factors correlate with board empowerment, in this study conceptualized as a larger number of board members, a higher representation of outside directors, and separate CEO and board chair positions. Statistical analyses on a sample of 135 small companies gave ample support for the agency-theoretic prediction that board empowerment in small companies is a response to satisfy the demands from owners not directly involved in managing the company. Other factors influencing board empowerment were younger CEOs, high degree of exports, and past poor company performance. The influence of these contingency factors, however, was not as strong and extensive as the presence of outside owners. The article ends with a discussion of the findings and their implications for understanding boards and governance in small companies.

Title: Beyond the Single‐Person, Single‐Insight Attribution in Understanding Entrepreneurial Opportunities
Author-Name: Dimov, Dimo
Abstract: This article helps develop the creativity perspective within entrepreneurship in two ways. First, it elaborates on the nature of opportunity as a creative product. Rather than viewing opportunities as single insights, it suggests that they are emerging through the continuous shaping and development of (raw) ideas that are acted upon. Second, rather than attributing them to a particular individual, it highlights the contextual and social influences that affect the generation and shaping of ideas. This helps move entrepreneurship research beyond the single-person, single-insight attribution that currently permeates it.

Abstract: The Panel Study of Entrepreneurial Dynamics data were used to analyze if the potential for increased life satisfaction pulls or job dissatisfaction pushes individuals toward an entrepreneurial career. For life satisfaction, we found no significant mean differences between nascent entrepreneurs and the comparison group, whereas for job satisfaction, we found a significantly higher mean for the nascent entrepreneurs than for the comparison group. As these results show little about nascent entrepreneurs being pulled into an entrepreneurial career, the results have to be taken as strong evidence against nascent entrepreneurs being pushed toward an entrepreneurial career due to low job satisfaction in their preentrepreneurial employment.

Abstract: Prior research has proposed five conditions that support corporate entrepreneurship: rewards, management support, resources including time, organizational structures (at the macro level), and risk acceptance. This article investigates the sufficiency of these conditions in motivating individual scientists or engineers who have created and commercialized multiple breakthrough innovations in mature corporations—or technical corporate entrepreneurs. Using in-depth interviews with technical corporate entrepreneurs and human resource managers, we explore both how they are motivated and whether there is concurrence between how they say they are motivated and how their human resource managers perceive that they are motivated. We find the framework applicable but incomplete relative to motivating these individuals. The additional dimensions of appropriate work design (at the micro level) and their intrinsic motivation to innovate need to be considered in supporting technical corporate entrepreneurship. Further, we find that an important disparity exists between what technical corporate entrepreneurs say motivates them and the perceptions of their human resource manger.

Title: From Human Capital to Social Capital: A Longitudinal Study of Technology‐Based Academic Entrepreneurs
Author-Name: Mosey, Simon
Author-Name: Wright, Mike
Abstract: This article develops theory relating to how differences in the human capital of academic entrepreneurs influence their ability to develop social capital that can address the barriers to venture development. We examine the development of social capital by three types of academic entrepreneurs with differing levels of entrepreneurship experience: nascent, novice, and habitual entrepreneurs. Using a longitudinal study, critical differences are observed between the structure, content, and governance of their social networks. We propose that entrepreneurs with prior business ownership experience have broader social networks and are more effective in developing network ties. Less experienced entrepreneurs likely encounter structural holes between their scientific research networks and industry networks. Support initiatives help attract industry partners for novice entrepreneurs from engineering and the material sciences but academics based within biological sciences encounter greater difficulties building such ties. Regardless of academic discipline, business ownership experience appears essential to learn to build relationships with experienced managers and potential equity investors.

Author-Name: Terjesen, Siri
Abstract: This case follows Sethu Sethunarayanan, Director of the nonprofit Center for Development of Disadvantaged People, which is dedicated to the improvement of the Irula tribe in rural villages of southeast India. The Irulas specialize in catching rats, an activity which provides the bulk of their income and food. Following a routine visit to a local village, Sethu recognized an opportunity for a “better rat trap” to aid the Irula rat catchers. With feedback from rat catchers, Sethu developed an innovative new trap. His innovation won the prestigious Global Development Marketplace award from the World Bank which provided the funding necessary to commercialize the new technology. The venture's implementation involved site visits to identify beneficiaries, health checks and treatment, preparatory workshops, factory establishment, factory training, production, women's micro-credit collectives, distribution, and project evaluation. The case focuses on the relationship between human capital and technological entrepreneurship, considering the knowledge and skills required to commercialize technology for the rural poor and the positive impact on this greatly disadvantaged population.

Title: Private Enterprise Growth and Human Capital Productivity in India
Author-Name: Majumdar, Sumit K.
Abstract: This article examines patterns of growth in private firms and private equity investment and in the decline in state-owned firms and equity capital within the corporate sector in Indian industry over a 25-year period, 1973–1974 to 1997–1998, with some additional analysis extended to 2001–2002, to assess whether a transformation in ownership has taken place, whether the boundaries of the state as a participant in industry have significantly declined and the boundaries of private enterprise enhanced. The data cover the entire industrial population of India. The boundaries of the state as an industrial participant have shrunk significantly as a result of the growth of private entrepreneurship in India, especially in industries where agents are engaged in technological entrepreneurship. The numbers of private companies established in India have grown and the volume of equity capital being invested has risen substantially. Associated with this relative growth of private firms and shrinking of government ownership is a significant increase in human capital productivity across all ownership categories of Indian industry.

Title: Assessing the Relationship between Human Capital and Firm Performance: Evidence from Technology‐Based New Ventures
Author-Name: Shrader, Rod
Author-Name: Siegel, Donald S.
Abstract: We assess the role of human capital in the growth and development of new technology-based ventures, based on longitudinal data from 198 high-tech ventures. Our empirical results imply that there is a strong relationship between team experience and strategy. Although there is a weak direct link between team experience and venture performance, the findings strongly suggest that the fit between strategy and team experience is a key determinant of the long-term performance of high-tech entrepreneurial ventures. For small, technology-based new ventures, the team's technological experience appears to be the most important determinant of the success of a differentiation strategy.

Title: Entrepreneurship and Human Capital: Evidence of Patenting Activity from the Academic Sector
Author-Name: Allen, Stuart D.
Author-Name: Link, Albert N.
Author-Name: Rosenbaum, Dan T.
Abstract: This paper presents empirical evidence of the relationship between faculty entrepreneurial activity—quantified in terms of the propensity of U.S. university faculty to work directly with industry on research activities that lead to patents—and human capital, measured in terms of faculty tenure and age. Patenting reflects a unique dimension of faculty entrepreneurship, namely, collaborative activity that results in joint intellectual property. We find that faculty with tenure are more likely to engage in such activity, thus providing suggestive evidence of an externality associated with permanent employment. We also find that older faculty are more likely to engage with industry, to a point, holding tenure constant. Tenure and age proxy, respectively, what we call the “accumulated advantage” of faculty and their absorptive capacity. Because faculty patenting with industry involved both parties, our findings reflect that such faculty experience and expertise are important to industry to enter into a patenting relationship. Finally, we find that male faculty are more likely to patent with industry than female faculty.

Title: How Corporate Entrepreneurs Learn from Fledgling Innovation Initiatives: Cognition and the Development of a Termination Script
Author-Name: Corbett, Andrew C.
Author-Name: Neck, Heidi M.
Author-Name: DeTienne, Dawn R.
Abstract: Through a parallel examination of literatures on new product development termination and entrepreneurial cognition, this study explores a specific form of human capital development: learning from failure. Specifically we advance the literature on entrepreneurial human capital by linking cognitive scripts used by corporate entrepreneurs in project termination decisions to corresponding levels of learning. Our longitudinal investigation of technology-based firms suggests that corporate entrepreneurs use three types of termination scripts: (1) undisciplined termination, (2) strategic termination, and (3) innovation drift. We illustrate the presence of each script and analyze learning implications during innovation projects (action learning) and after termination (post-performance learning). Based on our analysis we suggest that organizational learning is dependent upon the type of termination script individuals employ.

Title: Technology Entrepreneurs' Human Capital and Its Effects on Innovation Radicalness
Author-Name: Marvel, Matthew R.
Author-Name: Lumpkin, G.T.
Abstract: Radical innovations transform existing markets, create new markets, and stimulate economic growth. This study investigates how the experience, education, and prior knowledge of technology entrepreneurs relate to innovation radicalness. Findings from a sample of 145 technology entrepreneurs operating within university-affiliated incubators suggest that general and specific human capital are both vital to innovation outcomes. Innovation radicalness was positively associated with formal education and prior knowledge of technology, but negatively associated with prior knowledge of ways to serve markets. This suggests a counterintuitive conclusion—the less technology entrepreneurs know about ways to serve a market, the greater their chances of using technology knowledge to create breakthrough innovations within it. Finally, we discuss configurations of human capital that are likely to bestow unique advantages in the construction of radical innovations.

Title: Complementing Capital: The Role of Status, Demographic Features, and Social Capital in Founding Teams' Abilities to Obtain Resources
Author-Name: Packalen, Kelley A.
Abstract: To investigate the extent to which founders can influence their firms, I formulate a framework that considers the interaction between three main facets of founding teams' backgrounds, namely, industry status, entrepreneurially relevant demographic features, and social capital. As the propositions and illustrations suggest, the presence of one type of capital may reduce the dependence on or need for others. The model has applicability to a variety of industries with uncertain outcomes resulting from the commercialization of early-stage technology (e.g., biotechnology, nanotechnology, software, or hardware) or subjective quality (e.g., restaurants or movies).

Title: Note to Instructors: Building a Better Rat Trap
Author-Name: Terjesen, Siri
Abstract: This case examines technological entrepreneurship and human capital in a remote village in southeast India. Sethu Sethunarayanan, director of the nongovernment organization (NGO) Center for Development of Disadvantaged People (CDDP), uses technology to improve the lives of impoverished people, focusing in particular on the indigenous Irula tribe. The Irulas’ rat catching activities constitute a primary source of income and food. However, the Irulas are often unsuccessful in catching rats and suffer many health problems from mouth-blowing a clay pot filled with smoke. Sethu developed a “better rat trap,” improving success rates and income and eliminating health hazards. In parallel, CDDP established a factory and self-help, micro-credit collectives to enable other villagers to improve their socioeconomic condition. The case chronicles the project's development, including opportunity recognition, and new technology development and implementation. An overview of the skills and experience of Sethu and the CDDP team, and the national, local, and community context is also provided.

Title: Entrepreneurship in Emerging Economies: Where Are We Today and Where Should the Research Go in the Future
Author-Name: Bruton, Garry D.

Author-Name: Obloj, Krzysztof
Abstract: Emerging economies are characterized by an increasing market orientation and an expanding economic foundation. The success of many of these economies is such that they are rapidly becoming major economic forces in the world. Entrepreneurship plays a key role in this economic development. Yet to date, little is known about entrepreneurship in emerging economies. This introductory article to the special issue on entrepreneurship in emerging economies examines the literature that exists to date in this important domain. It then reviews the research that was generated as part of this special issue on this topic. The article concludes with a discussion of the critical future research needs in this area.

Title: Contrasting Entrepreneurial Economic Development in Emerging Latin American Economies: Applications and Extensions of Resource‐Based Theory
Author-Name: West, G. Page

Author-Name: Marsden, Jesse W.
Abstract: Emerging economies face daunting economic development challenges. Economists and management consultants have generally suggested global solutions that typically focus solely on foreign direct investment. Yet a resource-based theory approach offers an alternative view of economic development in which a foundation of resources within a region gestates entrepreneurial activity. While theoretically appealing, it is unclear in application how such resources can be developed or which types of resources are most important to develop. This paper extends the application of resource-based theory to entrepreneurial economic development in subsistence economies. A qualitative study of contrasting entrepreneurial activity in Chiapas (Mexico) and Atenas (Costa Rica) highlights the primacy of intangible resources—and especially entrepreneurial orientation resources—in the gestation of entrepreneurial activity.

Title: Corporate Entrepreneurship as Resource Capital Configuration in Emerging Market Firms
Author-Name: Yiu, Daphne W.
Author-Name: Lau, Chung‐Ming
Abstract: Network-based resource capital such as political capital, social capital, and reputational capital are critical in providing firms with special access to various resources and legitimacy in emerging markets. However, how these generic nonmarket forms of capital are transformed into value-adding, industry-specific, and firm-specific uses, which subsequently enhance firm competitiveness, remained unanswered. Adopting a dynamic capability approach, this paper posits that corporate entrepreneurship performs a unique role of resource capital configuration and transformation in emerging market firms by continuously renewing firm competences so that congruence with the changing environment can be achieved. Building on this conceptualization, we argue that the positive effects of network-based resource capital on firm performance are channeled through the resource configuration process given by various corporate entrepreneurial activities such as product and organizational innovations as well as new venturing. Empirical evidence of the proposed mediation model is obtained from a survey of established firms in China.

Abstract: The internationalization of new ventures from emerging economies to developed economies remains an unfilled gap at the intersection of the literature between international entrepreneurship and strategy in emerging economies. What drives some (but not all) new ventures from emerging economies to enter developed economies? We address this question by developing a comprehensive framework based on the three leading perspectives on strategy—industry-based, resource-based, and institution-based views. A series of propositions are proposed to explore the underlying logic behind new ventures' entrepreneurial entries from emerging to developed economies.

Abstract: Drawing on institutional theory and entrepreneurial cognition, we test the environmental perception-scanning framework in the United States and India. The results suggest that culture and transition context help explain scanning frequency, but entrepreneurs in the two countries are similar in their perceptions of strategic uncertainty in environmental sectors. Moreover, the perceptions of increased environmental change and sector importance, as conditioned by perceived information accessibility, are associated with increased scanning. Overall, our results provide important indications about perceptions and information seeking, and lend support to indications of a universal mindset of entrepreneurship.

Abstract: Following the collapse of socialism in the late 1980s, Central and Eastern European countries initiated attempts to adopt capitalist economic frameworks and promote entrepreneurship. However, persistent economic difficulties and high levels of unemployment have led to dissatisfaction with political parties favoring capitalism. We integrate identity, institutional, and social movement theories to describe the emergence of four competing social movements (capitalist democracy, socialist command, social democracy, and populist command) that are undertaken to pursue politico-economic reforms. We discuss the implications for developing an entrepreneurial culture in Central and Eastern Europe.

Author-Name: Filatotchev, Igor
Abstract: Building on an asset complementarity perspective, human capital and social capital measures are used to examine the science park location decisions of returnee entrepreneurs and the performance of their ventures. The study uses a unique, hand-collected data set of 349 SMEs from Zhongguancun Science Park in China, including 53 SMEs from locations administered by universities. The article considers the antecedents of university and nonuniversity science park location and firm growth with a view to drawing conclusions that go beyond the specific context of Beijing and China. Its findings include the tendency for returning entrepreneurs with academic knowledge in the form of patents transferred from abroad to locate in nonuniversity science parks, and for those with previous firm ownership abroad to choose university science parks. The firms of returnees with patents from abroad enjoyed stronger employment growth in nonuniversity science parks and those with commercial experience abroad with MNCs performed better in university science parks. This evidence is consistent with the view that returning entrepreneurs seek complementary (academic and commercial) assets in their location decisions, although some inconsistencies with this view are also discussed.

Abstract: Environmental shocks can occur when emerging country governments open their markets to outside influences. We extend research conducted primarily in mature economies on how managers react to environmental shocks by evaluating how environmental shock type, a firm's strategic orientation, and its slack resources affected strategic alliance formation intentions during and immediately following the Asian Financial Crisis. Results from two Indonesian small- and medium-sized enterprises (SME) samples show that these factors influenced alliance intentions, although not always in ways that were consistent with previous research findings in more mature markets. Overall, our results provide critical insights into emerging market firms' strategic actions, particularly related to key managerial motivations for SME alliance formation.

Abstract: Foreign firms from emergent economies are increasingly seeking equity capital in developed economies like the United States. Utilizing institutional, signaling, and agency theories this research examines the legitimacy of foreign IPOs (initial public offerings) in the United States. Employing the population of foreign IPOs listed on U.S. stock exchanges between 1997 and 2004, it is demonstrated that firms from countries with governmental policies and institutional practices that protect the economic freedom of its citizens are significantly less underpriced than IPOs of firms originating from countries experiencing lower levels of economic freedom. The evidence further indicates that firms from emerging economies can overcome negative country perceptions associated with lower levels of legitimacy by increasing their international scope of operations prior to beginning the IPO process as well as by retaining acceptable levels of ownership in their respective firms.

Abstract: In this article, we sought to empirically validate an instrument for measuring country institutional profiles for the promotion of entrepreneurship in a sample of 254 business students from three emerging economies: Bulgaria, Hungary, and Latvia. Results from the confirmatory factor analysis suggest high reliability, internal consistency, and construct validity of the instrument. Further, we find important differences in the three dimensions (regulatory, cognitive, and normative) of the institutional profiles across the three emerging economies, reflecting their idiosyncratic cultural norms and values, traditions, and institutional heritage in promoting entrepreneurship. Implications for future research, managerial practice, and public policy are discussed.

Abstract: The critical role of entrepreneurial orientation (EO) in firm performance has been widely studied in the U.S. context. However, the examination of this key construct in emerging regions such as China has been very limited. In this article, we hypothesize that the relationship between EO and firm performance is best represented as curvilinear, as opposed to linear, in China. We use a two-study approach to test the link between EO and performance, as expressed in both perceptual and objective performance. Findings of both studies demonstrate an inverted U-shape relationship. Implications for future research on EO are discussed.

Abstract: With this article, as introduction to a special issue on entrepreneurship research in Europe, we hope to initiate a discussion about the importance of grounding entrepreneurship research in its national context. Different European researchers, all knowledgeable about the entrepreneurship research scene in their respective country, present the state of the research field for France, Germany, the United Kingdom (Blackburn & Smallbone, 2008); and Scandinavia. Two articles from U.S. authors complement this issue, reviewing differences in how entrepreneurship scholars measure the phenomenon and assessing the European approach(es). This special issue sets out to demonstrate the value of variety in the field—variety that very much depends on the different national, methodological, and thematic contexts entrepreneurship research takes place in.

Abstract: While recent inventories and assessments of the entrepreneurship field examine the focus, purpose, and methods, one area receiving less attention is the outcome or dependent variable. The outcome variable is of critical importance in scholarship, as it is a leading indicator of the cumulative nature of the scholarship in our field. This paper reviews 389 articles published over the past 3 years in four top entrepreneurship journals; two published in the United States and two published in Europe. It classifies the scholarship by theoretical underpinnings, independent variables, dependent variables, and then looks at the variation in these by origin of the journal. Results indicate that entrepreneurship researchers are using a wide variety of dependent variables, that the most popular unit of analysis is the firm, and that performance, broadly defined, is the most popular dependent variable. Implications for future research are discussed.

Title: Researching Small Firms and Entrepreneurship in the U.K.: Developments and Distinctiveness
Author-Name: Blackburn, Robert A.
Author-Name: Smallbone, David
Abstract: This article charts the development of research on small firms and entrepreneurship in the U.K. over the last 30 years or so and identifies distinctive characteristics of the current orientation of the research field. The paper analyses the rapid increase in the number of researchers contributing to the field over the period, together with its growing legitimacy and institutionalization. One of the key underlying themes is the rich diversity of approaches, reflecting the origins and development path, with clusters of researchers ranging from those with normative objectives to those who view the phenomenon as an object of study. Specific features of the U.K. research field identified include its policy orientation; a rich empirical tradition, with methodological diversity; an emphasis on small firms, and entrepreneurship as a subject for study, rather than an object for promotion; aspects of the boundaries and language of small business and entrepreneurship research; and pre-paradigmatic and middle range theory development i.e., somewhere between grand theory and empirical findings.

Abstract: This article explores entrepreneurship research in Germany, paying particular attention to its origins and current “re-emergence.” Since the late 1990s, the field has gained ground, as is reflected in an increasing number of entrepreneurship chairs at universities, and the establishment of an annual national entrepreneurship conference. A particular strength of the German approach to researching entrepreneurship, which can be traced back directly to the historical roots, is found to be its consideration of context specificity and embeddedness, going hand-in-hand with a strong multidisciplinary tendency. These are two features where entrepreneurship research in Germany could add a distinctive flavor to the current mainstream debate. In practice, the diffusion of this perspective is inhibited by an insufficient exchange with the international scientific community.

Title: Nordic Entrepreneurship Research
Author-Name: Hjorth, Daniel
Abstract: This article describes and discusses Nordic entrepreneurship research (NER). It does so by providing a broader context for conducting entrepreneurship research, including historical, sociocultural, and disciplinary elements substantiating an understanding of “Nordic.” Contextualizing NER this way, we attempt for the article to do what it says, i.e., to also write here in a style we argue is characteristically Nordic. This includes a priority to the local and particular, and a subsequent focus on questions resonant with nominalist research. We thereby enable an experience of NER as a cultural practice, as we argue that this is a crucial part of understanding what it is. Drawing on a tracing of NER in journal publications (in between 2001 and 2005), the article identifies trends and tendencies. We identify three generations of entrepreneurship research and suggest directions for the future development of the third. This way, the discussion and conclusions are drawn toward images of what a Nordic entrepreneurship research might become.

Title: The Nature and Focus of Entrepreneurship Research in France over the Last Decade: A French Touch?
Author-Name: Lasch, Frank
Author-Name: Yami, Saïd
Abstract: This article gives an overview of the specificities of entrepreneurship research in France, paying attention to its emergence, nature, and focus. Reviewing 253 articles and conference papers from two journals and two conferences, considered main outlets for research outcomes from French scholars, our findings reveal a distinctive “French touch” of entrepreneurship research. The main facets we were able to identify with our data for the 1995 to 2005 period are as follows. There is a preference for qualitative methods, conceptual contributions, and the entrepreneurial process as privileged research theme. A particular strength of the French approach is also a strong focus of small and medium-sized organizations. The “French touch” of entrepreneurship research could make a distinctive contribution to the international research community and the mainstream debate. However, mainly French-speaking dissemination of knowledge and (still) insufficient international journal-oriented output strategies limit the diffusion of French entrepreneurship research. Implications for academic institutions and future research are discussed.

Title: The Influence of Top Management Team Heterogeneity on the Capital Raised through an Initial Public Offering
Author-Name: Zimmerman, Monica A.
Abstract: A significant body of research exists on the top management teams (TMTs) of established firms and specifically on the heterogeneity of TMTs of established firms. Little research exists, however, on the heterogeneity of TMTs of firms in the early stages of their existence. In this study, I examine the relationship among TMT heterogeneity and the capital raised by the firm through its initial public offering (IPO). I argue that TMT heterogeneity provides a signal to potential investors about the quality of the IPO and hence is associated with greater capital accumulations. My findings suggest that heterogeneity in the TMT's functional background and educational background is associated with greater capital raised through an IPO.

Abstract: In this paper we illustrate how boundary theory can be a useful perspective to understand the dynamics of family businesses. We integrate insights from the family business literature with the work–family and identity boundary literatures to describe degrees of integration between the family and business identities in family firms and outline contingencies that influence this integration. We also develop the notion of “differential permeability” as a state of being both integrated and segmented on various aspects of identity and articulate costs and benefits to this state, as well as to high integration and high segmentation. Finally, we invoke the research on “boundary work” as a means of managing family business boundaries and conclude by outlining additional avenues of research that stem from using such a boundary theory lens.

Abstract: This study addresses the role of small business managers’ growth motivation for business growth, taking into account the important effects of previous motives and feedback from earlier performance. We hypothesize that small business managers’ growth motivation has a unique influence on firm outcome measured as growth in sales and in number of employees. Data were gathered from two different Swedish samples of small firms using telephone interviews. Using cross-lagged regression analysis, we find support for our hypotheses when examining employment growth, but only partial support when examining sales.

Title: Venture Capitalists' Evaluations of Start‐Up Teams: Trade‐Offs, Knock‐Out Criteria, and the Impact of VC Experience
Author-Name: Franke, Nikolaus
Author-Name: Gruber, Marc

Author-Name: Henkel, Joachim
Abstract: The start-up team plays a key role in venture capitalists' evaluations of venture proposals. Our findings go beyond existing research, first by providing a detailed exploration of VCs' team evaluation criteria, and second by investigating the moderator variable of VC experience. Our results reveal utility trade-offs between team characteristics and thus provide answers to questions such as “What strength does it take to compensate for a weakness in characteristic A?” Moreover, our analysis reveals that novice VCs tend to focus on the qualifications of individual team members, while experienced VCs focus more on team cohesion. Data were obtained in a conjoint experiment with 51 professionals in VC firms and analyzed using discrete choice econometric models.

Title: The Role of Human Capital in Loan Officers' Decision Policies

Abstract: Using a human-capital perspective and the similarity-attraction paradigm, we examine the role of general and specific human capital in the decision policies of 114 Swedish loan officers in their assessments of small-business loan requests. We found that human capital characteristics had marginal impact on decision policy contingencies and that specific human capital had no significant influence on the probability of loan approval. However, we did find that the similarity between the loan officers' human capital and the applicants' human capital was a significant indicator of loan approval. The findings offer interesting insight into the heterogeneity of loan decision processes and outcomes and future research opportunities are suggested.

Title: Entrepreneurial Orientation and Growth of SMEs: A Causal Model
Author-Name: Moreno, Ana M.
Author-Name: Casillas, José C.
Abstract: The literature existing on entrepreneurship implicitly assumes that entrepreneurial orientation (EO) and growth orientation are positively related with each other. However, few studies, whether theoretical or empirical, analyze such relation in an explicit manner. Instead, most previous works have focused on the EO-performance relation, even though growth and profitability do not always correlate positively. This work has been carried out on a sample of 434 SMEs, and contributes two novelties with regard to previous research: (1) the analysis focuses on the EO-growth relation; and (2) it uses a flexible method (Partial Least Squares) which allows the study of several simultaneous relationships. The results reveal the complexity of the relationships between EO, strategy, environment, resources and growth.

Author-Name: Wu, Lei‐Yu
Author-Name: Wang, Chun‐Ju

Author-Name: Pan, Lee‐Yun
Abstract: This study explores the performance implications of internal resources and external networks for entrepreneurial firms. A relationship of trust among network members is essential because of the high risk during the initial start-up stage. However, once high-tech firms initiate mass production and enter the growth stage, whether trust influences competitiveness more than resources becomes uncertain. This study examines Taiwanese firms to elucidate the main influences on firm competitiveness. In conclusion, the result indicates the competitiveness of high-tech firms during the growth stage is determined by firm resources and the willingness of support firms to cooperate—where willingness is determined by the trust of the support firms in the high-tech firm but is unrelated to firm resources.

Title: How International is Entrepreneurship?
Author-Name: Gamboa, Ernesto C.
Author-Name: Brouthers, Lance Eliot
Abstract: Nine major entrepreneurship, international business (IB), and management journals used by the Financial Times to rank business schools were examined to see if the amount of international entrepreneurship (IE) research published in major entrepreneurship, IB, and management journals is increasing over time. Findings from two time periods spaced a decade apart indicate that although IE content more than doubled in the entrepreneurship journals, only a modest increase occurred in the international business journals and no increase occurred in the management journals. We proposed and found that: (1) entrepreneurship journals tend to favor replication studies while IB and management journals prefer nonreplications; and (2) because replication is straightforward while nonreplication is more difficult to conceptualize and execute, there are many more replication than nonreplication IE studies. As a result, IE studies appear more frequently in entrepreneurship journals. Managerial and scholarly implications are discussed.

Abstract: The formation of family firms, as well as their scale and scope, is likely to be influenced by the characteristics of the environment. This study presents preliminary findings on the relationship between economic development and the prevalence of family vs. nonfamily firms in the United States. We use three samples consisting of 15,918 firms aggregated at the state level and two methods of estimating the proportion of family businesses in each state. Our results indicate that regardless of the method of estimation, there is a negative relationship between the proportion of family firms in a state and gross state product per capita. Implications and research directions are provided.

Title: A Contingent Model of Network Utilization in Early Financing of Technology Ventures
Author-Name: Zhang, Jing

Author-Name: Wong, Poh‐kam
Abstract: Most of the entrepreneurship literature has addressed the benefits and necessity of using social network ties as opposed to market methods in early venture finance, but it has largely understated the potential limitations and costs of doing so. Specifically, very sparse research has examined the factors that influence entrepreneurs' choice between using networks versus market methods. In this study, we propose a contingent model of network utilization when approaching initial investors, based on the dimensions of human capital of the entrepreneurs. We test this model with primary field survey data from 226 new high-tech ventures in Singapore and Beijing. The results show that high occupational status and relevant industrial work experience are positively associated with the entrepreneurs' propensity to utilize existing networks by enhancing the resourcefulness of their network ties (social capital); however, such influences are alleviated by entrepreneurs' marketing or managerial experience, which increases the entrepreneurs' ability to interact with strangers (an aspect of social competence).

Abstract: This study presents a theoretical concept called the collaborative network orientation (CNO) and tests it using a sample of male and female small business owners. The CNO is based on (1) research that indicates female managers prefer to organize in cooperative network relationships and (2) conflict theory that indicates collaboration is preferred for both building relationships and achieving goals. Empirical tests revealed that female owners had a stronger preference for a CNO. A CNO was associated with business success for all owners, but it was significantly more positively associated with success for male business owners.

Title: Entrepreneurial Orientation, Learning Orientation, and Firm Performance
Author-Name: Wang, Catherine L.
Abstract: Entrepreneurial orientation (EO) is a key ingredient for firm success. Nonetheless, an important message from past findings is that simply examining the direct effect of EO on firm performance provides an incomplete picture. Prior studies examined various internal and external factors that influence the EO–performance relationship. However, learning orientation (LO) has been a missing link in the examination of the relationship. Using data from 213 medium-to-large UK firms, this study finds that LO mediates the EO-performance relationship, and the EO–LO–performance link is stronger for prospectors than analyzers. The findings indicate that LO must be in place to maximize the effect of EO on performance, and that LO is an important dimension, along with EO, to distinguish prospectors from analyzers.

Title: The Role of Perceived Relational Support in Entrepreneur–Customer Dyads
Author-Name: De Clercq, Dirk
Author-Name: Rangarajan, Deva
Abstract: Drawing from social exchange theory and the marketing literature, we posit that entrepreneurs' commitment to and satisfaction with a customer depends on the extent to which they believe the customer is willing to provide strong support to entrepreneurs in their role as suppliers. We tested the hypotheses among 217 entrepreneurs in a Western European country and found that entrepreneurs' perceptions of relational support relate positively to their commitment to and satisfaction with the customer. In turn, the reliability and quality of the exchanges that took place between entrepreneurs and the customer affected their perceptions of relational support, as well as their attitudes through perceived relational support. We thus identify a key mechanism that explains relationship outcomes in entrepreneur–customer dyads. We discuss the implications and limitations of our findings and provide directions for further research.

Title: Perceived Institutional Ambiguity and the Choice of Organizational Form in Social Entrepreneurial Ventures
Author-Name: Townsend, David M.
Author-Name: Hart, Timothy A.
Abstract: Social entrepreneurship (SE) is emerging as a common approach to meeting social needs. However, SE founders appear to be organizing under both for-profit and nonprofit organizational forms to engage in essentially the same activities. We investigate this lack of consistency regarding the choice of organizational form by examining two possible explanations: a difference in motivational goals among social entrepreneurs or perceived ambiguity regarding trends in core dimensions of the institutional environment. Overall, we argue that founder perceptions of an ambiguous institutional environment are leading to the variance in choice of organizational form for SE ventures. Both theoretical and practical directions for future research are discussed as well.

Title: Portfolio Entrepreneurship: Habitual and Novice Founders, New Entry, and Mode of Organizing
Author-Name: Wiklund, Johan
Author-Name: Shepherd, Dean A.
Abstract: With the purpose of advancing our understanding of portfolio entrepreneurship, we separate the act of entrepreneurship (new entry) from its mode or organizing (internal vs. independent organization). Analyzing a cohort of 2,253 novice and habitual business founders, we find that portfolio entrepreneurship is a common phenomenon and that the majority of portfolio entrepreneurs use the internal mode of organizing. Whether or not business founders subsequently pursue portfolio entrepreneurship is explained by their human capital (education and start-up experience) and social capital (business networks and links with government support agencies). Further, novice entrepreneurs are more likely to organize portfolio entrepreneurship within their existing firms while habitual entrepreneurs more often organize subsequent acts of portfolio entrepreneurship by creating another new independent organization. Implications for entrepreneurship research are discussed.

Abstract: In their article on entrepreneurship, effectuation, and over-trust, Goel and Karri suggest relationships between effectuation, over-trust, and certain psychological characteristics of entrepreneurs. In this response we debate their article. Goel and Karri are correct in claiming that effectuation supposes over-trust. However, we argue that effectual logic works in a different way than they presented because it neither predicts nor assumes trust. Goel and Karri's article also draws attention to the behavioral assumptions underlying constructs such as over-(under) trust. Our suggestion is that effectuation is based on alternative behavioral assumptions that open up interesting avenues for future research in entrepreneurship.

Abstract: In their response to our article, Sarasvathy and Dew (S&D) agree with us that effectuation supposes over-trust and yet claim that trust is irrelevant to an effectual entrepreneur. They further claim that our approach to entrepreneurship is trait based. We respond to these comments by pointing out the more subtle ways in which entrepreneurs deal with trust. In addition, while acknowledging the utility (and limitations) of a trait-based approach in advancing entrepreneurship theory, we refute their assertions that our paper is based on this approach. Finally, we address the “alternate” behavioral assumptions that S&D advance. Independent of the merit of these alternate assumptions, they are not contradicted in our article. We believe that these assumptions need to be developed further to contribute to a debate on their merits for advancing theory building in entrepreneurship.

Abstract: We set forth the attributes of forgiving business models that entrepreneurs can use to minimize losses while exploiting ideas to launch new ventures. Venture ideas possessing these attributes have greater potential because they can shift risk to resource providers. Thus, the success of a venture partially depends on the market conditions for others, which affects how an opportunity can be exploited. We emphasize combinations of outside options for resource providers together with their market interaction costs. Finally, we discuss the contributions of this research for entrepreneurs, its theoretical implications, and future research possibilities.

Title: The Role of Government Policy on Entrepreneurial Activity: Productive, Unproductive, or Destructive?
Author-Name: Minniti, Maria
Abstract: This paper serves as an introduction to the special issue of Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice on government policy and entrepreneurial activity. Entrepreneurship is an important engine of growth. Government policy, in turn, shapes the institutional environment in which entrepreneurial decisions are made. Thus, government policy is important for entrepreneurship. But what policies are more conducive to productive entrepreneurship? In spite of a significant amount of work on this and related topics, there is still much we do not know about this important relationship. After reviewing recent literature on entrepreneurship policy, this paper summarizes the contributions included in this volume and puts them in the context of the ongoing research debate. The goal of the special issue is to address important unanswered questions and trigger a constructive debate among diverging views.

Title: Innovation Policy and Nanotechnology Entrepreneurship
Author-Name: Woolley, Jennifer L.
Author-Name: Rottner, Renee M.
Abstract: In this article, we explore the relationship between innovation policy and new venture creation in the United States. Specifically, we examine two components of innovation policy in nanotechnology—science and technology (S&T) initiatives and economic initiatives—and their relationship with the founding of nanotechnology firms. We find strong support relating new firm formation to S&T and economic initiatives. States with both S&T and economic initiatives had six times as many firms founded than those states without such initiatives. We also find evidence of a first-mover advantage as states with the earliest innovation policies had higher rates of related firm foundings over time. These findings suggest that states that are most attractive to entrepreneurs not only pursue technological innovation and provide resources, but also encourage and legitimize commercial development. Implications for public policy makers and scholars are provided.

Abstract: Regional economic development policy is recognized as a key tool governments use to foster economic prosperity. Whether specialization (or diversity) of economic activities should be a regional development policy goal is often debated. We address this question in a local-diversity context, by reviewing traditional arguments in its favor, supplemented with evidence for more entrepreneurial concepts like industrial symbiosis and Jacobs externalities. We show that the context of entrepreneurship matters more to policy than the type and form of resulting industries. Policies enabling entrepreneurs to exploit opportunities in a context of spontaneously evolved industrial diversity are better facilitators of regional development.

Title: Governance and the Entrepreneurial Economy: A Comparative Analysis of Three Regions
Author-Name: Parker, Rachel
Abstract: The increasing number of regional concentrations of entrepreneurial activities and the shift of government–business relations to regional contexts have rendered regional governance arrangements of increasing importance. Drawing on the extensive literature on comparative models of national economic governance, this paper identifies three regional governance models: partnership, state–institutional coordination, and fragmentation. The three models are explored in the context of the entrepreneurial economy in three regions. The paper finds that regional governance arrangements differ from national varieties in the partnership and in the state–institutional models but not in the fragmented model. The difference is shown to involve the types of actors participating in governance arrangements and the types of economic activities promoted by the political–institutional context.

Title: Economic Freedom and Service Industry Growth in the United States
Author-Name: Gohmann, Stephan F.

Author-Name: McCrickard, Myra
Abstract: The growth of an economy depends upon entrepreneurial activities leading to the formation of new businesses and the production of new goods and services. In turn, institutions influence entrepreneurial activity. Public policy is an attribute of the institutions under which entrepreneurs operate. One element of the institutional environment is the degree of economic freedom under which entrepreneurs form and operate their business activities. The degree of economic freedom affects not only profit opportunities for entrepreneurs, but also the level and the type of economic activities they pursue. We examine how the entrepreneurial activity and level of employment in U.S. service industries respond to changes in the degree of economic freedom among states. Our findings suggest that the relationship between entrepreneurial outcomes and economic freedom varies significantly by industry. In some industries, such as business and personal services, increases in economic freedom lead to growth in the number of firms and the level of employment. However, the reverse is true for other industries, such as health, social, and legal services.

Title: Economic Freedom and the Motivation to Engage in Entrepreneurial Action

Author-Name: Palich, Leslie E.
Abstract: Using institutional theory, the Heritage Foundation/Wall Street Journal 2003 Index of Economic Freedom, and the 2002 Global Entrepreneurship Monitor, we regress opportunity-motivated entrepreneurial activity (OME) and necessity-motivated entrepreneurial activity (NME) on 10 factors of economic freedom and gross domestic product (GDP) per capita for 37 nations. We find that both OME and NME are negatively associated with GDP per capita and positively associated with labor freedom, but that various other factors of economic freedom are uniquely related to either OME or NME. Specifically, we find that OME, but not NME, is positively associated with property rights, while NME, but not OME, is positively associated with fiscal freedom and monetary freedom. Thus, governmental restrictions of economic freedom appear to impact entrepreneurial activity differently depending on the particular freedom restricted by government and the entrepreneur's motive for engaging in entrepreneurial action.

Abstract: Despite major policies surrounding economic integration among countries (e.g., the European Union [EU], North Atlantic Free Trade Area, and Mercosur), the theoretical and empirical research addressing the impact of such policies on various countries' entrepreneurial activities has yet to fully emerge. To address this issue, this paper draws on institutional, economic, and entrepreneurship literatures to examine if two specific economic integration mechanisms, namely market and currency commonality, increase cross-border venture capital flows made by participating nations in the EU. Findings suggest that broad scale economic integration policies do influence the extent of foreign venture capital investments made into other member countries.

Title: Computable Entrepreneurship
Author-Name: Koppl, Roger
Abstract: The mathematics of “computable economics” proves that entrepreneurship policy is unlikely to succeed if it presumes policy makers can replace the unplanned results of the entrepreneurial market process with ex ante judgments about which enterprises are best. It is mathematically impossible for policy makers or their assignees to make the required computations of opportunity costs. Some business professors dream of finding a grand algorithm that will allow them to guide entrepreneurial decisions and to judge in advance which decisions are good and which bad. The logic of computable economics, however, reveals this dream to be a form of magical thinking.

Abstract: An important distinction between family and nonfamily firms and among different types of family firms is the manner in which strategy is formulated and implemented. These differences in strategic behaviors can cause variations in firm performance. Understanding the nature of these differences and how the family form of organization drives them therefore contributes to the development of a strategic management theory of the family firm, a unifying theme of the series of special issues published in Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice to date. This article briefly reflects on the progress made in understanding the strategic differences of family firms in this ongoing series and discusses the contributions of the articles and commentaries contained in this fifth special issue on theories of family enterprise.

Title: Toward a Theory of Familiness: A Social Capital Perspective
Author-Name: Pearson, Allison W.
Author-Name: Carr, Jon C.
Author-Name: Shaw, John C.
Abstract: In the search for ways in which the family firm context is unique to organizational science, the construct of “familiness” has been identified and defined as resources and capabilities that are unique to the family's involvement and interactions in the business. While identification and isolation of a construct unique to family firms is both groundbreaking and important for family firm research, it is also important that the development of the construct continues to be examined from complementing theoretical viewpoints. As such, we set out to review the development of the familiness construct and identify its dimensions. We also explore the nomological relationships of the construct based on a social capital theory perspective and offer a theory of familiness.

Title: The Role of Family Influence in Firms' Strategic Responses to Threat of Imitation
Author-Name: Sirmon, David G.

Author-Name: Webb, Justin W.
Abstract: We integrate theory on the resource-based view and threat rigidity with family business research to explain the role family influence plays in responding to threats of imitation. As opposed to family control, we find that family influence affects resource management actions taken in response to threats of imitation. Specifically, results show that R&D investment and internationalization actions mediate the relationship between imitability and performance. However, we find that family-influenced firms are less rigid in their responses to such threats, reducing R&D and internationalization significantly less than firms without family influence.

Abstract: In this commentary, we extend Sirmon, Arregle, Hitt, and Webb's work in this issue by introducing shared mental models as antecedents of threat of imitability recognition and as moderators of the relationship between threat recognition and strategic action. Specifically, while Sirmon, Arregle, Hitt, and Webb focus on responses to threat recognition, we develop propositions on how shared mental models related to business issues affect the threat recognition process and on how shared mental models related to family issues influence strategic responses to recognized threats. Implications and areas for future research are discussed.

Title: Affiliate Directors and Perceived Risk Bearing in Publicly Traded, Family‐Controlled Firms: The Case of Diversification
Author-Name: Jones, Carla D.
Author-Name: Makri, Marianna
Author-Name: Gomez‐Mejia, Luis R.
Abstract: The present study examines the influence exerted by affiliate directors in the diversification decisions of family-controlled, publicly traded firms. Using a relational view based on the development of social capital, we argue that affiliate directors play a different role in boards of family firms vis-à-vis nonfamily firms. Specifically, we develop a set of hypotheses proposing that affiliate directors stimulate family firms to pursue diversification strategies by sharing their knowledge and experience with family executives, and hence reducing the perceived risk that may be associated with growth strategies. Affiliates can play this advisory role without reducing the control of family owners, and this facilitates the firm's willingness to adopt growth-oriented strategies. Namely, affiliates who are business experts or support specialists would tend to encourage diversification. These effects are supported empirically.

Title: Commentary: The Servant, the Parasite, and the Enigma: A Tale of Three Ownership Structures and Their Affiliate Directors
Author-Name: Combs, James G.
Abstract: In private family firms, affiliate directors are largely resource-providing servants of the family. In nonfamily public firms with dispersed ownership, affiliates are, figuratively speaking, symbiotic parasites loyally supporting their professional management hosts while extracting revenues for their home firms. The public family firm stands somewhere between and the affiliate directors in such firms are consequently an enigma. Jones, Makri, and Gomez-Mejia compare affiliate directors in public family firms with those in public nonfamily firms and find that they positively influence diversification strategy only in public family firms. They interpret this outcome as evidence that affiliate directors in public family firms act like the servants found in private family firms. I offer an alternative interpretation by suggesting that affiliate directors in public family firms are more successful versions of their parasitic cousins in public nonfamily firms. I draw attention to the Janus-headed nature of these directors to underscore why it is useful to study public family firms as a distinct ownership structure.

Abstract: The ability of family firms to identify and respond to changes in their external environments can be a key source of competitive advantage leading to success and survival. Some research, however, has suggested family firms are conservative and often lack the ability to adapt to their changing competitive environments. Using data from 248 family firms, we found a family firm's culture of commitment to the business is positively associated with its strategic flexibility—the ability to pursue new opportunities and respond to threats in the competitive environment. Further, we found stewardship-oriented organizational culture positively moderated the family commitment-strategic flexibility relationship.

Author-Name: Eddleston, Kimberly A.
Abstract: This commentary considers the role of the founder in establishing a family firm's culture. Drawing from transformational leadership theory, it is argued that a founder who displays transformational leadership behaviors may be more likely to establish a family firm culture that reflects family commitment, stewardship, and strategic flexibility. As such, this commentary extends the article by Zahra, Hayton, Neubaum, Dibrell, and Craig by linking stewardship theory with transformational leadership theory, and viewing family firm culture as an intervening mechanism between leadership behaviors and strategic flexibility.

Title: Unleashing the Relationship Power of Family Firms: Identity Confirmation as a Catalyst for Performance
Author-Name: Milton, Laurie P.
Abstract: This paper adopts a broad perspective on identity and identity relations and argues that family businesses can develop identity confirmation as a unique, hard to imitate competitive resource that unleashes and leverages the relational capabilities that differentiate them from nonfamily businesses. A person's identities are “confirmed” in a business, to the extent they are supported therein. Identity and identity confirmation research is marshaled to consider the impact of identity confirmation on succession. Implications for other relational challenges family businesses face are explored. The potential for family business research to contribute to a general theory of the firm is illustrated.

Title: Commentary and Extension: Moderating the Outcome of Identity Confirmation in Family Firms
Author-Name: Klein, Sabine B.
Abstract: In this commentary, I provide suggestions for further refining the way we view and apply the identity confirmation concept to family businesses. I distinguish different family types, such as the core family, the extended family, the patchwork family, and the multigenerational kinship family. In addition, I concentrate on crucial life cycle points in the sense that a business family stays and works together usually much longer than any other work-related group. From a dynamic perspective, certain opportunities and risks in applying the identity confirmation concept become obvious for families in family businesses. Different moderating variables might distinguish whether identity confirmation results in positive or negative outcomes. These moderators point to important future research projects in the area of family business.

Title: Examining the Link Between “Familiness” and Performance: Can the F‐PEC Untangle the Family Business Theory Jungle?
Author-Name: Rutherford, Matthew W.
Author-Name: Kuratko, Donald F.
Author-Name: Holt, Daniel T.
Abstract: Family business research appears to be caught in a “jungle” of competing theories in regards to familiness and performance. This study provides a further empirical examination into that relationship. We employ a family influence scale (the familiness-power, experience, and culture scale [F-PEC]) presented by Klein, Astrachan, and Smyrnios in an attempt to assess the relationship between familiness and performance in 831 family businesses. The resulting regression analysis adds to the current state of the literature by demonstrating significant and interesting results. Specifically, familiness showed associations with revenue, capital structure, growth, and perceived performance; however, the relationships were both positive and negative, thus casting doubt upon the F-PEC as a vehicle for untangling the jungle. We conclude with discussion and implications.

Abstract: This paper examines the papers presented at the 2007 Theories of Family Enterprise Conference for their applicability to practice and presents some ideas to make family business research more appropriate to practitioners. In general, we found the papers are not immediately useful to practitioners; however, the papers of a theory conference should not necessarily be immediately useful to practitioners. We identify several areas for future research, which include the development of a concrete definition for family business, a thorough analysis of the positive and negative effects of the concept of familiness, a close look at failed family business, as well as other issues.

Title: Strategic Entrepreneurship: Exploring Different Perspectives of an Emerging Concept
Author-Name: Kuratko, Donald F.
Author-Name: Audretsch, David B.
Abstract: Within the entrepreneurship and strategic management domains there has been a movement by scholars to combine certain aspects of both areas to create a new concept of strategic entrepreneurship. To date, however, there remains much to know about what constitutes this concept. This special issue is the result of a unique research conference in Germany where some of the world's most renowned scholars gathered to explore this concept in depth. The set of articles in this special issue examine different perspectives that relate to strategic entrepreneurship and we believe contribute to the growing body of knowledge on this concept by examining diverse scholarly topics. This introduction provides the overview of the perspectives contained in strategic entrepreneurship and argues for the importance of embracing diverse views at this stage rather than attempting to restrict the analysis of this emerging topic.

Abstract: Our knowledge of corporate entrepreneurship (CE) continues to expand. However, this knowledge remains quite fragmented and non-cumulative. Herein, we conceptualize CE strategy as a useful focal point for integrating and synthesizing key elements within CE's intellectual domain. The components of our CE strategy model include (1) the antecedents of CE strategy (i.e., individual entrepreneurial cognitions of the organization's members and external environmental conditions that invite entrepreneurial activity), (2) the elements of CE strategy (i.e., top management's entrepreneurial strategic vision for the firm, organizational architectures that encourage entrepreneurial processes and behavior, and the generic forms of entrepreneurial process that are reflected in entrepreneurial behavior), and (3) the outcomes of CE strategy (i.e., organizational outcomes resulting from entrepreneurial actions, including the development of competitive capability and strategic repositioning). We discuss how our model contributes to the CE literature, distinguish our model from prior models, and identify challenges future CE research should address.

Abstract: Autonomy is an important component of an entrepreneurial orientation (EO), but most studies that assess the EO construct do not include autonomy measures. This article first addresses the theoretical relevance of autonomy as an element of firm-level entrepreneurial behavior. After a review of existing autonomy measures, it then proposes scale items to test the autonomy dimension of EO. Finally, it reports the results of two studies of the proposed autonomy scale and addresses implications for future EO-related autonomy research.

Abstract: How do managers and staff react to strategic entrepreneurship? How can we minimize resulting job stress and maximize employee retention? We surveyed 1,975 managers and staff in 110 departments of a diversified healthcare organization on department-level entrepreneurial orientation (EO) (e.g., risk taking, proactiveness, and innovativeness), degree of role ambiguity in their job, and their strength of intention to quit. After validating manager and staff reports of EO, we estimated structural equation models for managers and staff. Our results demonstrate that strategic entrepreneurship can impact management and staff differently and thus requires a correspondingly customized design philosophy.

Title: Are We Comparing Apples With Apples or Apples With Oranges? Appropriateness of Knowledge Accumulation Across Growth Studies
Author-Name: Shepherd, Dean
Author-Name: Wiklund, Johan
Abstract: Although knowledge accumulation is dependent upon relationships among constructs being robust across different measurement and sampling decisions, scholars have not sufficiently established such robustness for the construct of firm growth. Focusing on this construct, we conduct analyses on all Swedish firms incorporated during the 1994 to 1998 period (68,830 firms) and track their growth (or demise) over their first 6 years of existence. Although we typically find low shared variance between different growth measures, there is variability such that some measures demonstrate high and/or moderate concurrent validity. These findings have implications for how we delineate the boundaries of firm growth research and accumulate knowledge—when we are comparing apples with apples and when we are comparing apples with oranges.

Title: Performance Configurations Over Time: Implications for Growth‐ and Profit‐Oriented Strategies
Author-Name: Steffens, Paul
Author-Name: Davidsson, Per
Author-Name: Fitzsimmons, Jason
Abstract: Strategic entrepreneurship can be described as simultaneous opportunity seeking and advantage seeking. Younger firms are generally more flexible and therefore enjoy “discovery advantages,” whereas established firms tend to be resource rich and more experienced and consequently enjoy “exploitation advantages.” The resulting evolution of the two important performance dimensions, “growth” and “profitability,” by firm age is not well understood. In this article we integrate several theoretical arguments concerning profit–growth relationships to develop a dynamic model of firm development, which suggests different development pathways for young firms. This leads to several unidirectional, competing hypotheses that we examine by studying the profitability-growth configurations of approximately 3,500 small firms and how these configurations evolve over time. We find that for both young and old firms a focus on achieving above-average profitability and then striving for growth is a more likely path toward achieving sustained above-average performance than is first pursuing strong growth in the hope of building profitability later. In line with our hypothesis we find that younger firms are over represented as “Stars” (high on both growth and profitability) and underrepresented as “Poor” (low on both growth and profitability). However, young firms in the “Star” category are also less likely than their older counterparts to maintain that position. Furthermore, our results indicate that young firms are overrepresented not only among “Stars,” but also among growth-orientated firms, regardless of the level of profitability. The findings strongly caution against the blind pursuit of growth for young firms, in favor of a thoughtful analysis of how both growth and profitability might be developed by firms. The results also question whether simultaneous high performance in terms of growth and profitability among young firms usually reflects a successful entrepreneurial strategy. The results can also be interpreted as luck on the part of a subgroup of young firms who indiscriminately pursue growth opportunities with varying profit prospects, and in many cases, the high growth–profit performance will be short lived.

Title: Agency and Governance in Strategic Entrepreneurship
Author-Name: Audretsch, David B.
Author-Name: Lehmann, Erik E.
Author-Name: Plummer, Lawrence A.
Abstract: This paper aims to highlight the opportunity to contribute to our understanding of strategic entrepreneurship by exploring the construct through the lens of agency theory. In particular, we claim a fundamental link between a new venture's control of critical resources and the distribution of equity between the principal and agent. According to agency theory, assigning top executives ownership in the firm provides arrangements that are compatible with the incentives of the owners of the firm. This paper suggests that agency theory has special relevance when considered in a strategic entrepreneurship context. This is because the function of managers in entrepreneurial new ventures is fundamentally different from their counterparts in large established, incumbent corporations. While both types of managers have to provide managerial and organizational expertise, managers in entrepreneurial new ventures have an additional function that is essential to the competitive advantage and performance of the new venture—providing knowledge and human capital, which, in many cases, is intrinsically linked to the capital resources of the new venture. Our framework is tested using patent ownership as a proxy for both relationship-specific investments and indispensable human capital of the top manager of the new venture. The empirical results support the main hypotheses posited by the entrepreneurial governance model. In particular, patent ownership of the top manager significantly increases the percentage of equity held, while the number of patents held by the firm significantly decreases the percentage of ownership.

Author-Name: Holcomb, Tim R.

Author-Name: Hitt, Michael A.
Abstract: We extend existing theories of entrepreneurial learning and highlight the effects of heuristics under two different learning contexts: experiential learning and vicarious learning. Specifically, we argue that heuristics are consequential in explaining variations in learning. In some cases, heuristics can be highly adaptive and beneficial to the accumulation of knowledge. In others, they can distort judgments and bias learning. By considering linkages among heuristics, knowledge, and action, we seek to provide a more complete model of entrepreneurial learning that allows for examination of the influence of judgments on learning and to expose conditions that can benefit or limit effective action in an entrepreneurial setting.

Abstract: Resource complementarity increases the potential value of alliances and acquisitions, but the extent to which the value potential of an alliance or an acquisition becomes realized depends on the ability of the firm to discover and conduct productive resource combinations. Using a sample of 319 small firms, we separate domestic from international alliances and acquisitions and show that alliances and acquisitions bring limited benefits to firms unless deliberate effort is devoted to resource combination. These findings help resolve conflicts in the resource-based literature concerning the benefits of alliances and acquisitions.

Abstract: Agency theory has focused on buyouts as a governance and control device to increase profitability, organizational efficiency, and limited attention to growth. A strategic entrepreneurship view of buyouts incorporates upside incentives for value creation associated with growth as well as efficiency gains. In this paper, we develop the complementarity between agency theory and strategic entrepreneurship perspectives to examine the performance implications for different types of buyouts. Further, we study how the involvement of private equity (PE) firms is related to the performance of the post-buyout firm. These issues are examined for a sample of 238 PE-backed buyouts in the UK between 1993 and 2003. Implications for theory and practice are suggested.

Author-Name: Schindehutte, Minet
Author-Name: Morris, Michael H.
Abstract: Five areas are identified wherein more development might enhance the current model of strategic entrepreneurship (SE): exploration–exploitation, opportunity, newness, micro–macro interaction, and dynamics. Complexity science is presented as an alternative theoretical lens for addressing these issues, and enhancing the potential of SE in a world characterized by fluctuations, irreversibility, nonlinearity, and instabilities. Using this lens, a rearticulation of SE is proposed that centers on the notion of an opportunity space and a paradigm built around forms, flows, and functions. SE's domain consists of a complex set of phenomena that cannot be neatly bundled according to disciplinary boundaries.

Abstract: While venture capital has received a tremendous amount of attention, prior research has predominantly looked at venture capital firms (VCFs) post raising their first fund. In this paper, we move the point of analysis back further and ask what type of founding team experience best predicts VCF success, controlling for firm strategy, firm size, and the environment upon which the firm was born. Empirical results show that venture capital, senior management, and consulting experience aids VCF success, while entrepreneurial experience impedes it. None of the control variables affect a VCF's ability to raise subsequent funds.

Title: Strategic Entrepreneurship at Universities: Academic Entrepreneurs' Assessment of Policy Programs
Author-Name: Patzelt, Holger
Author-Name: Shepherd, Dean A.
Abstract: In this article we draw on goal-setting theory to analyze how and why entrepreneurs perceive the usefulness of policy programs aimed at facilitating the development of academic ventures. Using a conjoint study and data on 3,136 assessments nested within 98 academic entrepreneurs, we find that access to finance offered by a policy program is central and enhances the entrepreneurs' perceived benefits of other policy measures such as providing access to nonfinancial resources (networks, business knowledge) and reducing administrative burdens, but diminishes the perceived benefits of offering tax incentives for new ventures. Our results extend the literature on academic entrepreneurship and entrepreneurs' assessments of government policy measures. For policy makers, our study suggests that the simultaneous launch of policy measures may be perceived by academic entrepreneurs as particularly beneficial for fostering the development of their young ventures.

Title: An Agency Theoretic Analysis of the Professionalized Family Firm
Author-Name: Chua, Jess H.
Author-Name: Chrisman, James J.
Author-Name: Bergiel, Erich B.
Abstract: The professionalized firm must evaluate the performance of managers and provide incentives that will motivate them to achieve the firm's goals. Using the agency theoretic framework we develop propositions on how differences in goals, altruistic tendencies, and strategic time horizons might affect performance evaluation and incentive compensation in family firms that employ both family and nonfamily managers and how these differences would affect the performance of the professionalized family firms relative to that of nonfamily firms.

Title: Residential Segregation Influences on the Likelihood of Ethnic Self‐Employment
Author-Name: Fairchild, Gregory B.
Abstract: Geographic and environmental influences on economic action have a long history in managerial research. This paper develops and estimates a model of the potential of a broad set of U.S. racial minority groups to enter self-employment based on individual-level, household-level, and metropolitan area-level factors. The model allows for an analysis of two distinct residential segregation processes on self-employment likelihood. Results indicate that clustering by race has group-specific influences, increasing the likelihood of self-employment for some groups and diminishing for others. Higher levels of racial exposure raise the likelihood of entrepreneurial careers for all groups, but especially for Blacks.

Title: The Role of Gender Stereotypes in Perceptions of Entrepreneurs and Intentions to Become an Entrepreneur

Author-Name: Sikdar, Arijit
Abstract: In this study we examine the role of socially constructed gender stereotypes in entrepreneurship and their influence on men and women's entrepreneurial intentions. Data on characteristics of males, females, and entrepreneurs were collected from young adults in three countries. As hypothesized, entrepreneurs were perceived to have predominantly masculine characteristics. Additional results revealed that although both men and women perceive entrepreneurs to have characteristics similar to those of males (masculine gender-role stereotype), only women also perceived entrepreneurs and females as having similar characteristics (feminine gender-role stereotype). Further, though men and women did not differ in their entrepreneurial intentions, those who perceived themselves as more similar to males (high on male gender identification) had higher entrepreneurial intentions than those who saw themselves as less similar to males (low male gender identification). No such difference was found for people who saw themselves as more or less similar to females (female gender identification). The results were consistent across the three countries. Practical implications and directions for future research are discussed.

Title: How Technology‐Based New Firms Leverage Newness and Smallness to Commercialize Disruptive Technologies
Author-Name: Carayannopoulos, Sofy
Abstract: Although the survival of young firms is challenged by the liabilities of newness, there are numerous instances where these firms have been successful at commercializing disruptive technologies at the expense of much larger and stronger incumbents. This paper explores this phenomenon and argues that the characteristics that challenge young technology-venture survival are also potential sources of advantage when commercializing disruptive technologies. The propositions developed also identify the boundary conditions for the advantages by examining the context of commercialization that is created by four types of disruptive technologies. The contributions of this paper are relevant to the enhanced understanding of the liabilities of newness, as well as the commercialization of disruptive technologies.

Author-Name: Whitcanack, Laney
Abstract: This research revealed the significant role of two distinct cognitive styles as a determinant of perceived entrepreneurial self-efficacy regarding the different stages of the new venture process. The study found that individuals' cognitive preference for analysis or intuition influences their perception and assessment of their entrepreneurial self-efficacy in their intentions to create a new venture. Individuals with the intuitive cognitive style were more confident in their ability to identify and recognize opportunities, without much confidence in their capacity of assessment, evaluation, planning, and marshalling of resources. Conversely, individuals with the analytic cognitive style were more confident in their abilities to assess, evaluate, plan, and marshal resources, but felt less confident in their abilities to search for and recognize new opportunities.

Title: Perceived Acute Human Resource Management Problems in Small and Medium Firms: An Empirical Examination
Author-Name: Tocher, Neil
Author-Name: Rutherford, Matthew W.
Abstract: The main objective of this study was to introduce and empirically test a novel and useful framework from which to study human resource management (HRM) problems in small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Specifically, the “perceived acute HRM problems framework” introduced in this study was an attempt to advance the literature by moving beyond simply studying when HRM problems may exist in SMEs, to instead studying when SME owners and managers perceive that HRM problems are the firm's most significant concern. Recent literature suggests that SME owners and managers do not conceptualize specific HRM problems on a spectrum. Rather, they are more likely to perceive only “people problems” in the aggregate and then only when severe. Thus, the acute problems framework may be a more appropriate angle from which to study HRM problems in SMEs. We employ binary logistic regression on a sample of 1,693 SMEs to analyze the effect of owner/manager characteristics and firm characteristics on the likelihood of perceiving acute HRM problems. Our results indicate that SME owners and managers who were running higher-performing firms were less likely to perceive acute HRM problems. Conversely, SME owners and managers who were more experienced, who were more educated, and who were running larger SMEs were more likely to perceive acute HRM problems. Finally, gender, owner age, firm age, and firm growth showed no significant relationship with likelihood of SME owners and managers perceiving acute HRM problems.

Title: Measuring Enterprise Potential in Young People
Author-Name: Athayde, Rosemary
Abstract: As young people increasingly become the target of entrepreneurial and enterprise policy initiatives and enterprise education in schools increases, so does the need to effectively measure the impact these programs have. A research instrument was designed to measure “enterprise potential” in young people using attitudes toward characteristics associated with entrepreneurship. A control-group cross-sectional design was used to investigate the impact of participation in a Young Enterprise Company Program, which is based on the U.S. Junior Achievement model, in six secondary schools in London, United Kingdom. The study found that participation in a Company Program can foster positive attitudes toward self-employment and that participants displayed greater enterprise potential than nonparticipants. Demographic differences also emerged in enterprise potential between ethnic groups. Young Black people were more positive about self-employment and displayed greater enterprise potential than either White or Asian pupils. A family background of self-employment had a positive influence on pupils' intentions to become self-employed. Finally, the research raises a conceptual issue concerning the multidimensionality of the construct of “enterprise potential.”

Title: Systematic Search and Its Relationship to Firm Founding
Author-Name: Patel, Pankaj C.
Author-Name: Fiet, James O.
Abstract: This research uses a representative sample of U.S. nascent entrepreneurs to find that there is a positive relationship between their use of systematic search and their success in founding new firms. We control for mediating variables and find that searching systematically leverages firm founding by using an adaptive decision-making style and social capital. Systematic search also appears to reduce environmental uncertainty, which has additional important implications for aspiring entrepreneurs. Finally, this research suggests possible lines of future inquiry.

Author-Name: Eddleston, Kimberly A.
Abstract: Why does social capital influence the progress of new venture creation for some entrepreneurs more than others? Our investigation suggests that social capital is not enough; that the type of person involved in network relationships matters to new venture creation. We test the effects of the interplay of social capital and cognition on a sample of 269 entrepreneurs. Our results confirm that social networks and relational capital enhance levels of illusion of control, which is directly related to the progress of new venture creation. We find marginal support for the relationship between social capital and risk propensity.

Title: Entrepreneurs' Decisions on Timing of Entry: Learning From Participation and From the Experiences of Others
Author-Name: Lévesque, Moren
Author-Name: Minniti, Maria
Author-Name: Shepherd, Dean
Abstract: Depending on the type of industry, an entrepreneur's decision of when to enter an industry may be a crucial one. The longer entrepreneurs wait, the more they learn from others. However, by waiting, they reduce their ability to learn directly and the possibility of locking in competitive advantages. We suggest that the optimal time of entry depends on the hostility of the learning environment since the latter has an impact on dimensions of performance, such as profit potential and mortality risk. The environment for entrepreneurial learning is less hostile when the information to be learned is abundant and when learning from others is relatively more effective at increasing performance than learning from participation. Our results suggest that delaying entry is desirable when the environment is less hostile. Entrepreneurs, however, cannot wait forever. We show that, under some general conditions, an optimal time of entry can be determined, and discuss the specific situations in which, instead, multiple equilibria may arise.

Abstract: A growing number of studies on entrepreneurial motivation, intentions, and behavior include entrepreneurial self-efficacy (ESE) as an explanatory variable. While there is broad consensus among researchers on the importance of including ESE in an intentionality model, there remain inconsistencies in the definition, dimensionality, and measurement of ESE. This study takes an important step toward refinement and standardization of ESE measurement. Within a new venture creation process framework, a multi-dimensional ESE instrument is developed and tested on a diverse sample that includes nascent entrepreneurs. Implications for entrepreneurship theory and entrepreneurship education are discussed.

Title: Can This Business Be Rescued?
Author-Name: Ivanova, Yuliya V.
Abstract: This teaching case describes an ethical dilemma for a small business owner operating in the challenging business environment of Belarus, 2003. Each of his four options is a viable consideration depending on the perspective through which it is considered: his role as an individual, his role within his social network, and his role as a business executive. Students learn to evaluate each option and to make difficult decisions. The case is most appropriate for ethics or decision-making classes in the areas of Organizational Behavior, Leadership, or International Management. This case would also be relevant in an executive education program.

Title: Does One Size Fit All? The Multiple Organizational Forms Leading to Successful Academic Entrepreneurship
Author-Name: Wood, Matthew S.
Abstract: This paper offers an integrative theory, through the use of transaction cost theory principles, that attempts to match the attributes of university-held innovations with the specific organizational form that best supports the identified attributes in innovation commercialization efforts. Two commonly utilized organizational forms are considered: the spin-off and the technology license agreement. Additionally, innovation transfer is conceptualized as a transaction and each of the organizational forms is considered an alternate governance mechanism for the management of the commercialization transaction. It is further conceptualized that by minimizing transaction costs, through the proper selection of the organizational form, universities may increase the odds of successful revenue generation from their entrepreneurial efforts. The overall goal of the paper is to enhance our understanding of proper organizational form-innovation attribute alignment as a key driver of innovation commercialization success, so that universities and their industry partners can increase their effectiveness in commercialization activities.

Title: Business Networks and Economic Development in Rural Communities in the United States

Abstract: Many rural communities in the United States are economically depressed. However, while poor rural communities are geographically isolated and small, they are likely to be rich in social capital. We first argue that the nature of the social capital in such communities can either facilitate or constrain the development of business networks among entrepreneurs. We then explain the community-level conditions that might increase the probability of business network effectiveness. The primary opportunities that such networks can exploit and their potential spillover effects on economic development are also identified. Finally, we provide directions for research that can contribute to better public policy decisions.

Abstract: Entrepreneurial orientation (EO) has received substantial conceptual and empirical attention, representing one of the few areas in entrepreneurship research where a cumulative body of knowledge is developing. The time is therefore ripe to document, to review, and to evaluate the cumulative knowledge on the relationship between EO and business performance. Extending beyond qualitative assessment, we undertook a meta-analysis exploring the magnitude of the EO-performance relationship and assessed potential moderators affecting this relationship. Analyses of 53 samples from 51 studies with an N of 14,259 companies indicated that the correlation of EO with performance is moderately large (r = .242) and that this relationship is robust to different operationalizations of key constructs as well as cultural contexts. Internal and environmental moderators were identified, and results suggest that additional moderators should be assessed. Recommendations for future research are developed.

Title: Founders, Private Equity Investors, and Underpricing in Entrepreneurial IPOs
Author-Name: Bruton, Garry D.
Author-Name: Chahine, Salim
Author-Name: Filatotchev, Igor
Abstract: One of the most important events in the life of an entrepreneurial firm is when it undergoes an initial public offering (IPO). Combining signaling theory with research on the role of information asymmetry in pricing of IPOs this study examines the performance outcomes of two distinct types of agency conflicts at the time of the IPO: adverse selection and moral hazard. Empirical results show a curvilinear (U-shaped) relationship between founders' retained equity and underpricing. This suggests that founders' retained ownership in an entrepreneurial IPO limits adverse selection problems and the associated IPO underpricing; however, at some point entrepreneurs' investment and risk become so great that entrepreneurs may no longer act rationally and moral hazard increases. Empirical findings also indicate that the retained ownership of business angels has a stronger mitigating effect on adverse selection and moral hazard problems than do venture capitalist investors.

Abstract: This article draws upon prior research and theory on the legitimacy threshold that suggests entrepreneurs in start-up ventures will likely employ proactive strategies to gain initial legitimacy with key stakeholders. We argue that these strategies may sometimes include questionable ethical behaviors, including telling legitimacy lies—intentional misrepresentations of the facts. Based on a review of literature on ethical decision making, we then apply two common ethical frameworks to explore the ethical boundaries of what may or may not be acceptable behavior in seeking legitimacy. We conclude the article with some specific guidelines for start-up entrepreneurs.

Abstract: Although entrepreneurship research on networks has studied issues pertaining to network content, governance and structure, we believe it requires a greater understanding of network processes. In this paper, we review how the entrepreneurship literature interprets and applies the concept of process to the study of networks. This allows us to identify areas for future investigation. Our work is also informed by social network theory and research on dyadic interactions in business networks. The paper concludes by presenting a theoretical framework for conceptualizing and studying the various processes associated with network development.

Title: Storm Clouds and Silver Linings: Responding to Disruptive Innovations Through Cognitive Resilience

Author-Name: Bowen, Frances
Abstract: Incumbent firms facing disruptive business model innovations must decide whether to respond through inaction, resistance, adoption, or resilience. We focus on resilient responses to simultaneous perceived threat and opportunity by managers of small incumbent firms. Using cognitive framing arguments, we argue that risk experience moderates perceptions of opportunity, whereas perceived urgency moderates situation threat. We test our framework in the real estate brokerage context, where small incumbents face considerable challenges from disruptive business model innovations, such as discount brokers. Analysis of data from 126 real estate brokers broadly confirms our framework. We conclude with implications of our research for small business incumbents.

Abstract: As environments become more dynamic and increasingly competitive, organizations must become more entrepreneurial. To explain how and why an organization becomes more (or less) entrepreneurial over time, we investigate the interrelationship between the psychology of individuals and the culture of organizations. To that end, we develop the notion of entrepreneurial spirals—enduring, deviation-amplifying loops—that serve to link the manager's mindset to his or her organization's culture and vice versa. We investigate how entrepreneurial spirals start, perpetuate, and stop, and detail the implications and insights suggested by entrepreneurial spirals for the relationship between managerial mindset and organizational culture.

We make explicit the trade-offs and opportunity costs for corporate employee-entrepreneurs. We use a conjoint field experiment to collect data on 1952 decisions made by 61 corporate employees to test how risk and effort moderate an employee's decision to participate in a new corporate venture. We find that these factors do interact to affect the choice to engage in corporate entrepreneurship projects.

Abstract: Empirical and anecdotal evidence suggests that businesses that act with an entrepreneurial orientation enjoy superior performance. Our research investigates whether nonprofit, religious congregations can benefit from similar initiatives. We based our hypotheses on the Rational Choice Theory of Religion, which was developed by social scientists to bring economic analysis to the understanding of the effects of competition among nonprofit organizations. Using a sample of 250 religious congregations in five different geographical markets, an entrepreneurial orientation is found to be positively associated with organizational performance. A hypothesized interaction effect between environmental munificence and entrepreneurial orientation is assessed.

The entrepreneurial intention model is then tested on a 519-individual sample from two rather diverse countries: Spain and Taiwan. EIQ and structural equation techniques have been used to try to overcome previous research limitations. The role of culture in explaining motivational perceptions has been specifically considered. Results indicate EIQ properties are satisfactory and strong support for the model is found. Relevant insights are derived about how cultural values modify the way individuals in each society perceive entrepreneurship.

Research has shown the strong economic impact of business groups throughout the world but remains heavily focused on large-business groups and on emerging economies. Theoretical approaches to explain the existence of highly diversified business groups range from market power to the resource-based view and include market failure, transaction costs, agency theory, and cultural embeddedness. These approaches, however, are not very appropriate to explain the existence of small to medium-size firms in developed countries. What we know is that these smaller groups exist and that they are largely the outcome of related diversification.

Title: Individual Entrepreneurial Intent: Construct Clarification and Development of an Internationally Reliable Metric
Author-Name: Thompson, Edmund R.
Abstract: Individual entrepreneurial intent is a key construct in research on new business formation. However, neither a clear or consistent definition of nor a uniform and reliable way to measure individual entrepreneurial intent has yet emerged. Several management scholars have highlighted the impediment this constitutes to the advancement of entrepreneurship research. This paper first seeks to clarify the construct of individual entrepreneurial intent and then reports the development and validation of a reliable and internationally applicable individual entrepreneurial intent scale.

Title: A Measure of Adaptive Cognition for Entrepreneurship Research
Author-Name: Haynie, Michael
Author-Name: Shepherd, Dean A.
Abstract: To sense and adapt to uncertainty may characterize a critical entrepreneurial resource. In this research, we employ a metacognitive lens toward the development of a 36-item inventory designed to assess cognitive adaptability, defined as the ability to be dynamic, flexible, and self-regulating in one's cognitions given dynamic and uncertain task environments. Construction of the inventory, and subsequent factor analysis, is confirmatory in nature based on five theoretically justified dimensions of metacognition. We describe the development of the instrument, discuss its implications for entrepreneurship, and finally offer suggestions for further development and testing.

Title: The Life Cycle of an Internet Firm: Scripts, Legitimacy, and Identity
Author-Name: Drori, Israel

Author-Name: Sheaffer, Zachary
Abstract: We study, longitudinally and ethnographically, the construction of legitimacy and identity during the life cycle of an entrepreneurial Internet firm, from inception to death. We utilize organizational scripts to examine how social actors enact identity and legitimacy, maintaining that different scripts, both contested and consent-oriented, become the source of action for acquiring legitimacy and creating organizational identity. We show that scripts enable entrepreneurs and other social actors to invoke a set of interactions within and outside the organization. Scripts construct values and interests, form social bonding and consented actions, and eventually shape and reshape the individual and institutional contexts of identity and legitimacy. We found that the strategic action of organizational members in pursuing and enacting their preferred scripts depends on their position and role in the organization. We observed that the institutionalization of simultaneously competing scripts created a path-dependent process leading to organizational conflict and eventual failure.

Abstract: This article discusses how the performance of family firms and nonfamily firms might differ as a result of the different priorities flowing from family influence, even when the two types of firms possess comparable levels of resource stocks. Using hierarchical regression to analyze data from a national study of the Small Business Development Center program, we find that family influence has both a positive and a negative moderating effect on the relationships between different categories of resource stocks and performance. Specifically, family firms benefit more from resource stocks based on external relationships while nonfamily firms benefit more from resource stocks based on functional skills.

Title: Entrepreneurial Scripts and the New Transaction Commitment Mindset: Extending the Expert Information Processing Theory Approach to Entrepreneurial Cognition Research
Author-Name: Smith, J. Brock

Author-Name: Mitchell, Ronald K.
Abstract: In this study, we extend the expert information processing theory approach to entrepreneurial cognition research through an empirical exploration of the new transaction commitment mindset among business people in Canada, Mexico, and the United States. Using analysis of covariance, multivariate analysis of variance, and hierarchical regression analysis of data from a cross-sectional sample of 417 respondents, our results provide a foundation for additional cross-level theory development, with related implications for increasing the practicality of expert information processing theory-based entrepreneurial cognition research. Specifically, this paper: (1) clarifies the nature of the relationship between entrepreneurial expert scripts and constructs that might represent an entrepreneurial mindset at the individual level of analysis; (2) identifies analogous relationships at the economy level of analysis, where the structure found at the individual level informs an economy-level problem; (3) presents a North American Free Trade Agreement-based illustration analysis to demonstrate the extent to which cognitive findings at the individual level can be used to explain economy-level phenomena; and (4) extrapolates from our analysis some of the ways in which script-based comparisons across country or culture can inform the more general task of making information processing-based comparisons among entrepreneurs across other contexts.

Author-Name: Arthurs, Jonathan D.

Author-Name: Johnson, Richard A.
Abstract: Entrepreneurs with firm-specific human capital represent both a potential source of competitive advantage and a threat to appropriate the rents that are ultimately generated by a new venture. This situation presents interesting agency and resource dependence challenges. While potential investors in these ventures will want assurances that their interests are protected, they will also want to ensure that these key entrepreneurs remain with the organization. Using agency theory and resource dependence theory, we examine the types of governance mechanisms that are implemented in firms going through an initial public offering comparing those ventures which indicate a dependence on these critical entrepreneurs versus those that do not. Our analysis reveals that ventures exhibiting dependence on key entrepreneurs are associated with higher insider and outsider ownership by the board, greater start-up experience by the board, greater use of contingent compensation, and greater use of involuntary departure agreements.

Title: The Impact of Networking on Bank Financing: The Case of Small and Medium‐Sized Enterprises in Vietnam
Author-Name: Le, Ngoc T.B.
Author-Name: Nguyen, Thang V.
Abstract: It is argued that networking is crucial for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), particularly in emerging economies as they seek to access resources for development. One key resource in emerging economies is bank financing. In this paper, we develop a model that examines the net effect of different network ties on bank financing to private SMEs. The results support our hypothesis that different network ties influence SMEs' use of bank loans in different ways. Specifically, networking with customers and government officials promotes the use of bank loans, while networking with suppliers and social ties reduces the need for bank loans. This study provides a number of research and managerial implications, which are discussed at the end of the paper.

Abstract: This paper examines the formation of the initial capital structure of Chinese start-up firms. Contrary to the predominant view of Chinese family business, this study found that family funding is not the major source of start-up capital under certain conditions. Employing two surveys conducted separately in Hong Kong and the mainland of the People's Republic of China, it was revealed that Chinese entrepreneurs seek initial funding from their family rather than from outsiders only if they expected lower transaction costs and lower levels of family interference in the business. The implications of the findings for entrepreneurship of ethnic Chinese communities in East Asia are discussed.

Abstract: This article introduces the reader to the scope, boundaries, variation, and theoretical lenses of transnational entrepreneurship (TE) research. We discuss issues concerning why, how, and when individuals and/or organizations pursue new business ventures, often in far less attractive environments, while relying on abilities and opportunities stemming from the exploitation of resources, both social and economic, in more than one country. We compare TE with international entrepreneurs, ethnic entrepreneurs, and returnee entrepreneurs. TE is considered from several perspectives: agency, institutional, cultural, power relations, and social capital and networks. We summarize the articles presented in this special issue and outline an agenda for further research.

Title: Transnational Entrepreneurship: Determinants of Firm Type and Owner Attributions of Success
Author-Name: Sequeira, Jennifer M.

Author-Name: Rasheed, Abdul A.
Abstract: Building on a typology of transnational firm types, developed by Landolt, Autler, and Baires in 1999, we examine whether immigrant attitudes toward the host country and their degree of embeddedness in the home country can predict the specific type of transnational enterprise that an immigrant is likely to begin. We also investigate whether the determinants of success of transnational enterprises vary by firm type. Based on a sample of 1,202 transnational business owners drawn from the Comparative Immigrant Entrepreneurship Project database, our analyses indicate general support for our hypotheses. More specifically, we found that transnational entrepreneurs' positive perceptions of host country opportunities and greater embeddedness in home country activities helped predict the specific type of ventures they would undertake. Further, the degree of embeddedness in the home country may influence the determinants of success for these types of firms. Depending on firm type, owners attributed their primary success to either personal characteristics, social support, or to the quality of their products and services.

Title: The Balancing Act: The Role of Transnational Habitus and Social Networks in Balancing Transnational Entrepreneurial Activities

Abstract: Transnational entrepreneurship is becoming an increasingly important global phenomenon with enormous impact on economic, social, and political structures worldwide. Drawing on Bourdieu's theory of practice, we assess how transnational entrepreneurs (TEs) may balance their network scope and network size in dual environments to enhance their ability to operate in both environments. Using a sample of 452 U.S. Latin American TEs, we find that balanced network size and network scope in the respective institutional settings enhance the degree of transnational venture activities. More importantly, we find that the joint effects of balancing network size with network scope are significantly greater than their individual effects.

Title: Transnational Entrepreneurs' Venture Internationalization Strategies: A Practice Theory Approach

Author-Name: Elam, Amanda
Abstract: How do entrepreneurs working across multiple countries leverage individual experiences and institutional environments to pursue international markets? This research utilizes Bourdieu's theory of practice as a sensitizing framework to explore transnational entrepreneurs' internationalization strategies. Four case studies reveal the ways in which transnational entrepreneurs rely on diverse sets of resources—economic, social, cultural, and symbolic capital—to navigate multiple institutional environments—cultural repertoires, social networks, legal and regulatory regimes, and power relations—when making strategic decisions about internationalization. Transnational entrepreneurs are uniquely positioned to internationalize directly and, in many cases, as an intermediary for local firms. As such, transnational entrepreneurs pursue a modern middleman role that transcends the multiple institutional environments in which they are embedded.

Abstract: This paper introduces an analysis of international relocation decisions of venture capital (VC)-backed companies. Relocations to the United States are motivated by economic conditions as well as an improvement in the laws of the country in which the entrepreneurial firm is based. Relocations to the United States yield much greater returns to Asia-Pacific VCs than investing in companies already based in the United States at the time of VC investment. Further, more experienced Asia-Pacific VCs have greater success with their investee relocations to the United States, and these relocations yield higher returns relative to staying in their country of origin.

Abstract: Family firms are embedded in social structures that differ substantially from those of nonfamily firms. While these social structures can be sources of strength, they can also lead to dysfunctional consequences. The four papers and three commentaries contained in this special issue on theories of family enterprise deal with the various positive and negative aspects of family involvement in a firm. The purpose of this introduction is to attempt to establish linkages between these papers and to provide further insights on their contributions to knowledge and the directions that future research might take to build upon them.

Title: Agency vs. Stewardship in Public Family Firms: A Social Embeddedness Reconciliation
Author-Name: Le Breton‐Miller, Isabelle
Author-Name: Miller, Danny
Abstract: Family businesses (FBs) play a key role in the world's economies. Unfortunately, the current literature surfaces disparate understandings and conclusions concerning their conduct and performance. Much of that literature falls under two insightful perspectives, agency theory and stewardship theory, that conflict quite directly. The agency view, based in economics, maintains that families will pursue utility for themselves to the detriment of their public shareholders. By contrast, stewardship proponents, arguing from a psychological perspective, suggest that family owners will invest deeply in their enterprise, to the benefit of all. This study synthesizes the literature on each of these perspectives to derive core motivational assumptions and expected organizational outcomes. Then, by employing a third sociological perspective, it proposes to reconcile these opposing views by considering the social embeddedness of firms and their key actors within the institution of the family for different types of public family enterprises. It will argue that there is a need for such integration in order to better understand and permit accurate, context-based predictions across various kinds of family businesses and family business situations.

Title: Goal Tolerance, Outside Investors, and Family Firm Governance

Author-Name: Sapienza, Harry J.
Abstract: Le Breton-Miller and Miller argue that as the family becomes more embedded in the firm, the firm's decision makers become more susceptible to influence by the family, and agency problems rise for outside investors. We contend that the family's embeddedness in the business does not, in itself, explain whether the assumptions of agency theory are warranted. Our commentary offers an alternative way in which outside investors might look at family firms' goals. Outsiders should assess the complementarity of the family firm's objectives with their own if they are to make rewarding investments in family firms.

Abstract: Family firms can enjoy substantial longevity. Ironically, however, they are often imperiled by the very process that is essential to this longevity. Using the concept of managerial discretion as a starting point, we use a human agency lens to introduce the construct of successor discretion as a factor that affects the family business succession process. While important in general, successor discretion is positioned as a particularly relevant factor for productively managing organizational renewal in family businesses. This study represents a foundation for future empirical research investigating the role of agency in entrepreneurial action in the family business context, which consequently can contribute to the larger research literature on succession and change.

Abstract: Employing grounded theory based on comparative case studies of informal microfinanced businesses in East Africa, we build a theoretical foundation for studying the establishment and evolution of family firms in emerging markets. We show that East African entrepreneurs not only use both strong family and strong community ties to establish and grow businesses, but they also use strong community ties to counterbalance the obligations that strong extended family ties create. In addition, we show that economic informality presents opportunities for some entrepreneurial businesses but not others to cycle rapidly from opportunity to opportunity as they maneuver toward higher value-creating ventures.

This commentary provides insight into the research by discussing the findings in light of the three-dimensional model of family business and attempts to limit agency costs based on cultural-based rights of the extended family. Also discussed here is a finding that may indicate a gender-related issue in opportunity identification and exploitation.

Title: Family Business, Identity Conflict, and an Expedited Entrepreneurial Process: A Process of Resolving Identity Conflict
Author-Name: Shepherd, Dean
Author-Name: Haynie, J. Michael
Abstract: Drawing on Identity Control Theory (ICT) and the literature on social identity, we offer a model of the dynamics associated with competing family and business identities brought into conflict by “family-business” events. We introduce the notion of the family-business role as a distinct identity functioning at the intersection of family and business identities. This meta-level identity “manages” conflict between the family and the business identities, and is formulated and transformed within the family structure. To illustrate the dynamics of the family-business meta-identity, in this article we focus on entrepreneurial opportunities as potentially identity conflict-triggering events and illustrate how and with what impact the meta-identity works to resolve identity conflict at the intersection of family and business so as to expedite the entrepreneurial process. We conclude with a discussion of the implications of our model.

Abstract: We study how social capital induces performance spillover effects in an industry network of entrepreneurs building their own hydroelectric micro-power plants. Most of them are farmers and novices living in rural areas. There is a link between social capital and performance at firm level. By expanding the level of analysis to dyads, we find that entrepreneurs lacking social capital can compensate for this through cohesion with colleagues rich in social capital. Entrepreneurs can also benefit by mimicking the networking patterns of successful colleagues, gaining access to equivalent resources developed in the niche.

Abstract: This paper studies the effect of the introduction of government-provided Internet technology to rural communities (Internet communities) on regional entrepreneurship. Entrepreneurship increases among larger Internet communities, as the Internet spurs entrepreneurial activities by enabling agglomeration across areas that have a preexisting cluster of real entrepreneurial activities. There is, however, a decrease in entrepreneurship among smaller and more geographically remote Internet communities, as the Internet facilitates the consumption of items and services not produced within such smaller communities. Overall, the key finding is that virtual entrepreneurial clusters are not independent of real entrepreneurial clusters.

Given theoretical and practical gaps associated with these issues, we integrate entrepreneurship, institutional, and network theories to discuss how the entrepreneurship process of MNEs is negatively affected in base of the pyramid markets. We then explain how partnerships with nongovernment organizations (NGOs) can offset such negative effects due to NGOs' high degree of localized knowledge, social embeddedness within multiple informal networks, and ambidexterity in dealing with diverse stakeholder groups. Both economic and social benefits can result from such partnerships.

Title: Bankruptcy Laws and Entrepreneur‐ Friendliness
Author-Name: Peng, Mike W.
Author-Name: Yamakawa, Yasuhiro
Author-Name: Lee, Seung‐Hyun
Abstract: Using bankruptcy laws as a case of formal institutions, we show how formal institutions impact entrepreneurship development. Historically, bankruptcy laws usually have been harsh. Recently, many governments have realized that entrepreneur-friendly bankruptcy laws can not only lower exit barriers, but also lower entry barriers for entrepreneurs. Since bankruptcy laws are not uniform around the world, it is important to understand how they differ in their friendliness to entrepreneurs. This article focuses on six dimensions of entrepreneur-friendliness: (1) the availability of a reorganization bankruptcy option, (2) the time spent on bankruptcy procedures, (3) the cost of bankruptcy procedures, (4) the opportunity to have a fresh start in liquidation bankruptcy, (5) the opportunity to have an automatic stay of assets during reorganization bankruptcy, and (6) the opportunity for entrepreneurs and managers to remain on the job after filing for bankruptcy. In an effort to cover both developed and emerging economies and to draw on geographically diverse examples, we use data from Australia, Canada, Chile, Finland, Hong Kong, Japan, Norway, Peru, Singapore, South Korea, Thailand, the United States, and other countries to illustrate these differences. Overall, this article contributes to the institution-based view of entrepreneurship by highlighting the important role that formal institutions such as bankruptcy laws play behind entrepreneurship development around the world.

Title: Mulling over Massachusetts: Health Insurance Mandates and Entrepreneurs
Author-Name: Jackson, Scott
Abstract: The author provides preliminary and provocative results regarding the impact of health insurance mandates on the propensity of entrepreneurs to start new organizations. In keeping with a well-observed propensity for individuals to adjust their economic calculations in anticipation of future costs/benefits, the evidence suggests that when confronted with such mandates, potential entrepreneurs may either abandon entrepreneurial ambitions or seek to minimize mandate costs through jurisdictional arbitrage with appreciable implications for state and national level approaches to health care, health insurance provision, and workers.

Abstract: This case focuses on the decisions confronting Marc van der Bilt and his family. At the age of 59, Marc had been a franchisee of the Dutch DA drugstore chain for 23 years and had always planned to remain one until his retirement. In the spring of 2003, however, a change of management at the DA headquarters sparked major strategic changes to the DA chain that placed Marc and his family in a difficult position. They must decide on the future of their family business; should they go along with their franchisor's new plans or not?

Title: Entrepreneurship in Russia and China: The Impact of Formal Institutional Voids
Author-Name: Puffer, Sheila M.
Author-Name: McCarthy, Daniel J.
Author-Name: Boisot, Max
Abstract: Transition economies are often characterized by underdeveloped formal institutions, often resulting in an unstable environment and creating a void usually filled by informal ones. Entrepreneurs in transition environments thus face more uncertainty and risk than those in more developed economies. This article examines the relationship of institutions and entrepreneurship in Russia and China in the context of institutional theory by analyzing private property as a formal institution, as well as trust and blat/guanxi as informal institutions. This article thus contributes to the literature on entrepreneurship and institutional theory by focusing on these topics in transition economies, and by emphasizing how their relationship differs from that in developed economies. We conclude that full convergence toward entrepreneurs' reliance on formal institutions may not readily occur in countries like Russia and China due to the embeddedness of informal institutions. Instead, such countries and their entrepreneurs may develop unique balances between informal and formal institutions that better fit their circumstances. Implications for the theory and practice of entrepreneurship in such environments are also offered.

Abstract: We examine the role of the state as entrepreneur and institutional entrepreneur in the Middle East. Using historical event sequencing methodology we seek to understand the rise of Dubai and the United Arab Emirates as a context for international entrepreneurship. We build on ideas at the intersection of international entrepreneurship and institutional theory to develop a set of propositions that enhance our understanding of international entrepreneurship. We provide implications for the management of both global and local legitimacy, resource mobilization, and agency as well as the strategic deployment of an institutional infrastructure to create and enable entrepreneurship.

Title: Syndication of Venture Capital Investment: The Art of Resource Pooling
Author-Name: Ferrary, Michel
Abstract: This article explores the rationale of syndications of institutional venture capital investors when they fund start-ups. There is an implicit labor division between institutional venture capital investors in which pure venture capital firms are in charge of converting investment uncertainty into risk by funding the seed stage of start-ups. The other investors invest in the following stages to sustain the start-ups' development. Relationships between investors are also handled following informal rules. Exchanges between institutional venture capital investors are based on a reciprocity that follows the informal principles of the gift exchange theory.

Title: Emotions and Entrepreneurial Opportunity Evaluation
Author-Name: Foo, Maw‐Der
Abstract: Emotions may affect opportunity evaluation yet emotions' influence in entrepreneurship research has been neglected. Findings from the two studies in this paper indicate that appraisal dimensions of emotions influence risk perceptions and preferences. In Study 1 (n = 187), the participants' scores on risk perception for a venture scenario were significantly lower for anger and happiness-induced participants (emotions associated with outcome certainty and control) than for fear- and hope-induced participants (emotions associated with outcome uncertainty and a lack of outcome control). In Study 2 (n = 66), the entrepreneurs' preference for the higher value but uncertain outcome related positively to their scores on trait anger and trait happiness.

Abstract: This study examines entrepreneurial motivation in three diverse samples from an identity-possible self-perspective. We propose a model describing antecedents and outcomes of entrepreneur identity aspirations. In two of the three samples, strength of entrepreneur identity aspiration was significantly associated with the extent to which the individual's self-description fit his or her perceptions of the entrepreneurial role. However, identity aspiration strength predicted discovery and exploitation behaviors in all three samples. Additionally, prior start-up experience moderated the relationship between identity aspiration and exploitation behaviors for all three samples. These findings contribute to our understanding of what moves entrepreneurial “dreamers” to action.

Abstract: This study examined the relationships among entrepreneurial orientation (EO), experimental learning (EL) and acquisitive learning (AL), and firm performance (FP). We tested our model in China as EO is the engine that is driving firms to take advantage of opportunities in an increasingly market-oriented transitional economy. From the responses of 607 firms, we found that EO was positively related to EL but had an inverse U-shaped relationship with AL. Both EL and AL enhanced FP although the effects from AL were weaker and became nonsignificant when external knowledge was embedded into the firm's internal private knowledge.

Abstract: We conceptualize a learning-based model of international new ventures (INVs)' post-entry internationalization speed focusing upon two measures: country scope speed and international commitment speed. We contribute to a deeper understanding of the pace of international expansion of the new venture once it has become an INV by articulating the role of (1) the speed of learning, influenced by social capital and absorptive capacity, and (2) the content of learning represented by knowledge accumulation. We also offer a more refined perspective on organizational learning, which indicates that different stages in the process of exploitative learning require different forms of social capital.

Abstract: Research on governance has focused on large corporations, giving far less attention to smaller and younger companies especially those moving from founder-controlled start-ups to professionally managed public companies. Emphasizing founder-involved firms (i.e., firms that are floated by their original founders), this article examines interlinks between founders' prestige and selection of inside and outside directors, and short-term performance measured in terms of IPO “underpricing.” The results provide evidence of positive association between founders' and directors' prestige, but there is substitution between inside and outside directors' prestige. Top management team's external board experiences reduce IPO underpricing.

Abstract: This article draws on the resource-based view to analyze the role founding teams' financial management competencies play for firm growth.

We explore the relevance of strategic financial planning competence, external financing competence, competence in financing from cash flow, and controlling competence of entrepreneurial teams for the growth of new technology-based firms. A total of 212 founding teams provided self-assessments of their financial management competencies at start-up. We apply the partial least squares approach to determine the effects of the different financial management competencies on firm growth.

Title: Parental Entrepreneurial Role Model Influence on Male Offspring: Is It Always Positive and When Does It Occur?
Author-Name: Mungai, Edward
Author-Name: Velamuri, S. Ramakrishna
Abstract: Parental self-employment has been shown to have a positive influence on offspring's subsequent choice of self-employment as a career. Previous studies have, however, not considered its dependence on parental performance in self-employment and at what stage of the offspring's development (late childhood, adolescence, or young adulthood) this influence is highest. This article uses social learning and career development theories to argue that first, parental influence may not exist in case of parents' economic failure in self-employment, and second, that when it does occur, it is more pronounced when the offspring is a young adult. Using the United States Panel Study of Income Dynamics data set, we find empirical support for our hypotheses.

Abstract: We examine the impact of interorganizational imitation on new venture international entry and subsequent performance. Using a sample of 150 U.S.-based publicly held new ventures, we find that new venture international entry is in part an imitative response to the internationalization of other firms in the venture's home country industry and/or subsets of firms with certain traits or outcomes. We also find that interorganizational imitation moderates the relationship between new venture international entry and profitability, but not the relationship between new venture international entry and sales growth. These findings contribute to the growing body of literature on new venture internationalization.

Abstract: We investigate how corporate venture capitalists (CVCs) can rapidly attain central positions in venture capital syndication networks. Using data of CVC investments by U.S. corporations between 1996 and 2005, we complement prior research, which suggests that centrally positioned VCs predominantly invest together with other centrally positioned VCs. While we find clear support for the social network theory arguments that prior central positions in syndication networks significantly explain future network positions of CVCs, we also find a negative interaction effect between past centrality and corporate resources. This finding implies that resources of CVCs can substitute for their lack of prior centrality and allow them to gain rapidly central positions in rigid VC syndication networks.

Title: Dominant Logic and Entrepreneurial Firms' Performance in a Transition Economy
Author-Name: Obloj, Tomasz
Author-Name: Obloj, Krzysztof
Author-Name: Pratt, Michael G.
Abstract: Dominant logic is the manner in which firms conceptualize and make critical resource-allocation decisions, and over time develop mental maps, business models, and processes that become organizational recipes. This study compares and contrasts the dominant logic of Polish entrepreneurial firms. We find evidence that a dominant logic characterized by external orientation, proactiveness, and simplicity of routines significantly influences the performance of entrepreneurial firms in this emerging economy. These dominant logic characteristics of high performers serve as a key intangible resource in transition economies that are characterized by the absence of strong institutions and resource constraints. Future research in this critical domain should include how dominant logic needs in transition economies evolve over time as the institutional environment matures and market mechanisms become more solidified.

Title: A 2 × 2 Conceptual Foundation for Entrepreneurial Discovery Theory
Author-Name: Murphy, Patrick J.
Abstract: Theories about entrepreneurial discovery are important to entrepreneurship. However, the dominant conceptual foundation underlying such theories hinders their development. It assumes that opportunities form based on either deliberate search or serendipitous discovery. I examine this unidimensional logic and identify a gap in its informative content. Then, I reframe it into orthogonal dimensions. The multidimensional model not only describes the same cases as the unidimensional model but also describes what the unidimensional model cannot, including cases that are high or low on both dimensions. This extension yields a 2 × 2 conceptual foundation for entrepreneurial discovery theory that promotes the development and coordination of distinct theoretic streams.

Title: Valuing University‐Based Firms: The Effects of Academic Affiliation on IPO Performance
Author-Name: Bonardo, Damiano
Author-Name: Paleari, Stefano
Author-Name: Vismara, Silvio
Abstract: This paper investigates for the first time the valuation of university-based companies and their ability to translate the potential benefits of academic affiliation into long-term performance gains. It contributes to the literature on technology transfer by expanding the view from the product market to the financial market. Among the 499 high-tech SMEs that went public on the stock markets of Germany, the U.K., France, and Italy between 1995 and 2003, we find that 131 were university-based firms. For firms who publicize the fact that they are university based and have chosen to go public, the affiliation with a university is recognized as beneficial by investors. Our econometric models show that affiliation with a university enhances valuation, in particular when academics are present in the Top Management Team at the time of the initial public offering. However, over the long run, university-based companies exhibit worse operating performance than independent firms.

Abstract: Current theorizations of bricolage in entrepreneurship studies require refinement and development to be used as a theoretical framework for social entrepreneurship. Our analysis traces bricolage's conceptual underpinnings from various disciplines, identifying its key constructs as making do, a refusal to be constrained by limitations, and improvisation. Although these characteristics appear to epitomize the process of creating social enterprises, our research identifies three further constructs associated with social entrepreneurship: social value creation, stakeholder participation, and persuasion. Using data from a qualitative study of eight U.K. social enterprises, we apply the bricolage concept to social entrepreneurial action and propose an extended theoretical framework of social bricolage.

Title: The Interplay of Form, Structure, and Embeddedness in Social Intrapreneurship
Author-Name: Kistruck, Geoffrey M.
Author-Name: Beamish, Paul W.
Abstract: While the influence of form and structure on social entrepreneurship has received some attention within academe, the perception of form as discrete rather than embedded in organizational history, and structure as an individual, dichotomous choice between simple for-profit and nonprofit alternatives, has painted an incomplete picture. Through a rigorous analysis of 10 case studies located within Africa and Latin America involving social intrapreneurship, our findings suggest that cognitive, network, and cultural embeddedness each play an important constraining role that is even more pronounced in organizations that were historically nonprofit in form. However, our results also suggest a variety of decoupled structural approaches that may help mitigate such constraints.

Abstract: Drawing on the organizational identity literature, this exploratory study examines the dual identities of award-winning social ventures recognized by FastCompany magazine and the Skoll Foundation. Specifically, we use computer-assisted content analysis to explore identities as reflected in organizational mission statements. Our findings demonstrate that these externally recognized social ventures do exhibit dual identities—a utilitarian organizational identity (i.e., entrepreneurial, product oriented) and a normative organizational identity (i.e., social, people oriented). Further, when compared with the mission statements of other high-performing entrepreneurial enterprises culled from the Inc. 500, our post hoc analysis suggests that social ventures manifest a greater normative identity and an equivalent utilitarian identity.

Title: Rapid Institutional Shifts and the Co‐evolution of Entrepreneurial Firms in Transition Economies
Author-Name: Ahlstrom, David
Author-Name: Bruton, Garry D.
Abstract: Economies in transition such as Russia's are among the world's fastest growing. Entrepreneurial firms in an environment like Russia's face rapid and dramatic shifts in the institutional environment. These shifts represent significant challenges to entrepreneurial firms as they seek not only to survive but also to prosper in that environment by rapidly co-evolving with institutional changes. Prior research has focused on institutional change and its impact in developed economies. But the rate of evolution of institutions in transition economies tends to be faster and less predictable. This article reports a longitudinal study of high technology entrepreneurial firms in Russia employing a grounded theory methodology to understand how entrepreneurial ventures co-evolve with rapid institutional changes and still manage to prosper.

Abstract: Even though there has been sustained interest in growth for almost 50 years, relatively little is known about this phenomenon and much confusion and misunderstanding surrounds it. Based on a literature review and the articles in this special issue we make three recommendations that we believe will allow theory to advance and be applicable in practice. First, that discourse between key stakeholders is encouraged in order to achieve greater understanding. Second, that focus is placed on “growth as a process,” rather than as a “change in amount.” Third, that knowledge production requires inclusivity and pluralism in research perspectives and approaches.

Title: Advancing Firm Growth Research: A Focus on Growth Mode Instead of Growth Rate
Author-Name: McKelvie, Alexander
Author-Name: Wiklund, Johan
Abstract: The development of firm growth research has been notably slow. In this paper, we argue that a major reason for this lack of development is the impatience of researchers to prematurely address the question of “how much?” before adequately providing answers to the question “how?” On the basis of an extensive review of the literature, we suggest how growth research can advance by changing focus to growth mode (organic, acquisition, hybrid). Toward this end, we provide a research agenda that helps establish the types of questions that growth researchers can ask within this new focus.

Title: “Business Growth”—Do Practitioners and Scholars Really Talk About the Same Thing?
Author-Name: Achtenhagen, Leona
Author-Name: Naldi, Lucia
Author-Name: Melin, Leif
Abstract: The current growth literature has stalled over which measures to use in empirical studies, causing a fragmented theory base. This paper claims that there is a third issue that further curbs efforts in developing a better understanding of business growth. Based on a thorough literature review, a quantitative, and a qualitative study, we find that academic scholars and entrepreneurs do not talk about the same thing when they say “business growth.” For practitioners, growth is a more complex phenomenon—with a strong emphasis on internal development—which differs from the simplified conceptualization of growth used in empirical studies.

Title: A Terminal Assessment of Stages Theory: Introducing a Dynamic States Approach to Entrepreneurship
Author-Name: Levie, Jonathan
Author-Name: Lichtenstein, Benyamin B.
Abstract: Stages of growth models were the most frequent theoretical approach to understanding entrepreneurial business growth from 1962 to 2006; they built on the growth imperative and developmental models of that time. An analysis of the universe of such models (n = 104) published in the management literature showed no consensus on basic constructs of the approach, and no empirical confirmation of stages theory. However, by changing two propositions of stages theory, a new dynamic states approach was derived. The dynamic states approach has far greater explanatory power than its precursor, and is compatible with leading edge research in entrepreneurship.

Title: The Growth of Business Groups by Habitual Entrepreneurs: The Role of Entrepreneurial Teams
Author-Name: Iacobucci, Donato
Author-Name: Rosa, Peter
Abstract: This article reports the analysis of case studies of portfolio entrepreneurs that suggests that one of the main reasons for the formation and expansion of business groups is the need to create an entrepreneurial team, which is achieved by giving minority shares in the new ventures to others, mainly former employees. This enhances entrepreneurs' ability to grow and diversify the businesses under their control without compromising their ownership control of the overall business group. The article identifies and discusses the different types of entrepreneurial teams developed by portfolio entrepreneurs: joint ventures with established entrepreneurs, employee involvement, and intrapreneurship. The latter two types were specifically interesting in studying situations where there was a dominant entrepreneur and associate entrepreneurs. The article enhances the theoretical and empirical understanding of how growth is achieved in the small firms sector through business group formation, and sheds insights on how entrepreneurial team dynamics operate in multiple business contexts.

Title: Fighting an Uphill Battle: Expansion Barriers, Intra‐Industry Social Stratification, and Minority Firm Growth
Author-Name: Shelton, Lois M.
Abstract: Here, a model of minority firm expansion based on the resource-based view, the expansion barriers framework, and social stratification processes illustrates the economic and social barriers faced by minority companies. Firm growth is impacted by industry economic structure through expansion barriers, and by industry social structure through opportunity structures. It is argued that industry social structure, which includes discriminatory industry practices, can be used to stratify firms into higher and lower performing groups by ethnicity and will have a greater impact on minority firm growth in industries with more concentrated social structures and higher wealth creation potential.

Abstract: Opt-e-scrip, Inc., has developed a patented test for determining the efficacy of drugs in individual patients so that doctors can prescribe the drug that really works for each person. In addition, test results show that older, less expensive drugs are often as or more efficacious than the newer, expensive drugs pushed by manufacturers. It, thus, benefits physicians, patients, and drug benefit payers. However, the company has had difficulty entering the market, given its complexity and their lack of resources. The test remains a product in search of an application and a customer willing to pay for its usage.

Author-Name: Corner, Patricia Doyle
Author-Name: Ho, Marcus
Abstract: The purpose of this article was to extend existing research on opportunity identification in the social entrepreneurship literature through empirically examining this phenomenon. We used an inductive, theory-building design that surfaced patterns in social value creation across multiple case studies. The patterns showed actors seeing a social need and prospecting ideas that could address it. Data also revealed multiple, not individual, actors, dynamically engaged in interactions that nudged an opportunity into manifestation. Also, data suggested complementarities to effectuation and rational/economic processes that are divergent theoretical approaches to the study of entrepreneurship to date.

Abstract: In the current study, we develop an institutional embeddedness explanation of foreign initial public offering (IPO) performance. To explain the performance differentials of these firms, we investigate the effects of both “home” and “host” country institutional signals on IPO underpricing using a sample of foreign IPOs listed in two different institutional environments, namely, the U.S. and U.K. stock exchanges. Supporting the view that signals are institutionally embedded and that their value is not universal, we find the salience of signals associated with country of origin is contingent on the institutional environment of the listing exchange.

Abstract: In this study, we investigate the relationship between institutional elements of the social environment and entrepreneurial cognitions, which lead to the individual's venture creation decision. Employing a sample of 757 entrepreneurs and non-entrepreneurs from eight countries we examine the extent to which institutions influence venture creation decisions, where entrepreneurial expert scripts act as a mediator. Results show that various institutional elements, such as legal and financial systems, affect venture arrangements and willingness scripts. Venture arrangements scripts, in turn, have the most significant impact on an individual's venture creation decision.

Author-Name: Haeussler, Carolin
Abstract: The intention of this paper is to investigate whether market-related factors have a stronger influence on the strategic decision making of ventures in “liberal market economies” than on that of their counterparts in “coordinated economies.” Thereby, I focus on a particularly important strategic decision that firms face—the commercialization choice. Using a unique survey data set on the commercialization of British and German biotechnology firms, I analyze the determinants of commercialization strategy, paying particular attention to national idiosyncrasies. Together, the findings indicate that the commercialization strategy follows distinct patterns in the British “liberal market economy” and the German “coordinated economy.”

Title: Recognizing Opportunities for Sustainable Development

Author-Name: Shepherd, Dean A.
Abstract: Building on the entrepreneurial action and sustainable development literatures, we highlight how the current explanations of opportunity recognition, based on entrepreneurial knowledge and economic motivation, are insufficient for modeling the recognition of opportunities for sustainable development. Our model suggests that entrepreneurs are more likely to discover sustainable development opportunities the greater their knowledge of natural and communal environments become, the more they perceive that the natural and communal environment in which they live is threatened, and the greater their altruism toward others becomes. We propose that entrepreneurial knowledge plays a central role by moderating these effects.

Abstract: This study provides a comprehensive analysis of distribution channel choices of new entrepreneurial ventures (NEVs). First, factors that influence NEVs' choice of distribution channels are examined. Second, performance consequences of those choices are investigated. A research model drawing from transaction cost economics as well as customer relationship and strategy literature is developed. Data collected from 330 NEVs are used to test the proposed model. The results show that the identified antecedents explain a large part of the variance in NEVs' channel choice. Moreover, NEVs that accomplish a fit between their distribution channel system and transaction cost-, product-, strategy-, and competition-related variables tend to perform better. Findings are discussed in light of the specific characteristics of NEVs.

Abstract: Social venture capitalists (SVCs) have emerged to provide a new source of funding for social entrepreneurs. Building on organizational identity theory, we examine how the dual identity of social ventures grounded within the social and entrepreneurship sectors prompts SVCs to value the resources and goals of both sectors. We use policy capturing to study the decision rules of 44 SVCs, finding that criteria of both sectors influenced SVC assessments, and entrepreneurial sector criteria were relied on most strongly in these assessments. Furthermore, not all SVCs evaluate social ventures similarly; their social investment focus influences their emphasis on social and entrepreneurial sector criteria.

Abstract: This study aims to discover relationships using a resource-based view of entrepreneurship and the social value creation characteristics of 70 social entrepreneurs. This study builds on existing research that commercial and social entrepreneurs share similar operational processes by providing empirical support for these relationships from a sample of acknowledged successful social entrepreneurs and by applying a resource-based lens to the context of social entrepreneurship. Novel qualitative and quantitative content analysis techniques were applied to the online profiles of Ashoka Fellows. Statistically significant relationships were found among measures of partnerships, financial capital, innovativeness, organizational structure, and knowledge transferability. These findings suggest that social entrepreneurs, when viewed through a resource-based lens, demonstrate similar internal operational processes in utilizing resource bundles as commercial entrepreneurs.

Abstract: Institutional theory is an increasingly utilized theoretical lens for entrepreneurship research. However, while institutional theory has proven highly useful, its use has reached a point that there is a need to establish a clearer understanding of its wide-ranging application to entrepreneurship research. Therefore, we will initially review the existing entrepreneurship literature that employs institutional theory to both understand the current status of the field, its current shortcomings, and where we need to move in the future. We then summarize and discuss the articles in this special issue and how they contribute to this process of advancing institutional theory and its application in entrepreneurship research.

Abstract: We examine the impact that gender diversity has on angel group investment behavior for a sample of 183 group-years between 2000 and 2006. Our evidence suggests that gender diversity is a significant predictor of group investment behavior, and that the proportion of women angels in the group has a negative though nonlinear effect on investment likelihood. These data are most consistent with a situational interpretation that women invest differently when they are in the small minority compared with other situations. These results have important implications for the availability of funds for women entrepreneurs and call for greater participation of women investors in the angel marketplace.

Abstract: As entrepreneurship emerges into an independent field of study, it is important for scholars and administrators to have a good understanding of the main channels for disseminating knowledge within this field. Here, we provide a new evaluation of journals devoted to entrepreneurship, plus more general journals that publish entrepreneurship articles. The evaluation uses a citation-based model to rate journals. This model overcomes some limitations inherent in the widely known “JIFs” approach. The model is used to derive ratings that shows the relative influences of established journals that publish research dealing with the entrepreneurship domain. In addition to being a way to gauge the influence that a particular journal has had on this domain, a journal's rating can serve as an early proxy for measuring the influence of individual entrepreneurship articles that have yet to have an opportunity to accumulate citations.

Abstract: Business goals in family businesses are often subsumed by family goals. As a result, reference performance for each family business is different. This makes the popular financial performance measure of publicly traded companies, profit maximization, insufficient for family businesses. We believe that for evaluating family businesses, the family members' satisfaction with firm performance is a better measure of performance. In the study, we identify three predictors of family members' satisfaction with firm performance and test the proposed linkages on two samples of family businesses.

Author-Name: Tonoyan, Vartuhí

Author-Name: Perlitz, Manfred
Abstract: This article explores the determinants of corruption in transition economies of the post-Soviet Union, Central-Eastern Europe, and Western industrialized states. We look in-depth at the East–West gap in corruption, and why entrepreneurs and small business owners become engaged in corrupt deals. Part of the answers lie in the country-specific formal and informal institutional make-up. The likelihood of engaging in corruption is influenced by the lower efficiency of financial and legal institutions and the lack of their enforcements. Also, viewing illegal business activities as a widespread business practice provides the rationale for entrepreneurs to justify their own corrupt activities. Moreover, closed social networks with family, friends, and national bureaucrats reduce the opportunism of the contracting party of the corrupt deal, thus providing breeding grounds for corruption.

Title: The Impact of Environment and Entrepreneurial Perceptions on Venture‐Creation Efforts: Bridging the Discovery and Creation Views of Entrepreneurship
Author-Name: Edelman, Linda
Author-Name: Yli‐Renko, Helena
Abstract: Recent literature has highlighted two conflicting theories of entrepreneurship. In the “discovery” perspective, objective environmental conditions are considered to be the source of entrepreneurial opportunities and thus drivers of subsequent entrepreneurial action. The “creation” view, in contrast, is based on entrepreneurial perceptions and socio-cognitive enactment processes. While empirical studies have separately utilized each of these perspectives, few attempts have been made to integrate insights from both theories to empirically examine the interrelationships among environmental conditions, entrepreneurial perceptions, entrepreneurial action, and outcomes. In this article, we explicate the roles that both objective environmental conditions and entrepreneurial perceptions of opportunity and resource availability play in the process of firm creation. Utilizing longitudinal data on nascent entrepreneurs, we find that as hypothesized, entrepreneurs' opportunity perceptions mediate between objective characteristics of the environment and the entrepreneurs' efforts to start a new venture. Contrary to our expectations, we do not find a similar mediating effect for perceived resource availability. These findings have important implications for further theory development in entrepreneurship as well as for practice and education in the field.

Author-Name: Kreiser, Patrick M.

Author-Name: Weaver, K. Mark
Abstract: This study utilizes data from 1,048 firms in six countries to assess the impact of national culture and certain institutions that are representative of national culture on two key dimensions of entrepreneurial orientation: risk taking and proactiveness. Eight hypotheses are developed specifying the expected relationships between four cultural dimensions and levels of risk taking and proactiveness within SMEs. Additionally, two hypotheses are developed to explore between-country differences in the relationship between risk taking and proactiveness and a range of institutional variables. Uncertainty avoidance and power distance are both found to have a significant negative influence on risk taking; uncertainty avoidance, individualism, and power distance are found to negatively influence proactive firm behaviors. A number of institutional factors are also found to be significantly linked to between-country differences in both risk taking and proactive behaviors. This research contributes to existing theories of national culture by suggesting that the various dimensions of cultural values and several of the institutions that are representative of national culture impact the willingness of entrepreneurial firms to display risk taking and proactive behaviors.

Title: The Legitimacy of Social Entrepreneurship: Reflexive Isomorphism in a Pre‐Paradigmatic Field
Author-Name: Nicholls, Alex
Abstract: Following Kuhn, this article conceptualizes social entrepreneurship as a field of action in a pre-paradigmatic state that currently lacks an established epistemology. Using approaches from neo-institutional theory, this research focuses on the microstructures of legitimation that characterize the development of social entrepreneurship in terms of its key actors, discourses, and emerging narrative logics. This analysis suggests that the dominant discourses of social entrepreneurship represent legitimating material for resource-rich actors in a process of reflexive isomorphism. Returning to Kuhn, the article concludes by delineating a critical role for scholarly research on social entrepreneurship in terms of resolving conflicting discourses within its future paradigmatic development.

Abstract: Researchers claim that social entrepreneurship represents a new phenomenon within the social sector. Their studies often distinguish social entrepreneurs according to their emphasis on tracking and measuring their performance. By applying sense making theory to three case studies of funding relationships within the social sector, this study finds that organizations within the social sector employ performance measurement not just as a means of accountability, but also as a tool for making sense of social entrepreneurship as an organizational identity. As such, the article refocuses scholarly attention on social entrepreneurship as a socially constructed phenomenon.

Two engineering students and two faculty members at a land grant university in the United States designed a retrofit kit to vastly reduce emissions from dirty two-stroke motorcycles, which are used throughout Asian cities as taxis. This case presents the beginnings of the Envirofit story, and the issues involved in creating an entrepreneurial venture focused on triple bottom line objectives in “base of pyramid” markets. Specifically, the case examines the ambiguity facing a start-up as it begins to develop a technology, a business model, and a management team. The case demonstrates the tension between planning and doing in managing the uncertainty facing a new venture.

Abstract: This article investigates whether bribery in emerging economies matters and whether such bribery has a diminishing return to performance. Bribery allows entrepreneurs to develop and foster a network of informal relationships with public officials, and reap the accompanying benefits; but it may also have disadvantages, such as an inefficient allocation of resources. The relationship between bribery and performance was estimated using unique data derived from a survey of 606 Vietnamese entrepreneurs. We controlled for various entrepreneurial, organizational, and industrial characteristics. The exploratory results provide support for a hill-shaped non-monotonic relationship between bribery and revenues.

Abstract: This case deals with the dilemma faced by an entrepreneur named John Styles who was faced with the decision of whether or not to enter into a partnership with M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston to build a Proton Cancer Therapy Center. The decision was clouded by the fact that most of the $100 million investment required for the venture would be invested in facilities and technology that could be used for nothing else if the project failed. In addition, the typical venture capitalists who would normally invest in such a venture would not find this deal enticing because of the long time lag to profitability.

Abstract: Drawing from stewardship theory, we investigated corporate entrepreneurship in family firms. We argued that stewardship culture determinants––comprehensive strategic decision making, participative governance, long-term orientation, and human capital––differentiate the most entrepreneurial family firms. Based on a study of 179 family firms, we showed that comprehensive strategic decision making and long-term orientation contribute to corporate entrepreneurship. Additionally, family-to-firm unity enhanced the positive effects participative governance and long-term orientation have on corporate entrepreneurship. While we found that family-to-firm unity can compensate for low human capital, unexpectedly, we also found that family-to-firm unity can dampen the positive relationship between human capital and corporate entrepreneurship.

Title: Parent–Child Relationships: Planting the Seeds of Deviant Behavior in the Family Firm
Author-Name: Eddleston, Kimberly A.
Author-Name: Kidwell, Roland E.
Abstract: We posit that parent–child relationships lead to subsequent leader–member exchange (LMX) differentiation in family firms. This differentiation shapes a child's behavior toward the firm. Altruism is proposed to further increase the effects of LMX differentiation on workplace behavior by fostering feelings of entitlement or rebellion among out-group children and strengthening in-group children's commitment to the firm. Our article breaks new ground by explaining how parent–child relationships and LMX can result in deviant behavior in family firms, how parental altruism can create vicious and virtuous circles of behavior and how stewardship and opportunism can occur within the same family firm.

Title: Perceived Labor Productivity in Small Firms—The Effects of High‐Performance Work Systems and Group Culture Through Employee Retention
Author-Name: Patel, Pankaj C.
Author-Name: Conklin, Betty
Abstract: In small firms, high-performance work systems (HPWS) may not always yield benefits that outweigh their costs. Using a sample of 145 small enterprises (SEs) with 10–100 employees, we examine how small firms may realize mutually reinforcing effects of group culture on HPWS to increase employee retention and improve perceived labor productivity. Using a novel methodology, we find that employee retention does not mediate the effects of HPWS on perceived labor productivity, but that mediation becomes significant and increases with greater levels of group culture. This study provides insights into conditions in which HPWS can enhance SE perceived labor productivity.

Abstract: The increased pressure put on public research institutes to commercialize their research results has given rise to an increased academic interest in technology transfer. We assess under which conditions tacit knowledge transfer contributes to the performance of academic spin-offs. Using an inductive case study approach, our evidence suggests that tacit knowledge is most effectively transferred when a substantial part of the original research team joins the new venture as founders. Commercial expertise and mindset are also required in the team on the condition that the cognitive distance between the scientific researchers and the person responsible for commercialization is not too large.

Title: Institutions, Latent Entrepreneurship, and Self‐Employment: An International Comparison
Author-Name: Gohmann, Stephan F.
Abstract: This paper examines how the institutional environment in 18 countries affects the self-employment decision, as well as the preferences of latent entrepreneurs—individuals who prefer to be self-employed. Latent entrepreneurs fall into two groups, those who are currently self-employed and those who are not—the “truly latent entrepreneurs.” These two groups differ in their responses to changes in the institutional environment. An occupational choice model where institutions affect switching costs informs the empirical model. As institutions such as economic freedom improve, preferences for self-employment increase for both groups, but the effect is greater for those who are currently self-employed.

Abstract: Using behavioral and stakeholder theories, we suggest that family firms may have family-centered non-economic goals and that these goals could influence firm behaviors. This study extends the literature by hypothesizing that the essence of family influence partially mediates the relationship between family involvement and family firms' adoption of family-centered non-economic goals. The results using 1,060 small firms support the hypotheses. Aside from contributing to family business theory by explaining and testing mediating variables as sources of goal heterogeneity among family firms, our findings also imply that the involvement and essence approaches to defining family businesses may be hierarchically reconciled.

Abstract: In 2001, the United Parcel Service (UPS) purchased the entire Mail Boxes Etc. (MBE) franchise system. After test marketing several new concepts in 2003, the corporation strongly encouraged franchise owners to reposition their MBE outlets as “The UPS Store.” Joseph and Courtney Morris, owners of a thriving MBE outlet, faced a quandary: should they retain their well-established MBE identity, adopt the new UPS brand name, or sell their franchise outright? The case incorporates both family issues and business factors as the franchisees struggle with a decision that could have significant impacts on their financial future.

Abstract: To sense and adapt to uncertainty by leveraging prior entrepreneurial knowledge is a critical ability. However, for many individuals, prior entrepreneurial knowledge is absent or underdeveloped. We investigate the ability of individuals without prior entrepreneurial knowledge to effectively adapt decision policies in response to feedback, while performing an entrepreneurial task. We model 10,000 “entrepreneurial decisions” nested within 217 individuals, to demonstrate how differences in metacognitive ability and feedback type promote (or alternatively impede) cognitive adaptability. Our findings suggest insights into the interplay between knowledge, learning, and cognition that are generalizable to activities and actions central to the entrepreneurial process.

Abstract: In this article, we study the determinants of corporate entrepreneurial intention (CEI) within small and newly established firms. Given that in these ventures, entrepreneurial activities usually occur as a result of individuals' behaviors, the CEI of their founders is key to explaining these companies' ability to become engaged in entrepreneurial actions. Building on the theory of planned behavior, we conceptualize how individual characteristics and contextual variables influence CEI. Our theoretical model of the micro-foundation of CEI is tested on a sample of 200 entrepreneurs, founders of 133 new technology-based firms.

Abstract: We provide an overview of the articles and commentaries devoted to theories of family enterprise in this special issue and link them to the concept of trust. Trust is a governance mechanism and theoretical construct of particular relevance for family firms, encapsulating some of their advantages and disadvantages. Trust is also linked to theoretical frameworks such as agency theory, stewardship theory, social capital theory, and transaction cost economics that are often used in family business studies, including those found in this special issue. Consequently, we advance trust as a bridging concept to reconcile and enhance our understanding of family firms as a unique organizational form.

Author-Name: Morris, Michael H.

Author-Name: Brannon, David
Abstract: An experiential perspective for examining family business creation is introduced. As a “lived experience,” the family firm generates a cumulative series of interdependent events that takes on properties rooted in affect. The family business is a context that enables unscripted temporal performances by founders. Characteristics of the venture creation experience are examined, and underlying dimensions are proposed and empirically investigated. Building on social capital theory, differences in experiences between founders of family businesses, nonfamily managers, and founders of nonfamily ventures are explored. These differences are argued to have important implications for decision making and ongoing dynamics within the family firm.

Title: Emotions and Family Business Creation: An Extension and Implications
Author-Name: Stanley, Laura J.
Abstract: Morris, Allen, Kuratko, and Brannon found that family founders, nonfamily managers working in family firms, and nonfamily founders experience a wide range of emotions during the first 4 years of establishing a new business. They identify differences in the emotional experiences of these three groups. I extend their findings by suggesting that divergent emotional experiences may explain differences in risk-taking behavior between family and nonfamily firms, and between family firms. Furthermore, I suggest that family founders' early emotional experiences may affect the firm's culture, strategy, and decision-making processes well beyond the start-up phase.

Title: Is Blood Thicker Than Water? A Study of Stewardship Perceptions in Family Business

Author-Name: Hayes, H. David
Abstract: Stewardship theory has been used to explain the culture and relationships within family businesses. Researchers have also demonstrated that stewardship leads to superior family business performance. To date, few empirical analyses have examined the situational mechanisms associated with stewardship in family business. This paper examines the role of the family in explaining stewardship within a family business, including the role of trust, value commitment, and agency. We find that value commitment, trust, and agency perceptions explain a significant portion of stewardship variance for family and nonfamily business employees. We further find that family member employees perceive significantly higher value commitment, trust, and stewardship perceptions and lower agency perceptions in family firm leadership than nonfamily members, suggesting that blood is indeed thicker than water.

Abstract: Davis, Allen, and Hayes found that family members employed by the family firm reported significantly higher levels of perceived stewardship than nonfamily members. We extend their research by exploring how stewardship in family firms can be further expanded throughout the firm using the theoretical perspective of leader–member exchange (LMX) theory. Particularly in family firms, the leader's stewardship behaviors may establish a culture of stewardship throughout the firm. The resulting reciprocal stewardship behaviors of employees can be explained through LMX mechanisms. Propositions are offered to explore conditions where the family firm context provides a unique opportunity for creating a culture of reciprocal stewardship.

Title: The Impact of Family Representation on CEO Compensation

Abstract: Understanding the nature of family representation in public firms has been an important topic for entrepreneurship research. Because CEO compensation is a key tool that boards use to align the interests of shareholders and managers, researchers have taken steps toward understanding how family representation affects CEO compensation. Prior research has painted family-member CEOs as stewards who accept lower compensation. Based on agency theory, we describe a different scenario wherein family representatives engage in strategic control that reduces family-member CEOs' compensation. Thus, family-member CEOs accept lower compensation only when additional family members are represented in management or on the board. In comparison with CEOs at nonfamily firms, we find that family-member CEO compensation is 13% lower when multiple family members are involved, but 56% higher when the CEO is the lone family member.

Title: Markets, Hierarchies, and Families: Toward a Transaction Cost Theory of the Family Firm
Author-Name: Gedajlovic, Eric
Author-Name: Carney, Michael
Abstract: Why do family businesses exist? What factors explain their versatility, limitations, and success within and across different industrial and geographic contexts? We develop a transaction cost framework that addresses these questions. In doing so, we identify a class of assets we term generic nontradeables (GNTs), that are firm specific, but generic in application. While many types of firms may possess such assets, we reason that family firm governance provides relative advantages in developing, sustaining, and appropriating value from GNTs through combinations with other types of assets. We propose that these advantages, as well as some concomitant disadvantages, explain the versatility, limitations, and success of family business enterprise.

We show that both the exposure and response to bounded rationality and bounded reliability challenges may be different in family firms versus Chandlerian hierarchies, and introduce the new concept of family-based human asset specificity.

Abstract: In this article, we explore how new capabilities emerge and solidify in new ventures that are faced with fundamental uncertainty from their environment.

Using initial qualitative evidence from a multifirm study in the context of new venture internationalization, we develop a cognition-based model of capability emergence in new ventures. Our findings extend the capability development and learning implications of internationalization to the fundamental character of organizing processes in start-ups. Moreover, we derive avenues for future entrepreneurship research on the origins and evolution of capabilities in new ventures.

Title: The Rewards of Entrepreneurship: Exploring the Incomes, Wealth, and Economic Well‐Being of Entrepreneurial Households
Author-Name: Carter, Sara
Abstract: The financial rewards and consequences of entrepreneurship for the individual are unknown. Prior studies have focused on self-employment income estimates and have highlighted the low median earnings that may be anticipated. The apparent financial irrationality of entrepreneurship is typically explained in terms of nonpecuniary compensating factors, such as autonomy and satisfaction. However, the financial rewards of entrepreneurship are multifaceted and include different types and amounts of rewards at different stages of the business life cycle. More accurate reflections of entrepreneurial rewards require researchers to move away from the use of narrow and static measures and instead focus on a broad set of indicators that collectively contribute to overall economic well-being. Entrepreneurial rewards are not only determined by business rationality, but are influenced by household needs that evolve over time. Hence, the analysis of entrepreneurial rewards requires an approach that captures the processes of reward decision making over the business life cycle while contextualizing reward decisions within the entrepreneurial household.

Title: Grappling With the Unbearable Elusiveness of Entrepreneurial Opportunities
Author-Name: Dimov, Dimo
Abstract: The notion of opportunity, as currently discussed in entrepreneurship research, is theoretically exciting but empirically elusive. This article seeks to stimulate a new conversation about entrepreneurial opportunities by distinguishing two conceptions of entrepreneurial behavior—formal and substantive—and situating the construct of opportunity within the latter. It discusses three substantive premises for studying opportunities empirically: (1) opportunity as happening; (2) opportunity as expressed in actions; and (3) opportunity as instituted in market structures. These premises stimulate research questions that can invigorate and expand the study of entrepreneurial opportunities. They invite a continuous dialogue between qualitative and quantitative methodologies in behalf of understanding how opportunities emerge and evolve at the level of individual entrepreneurs.

Abstract: While the term “business model” has gained widespread use in the practice community, the academic literature on this topic is fragmented and confounded by inconsistent definitions and construct boundaries. In this study, we review prior research and reframe the business model with an entrepreneurial lens. We report on a discourse analysis of 151 surveys of practicing managers to better understand their conceptualization of a business model. We find that the underlying dimensions of the business model are resource structure, transactive structure, and value structure, and discuss the nature and implications of dimensional dominance for firm characteristics and behavior. These findings provide new directions for theory development and empirical studies in entrepreneurship by linking the business model to entrepreneurial cognition, opportunity co-creation, and organizational outcomes.

Abstract: In this essay, we outline the provocative argument that in the realm of human affairs there exists an “entrepreneurial method” analogous to the scientific method spelled out by Francis Bacon and others with regard to the natural realm. We then suggest a series of open questions that we believe will help future scholars spell out the contents of such a method and ways in which it can be put to work in the design and achievement of socioeconomic ends. At least one normative implication of accepting the argument would be to teach entrepreneurship not only to entrepreneurs but to everyone, as a necessary and useful skill and an important way of reasoning about the world.

Abstract: Informed by the sustainable development and entrepreneurship literatures we offer the following definition: Sustainable entrepreneurship is focused on the preservation of nature, life support, and community in the pursuit of perceived opportunities to bring into existence future products, processes, and services for gain, where gain is broadly construed to include economic and non-economic gains to individuals, the economy, and society. To illustrate the diversity of potential research avenues that will advance this field, we offer a research agenda derived from an economics, an institutional, and a psychology perspective. We suggest research questions exploring “what is to be sustained” and “what is to be developed” in sustainable entrepreneurship research.

Title: Contextualizing Entrepreneurship—Conceptual Challenges and Ways Forward 
Author-Name: Welter, Friederike
Abstract: This paper sets out to explore contexts for entrepreneurship, illustrating how a contextualized view of entrepreneurship contributes to our understanding of the phenomenon. There is growing recognition in entrepreneurship research that economic behavior can be better understood within its historical, temporal, institutional, spatial, and social contexts, as these contexts provide individuals with opportunities and set boundaries for their actions. Context can be an asset and a liability for the nature and extent of entrepreneurship, but entrepreneurship can also impact contexts. The paper argues that context is important for understanding when, how, and why entrepreneurship happens and who becomes involved. Exploring the multiplicity of contexts and their impact on entrepreneurship, it identifies challenges researchers face in contextualizing entrepreneurship theory and offers possible ways forward.

Author-Name: McMullen, Jeffery S.
Abstract: Development economists and management scholars have called for a more market-based approach to address the extreme poverty suffered by the billion people residing primarily in least developed countries. This article proposes a theory of development entrepreneurship that blends business entrepreneurship, social entrepreneurship, and institutional entrepreneurship to accelerate the institutional change necessary to make economic growth more inclusive. After examining various explanations of market failure in the base of the pyramid and social entrepreneurship literatures, I explain why entrepreneurial transformation of formal institutions is needed and what differentiates development entrepreneurship from related concepts such as social entrepreneurship, social business entrepreneurship, and socio-political activism.

Abstract: Based on a sample of 425 SMEs, we investigate whether intergenerational differences affect the capital structure and growth behavior of family firms. We integrate the financing and growth relation into our research by using a 2SLS approach and the internal and sustainable growth concepts. Evidence is found that the capital structure is not directly influenced by the managing generation, but indirectly through the realized growth rate. Moreover, results indicate that next-generation companies grow slower because they have the tendency to forego part of their growth rather than risk the loss of family control due to the increased use of debt.

Title: Resource Mobilization in International Social Entrepreneurship: Bricolage as a Mechanism of Institutional Transformation
Author-Name: Desa, Geoffrey
Abstract: International entrepreneurs are often confronted with unfavorable normative, regulatory, and cognitive institutional environments. Those entrepreneurial firms that successfully navigate this uneven terrain appear to defy institutional constraint and create economic growth. Yet little is known about how ventures develop in unfavorable institutional environments, particularly in terms of social entrepreneurship. Contrary to the predominant view of resource mobilization, this article finds that social entrepreneurs confronted with institutional constraints engage in bricolage to reconfigure existing resources at hand. In the process, bricolage can act as a legitimating mechanism for institutional change. This article examines how regulatory, political, and technological institutions affect resource-mobilization in 202 technology social ventures from 45 countries. The implications for social entrepreneurship and for institutionally embedded entrepreneurial action are discussed.

Title: Analyzing the Influence of Gender Upon High‐Technology Venturing Within the Context of Business Incubation
Author-Name: Marlow, Susan
Author-Name: McAdam, Maura
Abstract: We explore the influence of sex role attribution and associated gendered ascriptions upon the entrepreneurial experiences of a female high-technology business owner operating within the context of business incubation. Our literature analysis and empirical evidence suggest that stereotypical gendered expectations surrounding incubated high-technology venturing reproduce masculine norms of entrepreneurial behavior. The adoption of a gendered perspective to explore the experience of business incubation responds to contemporary calls to embed feminist analyses within the entrepreneurial field of enquiry. Furthermore, we draw upon evidence from a detailed case study informed by a life history narrative to explore a female entrepreneur's experience of incubated high-technology entrepreneurship.

Title: The Measurement of Entrepreneurial Orientation
Author-Name: Covin, Jeffrey G.
Author-Name: Wales, William J.
Abstract: This article explores how the concept of entrepreneurial orientation (EO) has been portrayed and assessed in prior research. The challenges and decision criteria associated with formative versus reflective measurement approaches are reviewed. It is argued that, as a latent construct, EO exists apart from its measures and that researchers are free to choose whichever measurement approach best serves their research purposes, recognizing that unidimensional versus multidimensional EO measurement models are consistent with fundamentally different conceptualizations of the EO construct. Recommendations are offered regarding potentially appropriate formative and reflective measures of EO.

Title: Is Age a Determinant of SMEs' Financing Decisions? Empirical Evidence Using Panel Data Models
Author-Name: Serrasqueiro, Zélia
Author-Name: Nunes, Paulo Maçãs
Abstract: Using panel data models, this study investigates whether firm's age is a determinant of Portuguese SMEs' financing decisions. The results suggest that age is relevant for: the impact of financial deficit on variations of short- and long-term debt; the level of adjustment of short- and long-term debt toward the respective optimal levels; and the relationships between usual determinants and short- and long-term debt. The results for young and old SMEs suggest that Trade-Off Theory and Pecking Order Theory should not be considered to be mutually exclusive, since both theories are necessary to understand the SMEs' capital structure decisions throughout their life-cycle.

Author-Name: Swinney, Jane L.
Abstract: The entrepreneurial orientation (EO) scale has become the most widely used scholarly measure of entrepreneurial behavior. Additionally, it is frequently used in studying entrepreneurship in non-Western cultures. In the current study, the authors respond to calls for cross-cultural validation of measures used in international research by assessing the measurement invariance of the most frequently utilized EO scale. Using samples of small and medium-sized firms from the United States and China, the authors assess the dimensionality of EO, optimal number of scale items, and the measurement invariance of the construct across cultures. The results support conceptualizing EO as multidimensional, using an 8-item version, and utilizing it in cross-cultural research settings in certain instances.

Title: The Emotional Embeddedness of Corporate Entrepreneurship: The Case of Envy
Author-Name: Biniari, Marina G.
Abstract: This article argues for the emotional embeddedness of the entrepreneurial act as a moderator of its social embeddedness. Building on the theoretical grounds of the sociology of emotions, we propose the study of entrepreneurial affect as an element of the social–emotional interaction between the entrepreneur and the others who are influenced by the entrepreneurial process. The empirical context of corporate entrepreneurship is used to illustrate how the emotion cycle around the entrepreneurial act, involving the emotions of corporate entrepreneurs and others, indicates the emotional embeddedness of the latter. The emergence of envy toward members of two venturing programs is used to exemplify low levels of emotional and consequently social embeddedness.

Author-Name: Michael, Steven C.
Abstract: Anecdotal evidence suggests that franchisors use multiunit franchising to reward franchisees. In this paper, we model multiunit franchising as the reward in a tournament—one solution to the franchising agency problem. We use a unique database of 68 restaurant franchisors and find support for the tournament model. Franchisors that seek franchisees with managerial experience and franchisors that build routines to share knowledge use more multiunit franchising. Also, franchisors that grow faster use more multiunit franchising than franchisors that grow more slowly, suggesting that faster-growing franchisors use multiunit franchising as a reward in a tournament to reduce agency problems.

Title: A Strategic Deviance Perspective on the Franchise Form of Organizing
Author-Name: Kidwell, Roland E.
Author-Name: Nygaard, Arne
Abstract: Drawing on various theoretical perspectives, we propose that franchisors cannot assess and control opportunism absent comparative information provided by owning and operating some of their outlets and by franchising others. Moving beyond dyadic perspectives, we propose that the concept of strategic deviance suggests why franchisors accept deviant behavior resulting from vertical and horizontal agency problems in multiagent contracts. A plural form provides efficiency and quality benchmark information that curbs even greater levels of shirking and free-riding behaviors and enhances system performance. Opportunistic behaviors by company managers and franchisees are addressed through self-enforced social control and social comparison mechanisms.

Title: The Structure of Decision Rights in Franchising Networks: A Property Rights Perspective
Author-Name: Mumdžiev, Nada
Author-Name: Windsperger, Josef
Abstract: This paper explains the structure of decision rights in franchising networks using property rights theory. Property rights theory explains the allocation of decision rights based on the importance of intangible assets. We submit that franchisees' fraction of decision rights varies positively with the contractibility of local market assets and negatively with contractibility of system-specific assets. Further, franchisees' less contractible innovation assets impact decision rights allocations more than contractible operation assets. Hypotheses tested on data from German franchisors are largely supportive. We extend the franchise literature by arguing that the contractibility of local market assets impacts the allocation of decision rights, and that decision rights allocations change for decisions involving different areas of the value chain.

Author-Name: Sirmon, David G.
Abstract: The paucity of research examining family firms engaged with franchising is surprising. We theorize about differences in franchising behavior between family and nonfamily firms and the relative advantages accruing to family firms in this context. We also explore how selection processes tend to lead to family franchisor/family franchisee matches that enable a more effective sharing of complementary resources. The theoretical framework we develop is grounded in the “familiness” of the family firm as suggested by the logic of the resource-based view. Additionally, our theoretical analysis extends and complements the frequent use of agency theory as the basis for studying franchising.

Abstract: We report the results of a survey of key thought leaders within the entrepreneurship field centered on the relationship between franchising and entrepreneurship. Specifically, we asked members of the Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice editorial board whether they consider franchisors to be entrepreneurs, whether they consider franchisees to be entrepreneurs, whether they consider research on franchising to be entrepreneurship research, and how they view the quality of franchising research compared with the quality of entrepreneurship research in general. Their collective responses offer important implications for franchising research. One implication is that franchising research needs to become more theoretically robust. A second is that the concepts of opportunity recognition, risk, organizational size, stage of organizational development, and organizational autonomy need to be taken into account when studying franchising.

Author-Name: Short, Jeremy C.
Abstract: For decades, most franchising research leveraged one of three theoretical milestones—resource scarcity, agency theory, and plural form symbiosis—to answer questions about why, where, and how often firms use franchising. Today's franchising researchers are leveraging new theories, investigating under-examined aspects of franchising, and exploring contextual factors that shape its use. The articles in the special issue continue these “New Directions in Franchising Research.” This introduction describes the three milestones that form the theoretical foundation for today's new directions, summarizes the special issue articles and their implications, and explains why entrepreneurship researchers are well-positioned to advance knowledge about franchising.1

Abstract: Although academic research has provided tremendous insights about the organizational form of franchising, considerable work remains with regard to understanding the critical factors that enable international franchise expansion and performance. The authors advance the argument that a franchise relationship is essentially an entrepreneurial partnership, and that this partnership influences the speed, scale, and scope of franchise expansion into international markets. In the proposed conceptual model, the authors detail the links among the franchise partnership, international expansion, and franchise system performance.

Abstract: Social exchange theory provides the basis for developing a model where collaborative communication from the franchisor relates positively to commitment, and commitment relates negatively to franchisees' propensity to leave the relationship. We analyze data from a unique dataset of 200 franchisees and find partial support for this model; franchisor communication positively relates to one dimension of franchisee commitment, and one dimension of commitment negatively relates to propensity to leave. The study expands franchising theory by examining the franchising relationship from a social exchange perspective and by empirically demonstrating the important role commitment plays in the franchising context.

Abstract: Microfranchising has attracted interest as a potential strategy for rapid scaling within base-of-the-pyramid (BOP) markets. However, our findings suggest that while microfranchising might provide a number of social benefits to microfranchisees and underserved communities, the institutional contexts that characterize BOP markets create a number of significant challenges to the economic sustainability of the microfranchisor and the overall microfranchising model. Simultaneously, our data also suggest several unique adaptations to the microfranchising model that might help mitigate the institutional challenges associated with agency concerns, resource scarcity, and branding/standardization within BOP markets.

Title: Governance, Social Identity, and Entrepreneurial Orientation in Closely Held Public Companies
Author-Name: Miller, Danny
Author-Name: Le Breton‐Miller, Isabelle
Abstract: Based on notions from the identity theory, this study argues that in public firms in which ownership is concentrated, owner-chief executive officer (CEO) identities will influence entrepreneurial orientation (EO), and EO will relate to superior performance. Specifically, lone founder owners and CEOs will embrace entrepreneurial identities: their firms will exhibit high levels of EO and outperform. Post-founder family owners and CEOs, given their ties to family in the organization, will assume identities as family nurturers, thereby limiting EO and performance. Family firm founders will exhibit blended identities and demonstrate intermediate levels of EO and performance. This analysis of Fortune 1000 firms finds support for these arguments.

Abstract: This study develops theoretical propositions regarding the role that entrepreneurial orientation (EO) plays in enhancing an organization's level of acquisitive and experimental learning. It also develops propositions concerning the manner in which a firm's ability to directly link itself to disparate sources of knowledge (network range) impacts the relationship between EO and acquisitive learning, as well as how a firm's ability to maintain a series of strong ties within a network (network closure) impacts the relationship between EO and experimental learning. Finally, propositions are developed regarding how firms can most effectively utilize EO and network participation to maximize levels of organizational learning while conserving their limited resources.

Abstract: While 30 years of entrepreneurial orientation (EO) research has demonstrated that EO provides critical insights into questions of organizational-level strategy and performance, how EO manifests inside organizations has received little attention. Instead of assuming that EO is homogenous, we examine the questions of how and why EO might pervade organizations heterogeneously along three dimensions: vertically across hierarchy levels, horizontally across business units, and temporally as an organization develops. We then present three models for how EO can dynamically pervade organizations and discuss how examining the pervasiveness of EO can further our understanding of entrepreneurship as an organizational phenomenon.

Title: Entrepreneurship as a Process: Toward Harmonizing Multiple Perspectives
Author-Name: Moroz, Peter W.
Author-Name: Hindle, Kevin
Abstract: Are there any common denominators within the diversity of entrepreneurship literature that may serve as foundations for understanding the entrepreneurial process in a systematic and comprehensive way that is useful to both scholars and practitioners? The objective of this paper was to discover about the entrepreneurial process what, if anything, is both generic (all processes that are “entrepreneurial” do this) and distinct (only entrepreneurial processes do this). Our approach was to evaluate published models of entrepreneurial process to discover what scholars have argued about what entrepreneurs do and how they do it (the processes they use) and to seek out any key commonalities that scholars claim are associated with the phenomenon. Unfortunately for the field, the investigation demonstrates that, as at the time of our investigation, the 32 extant models of entrepreneurial process are highly fragmented in their claims and emphases and are insufficient for establishing an infrastructure upon which to synthesize an understanding of entrepreneurial process that is both generic and distinct. Insights gained in the study lead to suggestions for future research and theory development of which the most urgent is the need to develop a single harmonized model of entrepreneurial process capable of embracing the best of what is on offer and adding new theoretical arguments in areas where practice shows that they are lacking.

Abstract: The nonprofit sector serves an increasingly important entrepreneurial role in the economy. Scholars have taken an interest in entrepreneurship in nonprofits and have drawn upon entrepreneurial orientation (EO) as a methodological tool to advance knowledge in this domain. However, the nonprofit context differs from the for-profit context for which the EO scale was developed, particularly with regard to motivations, processes, and outcomes. We propose a new approach for capturing the manifestation of EO in the nonprofit context. A typology is presented to highlight the multiple facets of EO in the nonprofit context. We conclude with implications for scholars and practitioners.

Author-Name: Shepherd, Dean A.
Abstract: This article examines two potential causal mechanisms underlying the observed entrepreneurial orientation (EO)–performance relationship. We find empirical support for the notion that EO might be a performance–variance-enhancing strategic orientation rather than a performance–mean-enhancing orientation. With such a conceptualization, performance variance (along with, or instead of, mean performance) and failure take center stage. To address the question of “where to from here,” we discuss a number of research opportunities that we believe are going to make important contributions to the entrepreneurship and strategy literature.

We suggest that the continued accumulation of knowledge in the field is best facilitated by conceptualizing EO as a reflective model utilizing three dimensions that can be extended through the use of a classical classification scheme and that additional subcategories of EO should be developed within the EO conceptual family utilizing new measurement items.

Author-Name: Collewaert, Veroniek
Abstract: This study examines the relationships among angel investor-entrepreneur relationship conflicts, task conflicts, and goal conflicts on the one hand and their intentions to exit on the other. I evaluate the hypotheses with survey data from 65 angel investors and 72 entrepreneurs belonging to 54 ventures located in either California or Belgium. Regression analyses indicate that entrepreneurial intentions to exit are higher for entrepreneurs who face more task and goal conflicts. Angel investors' intentions to exit are only increased when faced with more goal conflicts. Together, these results indicate the importance of taking into account investor-entrepreneur relations when studying their respective exit processes.

Abstract: Using Miller (1983) as a starting point, this article reviews the literature on entrepreneurial orientation or “EO.” It summarizes Miller's major points before recapping some of the subsequent literature and assessing why EO has become such a prominent topic. It identifies weaknesses in the literature, some of which, paradoxically, Miller wrote his article to guard against. It then makes recommendations for extending conceptually, and improving methodologically, future research on EO, arguing the importance of linking EO to current theories in strategy, organization theory, and economics. Methodological reorientations are also suggested to arrive at more cumulative and practical findings.

Title: The Role of Affect in the Creation and Intentional Pursuit of Entrepreneurial Ideas
Author-Name: Hayton, James C.
Author-Name: Cholakova, Magdalena
Abstract: The creation and intentional pursuit of entrepreneurial ideas lies at the core of the domain of entrepreneurship. Recent empirical work in a number of diverse fields such as cognitive psychology, social cognition, neuroscience, and neurophysiology all suggest that dual processes involving affect and cognition have a significant impact on judgment and decision making. Existing cognitive models ignore this significant role. In this article we develop a framework for understanding the role of affect on idea perception and the intention to develop the entrepreneurial idea. We present a set of testable propositions that link affect to entrepreneurial idea perception through its influence on attention, memory, and creativity. A second set of propositions links affect to the intention to pursue these ideas further. We explore the boundary conditions and moderators of the proposed relationships, and discuss the implications of this framework for existing cognitive and psychological perspectives on entrepreneurship.

Title: The Decision to Exploit Opportunities for Innovation: A Study of High‐Tech Small‐Business Owners
Author-Name: de Jong, Jeroen P.J.
Abstract: We collected longitudinal data from 160 high-tech small-business owners to analyze if the planned behavior constructs are related to their decision to innovate, as evidenced by their behavior (rather than their intentions to do so). Subjective norms and perceived behavioral control are directly related with innovation exploitation. Attitude towards the opportunity is significant only when respondents perceive both positive subjective norms and being in high control. This multiplicative effect suggests that the planned behavior constructs can be thought of as necessary conditions beneath which business owners are much less likely to exploit identified opportunities. Implications are discussed.

Title: University Departments and Self‐Employment Intentions of Business Students: A Cross‐Level Analysis
Author-Name: Walter, Sascha G.
Author-Name: Parboteeah, K. Praveen
Author-Name: Walter, Achim
Abstract: This study examines how characteristics of university departments impact students' self-employment intentions. We argue that four organizational-level factors (entrepreneurship education, entrepreneurship support programs, industry ties, and research orientation) increase such intentions. Using a data set of 1530 business students and 132 professors at 25 university departments, this study shows that entrepreneurship education and industry ties are related to self-employment intentions only for the males in our sample. A negative effect of the department's research orientation was found. Our study suggests that the organizational context plays an important but gender-specific role in shaping future entrepreneurs. Implications of our findings are discussed.

Abstract: Despite evidence that embedded ties are important to entrepreneurs seeking low-cost resources, no research to date has explored how this relationship unfolds in the context of emerging organizations, how the inevitable dependence on ties might drive up resource acquisition costs, or how the manner in which ties are embedded might affect the specificity of these resources. We develop a conceptual model that examines these relationships and, analyzing data from the Panel Study of Entrepreneurial Dynamics I, find support for the majority of our hypotheses. We then discuss the implications of our findings for scholars and practitioners.

Title: Cultural Contingency in the Cognitive Model of Entrepreneurial Intention
Author-Name: Siu, Wai‐sum
Author-Name: Lo, Eric Siu‐chung
Abstract: This study examines the impact of individualism–collectivism orientation on the cognitive model of entrepreneurial intention in a collectivist environment (i.e., China). Using a sample of 204 MBA students from China and Hong Kong, we investigate the moderating effect of self-construal on the relationship between perceptual factors and entrepreneurial intention. The results show that the strength of perceived social norms in predicting entrepreneurial intention depends on interdependent self-construal. The resulting nonsignificance of personal attitude contradicts findings reported in individualist contexts. This study develops a sound theory to explain the cultural contingency in the cognitive model of entrepreneurial intention.

Abstract: Brazilian entrepreneurs founded Trikke Tech Inc. in the United States in 2000 after an unsuccessful attempt to market their product—a human-propelled vehicle similar to a scooter—in Brazil. By 2006, Trikke Tech was a new international venture with manufacturing in China, marketing activities in the United States, R&D in Brazil, patents pending in 35 countries, and sales in 17 countries. This case study describes the company's initial steps and its strategy in the U.S. market and outlines the future challenges faced by the entrepreneurs. Specifically, the case addresses the question of how to position the new product to achieve market penetration in the United States, and which strategies and marketing programs to adopt, considering the firm's limited resources.

Author-Name: Marvel, Matthew R.
Abstract: What types of knowledge and experience enable those who have the desire to start a venture find an appropriate opportunity? To respond to this question, a human capital perspective is used with a sample of 166 founders of new technology ventures in university incubators. General human capital is assessed using experience depth and formal education. Specific human capital is measured using prior start-up experience as well as Shane's knowledge framework of markets, customer problems, and ways to serve markets. Findings reveal key aspects of human capital vital to explaining search-based discovery. Implications for research and entrepreneurship education are drawn.

Abstract: This paper develops an organizational identity-based rationale for why family firms strive for nonfinancial goals. We show that the visibility of the family in the firm, the transgenerational sustainability intentions of the family, and the capability of the firm for self-enhancement of the family positively influence the importance of identity fit between family and firm as well as the family's concern for corporate reputation. We suggest that the concern for corporate reputation leads the family to pursue nonfinancial goals to the benefit of nonfamily stakeholders. We also discuss reinforcing feedback loops in these processes.

Abstract: Franchisees participate in new business creation uniquely, because, in many respects, the development of their ventures is under the direction of franchisors. In this study, using entrepreneurial scripts, we compare the extent to which franchisee venturing is similar to and/or distinct from individual-based entrepreneurship in nonfranchise new ventures. We therefore examined the entrepreneurial scripts of individuals in a purposeful sample of 54 franchisees compared to two counterpart groups: 54 independent entrepreneurs and 94 managers (neither franchisee nor entrepreneur). Using MANCOVA and follow-up tests we find that franchisees are less like entrepreneurs and more similar to nonentrepreneur managers.

Title: Deciding to Persist: Adversity, Values, and Entrepreneurs’ Decision Policies
Author-Name: Holland, Daniel V.
Author-Name: Shepherd, Dean A.
Abstract: Entrepreneurial persistence occurs when the entrepreneur chooses to continue with an entrepreneurial opportunity regardless of counterinfluences or enticing alternatives. The decision to persist is influenced by personal characteristics and by feedback from the environment relative to thresholds. Using a conjoint experiment, we investigate how adversity and values influence the weight placed on the decision attributes for the persistence decisions of 100 entrepreneurs. The findings suggest that the persistence decision policies are heterogeneous depending on the level of adversity experienced and the individual values held by the entrepreneurs. The results provide interesting insights into why and how entrepreneurs choose to persist.

Title: Local and Systemic Entrepreneurship: Solving the Puzzle of Entrepreneurship and Economic Development
Author-Name: Sautet, Frederic
Abstract: Most economists agree that entrepreneurship has a positive effect on growth in developed countries. However, no evidence of this has been found in the case of developing countries. Rather, in many low-income countries, one can observe productive entrepreneurship but little corresponding development. This is the puzzle of entrepreneurship and development. To solve this puzzle, we propose to look at the notions of local and systemic entrepreneurship. Using recent research on the mechanisms of social cooperation, as well as network and firm theories, we offer an explanation of why entrepreneurship has a limited impact on growth in developing countries.

Abstract: This study considers the relationship between people's access to resources and their likelihood to start a new business, and particularly how this relationship might be moderated by formal and informal institutions. Individual-level resources might be more potent for new business creation in countries with financial and educational systems that are more oriented toward entrepreneurship, higher levels of trust, and cultures that are less hierarchical and conservative. The hypotheses are tested by undertaking random-effects multilevel analyses of a multi-source data set that spans a 5-year time period (2003–2007). The study's findings offer important implications for research and practice.

Author-Name: Spivack, April J.
Abstract: Building on affective events theory (AET), an experiential perspective for conceptualizing entrepreneurship is introduced. As a “lived experience,” entrepreneurship represents a cumulative series of interdependent events that takes on properties rooted in affect and emotion. Unique characteristics of entrepreneurial experiences are examined. The entrepreneur is presented as actor in an unscripted temporal performance who continually encounters novelty. A model and set of propositions are presented linking pre-venture experience, key events, experiential processing, learning, affective outcomes, and decision making. It is argued that the entrepreneur and venture emerge as a function of ongoing experience, with the venture creating the entrepreneur as the entrepreneur creates the venture.

Abstract: Scholars have suggested that counterfactual thinking may play an important role in entrepreneurship; however, empirical research positioned to inform the nature of this relationship has been equivocal. In this study, we draw on the tenets of social cognition theory as a basis to investigate the relationship between counterfactual thinking and the dispositional attributes of the entrepreneur, hypothesizing concomitant influences upon the entrepreneur's self-efficacy. Based on a survey of 138 entrepreneurs, our findings suggest that the implications of counterfactual thinking for entrepreneurial self-efficacy are moderated by individual differences based in the dispositional attributes of the entrepreneur.

Abstract: The domain definition of entrepreneurship research is “in play” as the Academy of Management Entrepreneurship Division prepares to submit a revision to its 1995 Domain Statement; and as “inclusive” vs. “distinctive” adjectives characterize the debate. In this essay, I argue that the inclusiveness/distinctiveness question itself poses a false dilemma detrimental to the development of entrepreneurship research as a field of excellence, when seen as a domain of increasing vs. decreasing returns. To encourage balanced discussion, I analyze the current and proposed domain statements according to their implicit worldview, content, basis for boundary setting, and implications for resolving domain-boundary conflicts.

Abstract: We examine network relationships, particularly the type and strength of these relationships and how firms use them in order to commercialize different types of innovations. We conduct an in-depth case study of four small firms to provide insight on how and why a portfolio of network relationships (e.g., suppliers, distributors, customers, and research institutes) helps small new innovative firms to gain resources. We develop a framework of four innovation types and expand on how successful commercialization for each innovation type requires certain types and strength of relationships. Both types (systemic and autonomous) of radical innovations require strong collaborative ties with customers, whereas incremental innovations are commercialized through different types of downstream networks.

Abstract: We investigate how an entrepreneur's behaviors during an initial interaction with a business angel can build, damage, or violate trust, and how the investor's level of trust (prompted by the entrepreneur's behavior) can affect his/her decision to make an investment offer. Our empirical analysis shows that entrepreneurs who receive offers from business angels exhibit a larger number of trust-building behaviors during the initial interaction and a smaller number of unintentional trust-damaging behaviors than those who do not receive an offer, and display few deliberate trust-violating behaviors. We further observe that the investor's deployment of a control mechanism is a prerequisite for receiving an investment offer for all entrepreneurs who damage or violate trust.

Abstract: This study examines the role of mixed emotions in the risk perception of entrepreneurs, an important determinant of entrepreneurial decision making. We extend the literature on mixed emotions by applying the cognitive appraisal tendency approach and contrasting it with ambivalence stemming from the valence-based approach. We test our hypotheses on a data set of 253 entrepreneurs from the United States. We show that mixed and conflicting emotions are an important predictor of the risk perception of entrepreneurs. At the same time, we find that emotional reactions of entrepreneurs on strategic issues change substantially as they found more ventures and become habitual entrepreneurs.

Abstract: Using the intellectual capital perspective as a theoretical framework, we develop a conceptual model of offshoring of knowledge-intensive, complex work by young, entrepreneurial firms.

In addition, we argue that offshoring of such activities can lead to innovation under certain intellectual capital configurations.

Title: Whitetracks Design, Inc.
Author-Name: Grove, Hugh
Author-Name: Cook, Tom
Abstract: Whitetracks Design, Inc. is one of the leading U.S. manufacturers of snowshoes. The business is owned by three individuals who are contemplating whether it should be sold now or continue to be operated for a later sale at a potentially enhanced business value. All the Whitetracks owners are now in their early 60s and are hoping for a comfortable retirement. Whether they retire sooner or later is dependent upon the proceeds from selling the business. Prior to selling, the owners want an accurate determination of the firm's value to ensure proper returns for years of hard work and personal investment. From an entrepreneurial standpoint, this case raises the issues of how private companies can be valued so that they can be subsequently managed for value creation. This is important as a 2005 survey found that only 60% of private company managers had at least some idea of their firms' value, and two thirds of these managers said that such firms' value was based upon management estimates or wishful thinking. To assist with determining the value of their business, the Whitetracks owners hired a merger and acquisition consultant, who is a coauthor of this case. The consultant will assist the owners in valuing the business and in making the decision to sell now or continue to operate the business.

Abstract: Our commentary addresses three papers that we believe make important contributions to the emerging literature on entrepreneurial orientation (EO). The first paper rigorously assesses and enhances the construct validity of EO—an important antecedent to empirical research. The second paper draws on the concepts of identity and social identity and provides a means of predicting how various ownership types of family firms will affect the EO-performance relationship. The third paper synthesizes multiple theoretical perspectives and empirical research to provide insights on the role that EO plays in enhancing a firm's acquisitive and experimental learning. We close with a discussion of EO as an area for theory development.

Abstract: This research examines the interplay of opportunity evaluation and emotions as determinants of entrepreneurial exploitation using affect-as-information theory and the affective processing principle as conceptual bases. Three central assumptions are confirmed across two studies. The first is that the effects of opportunity characteristics on exploitation are mediated by evaluation. The second is that emotions influence exploitation decisions in addition to evaluation. Fear reduces exploitation, whereas joy and anger increase it. The third is that fear, joy, and anger influence evaluation's effect on exploitation with higher levels of fear reducing and higher levels of joy and anger increasing the positive impact of evaluation on exploitation.

Title: Like Mother, Like Daughter? Analyzing Maternal Influences Upon Women's Entrepreneurial Propensity

Abstract: Within the phenomenon of entrepreneurship, the extant literature suggests that the normative actor is embodied by and through stereotypical masculinized characteristics. In this paper, we contextualize entrepreneurship as self-employment in order to explore how such stereotypical characterizations might influence women's attitudes toward this activity. However, rather than analyzing the confirmatory effects of stereotypes, we critically evaluate the effect of counterstereotypical characterizations upon women's propensity for self-employment. Drawing upon life-span data, we explore whether self-employed mothers disconfirm masculinized stereotypes and so act as positive role models for their daughters. As hypothesized, we found that maternal self-employment has a counterstereotypical effect and so positively influences daughters to become self-employed. These data indicate, however, that this effect is tempered by personal stereotypes held by daughters; moreover, it is shaped by significant life events (marriage, parenthood, education, and prior managerial experience). By using a robust data set, this paper contributes to our understanding of how stereotypes and role expectations influence women's propensity toward entrepreneurial activity.

Title: The Development of Social Capital and Financing of Entrepreneurial Firms: From Financial Bootstrapping to Bank Funding
Author-Name: Jonsson, Sara
Author-Name: Lindbergh, Jessica
Abstract: This paper uses a three-dimensional perspective on social capital to investigate how entrepreneurs develop their social capital when relying on bootstrapping strategies becomes insufficient and financing needs to be acquired from external debt and equity financiers. Findings from six case studies of entrepreneurs in the fashion industry show that to acquire funding, due to perceived deficiency in the existing network, entrepreneurs develop the structural dimension by adding relationships based on function. However, when seeking financial information that is perceived as sufficient in the existing network, they do so by developing cognitive and relational dimensions to preexisting network ties.

Abstract: How do entrepreneurs obtain the creative ideas they need to develop innovative new products? We interviewed 32 technology entrepreneurs to generate a grounded theory as to how technology entrepreneurs use social behaviors, techniques, and cognitive processes to generate, validate, and refine ideas for new products, processes, or services. The results reveal a complex, cyclical, and recursive multilevel social process emphasizing active and social experimentation. Greatest ideational productivity occurs when “trusted partners” exchange and refine ideas through a form of shared cognition. The findings will be useful to researchers and practitioners interested in entrepreneurship, social creativity, and management team dynamics.

Title: The Effects of General and Specific Human Capital on Long‐Term Growth and Failure of Newly Founded Businesses
Author-Name: Rauch, Andreas
Author-Name: Rijsdijk, Serge A.
Abstract: The model developed in this paper draws on human capital theory to explain how newly founded business ventures achieve long-term growth and reduce their chances of failure. Using a sample of 201 business start-ups and assessing growth and venture failure over a period of 12 years, we found that general and specific human capital lead to growth and failure in different ways. More specifically, we found that the effect of general human capital on failure was mediated by growth. Unexpectedly, specific human capital was not related to growth and had direct negative effects on business failure.

Title: Biohit: A Global, Family‐Owned Company Embarking on a New Phase
Author-Name: Kontinen, Tanja
Abstract: This case concerns Biohit, a family-owned biotechnology company established in Finland in 1988, selling liquid handling and diagnostics products in the global market. The case also describes the entrepreneurial career of Biohit's CEO Osmo Suovaniemi, since the company is mainly based on the know-how that Osmo gained as owner-manager of his two earlier companies, Labsystems and Eflab, during the 1970s and 1980s. Hence, this case describes the prior and initial phases of Biohit, examining also its commitment to innovation and its management practices. The case ends with the situation as of March 2010 and includes the reflections of Biohit's managers on the future of the company. At this point, Osmo was intending to hand over his executive position to someone from outside the family, on the grounds that none of his three sons was able or willing to take up the position. However, he planned to continue as owner, inventor, and full-time board member of Biohit. The managers of Biohit had high hopes of making a breakthrough with diagnostics products that had been under intensive development over a long period.

Title: When Contingency Is a Resource: Educating Entrepreneurs in the Balkans, the Bronx, and Beyond
Author-Name: Harmeling, Susan S.
Author-Name: Sarasvathy, Saras D.
Abstract: The research project described in this paper began as an inductive field study of entrepreneurship education in two very different settings—a university in war-torn Eastern Croatia and an entrepreneurship program in inner-city high schools in the United States. It evolved into a study of the two unlikely entrepreneurs who founded these education initiatives. Through a detailed counterfactual analysis of the narratives on the programs' founding and evolution, we offer compelling evidence for the role of contingency in the entrepreneurial process. We present an inductive conceptual framework of responses to contingency based on entrepreneurs' beliefs about agency and environment and conclude with implications of this research for entrepreneurship education.

Abstract: This two-year study with 122 business owners examined the link between affective well-being and task-oriented as well as relationship-oriented personal initiative (PI). We tested two complementary models explaining the link between well-being and PI: (1) broaden-and-build theory and (2) self-regulation as limited resource approach. In line with current research on well-being, we differentiated between hedonic and eudaimonic well-being using life satisfaction and vigor as indicators. Hierarchical regression analyses showed that only vigor predicted both forms of PI. Our results support the self-regulation approach and indicate that eudaimonic well-being is the relevant affective well-being dimension for proactive behavior.

Abstract: Drawing on theories of emotional contagion and goal setting, we propose two mechanisms as to how employees' perceptions of entrepreneurial passion influence their commitment to entrepreneurial ventures. Testing these mechanisms with data from a survey of 124 employees, we find that employees' perceptions of their supervisors' passion for inventing, founding, and developing differentially impact commitment. While perceptions of entrepreneurs' passion for inventing and developing enhance commitment, passion for founding reduces it. Employees' experiences of positive affect at work and their goal clarity mediate these effects. Our results have implications for the literature on entrepreneurial passion and leadership in entrepreneurial firms.

Title: Resilience of Family Firms: An Introduction
Author-Name: Chrisman, James J.

Author-Name: Steier, Lloyd P.
Abstract: Family firms have long been a prominent feature of the organizational landscape and researchers have found some variations of this organizational form to be more resilient than others. The articles and commentaries in this special issue address some of the bases of this resilience including arranged marriages as a management succession strategy, long-term orientation and multitemporal perspectives, knowledge structures and opportunity identification, and social capital and social exchange. This introduction to the eighth special issue on “theories of family enterprise” discusses the contributions made by the articles and commentaries to our understanding about the resilience of family firms.

Title: Must Love Kill the Family Firm? Some Exploratory Evidence
Author-Name: Mehrotra, Vikas

Abstract: Family firms depend on a succession of capable heirs to stay afloat. If talent and IQ are inherited, this problem is mitigated. If, however, progeny talent and IQ display mean reversion (or worse), family firms are eventually doomed. Since family firms persist, solutions to this succession problem must exist. We submit that marriage can transfuse outside talent and reinvigorate family firms. This implies that changes to the institution of marriage—notably, a decline in arranged marriages in favor of marriages for “love”—bode ill for the survival of family firms. Consistent with this, the predominance of family firms correlates strongly across countries with plausible proxies for arranged marriage norms.

Title: Long‐Term Orientation and Intertemporal Choice in Family Firms
Author-Name: Lumpkin, G. T.
Author-Name: Brigham, Keith H.
Abstract: A long-term orientation (LTO) is often associated with family firms, but the LTO construct is underdeveloped. This paper sets forth a framework for studying LTO in family firms including developing three dimensions—futurity, continuity, and perseverance. It identifies LTO as a higher-order heuristic that, in matters of intertemporal choice, provides a dominant logic for decisions and actions. Intertemporal choice refers to decisions with payoffs or outcomes that play out over time. Three mechanisms affecting intertemporal choices are identified—representation, self-control, and anticipation. LTO and intertemporal choice are further examined and discussed in the context of family firms.

Abstract: In this commentary, we argue the need for multitemporality (MT)—the ability to achieve enduring success by meeting both short- and long-term challenges—and we show how many family firms are in a superior position to do that. We situate Lumpkin and Brigham's (L&B's) long-term orientation (LTO) components within a multitemporal frame in part by relating them to their primary mechanisms of intertemporality. We then extend L&B's LTO conception by moving from an organizational mindset to its effective actualization via multitemporal facilitators as they manifest in family firms, arguing also the conditions under which family firms have an advantage in achieving MT. We conclude with a discussion of suggested research directions.

Title: Knowledge Combination and the Potential Advantages of Family Firms in Searching for Opportunities
Author-Name: Patel, Pankaj C.
Author-Name: Fiet, James O.
Abstract: This study examines differences in knowledge structures and combinative capabilities that provide family firms with distinct advantages over nonfamily firms in identifying opportunities. Drawing on constrained, systematic search, we explore how noneconomic goals and family relations enhance searching for opportunities. Unique human capital conditions create specific knowledge and economies of scope in knowledge combination. Differences in knowledge stocks, knowledge combination, and the long-term orientation of family firm managers explain differences in finding opportunities between family and nonfamily firms. Furthermore, we propose that family firms are more likely to improve their search routines over time. Fewer endgame scenarios in family firms allow the refinement of search routines.

Title: Commentary: Exploiting and Exploring New Opportunities Over Life Cycle Stages of Family Firms
Author-Name: Sharma, Pramodita
Author-Name: Salvato, Carlo
Abstract: Family firms vary with regards to success achieved in terms of opportunity creation and exploitation over time. Elaborating on this variation, this commentary argues that firms that simultaneously engage in multiple levels of innovation—incremental, progressive, and radical—are likely to enjoy sustainable performance advantages across generations. Toward this end, a strategic split of innovation responsibilities between family and nonfamily professionals is likely to be useful, contingent on the firm's life cycle and size. In terms of entrepreneurial expertise, a combination of causal and effectual thinking is necessary to ensure exploitation of already discovered or created opportunities and exploration of new ones.

Abstract: Drawing on the social capital literature, this study develops a new measure to assess the internal social capital using a sample of family firms and its effect on economic and noneconomic performance. We collected data from two independent samples to explore the importance of family businesses' internal social capital as assessed by a new instrument—the internal social capital among family business (ISC-FB). Results from confirmatory factor analyses, convergent and discriminant validity assessments, and predictive and incremental validity offered support for the ISC-FB's construct validity. Finally, we cross-validated the hypothesized factor structure with a second sample of family firms. Implications and future research using this measure are proposed.

Abstract: Entrepreneurial emotion refers to the affect, emotions, moods, and/or feelings—of individuals or a collective—that are antecedent to, concurrent with, and/or a consequence of, the entrepreneurial process, meaning the recognition/creation, evaluation, reformulation, and/or the exploitation of a possible opportunity. In this paper, we explore this working definition of entrepreneurial emotion, what it means, and some important advances the field has made in this area of research. We also highlight fundamental avenues for future research that are sorely in need of study. Finally, we introduce the seven papers in this special issue on the Heart of Entrepreneurship and how they move the conversation on entrepreneurial emotion forward.

Abstract: Article manuscripts are rarely accepted before being improved by their authors in response to editor recommendations. Therefore, authors who succeed in publishing their research in prestigious entrepreneurship journals must master the art of responding to critiques and critics while maintaining the integrity of their submissions. This article presents the results of a survey of editors to give authors authoritative guidelines for revising the presentation of their research so that their findings are more fully developed, accurately conveyed, and ultimately publishable. In a survey of 18 editors and associate editors of six top academic journals with missions to advance entrepreneurship, the editors identify major problems that authors face and proffer possible solutions.

Abstract: Gender-based differential treatment of business borrowers has been illegal for decades now. Therefore, any remaining gender effect is likely to be more subtle than before and second order in nature. Using 1,577 small businesses from the 2003 National Survey of Small Business Finances by the Federal Reserve Board, resolving the gender assignment problem, and isolating the supply effects, our tests detected a second-order gender effect in U.S. small business borrowing cost. Specifically, lenders charge female sole proprietorships an average of 73 basis points higher than male sole proprietorships. The methodology also ameliorates an interpretation problem common to first-order gender effects.

Abstract: The dramatic expansion of scholarly interest and activity in the field of women's entrepreneurship within recent years has done much to correct the historical inattention paid to female entrepreneurs and their initiatives. Yet, as the field continues to develop and mature, there are increasingly strong calls for scholars to take their research in new directions. Within this introduction to the special issue, we expand upon the reasons for this call, describe who responded, and summarize the new frontiers explored within the work appearing in this and another related collection. We conclude by delineating new territories for researchers to explore, arguing that such endeavors will join those in this volume in not only addressing the criticisms raised to date, but also in generating a richer and more robust understanding of women's entrepreneurship.

Abstract: Women's cooperatives offer self-employment opportunities that can contribute to women's social inclusion and empowerment. This article seeks to broaden existing understandings of women's entrepreneurship by focusing on less studied types of ventures and contexts—namely, a social entrepreneurial venture in India. A case study analysis was used to assess two primary areas of interest: (1) elements of empowerment embedded in the venture's business model and (2) individual perceptions of empowerment. The personal accounts of sister members reveal that this collective form of entrepreneurship has empowered them in three ways: economic security, development of entrepreneurial behavior, and increased contributions to the family.

Author-Name: Powell, Gary N.
Abstract: A survey of 258 entrepreneurs examined how positive facets of their family experiences, family-to-business enrichment, and support, nurture their satisfaction with work–family balance. Satisfaction with work–family balance was nurtured by instrumental family-to-business enrichment to the advantage of women as a group and by instrumental support from the family at home to the advantage of men as a group. Overall, results supported feminist theories that depict entrepreneurship as a gendered process. Female entrepreneurs tend to nurture satisfaction with work–family balance by creating work–family synergies, whereas male entrepreneurs tend to nurture satisfaction with work–family balance by obtaining family support at home.

This study, the first independent empirical investigation, reports that in South Africa, Avon helps some impoverished women earn a better income and inspires empowerment among them. The authors introduce a new theory, pragmatist feminism, to integrate past work on women's entrepreneurship and argue that feminist scholars should reexamine the histories of the market democracies for replicable innovations that may have empowered women.

Abstract: This paper examines how culture and gender shape entrepreneurial perceptions and intentions within Hofstede's cultural dimensions framework and gender role theory. We test whether gender differences exist in the way university students in three nations perceive barriers to entrepreneurship and whether gender has a moderating effect on the relationship between perceived barriers and entrepreneurial intentions across nations. Findings indicate significant gender differences in barrier perceptions. However, this gap is not consistent across cultures. Also, a moderating effect of gender on the relationship between barriers and entrepreneurial intentions is identified. Implications for research and practice are discussed.

Abstract: This interview and commentary addresses key issues in entrepreneurship by highlighting William Baumol's contributions and his personal insights. We emphasize the multilevel approach that entrepreneurship research should adopt, and that assumptions underlying the research are too often unstated, rendering comparison between studies difficult. Baumol argues for more experimentation and government support of research on ways to improve the teaching of innovative entrepreneurship, since there is little evidence on what works and what does not. The discussion stresses that entrepreneurship is a multifaceted phenomenon that varies depending on context, the level of innovation, and its impact on society. Consequently, entrepreneurship research requires the development of an encompassing paradigm, appropriate educational methods, and study of the institutions that provide the most desirable incentives.

Abstract: Legal rules and the economic environment play an important role in the decision to become an entrepreneur. Many studies examine the effect of such institutions at the national or state level. The metropolitan area may be a more appropriate geography to examine, since entrepreneurs often serve a more localized market and there is wide variation in both the environment for and incidence of proprietorship among metropolitan areas. We find that proprietorship increases with home equity, intangible wealth, unemployment, relative earnings of proprietors, and population. It decreases with higher state income tax rates and minimum wages.

Title: Differences Between Men and Women in Opportunity Evaluation as a Function of Gender Stereotypes and Stereotype Activation
Author-Name: Gupta, Vishal K.
Author-Name: Turban, Daniel B.
Author-Name: Pareek, Ashish
Abstract: Opportunity evaluation represents a core aspect of the entrepreneurial process. Prior research suggests that evaluation of new opportunities is influenced by biases rooted in subjective beliefs, values, and assumptions. In the present study, we used stereotype activation theory to propose that respondent gender (men–women), content of stereotype (masculine–feminine), and the manner in which stereotype information is presented (subtle–blatant) interact to influence evaluations of a new business opportunity. We found that both masculine and feminine stereotype activation influenced men and women's evaluation of a business opportunity differently depending upon whether the stereotype was blatantly or subtly activated. Our results indicate that gender stereotype activation can both boost and impede men and women's subsequent actions on entrepreneurial tasks such as opportunity evaluation, depending on the content of the stereotype and the manner in which it is presented. Implications and directions for future research are discussed.

Title: Founding Team Capabilities and New Venture Performance: The Mediating Role of Strategic Positional Advantages
Author-Name: Zhao, Y. Lisa

Author-Name: Storm, Gregory L.
Abstract: This study conceptualizes founding team human capital with three multi-item scales that are related to critical functional areas in new service ventures: marketing capabilities, market-linking capabilities, and service design capabilities. We develop and empirically test a theoretical framework linking founding team capabilities to service venture performance through two strategic positional advantages: scalability and protectability. Our results provide insight into previous inconsistent findings regarding founding teams' impact on new venture performance, offer important managerial implications, and point to future research directions.

Title: Easy Now, Desirable Later: The Moderating Role of Temporal Distance in Opportunity Evaluation and Exploitation
Author-Name: Tumasjan, Andranik

Author-Name: Spörrle, Matthias
Abstract: How does the temporal distance between the phases of evaluation and exploitation alter entrepreneurs' opportunity evaluation? Building on construal level theory, we argue that the impact of an opportunity's desirability and feasibility on evaluation and exploitation intentions varies systematically with temporal distance. We experimentally demonstrate stronger influences of desirability on evaluation when the exploitation phase is temporally distant rather than near, whereas feasibility more strongly affects evaluation when exploitation is near rather than distant. Using construal level theory, we explain empirical inconsistencies in previous research and demonstrate the usefulness of integrating the concept of temporal distance in entrepreneurship research and education.

Title: Entrepreneurship at the Periphery: Exploring Framework Conditions in Core and Peripheral Locations
Author-Name: Felzensztein, Christian

Author-Name: Aqueveque, Claudio
Abstract: This paper reports the findings of the first academic study in Latin America, and one of the few in any emerging economy, to explore entrepreneurial perceptions and activity in peripheral geographic locations. A survey of experts included 139 respondents from three peripheral regions and two core regions in Chile. A key finding is that those located at the periphery perceived critical entrepreneurial resources and access to markets less favorably than their counterparts at the core, but surprisingly, they perceived greater business opportunity in their area. A further survey of 2,200 respondents concerning actual entrepreneurial activities among the total adult population revealed no differences between peripheral and core regions. This study revives the debate about specific regional policies for fostering the growth of local business, and the entrepreneurial framework conditions required at the regional level in emerging economies.

Abstract: La Vida Local is a small organic food delivery business which was started with an investment of under $1,000. In 2008, less than 2 years after its inception, the company is grossing over $80,000. Profits, however, are minimal. Although Julie LaPorte, the owner/operator, is more interested in facilitating the consumption of organic foods than making money, she is exhausted. She wants to hire an employee to help out, but to do so she needs to find a way to generate more profits and to overcome her own desire to keep tight control over operations.

Abstract: Although previous research shows that corporate spin-offs contribute to economic growth, few studies link growth to the type of corporate spin-off. We distinguish between three types of corporate spin-offs: incumbent-backed, opportunity, and necessity spin-offs. Using empirical data on 46 corporate spin-offs in Flanders, we find that opportunity spin-offs outperform the other two types. By identifying the type of corporate spin-offs, this study aims to add to our knowledge on the relationship between spin-off type and firm growth.

Author-Name: Walter, Sascha
Abstract: Whereas the determinants of entrepreneurial choice have been thoroughly analyzed in the literature, little is known about the preferred mode of entry into entrepreneurship, such as taking over an existing business or starting a new venture. Using a large international data set, this study reports considerable differences in takeover preferences across 33 countries. Hierarchical (multilevel) regressions are performed to explore individual-level and country-level determinants of the preferred mode of entry. At the individual level, a person's human capital, risk attitude, and inventiveness influence the preference for starting a new venture versus taking over an existing business. At the country level, the culture-inherent level of risk tolerance, the country's level of innovation output, and the administrative difficulty of starting a new business are found to explain the between-country variation in the preferred mode of entry. Implications of our findings for research and practice are also discussed.

Author-Name: Renko, Maija
Abstract: Social entrepreneurs are celebrated as transformational leaders whose accomplishments create opportunities for those less fortunate. However, little is known about the early stages of social enterprise development. This study focuses on how a nascent entrepreneur's prosocial motivation affects the progress in building a new venture. Results show that prosocial motivation decreases the likelihood of firm emergence within a 4-year follow-up period, and even more so when the product offering of the emerging venture is new to the markets. These findings are discussed in the light of previous research on prosocial motivation, social entrepreneurship, market novelty, and nascent entrepreneurship.

Abstract: Given the increasing attention to traditionally less “rational” entrepreneurial behaviors, such as bricolage, we used grounded theory techniques to study 23 diverse entrepreneurs. From this, we developed a five-category typology of entrepreneurial behavior that includes art, craft, engineering, bricolage, and brokerage. Themes such as self-perceived identity, organization of space, integration of materials, sense of personal limits, and responsiveness to changing market conditions were observed along categorical lines. We discuss the significance of the typology and each category's associations with venture longevity and financial performance for practitioners and for the study of entrepreneurship.

Title: Why Do Entrepreneurs Switch Lead Venture Capitalists?
Author-Name: Cumming, Douglas
Author-Name: Dai, Na
Abstract: We examine the dynamics of the positive sorting in the venture capital industry. Our findings indicate that switching lead venture capitalists (VCs) is not uncommon during the course of entrepreneurial firms' development. Companies with upwardly revised perceived quality are more likely to switch to more reputable VCs. Further, companies that switch lead VCs obtain larger capital infusion and higher pre-money valuation. However, companies that switch to more reputable VCs accept smaller investment size and lower pre-money valuation in follow-on rounds. In addition, it takes significantly more time for switchers with downwardly revised perceived quality to obtain subsequent financing.

Abstract: This article investigates how prior corporate venture capital (CVC) relationships between two firms affect the likelihood of their subsequently entering a strategic alliance. Creating a portfolio of CVC investments provides the investing firm with a set of opportunities that can be pursued once the technological and market uncertainty have been reduced. If the technology appears to be promising, a follow-on investment, such as a strategic alliance, is made to ensure the transfer of the technological knowledge. This article shows that prior CVC investments can play a role in the formation of strategic alliances and investigates the conditions under which they are most likely to do so.

Title: Generational Involvement in the Top Management Team of Family Firms: Exploring Nonlinear Effects on Entrepreneurial Orientation
Author-Name: Sciascia, Salvatore

Author-Name: Chirico, Francesco
Abstract: The present study contends that an inverted U-shaped relationship exists between generational involvement—i.e., the number of family generations simultaneously involved in the family-firm top management team (TMT)—and entrepreneurial orientation (EO). Drawing on the upper echelons theory, we conceive generational involvement as a proxy of knowledge diversity in multigenerational family TMTs. We argue that while moderate levels of generational involvement stimulate task-related constructive conflicts for EO, increased kinship distance and relationship conflicts led by high levels of generational involvement are likely to undermine this potential advantage by damaging the relational context for EO. Our hypothesis is confirmed on a data set of 199 family firms.

Title: Imprinting by Design: The Microfoundations of Entrepreneurial Adaptation
Author-Name: Bryant, Peter T.
Abstract: Entrepreneurial ventures need frequently to adapt. Yet their adaptive capacity is often limited by the legacies of imprinted founding characteristics. The question then arises whether it is possible to explain and manage the imprinting process so that the capacity to adapt is enhanced, rather than diminished. I address this question by developing a model of the microfoundations of imprinting based in collective memory. I argue that entrepreneurial founding teams naturally develop transactive autobiographical memory systems. By partially managing the design and imprinting of these memory systems, I argue that founders may improve their venture's long-term capacity to adapt.

Abstract: Drawing on previous literature proposing that entrepreneurial orientation (EO) reflects a disposition toward, rather than actual involvement in, entrepreneurial activity, and on the resource-based view of the firm, we complement the literature concerning the EO–performance relationship with the introduction of exploratory innovation and exploitative innovation as mediating variables accounting for entrepreneurial behavior. Data from 228 adolescent companies indicate the existence of an EO–entrepreneurial behavior gap and support the predicted mediating effects. In this context, the constituent dimensions of EO differ in their effects on exploration and exploitation, and performance, calling for an exacting consideration of the interplay of orientation, activity, and performance.

Title: Preparedness and Cognitive Legitimacy as Antecedents of New Venture Funding in Televised Business Pitches
Author-Name: Pollack, Jeffrey M.

Author-Name: Nagy, Brian G.
Abstract: This research addresses the question of what specific entrepreneurs' behavior increases the propensity for resource acquisition. Within the context of business “pitches,” we explore subtleties in the process via a theoretically derived model linking entrepreneurs' preparedness behavior, perceived cognitive legitimacy, and amount of funding received. We test this model using data coded from two sources: 14 episodes of the television show “Shark Tank” that aired in 2009, as well as 84 episodes of “Dragons Den” that aired from 2005 to 2010. Within these episodes, we specifically examine the 113 individual business pitches that received funding. Overall, results suggest the relationship between entrepreneurs' preparedness behavior and the amount of funding received is mediated by cognitive legitimacy. Specifically, entrepreneurs' increased preparedness behavior was positively related to increased cognitive legitimacy. Cognitive legitimacy, in turn, was positively related to amount of funding received. We offer thoughts regarding implications from both theoretical and practical perspectives.

Abstract: Using the upper echelon perspective and imprinting arguments as key theoretical lenses, this paper examines how characteristics of new venture core teams influence internal consistency and distinctiveness of human resources (HR) values at the early-growth stage of the firm. We found that shared organizational experience among founding core team members positively predicts internal consistency and distinctiveness of the dominant HR values, whereas functional diversity positively predicts distinctiveness of these values. Contrary to our prediction, when the levels of both prior shared organizational experience and functional diversity are high, positive effects turned negative, indicating more complex interaction effects between the two team characteristics.

Abstract: A majority of entrepreneurial teams contain family relations but little is known about the implications of such family relationships in the formative stages of new venture creation. We examine two distinct types of family relationships in these teams; romantic couples and biologically linked teams and how such relationships influence the probability of ever achieving first sales. Relying on social identity theory, and a longitudinal sample of 295 nascent teams, we find that these relationships matter in important ways. Our conceptualizations and results have implications for the entrepreneurial teams and family business literatures.

Abstract: Family entrepreneurial teams are groups of related individuals who engage in entrepreneurship. Entrepreneurial teams studies emphasize the resources that members bring to the team. Family business studies suggest that relationships and social theories are important. Social capital explains the formation and composition of family entrepreneurial teams (FETs). Analysis is of case studies of FETs based in Honduras. A shared commitment to entrepreneurial stewardship of the family's assets underpins formation of FETs. Trust and shared values were important for membership. This study highlights that families are not internally consistent, and family ties are not equally strong.

Abstract: Entrepreneurs' behavior is a key construct in understanding how entrepreneurs create new organizations. We define entrepreneurs' behavior as concrete and observable, and distinguish it from related concepts. In reviewing the literature in top entrepreneurship and management journals, we note that behaviors are poorly defined and the cumulative research is fragmented with often ad hoc measures lacking important validation in many studies. To better define behavior, we outline taxonomic (types of behavior) and partonomy (parts of behavior) approaches. Then, we offer a list of important exemplar behaviors based on the extant literature. Finally, we introduce the articles in the issue.

Abstract: Social entrepreneurs develop market-driven ventures to produce social change; some succeed while others fail. This research advances our understanding of start-up behaviors of ventures that span nonprofit and for-profit institutional boundaries. A rigorous qualitative study of 23 social ventures reveals that entrepreneurs employ a blend of nonprofit and business venture behaviors, suggesting the importance of contextual factors. Only selective behaviors from each institution differentiate the successful from the struggling ventures. But while the higher level organizing tasks and activities of successful and struggling ventures may appear similar, fine-grained analyses of their behaviors show stark differences, emphasizing the need for such analyses.

Abstract: This study provides a critical examination of how different theoretical perspectives in entrepreneurship research translate into individual behavior, and whether such behavior is evident in the creation and development of new ventures. Using an alternative templates research methodology, the behaviors underlying the theories of effectuation, causation, and bricolage are evaluated to see whether such behaviors are observable in case study data describing the early development of six new ventures. The analysis highlights behavioral similarities and differences between the various theoretical perspectives in entrepreneurship research, providing insight into how these perspectives contrast and complement one another, and how they could be integrated in future research.

Abstract: In this study, we used the sociological method of structured observation to investigate the everyday behavior of six entrepreneurs in the start-up stage and six entrepreneurs in the growth stage.

Building on these detailed observations, we develop a taxonomy specifying the constitutive elements of entrepreneurs' behavior on a continuum that spans from single, discrete actions of entrepreneurs to actions concerning the broader organization.

Abstract: We examine how entrepreneurs' behaviors related to credentials and impression management (IM) impact perceptions of new venture (NV) legitimacy. Results from this experiment, as hypothesized, show that entrepreneurs' credentials and IM behaviors are positively related to legitimacy perceptions. Contrary to expectations, however, findings do not support either interaction hypothesis when credentials are high or low. We discuss how these findings illustrate the importance of entrepreneurs' behaviors during the NV creation process and outline multiple directions for future research.

Abstract: Family business researchers have devoted substantial attention to comparing family firms with nonfamily firms. Many of these comparisons rely on dichotomous variables, which implicitly treat family firms as homogeneous entities. However, recent studies have started to use moderators and mediators as well as continuous measures of family involvement in recognition of the heterogeneity of family firms. The articles and commentaries in this special issue contribute to a better understanding of that heterogeneity by examining how vision and goals, as well as the discretion engendered by family control, influence the innovation, internationalization, succession, professionalization, and proactive stakeholder engagement of family enterprises.

Abstract: This research focuses on family-controlled firms as an important type of family firms, and demonstrates how external parties in the governance (ownership and board of directors) can serve as a catalyst for their internationalization. Our framework also embraces the moderating effects of the competitive environmental heterogeneity and past performance on the relationship between external, nonfamily involvement in governance, and internationalization (scale and scope). The hypotheses are tested on a sample of 351 Swedish family-controlled firms. Our findings extend previous research on family firms and their internationalization, especially addressing some of the prior mixed findings, and offers implications for both theory and practice.

Title: Strategic Decisions Within Family Firms: Understanding the Controlling Family's Receptivity to Internationalization
Author-Name: Holt, Daniel T.
Abstract: Arregle, Naldi, Nordqvist, and Hitt found that external owner and board member involvement within family firms influence the scale and scope of these firms’ internationalization. This commentary further explicates how and under what conditions the family might be receptive to these types of strategic initiatives when they are presented by external owners. In essence, the controlling family's receptivity to internationalization would be influenced by how successfully external owners use persuasion techniques and how these techniques, given the firm's social context, might be viewed. The resulting receptivity would be balanced against the scripts and images that have emerged based on the family's values, goals, and aspirations.

Title: Socioemotional Wealth and Proactive Stakeholder Engagement: Why Family‐Controlled Firms Care More About Their Stakeholders
Author-Name: Cennamo, Carmelo
Author-Name: Berrone, Pascual
Author-Name: Cruz, Cristina
Author-Name: Gomez‐Mejia, Luis R.
Abstract: While family business research has prominently recognized that family firms are motivated by nonfinancial factors, the literature has remained relatively silent about whether or not these firms are more likely than others to engage actively with their stakeholders, who often have nonpecuniary demands. This paper argues that family firms are more prone to adopt proactive stakeholder engagement (PSE) activities because by doing so they preserve and enhance their socioemotional wealth (SEW). We explore the impact of the different dimensions of SEW on PSE and identify distinctive logics that explain the adoption of such practices. Finally, we offer a set of topics for future studies.

Title: Extending the Socioemotional Wealth Perspective: A Look at the Dark Side
Author-Name: Kellermanns, Franz W.
Author-Name: Eddleston, Kimberly A.
Author-Name: Zellweger, Thomas M.
Abstract: We extend the socioemotional wealth (SEW) perspective by arguing that SEW can be negatively associated with proactive stakeholder engagement (PSE). We further suggest that the SEW dimensions can be associated with positive or negative valence. Lastly, we propose that negatively valenced SEW dimensions lead to family-centric behavior, which negatively affects PSE. This multifaceted conceptualization of SEW allows us to explain how family firms can partake in harmful stakeholder behaviors despite having seemingly strong SEW. Our paper suggests that SEW can be either an affective endowment or burden for family firms and their constituents.

Title: The Transaction Cost Economics Theory of the Family Firm: Family‐Based Human Asset Specificity and the Bifurcation Bias
Author-Name: Verbeke, Alain
Author-Name: Kano, Liena
Abstract: We develop a transaction cost economics theory of the family firm, building upon the concepts of family-based asset specificity, bounded rationality, and bounded reliability. We argue that the prosperity and survival of family firms depend on the absence of a dysfunctional bifurcation bias. The bifurcation bias is an expression of bounded reliability, reflected in the de facto asymmetric treatment of family vs. nonfamily assets (especially human assets). We propose that absence of bifurcation bias is critical to fostering reliability in family business functioning. Our study ends the unproductive divide between the agency and stewardship perspectives of the family firm, which offer conflicting accounts of this firm type's functioning. We show that the predictions of the agency and stewardship perspectives can be usefully reconciled when focusing on how family firms address the bifurcation bias or fail to do so.

Title: Vision and Exchange in Intra‐Family Succession: Effects on Procedural Justice Climate Among Nonfamily Managers
Author-Name: Barnett, Tim
Author-Name: Long, Rebecca G.
Author-Name: Marler, Laura E.
Abstract: We develop and extend fledgling literature on procedural justice climate and succession processes in family firms by focusing on the impact of family vision and exchange systems on procedural justice climate among nonfamily managers. Drawing upon social exchange theory, we argue that family involvement accompanied by a weak family vision will be associated with restricted exchanges in dominant coalitions, which will have a negative impact on procedural justice climate among nonfamily managers. Conversely, we suggest that family involvement with a strong family vision will be accompanied by generalized exchange, which should positively impact the procedural justice climate among nonfamily managers. We expect that the extent to which nonfamily managers work to support or hinder intra-family succession will be influenced by their collective perception of a positive or negative procedural justice climate.

Title: Family Involvement and Procedural Justice Climate Among Nonfamily Managers: The Effects of Affect, Social Identities, Trust, and Risk of Non‐Reciprocity
Author-Name: De Massis, Alfredo
Abstract: This commentary elaborates on the paper by Barnett, Long, and Marler wherein they conceptualize the relationships between family involvement, family vision, exchange systems, and procedural justice climate among nonfamily managers. My elaboration places their conceptual model within the wider context of the affect theory of social exchange and offers two directions for extension based on social identity theory and a longitudinal perspective.

Title: Retracted: The Impact of Family Involvement on Dynamic Innovation Capabilities: Evidence From German Manufacturing Firms
Author-Name: Lichtenthaler, Ulrich
Author-Name: Muethel, Miriam
Abstract: Drawing on the capability-based view, we provide new theoretical arguments related to innovation capabilities rather than realized innovation output in firms with family involvement. We focus on technology-based product innovation capabilities and use data from a sample of 119 German manufacturing firms to show that family involvement is positively related to dynamic innovation capabilities. Specifically, the degree of family involvement, which describes the owner family's ability to influence firm behavior, is positively related to sensing innovation opportunities and to transforming a firm's innovation processes, while it is insignificantly related to seizing innovation opportunities. The findings suggest that dynamic innovation capabilities are an important characteristic that differs between firms with varying levels of family involvement.

Title: New Venture and Family Business Teams: Understanding Team Formation, Composition, Behaviors, and Performance
Author-Name: Schjoedt, Leon

Author-Name: Chrisman, James J.
Abstract: New ventures are frequently started by entrepreneurial teams rather than lone entrepreneurs. Often, team members have family ties. Yet, there has been relatively little research on new venture and family business teams. The papers in this special issue address this gap by studying team formation and composition, faultlines among team members, generational involvement in teams, the influence of shared organizational experience and functional homogeneity, and the likelihood of couples, biologically related, and unrelated teams achieving first sales. Combined, they suggest that relationships are more important than skill diversity in determining the effectiveness of both family business and new venture teams.

Title: New Venture Teams and the Quality of Business Opportunities Identified: Faultlines Between Subgroups of Founders and Investors
Author-Name: Lim, JoAnne Yong‐Kwan

Abstract: New venture teams (NVT) often comprise idea-conceiving founders and equity-based investors. These subgroups represent a faultline whose magnitude influences the quality of business opportunities. We propose that the faultline strength formed between founders and investors is influenced by structural factors (ownership equity, membership change, preexisting tie strength) and cognitive factor (mental models of the venture). Finally, we address how the faultline strength impacts interaction processes (relationship conflict, task conflict, knowledge exchange) and their subsequent impact on the quality of entrepreneurial opportunities. Our theoretical model provides insight into how informational resources inherent in new venture teams can be more effectively leveraged.
