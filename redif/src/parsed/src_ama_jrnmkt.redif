Title: Low Prices Are Just the Beginning: Price Image in Retail Management
Author-Name: Ryan Hamilton
Author-Name: Alexander Chernev
Abstract: Recent managerial evidence and academic research has suggested that consumer decisions are influenced not only by the prices of individual items but also by a retailer's price image, which reflects a consumer's impression of the overall price level of a retailer. Despite the increasing importance of price image in marketing theory and practice, existing research has not provided a clear picture of how price images are formed and how they influence consumer behavior. This article addresses this discrepancy by offering a comprehensive framework delineating the key drivers of price image formation and their consequences for consumer behavior. Contrary to conventional wisdom that assumes price image is mainly a function of a retailer's average price level, this research identifies several price-related and nonprice factors that contribute to price image formation. The authors further identify conditions in which these factors can overcome the impact of the average level of prices, resulting in a low price image despite the retailer's relatively high prices, as well as conditions in which people perceive a retailer to have a high price image despite its relatively low average price level.

Title: When Do Third-Party Product Reviews Affect Firm Value and What Can Firms Do? The Case of Media Critics and Professional Movie Reviews
Author-Name: Yubo Chen, 
Author-Name: Yong Liu, 
Author-Name: Jurui Zhang
Abstract: Third-party product reviews (TPRs) have become ubiquitous in many industries. Aided by communication technologies, particularly on the Internet, TPRs are widely available to consumers, managers, and investors. The authors examine whether and how TPRs of new products influence the financial value of firms introducing the products. An event study covering 14 major media and professional reviews of movies released by 21 studios shows that TPRs exert significant impact on stock returns in the direction of their valence. However, the impact comes from the valence of a review that is measured relative to other, previously published reviews and not from the absolute valence of the review itself. The authors further study the dynamics of TPR impact on firm value and find that the impact exists only for prerelease reviews and is the strongest on the product release date, though it disappears when sales information becomes available after product release. These results demonstrate that TPRs play significant roles as the investors update their expectation about new product sales potential. The authors also find that advertising spending increases the positive impact of TPRs on firm value and buffer the negative impact. Therefore, firms could strategically use marketing instruments such as advertising to moderate the impact of TPRs.

Title: Adding Bricks to Clicks: Predicting the Patterns of Cross-Channel Elasticities Over Time
Author-Name: Jill Avery, 
Author-Name: Thomas J. Steenburgh, 
Author-Name: John Deighton, 
Author-Name: Mary Caravella
Abstract: The authors propose a conceptual framework to explain whether and when the introduction of a new retail store channel helps or hurts sales in existing direct channels. A conceptual framework separates short- and long-term effects by analyzing the capabilities of a channel that help consumers accomplish their shopping goals. To test the theory, the authors analyze a unique data set from a high-end retailer using matching methods. The authors study the introduction of a retail store and find evidence of cross-channel cannibalization and synergy. The presence of a retail store decreases sales in the catalog but not the Internet channel in the short run but increases sales in both direct channels over time. Following the opening of the store, more first-time customers begin purchasing in the direct channels. These results suggest that adding a retail store to direct channels yields different results from adding an Internet channel to a retail store channel, as previous research has indicated.

Title: Multicomponent Systems Pricing: Rational Inattention and Downward Rigidities
Author-Name: Sourav Ray, 
Author-Name: Charles A. Wood, 
Author-Name: Paul R. Messinger
Abstract: The authors examine the relative magnitude of price reductions for product systems and their constituent components (e.g., cameras, computers, monitors, lenses) and hypothesize that these price reductions systematically vary across different types of systems. The authors offer rational inattention as an explanation and document patterns of downward rigidity in online prices of computers and cameras that are consistent with this view. Their basic argument is that under certain circumstances, it is rational for consumers to ignore small price changes. This results in some price rigidity because firms would see no demand effect for small reductions. The authors suggest that this inattention systematically varies across different types of multicomponent systems, leading to specific hypotheses about sellers' pricing behavior. They first check the validity of their theoretical arguments using data from two surveys of consumers and managers. They then examine 669,557 daily price listings for 1052 high-end cameras and computers from 102 online vendors and find evidence consistent with their predictions. Using publicly available web traffic data, the authors also find that their predicted pricing behavior is aligned with better traffic response for the firm.

Title: Multihoming in Two-Sided Markets: An Empirical Inquiry in the Video Game Console Industry
Author-Name: Vardit Landsman, 
Author-Name: Stefan Stremersch
Abstract: Two-sided markets are composed of platform owners and two distinct user networks that either buy or sell applications for the platform. The authors focus on multihoming—the choice of an agent in a user network to use more than one platform. In the context of the video game console industry, they examine the conditions affecting seller-level multihoming decisions on a given platform. Furthermore, they investigate how platform-level multihoming of applications affects the sales of the platform. The authors show that increased platform-level multihoming of applications hurts platform sales, a finding consistent with literature on brand differentiation, but they also show that this effect vanishes as platforms mature or gain market share. The authors find that platform-level multihoming of applications affects platform sales more strongly than the number of applications. Furthermore, among mature platforms, an increasing market share leads to more seller-level multihoming, while among nascent platforms, seller-level multihoming decreases as platform market share increases. These findings prompt scholars to look beyond network size in analyzing two-sided markets and provide guidance to both (application) sellers and platform owners.

Title: Social Capital of Young Technology Firms and Their IPO Values: The Complementary Role of Relevant Absorptive Capacity
Author-Name: Guiyang Xiong, 
Author-Name: Sundar Bharadwaj
Abstract: The strategic importance of business-to-business (B2B) relationships is well recognized, but their financial impact remains equivocal. This study links social capital from three types of B2B networks of young technology firms with their initial public offering (IPO) value. The authors identify three relevant types of absorptive capacity that facilitate the transformation of B2B social capital into IPO value. For the transformation to occur, the authors find that young firms need not only the opportunity to access the resources provided by B2B relationships but also the ability to leverage them through the complementary capability—namely, absorptive capacity. They test the hypotheses on a sample of 177 IPOs, and the results are robust to endogeneity concerns and alternative measures. As one of the first studies in marketing–finance interface to focus on young firms, the findings provide novel insights, such as the deleterious financial consequence of having marketing and research-and-development B2B relationships without the relevant absorptive capacity. The authors conclude with a discussion of managerial implications regarding communicating the value of absorptive capacity, disclosure of marketing-related information, and the importance of marketing for young technology firms.

Title: The Effect of Brand Acquisition and Disposal on Stock Returns
Author-Name: Michael A. Wiles, 
Author-Name: Neil A. Morgan, 
Author-Name: Lopo L. Rego
Abstract: Brand acquisitions and disposals are key strategic marketing decisions and often the largest single marketing investments that firms make. Yet little is known about the performance effects of such decisions. This study examines stock market reactions to brand acquisition and disposal announcements in 31 consumer industries. The results reveal that returns to such announcements depend crucially on three complementary firm assets—marketing capabilities, channel relationships, and brand portfolios—but that these effects may not be symmetric across brand acquisitions and disposals. Acquirer abnormal returns are greater for firms with strong marketing capabilities and those that buy brands with higher price/quality positioning than their existing portfolio. Investors also reward buyers that identify cost synergies in integrating new brand(s) into their portfolios but punish those that identify revenue synergies. Conversely, greater abnormal returns arise for sellers with inferior channel relationships and for those selling multiple brands, brands with relatively lower price/quality positioning than the seller's remaining portfolio, and brands unrelated to the rest of the seller's portfolio. The results from a paired subsample provide new knowledge about the positive net shareholder wealth created from brand acquisition–disposal transactions and indicate a strong role of marketing capabilities in creating this wealth.

Title: Developing New-to-the-Firm Products: The Role of Micropolitical Strategies
Author-Name: Rajesh Sethi, 
Author-Name: Zafar Iqbal, 
Author-Name: Anju Sethi
Abstract: This research addresses three questions: (1) To what extent do new-to-the-firm products (with market and technology newness) face resistance in winning approval for development during the review process? (2) To what degree does product development teams' use of micropolitical strategies help reduce resistance and get approval with minimum compromise in the product? (3) To what extent do some of these micropolitical strategies harm the new product's performance? The findings suggest that products with both market and technology newness encounter resistance in getting approval for development. If the product development team wants to reduce resistance to products with market newness, it needs to build a coalition of supporters that can help it during the review process. Similarly, if the team seeks to minimize resistance to products with technology newness, it should frame the product in terms of the firms' existing products, strategies, and competitive thrusts. However, such framing increases resistance to market newness. If products continue to be resisted, they must be compromised (i.e., modified as a concession) to win approval. If the team wants to reduce the degree of compromise, it should initially develop the product in hiding. Products that are compromised perform poorly in the marketplace.

Title: The Effect of Business-Cycle Fluctuations on Private-Label Share: What Has Marketing Conduct Got to Do with It?
Author-Name: Lien Lamey, 
Author-Name: Barbara Deleersnyder, 
Author-Name: Jan-Benedict E.M. Steenkamp, 
Author-Name: Marnik G. Dekimpe
Abstract: The authors investigate whether, and to what extent, marketing conduct varies over the business cycle and how this contributes to the growing popularity of private labels. To address this issue, they examine a unique data set that combines a broad set of seven marketing-mix instruments with private-label share, using two decades' worth of data for 106 consumer packaged goods categories in the United States. The results show that private-label share behaves countercyclically and that part of the boost in private-label share during contractions is permanent. Retailers' observed practice of supporting their own labels in contraction periods while cutting back in expansion periods helps this cyclical sensitivity even further. In addition, national brands' procyclical behavior in terms of (1) major new product introductions, (2) advertising, and (3) their promotional pressure compared with private labels is associated with more pronounced cyclical fluctuations in private-label share and even with permanent private-label market share gains. Although brand managers cannot be held responsible for the occurrence of economic downswings, they can be held accountable for how much contractions help strengthen their fiercest competitor, the store brands owned by their very customers.

Title: Brand Love
Author-Name: Rajeev Batra, 
Author-Name: Aaron Ahuvia, 
Author-Name: Richard P. Bagozzi
Abstract: Using a grounded theory approach, the authors investigate the nature and consequences of brand love. Arguing that research on brand love needs to be built on an understanding of how consumers actually experience this phenomenon, they conduct two qualitative studies to uncover the different elements (“features”) of the consumer prototype of brand love. Then, they use structural equations modeling on survey data to explore how these elements can be modeled as both first-order and higher-order structural models. A higher-order model yields seven core elements: self–brand integration, passion-driven behaviors, positive emotional connection, long-term relationship, positive overall attitude valence, attitude certainty and confidence (strength), and anticipated separation distress. In addition to these seven core elements of brand love itself, the prototype includes quality beliefs as an antecedent of brand love and brand loyalty, word of mouth, and resistance to negative information as outcomes. Both the first-order and higher-order brand love models predict loyalty, word of mouth, and resistance better, and provide a greater understanding, than an overall summary measure of brand love. The authors conclude by presenting theoretical and managerial implications.

Title: Decision Process Evolution in Customer Channel Choice
Author-Name: Sara Valentini,

Author-Name: Scott A. Neslin
Abstract: The growing number of sales channels through which customers can make purchases has made it imperative for managers to understand how customers decide which channels to use. However, this presents a significant challenge because there is reason to believe the channel decision process evolves over the lifetime of the customer. The authors document the existence and nature of this phenomenon by analyzing the evolution of a customer's channel choice decision process from a trial stage to a posttrial stage. First, they analyze data for a book retailer and replicate their analysis using data from a durables and apparel retailer. Their results suggest that (1) customers' decision processes do evolve, (2) a minority but sizeable segment changes decision processes within the observation period, and (3) customers who change do so from a decision process in which they are highly responsive to marketing to one in which they are less responsive. The authors illustrate and discuss the implications for both managers and researchers.

Title: Reexamining the Market Share–Customer Satisfaction Relationship
Author-Name: Lopo L. Rego
Author-Name: Neil A. Morgan
Author-Name: Claes Fornell
Abstract: Market share and customer satisfaction are often used to assess marketing performance. Despite the widespread assumption of a positive relationship between these two variables, the limited extant empirical literature on the subject indicates either a negative or a nonsignificant relationship. The authors reexamine this relationship over a longer time period than has previously been possible in a representative sample of U.S. consumer markets and find a consistently significant negative market share–customer satisfaction relationship. This is because customer satisfaction is generally not predictive of firms' future market share, but market share is a strong negative predictor of firms' future customer satisfaction. In follow-up analyses, the authors find that a firm's customer satisfaction can predict its future market share when it is benchmarked against that of its nearest rival and customer switching costs are low. In examining why the market share–future customer satisfaction relationship is generally negative, they find strong support for preference heterogeneity as a key mediator in this relationship. They also show that marketing more brands moderates the negative effect of preference heterogeneity on future customer satisfaction. Thus, larger brand portfolios offer a strategy solution for the general market share–satisfaction trade-off.

Title: Hybrid Offerings: How Manufacturing Firms Combine Goods and Services Successfully
Author-Name: Wolfgang Ulaga, 
Author-Name: Werner J. Reinartz
Abstract: This article examines key success factors for designing and delivering combinations of goods and services (i.e., hybrid offerings) in business markets. Goods manufacturers, unlike pure service providers, find themselves in a unique position to grow revenues through hybrid offerings but must learn how to leverage unique resources and build distinctive capabilities. Using case studies and depth interviews with senior executives in manufacturing companies, the authors develop a resource–capability framework as a basis for research and practice. Executives identify four critical resources: (1) product usage and process data derived from the firm's installed base of physical goods, (2) product development and manufacturing assets, (3) an experienced product sales force and distribution network, and (4) a field service organization. In leveraging these specific resources, successful firms build five critical capabilities: (1) service-related data processing and interpretation capability, (2) execution risk assessment and mitigation capability, (3) design-to-service capability, (4) hybrid offering sales capability, and (5) hybrid offering deployment capability. These capabilities influence manufacturers' positional advantage in two directions: differentiation and cost leadership. The authors propose a new typology of industrial services and discuss how resources and capabilities affect success across categories of hybrid offers.

Title: What Is Quality? An Integrative Framework of Processes and States

Abstract: Quality is a central element in business strategy and academic research. Despite important research on quality, an opportunity for an integrative framework remains. The authors present an integrative framework of quality that captures how firms and customers produce quality (the quality production process), how firms deliver and customers experience quality (the quality experience process), and how customers evaluate quality (the quality evaluation process). The framework extends the literature in several ways. First, the authors describe important linkages between the three processes, including links reflecting the role of co-production. Second, they point to overlooked aspects of the quality processes that influence how quality is conceptualized and should be managed. These include customer heterogeneity in measurement knowledge and motivation; the role of emotion in quality production, experience, and evaluation; and a new typology of attributes. Third, they propose a quality state residing within each quality process and describe what gives rise to these states, which will enhance decision makers' ability to measure and manage quality processes. Finally, they offer theoretical and managerial implications derived from their integrative quality framework including 20 strategies to increase customer satisfaction.

Title: Service Sweethearting: Its Antecedents and Customer Consequences
Author-Name: Michael K. Brady, 
Author-Name: Clay M. Voorhees, 
Author-Name: Michael J. Brusco
Abstract: This research is the first to examine service sweethearting, an illicit behavior that costs firms billions of dollars annually in lost revenues. Sweethearting occurs when frontline workers give unauthorized free or discounted goods and services to customer conspirators. The authors gather dyadic data from 171 service employees and 610 of their customers. The results from the employee data reveal that a variety of job, social, and remuneration factors motivate sweethearting behavior and several measurable employee traits suppress its frequency. The results from the customer data indicate that although sweethearting inflates a firm's satisfaction, loyalty, and positive word-of-mouth scores by as much as 9%, satisfaction with the confederate employee fully mediates these effects. Thus, any benefits for customer satisfaction or loyalty initiatives are tied to a frontline worker that the firm would rather not employ. Marketing managers can use this study to recognize job applicants or company settings that are particularly prone to sweethearting and as the basis for mitigating a positive bias in key customer metrics.

Title: Customer Uncertainty Following Downsizing: The Effects of Extent of Downsizing and Open Communication
Author-Name: Christian Homburg, 
Author-Name: Martin Klarmann, 
Author-Name: Sabine Staritz
Abstract: Although downsizing has become a nearly universal managerial practice, many downsizing initiatives fail. To explain this phenomenon, previous research has mainly investigated possible negative consequences for employees remaining in the firm while largely neglecting customer reactions to downsizing and the issues surrounding its implementation. The authors describe three studies analyzing how downsizing at a firm's point of customer contact affects customers and how managers can influence customer reactions through open communication. The first study, a manager study, is based on an executive survey of a sample of more than 100 downsizing projects. The other two studies are customer studies that use an experimental scenario method. Across the two methods, results show that the extent of downsizing is linked to customer uncertainty. In addition, both survey results and experimental results reveal that open downsizing communication carries substantial risks for downsizing firms. Although open communication reduces customer uncertainty if customers have strong informal ties with the firm's employees or perceive a firm's products as important, it may increase customer uncertainty in other situations.

Title: Marketing Performance Measurement Systems: Does Comprehensiveness Really Improve Performance?

Abstract: Comprehensive performance measurement systems such as the balanced scorecard have received considerable attention in marketing. However, whether and under which circumstances comprehensiveness as a performance measurement system property is desirable and contributes to firm performance is still a subject of debate in research and practice. To address this issue, the authors use dyadic field data from marketing managers and management accounting executives and extend prior work by developing and testing a more complex, contingency-based model. The empirical results confirm the developed framework. In particular, the results show that the relationship of comprehensiveness in a marketing performance measurement system to firm performance is conditional. Marketing alignment and market-based knowledge mediate this relationship, depending on marketing strategy, marketing complexity, and market dynamism. These insights explain mixed findings of previous research and provide important implications for research and managerial practice.

Title: When Do Consumers Eat More? The Role of Appearance Self-Esteem and Food Packaging Cues
Author-Name: Jennifer J. Argo, 
Author-Name: Katherine White
Abstract: Prior research has found that under certain conditions, small packages can paradoxically increase consumption. The authors build on this work by suggesting that people low in appearance self-esteem (ASE) are particularly sensitive to external control properties (i.e., packaging-related factors that signal the ability of packaging to regulate food intake) and, as a result, increase consumption levels when packages are small (vs. large or absent). Factors that highlight the external control properties of small packages, such as the visibility of product quantity, location of the caloric content, and communicated caloric content, further increase consumption, particularly among people with low ASE. The underlying process appears to be, at least in part, cognitively driven. The effects are mitigated when participants are under cognitive load, and the findings are mediated by cognitions regarding the ability of small packages to regulate food intake. The results have important practical implications suggesting that to quell the effects of small packages on overconsumption, emphasis on the external control properties of small packages should be minimized.

Title: Belief in a Just World: Consumer Intentions and Behaviors Toward Ethical Products
Author-Name: Katherine White, 
Author-Name: Rhiannon MacDonnell, 
Author-Name: John H. Ellard
Abstract: Although consumers report positive attitudes toward ethical goods, their intentions and behaviors often do not follow suit. Just-world theory highlights the conditions under which consumers are most likely to prefer fair-trade products. This theory proposes that people are motivated to construe the world as a just place where people get what they deserve. In the current research, when people are confronted with high levels of injustice (communicated need is high) and avenues for justice restoration seem uncertain or unavailable, assisting others by supporting fair trade decreases. However, highlighting how injustice can be redressed through purchases enhances fair-trade support under conditions of high need. The effects are moderated by justice sensitivity factors, such as just-world beliefs and whether the product type (indulgence vs. necessity) makes the injustice of consumer privilege salient. The results suggest that communicating high need when requesting consumer prosocial actions can sometimes backfire. Marketers employing high need appeals should heighten perceptions of justice restoration potential and activate fairness-related thoughts through product positioning to encourage fair-trade purchases.

Title: Choice of Cause in Cause-Related Marketing

Abstract: Spurred by the consumer demand for companies to be socially responsible, cause-related marketing (CM), in which fund raising for a cause is tied to purchase of a firm's products, has become popular in recent years. The authors demonstrate the conditions in which CM campaigns that allow consumers to choose the cause that receives the donation lead to greater consumer support than those in which the company determines the cause. They show that choice in this context is helpful as long as it increases consumers' perception of personal role in helping the cause. Specifically, allowing consumers to select the cause in a CM campaign is more likely to enhance perceived personal role and, thus, purchase intentions (1) for those consumers who are high (vs. low) in collectivism and (2) when the company and causes have low (vs. high) perceptual fit. Finally, the authors show that under certain conditions, choice may have a negative impact on perceived personal role and consumer support of CM campaigns.

Title: Mapping the Play of Organizational Identity in Foreign Market Adaptation

Abstract: While organizational identity can be a powerful tool for mobilizing and directing organizational members, the authors' findings demonstrate that it can also constrain the process of foreign market adaptation. Drawing from extensive ethnographic fieldwork in India, where they followed several multinational companies, they show how well-entrenched and enduring identities can obstruct the learning and strategic adjustments that are necessary to appeal to consumers in a new market environment. By explaining how organizational identity comes into play as a frame of reference and guiding principle, orienting managers in their efforts to preserve the character of their firm as it expands and globalizes, this research offers new insights into foreign market learning and adaptation. The authors extend this analysis to provide valuable recommendations to managers for making organizational identity a more explicit component of global marketing strategy.

Title: Dealing with Institutional Distances in International Marketing Channels: Governance Strategies That Engender Legitimacy and Efficiency
Author-Name: Zhilin Yang,

Author-Name: Kim-Shyan Fam
Abstract: Firms doing business in foreign institutional environments face pressures to gain social acceptance (commonly referred to as legitimacy) and difficulty in evaluating market information, both of which undercut firm performance. In this article, the authors argue that firms can design governance strategies to deal with foreign institutions to secure both social acceptance and firm performance. Using a Chinese sample of manufacturers that export products to various foreign markets through local distributors, the authors develop and test a model that bridges the effects of institutional environments and governance strategy on channel performance. Specifically, they find that firms can use two governance strategies, contract customization and relational governance, to deal with both legitimacy and efficiency issues and to safeguard channel performance. Thus, international channel managers are advised to maintain an integrated management of legitimacy and efficiency in foreign marketing channels.

Title: The Sales Lead Black Hole: On Sales Reps' Follow-Up of Marketing Leads
Author-Name: Gaurav Sabnis, 
Author-Name: Sharmila C. Chatterjee, 
Author-Name: Rajdeep Grewal, 
Author-Name: Gary L. Lilien
Abstract: The sales lead black hole—the 70% of leads generated by marketing departments that sales representatives do not pursue—may result from competing demands on sales reps' time. Using the motivation–opportunity–ability framework, the authors consider factors that influence sales reps' pursuit (or lack thereof) of marketing and self-generated leads. The proportion of time that sales reps devote to marketing leads depends on organizational lead prequalification and managerial tracking processes (extrinsic motivation), as well as marketing lead volume (opportunity), and sales rep experience and performance (ability). Consistent with a person–situation framework, individual sales rep factors should also moderate the influence of organizational processes on lead follow-up. Data from 461 sales reps employed by four firms confirm that as sales reps' experience increases, their responses to managerial tracking of lead follow-up and marketing lead volume decrease; responses to the quality of the lead prequalification process increase. As sales reps' performance improves, their response to the volume of marketing leads increases, but their response to managerial tracking decreases. The interplay of individual sales reps' abilities and organizational marketing and sales processes explains differences in sales reps' follow-up of marketing leads.'

Title: The Effect of Marketer-Suggested Serving Size on Consumer Responses: The Unintended Consequences of Consumer Attention to Calorie Information
Author-Name: Gina S. Mohr, 
Author-Name: Donald R. Lichtenstein, 
Author-Name: Chris Janiszewski
Abstract: Nutritional labels are mandatory on virtually all packaged food items sold in the United States. The nutritional information on these labels is reported on a “per-serving-size” basis. However, unbeknownst to many consumers, current Food and Drug Administration regulations allow manufacturers some discretion in setting serving sizes—a factor that the authors hypothesize has implications for consumer behavior. For example, adopting a smaller serving size allows marketers to reduce the reported calories, fat, sugar, and carbohydrates in a product serving, which in turn can influence the anticipated consequences of consumption. Three studies show that manipulating the serving size, and thus calories per serving, for equivalent consumption amounts influences the anticipated guilt of consumption, purchase intentions, and choice behavior. However, the results also show that individual difference and context variables, which heighten consumer attention to nutritional information in general, often focus attention on calorie information but not serving size. This leads to the counterintuitive finding that more nutritionally vigilant consumers are more heavily influenced by serving size manipulations. The authors discuss the managerial and public policy implications.

Title: Seeding Strategies for Viral Marketing: An Empirical Comparison

Author-Name: Jan U. Becker
Abstract: Seeding strategies have strong influences on the success of viral marketing campaigns, but previous studies using computer simulations and analytical models have produced conflicting recommendations about the optimal seeding strategy. This study compares four seeding strategies in two complementary small-scale field experiments, as well as in one real-life viral marketing campaign involving more than 200,000 customers of a mobile phone service provider. The empirical results show that the best seeding strategies can be up to eight times more successful than other seeding strategies. Seeding to well-connected people is the most successful approach because these attractive seeding points are more likely to participate in viral marketing campaigns. This finding contradicts a common assumption in other studies. Well-connected people also actively use their greater reach but do not have more influence on their peers than do less well-connected people.

Title: The Innovator's License: A Latitude to Deviate from Category Norms
Author-Name: Michael J. Barone, 
Author-Name: Robert D. Jewell
Abstract: Firms often look for ways to improve the return on investment they earn from costly innovation strategies. The authors investigate a previously unexplored benefit of innovation that occurs when a brand's reputation as a provider of valued new offerings allows it to earn innovation credit, a form of customer-based brand equity. Innovation credit provides brands with the license or latitude to use strategies that violate category norms without the penalty (in the form of impaired attitudes) that consumers are shown to levy on less innovative brands. Consistent with the proposed theoretical framework, three studies demonstrate that innovative brands are granted the license to employ nonnormative strategies without sanction. In addition to providing evidence regarding the inferential mechanism underlying this licensing effect, Study 3 shows that, under certain conditions, innovative brands not only escape the penalty associated with using atypical strategies but are actually rewarded for utilizing such approaches. The authors provide theoretical and managerial implications of these findings and suggestions for further research in this emerging area of innovation research.

Title: Measuring and Managing Returns from Retailer-Customized Coupon Campaigns
Author-Name: Rajkumar Venkatesan, 
Author-Name: Paul W. Farris
Abstract: The authors assess how and why retailer-customized coupon campaigns affect customer purchases. The conceptual model proposes effects on trip incidence and revenues through the mere exposure to campaigns (exposure effect) and the redemption of coupons (redemption effect). The authors propose monetary savings of the coupons, regularity of the campaigns, and coupon fit with customer preferences as moderators. Analysis of data from a group of regional grocery chains that were part of a quasi experiment demonstrates that retailer-customized coupon campaigns have a positive exposure and redemption effect on customer purchases. Mere exposure to customized coupon campaigns contributes more than coupon redemption to campaign returns. Consistent with theoretical expectations, customized coupon campaigns are more effective if they provide more discounts, are unexpected, and are positioned as specially selected for and customized to consumer preferences. The substantial exposure effects suggest that managers should look beyond redemption rates and also consider sales lift from nonredeemers when measuring the effectiveness of customized coupon campaigns.

Title: Why Do Customers Get More Than They Need? How Organizational Culture Shapes Product Capability Decisions
Author-Name: Bryan A. Lukas, 
Author-Name: Gregory J. Whitwell, 
Author-Name: Jan B. Heide
Abstract: The capability level of a product that a firm provides to a customer is an important marketing decision. In the extant literature, the normative heuristic for this decision is one of matching—of providing product capability levels that meet customer needs. However, industry evidence suggests that supplier firms routinely make product decisions that lead to “overshot” customers, whereby customers receive products with capabilities that exceed their requirements. The authors demonstrate how a supplier firm's organizational culture can cause overshooting scenarios and how these effects can be attenuated to the extent that the focal firm's basic values also reflect a customer orientation.

Title: How Can Stressed Employees Deliver Better Customer Service? The Underlying Self-Regulation Depletion Mechanism
Author-Name: Kimmy Wa Chan, 
Author-Name: Echo Wen Wan
Abstract: This research delineates and empirically tests how regulatory depletion may affect high-stress employees' service performance on different types of job tasks. Using a laboratory experiment and a survey study, the authors examine (1) whether work stress causes a depletion effect, such that high work stress undermines service employees' performance on tasks requiring self-regulation (e.g., customer complaint handling performance) versus tasks requiring limited self-regulation (e.g., customer-directed extra-role performance); (2) whether the depletion effect can be overcome by supervisory support or employees' engagement in perspective taking; and (3) how these moderating effects might be mediated by employees' feelings of fatigue and intrinsic job motivation. The results confirm regulatory depletion: High-stress employees feel more fatigue and perform more poorly than low-stress employees in tasks requiring self-regulation. However, the depletion effect from work stress is largely attenuated on employees' performance on tasks requiring less or limited self-regulation. The mediated moderation tests further show that the extent of the depletion effect is not uniform. Employees who can replenish their resources from supervisory support or enhance their goal focus by engaging in perspective taking are less affected by regulatory depletion. These buffering effects occur because of enhanced intrinsic job motivation.

Title: Consumer Participation in Coproduction: “I Made It Myself” Effects on Consumers' Sensory Perceptions and Evaluations of Outcome and Input Product
Author-Name: Sigurd Villads Troye, 
Author-Name: Magne Supphellen
Abstract: Consumers engage in self-production when they play an active role in the creation of end products, such as preparing a meal or assembling a piece of furniture. In three experimental studies of self-production involving a branded input product, the authors show that consumers' active engagement in the value creation process (preparing a meal) positively biases their evaluations of an outcome (a dish) and an input product (a dinner kit). A positive evaluation bias for the input product occurs despite increased self-attribution due to self-production. In support of an associative self-anchoring explanation and the notion of self-generated validity, self-producing consumers bias their sensory perceptions (e.g., perceived level of saltiness and spiciness) so that they match a positive evaluation of the outcome. Mediation analyses show that perceived self-integration (perceived link between self and outcome) partly mediates the positive effect of self-production on outcome evaluation. The authors conclude that branded input products may benefit from the evaluation bias caused by self-production.

Title: Social Effects on Customer Retention
Author-Name: Irit Nitzan, 
Author-Name: Barak Libai
Abstract: This study explores the role of customers' social network in their defection from a service provider. The authors use data on communication among one million customers of a cellular company to create a large-scale social system composed of customers' individual social networks. The study's results indicate that exposure to a defecting neighbor is associated with an increase of 80% in the defection hazard, after controlling for a host of social, personal, and purchase-related variables. This effect is comparable in both magnitude and nature to social effects observed in the highly researched case of product adoption: The extent of social influence on retention decays exponentially over time, and the likelihood of defection is affected by tie strength and homophily with defecting neighbors and by these neighbors' average number of connections. Highly connected customers are more affected, and loyal customers are less affected by defections that occur in their social networks. These results carry important implications for the theoretical understanding of the drivers of customer retention and should be considered by firms that aim to predict and affect customer retention.

Title: What Is Special About Marketing Organic Products? How Organic Assortment, Price, and Promotions Drive Retailer Performance
Author-Name: Ram Bezawada, 
Author-Name: Koen Pauwels
Abstract: Higher sales and margins are key goals for retailers promoting emerging products, such as organics, but little is known about their marketing effectiveness and their cross-effects on conventional product sales. Extant research reports conflicting results about price and promotional sensitivity for organic products and does not address the impact of organic assortment. This article calculates long-term own- and cross-elasticities of organic and conventional product sales in response to changes in assortment, price, and promotions. Using a rich data set of 56 categories, the authors test hypotheses on how different costs and benefits of organic products affect these elasticities. They find that enduring actions, such as assortment and regular price changes, have a higher elasticity for organics than for conventional products. In contrast with common wisdom, even “core” organic consumers are sensitive to these actions. Increasing organic assortment and promotion breadth yields higher profits for the total category, as do more frequent promotions on conventional products. The category comparison yields specific advice with regard to where larger assortment and lower prices versus more and deeper promotions are most effective.

Title: How and When Does Customer Orientation Influence Frontline Employee Job Outcomes? A Meta-Analytic Evaluation
Author-Name: Alex R. Zablah, 
Author-Name: George R. Franke, 
Author-Name: Tom J. Brown, 
Author-Name: Darrell E. Bartholomew
Abstract: Previous research has conceptualized and modeled customer orientation (CO) in one of two ways: as a psychological phenomenon antecedent to critical job states (i.e., stress and engagement) or as frontline employee behaviors that are caused by these same job states. Building on meta-analytic data, this study finds greater support for the causal relationships implied by a psychological construal of the construct and reveals that CO influences frontline employees' job outcomes through its effects on stress and engagement. Moderation analyses also indicate that CO's influence on model variables is stronger when frontline employees' customer workloads increase and is weaker as the need for customer persuasion increases. These findings contradict widely held assumptions rooted in a behavioral view of CO—namely, that CO is a consequence of job states, a proximate determinant of job outcomes, and most beneficial when ample opportunity for customer engagement exists. Overall, the results support a broadened perspective that recognizes that CO improves job outcomes because it enhances frontline employees' psychological welfare in addition to being good for business. These findings suggest that managers should consider CO an important criterion in frontline employee decisions, recognize CO as beneficial when limited opportunity for customer engagement exists, and avoid efforts to curtail CO's costs at the frontline employee level.

Title: Regret from Postpurchase Discovery of Lower Market Prices: Do Price Refunds Help?
Author-Name: Sujay Dutta, 
Author-Name: Abhijit Biswas, 
Author-Name: Dhruv Grewal
Abstract: Consumer regret can result in unfavorable outcomes for marketers. To prevent regret, many retailers promise to refund money to consumers who discover lower prices after purchase. The authors show that a refund's effect on felt regret depends on how consumers view these promises. If consumers mainly view them as protective tools (i.e., adopt a protection focus), postrefund regret is minimal. If consumers primarily view such promises as sources of information about the retailer's price status (i.e., adopt an information focus), regret persists even after refund. The authors show that regret persists with these consumers because finding a lower price results in a perception of trust violation. They find that subject to boundary conditions, using a disclaimer that states that the retailer does not claim to offer the lowest prices helps avoid this negative outcome for information-focused consumers. The authors contribute to the literature on outcome reversibility and regret by showing that outcome reversal does not necessarily obviate regret. In addition, they show that regulatory focus serves as the motivational basis for how consumers view refund promises.

Title: Linking Customer and Financial Metrics to Shareholder Value: The Leverage Effect in Customer-Based Valuation
Author-Name: Christian Schulze, 
Author-Name: Bernd Skiera, 
Author-Name: Thorsten Wiesel
Abstract: Customers are the most important assets of most companies, such that customer equity has been used as a proxy for shareholder value. However, linking customer metrics to shareholder value without considering debt and non-operating assets ignores their effects on relative changes in customer equity and leads to biased estimates. In developing a new theoretical framework for customer-based valuation, grounded in valuation theory, this article links the value of all customers to shareholder value and introduces a new leverage effect that can translate percentage changes in customer equity into shareholder value. The average leverage effect in more than 2000 companies across ten years is 1.55, which indicates that a 10% increase in customer equity is amplified to a 15.5% increase in shareholder value. This research also compares the influence of customer and financial metrics on shareholder value. The findings challenge previous notions about the dominant effect of the retention rate and underline the importance of predicting the number of future acquired customers for a company.

Title: The Aha! Experience: Insight and Discontinuous Learning in Product Usage
Author-Name: Arun Lakshmanan, 
Author-Name: H. Shanker Krishnan
Abstract: Success of many products depends on how consumers learn to use them. This research suggests that initial product trial may lead to jumps in consumer learning. Such discontinuities in learning co-occur with the experience of insight—namely, a better conceptual understanding of how to use the product. Notably, such learning also positively affects downstream outcomes such as affect and usage intentions. Whereas exploration during initial trial facilitates insight-based learning, usage instructions seem to limit this type of learning. The implication for marketing managers is to structure initial trials in a manner conducive to exploration, thus leading to insight-driven learning and the associated positive outcomes.

Title: When Is Ours Better Than Mine? A Framework for Understanding and Altering Participation in Commercial Sharing Systems
Author-Name: Cait Poynor Lamberton, 
Author-Name: Randall L. Rose
Abstract: Sharing systems are increasingly challenging sole ownership as the dominant means of obtaining product benefits, making up a market estimated at more than US$100 billion annually in 2010. Consumer options include cell phone minute-sharing plans, frequent-flyer-mile pools, bicycle-sharing programs, and automobile-sharing systems, among many others. However, marketing research has yet to provide a framework for understanding and managing these emergent systems. The authors conceptualize commercial sharing systems within a typology of shared goods. Using three studies, they demonstrate that beyond cost-related benefits of sharing, the perceived risk of scarcity related to sharing is a central determinant of its attractiveness. The results suggest that managers can use perceptions of personal and sharing partners' usage patterns to affect risk perceptions and subsequent propensity to participate in a commercial sharing system.

Title: Social Influence Effects in Online Product Ratings
Author-Name: Shrihari Sridhar, 
Author-Name: Raji Srinivasan
Abstract: Websites prominently display consumers' product ratings, which influence consumers' buying decisions and willingness to pay. Few insights exist regarding whether a consumer's online product rating is prone to social influence from others' online ratings. Examining this issue, the authors hypothesize that other consumers' online ratings moderate the effects of positive and regular negative features of product experience, product failure, and product recovery (to address product failure) on the reviewer's online product rating. The results from a model using 7499 consumers' online ratings of 114 hotels support the hypotheses. Other consumers' online ratings weaken the effects of positive and regular negative features of product experience but can either exacerbate or overturn the negative effect of product failure, depending on the quality of product recovery. For marketing theory, the findings indicate that consumers who influence others are themselves influenced by other consumers and that this influence is contingent on their product experience. For managerial practice, the authors offer a method to estimate the effects of product experience characteristics on online product ratings and show that social influence effects make high online product ratings a double-edged sword, exacerbating the negative effect of product failure and strengthening the benefit of product recovery.

Abstract: Global brands are faced with the challenge of conveying concepts that not only are consistent across borders but also resonate with consumers of different cultures. Building on prior research indicating that abstract brand concepts induce more favorable consumer responses than functional attributes, the authors introduce a generalizable and robust structure of abstract brand concepts as representations of human values. Using three empirical studies conducted with respondents from eight countries, they demonstrate that this proposed structure is particularly useful for predicting (1) brand meanings that are compatible (vs. incompatible) with each other and, consequently, more (less) favorably accepted by consumers when added to an already established brand concept; (2) brand concepts that are more likely to resonate with consumers with differing cultural orientations; and (3) consumers' responses to attempts to imbue an established brand concept with new, (in)compatible abstract meanings as a function of their own cultural orientations.

Title: How Doppelgänger Brand Images Influence the Market Creation Process: Longitudinal Insights from the Rise of Botox Cosmetic
Author-Name: Markus Giesler
Abstract: Using actor-network theory from sociology, the author explores the creation of new markets as a brand-mediated legitimation process. Findings from an eight-year longitudinal investigation of the Botox Cosmetic brand suggest that the meanings of a new cosmetic self-enhancement technology evolve over the course of contestations between brand images promoted by the innovator and doppelgänger brand images promoted by other stakeholders. Each contestation addresses an enduring contradiction between nature and technology. A four-step brand image revitalization process is offered that can be applied either by managers interested in fostering an innovation's congruence with prevailing social norms and ideals or by other stakeholders (e.g., activists, competitors) interested in undermining its marketing success. The findings integrate previously disparate research streams on branding and market creation and provide managers with the conceptual tools for sustaining a branded innovation's legitimacy over time.

Author-Name: Suman Basuroy
Author-Name: Thorsten Hennig-Thurau
Author-Name: Bruno Kocher
Abstract: Innovations commonly involve changes to iterated market offerings (e.g., new games, car models, film sequels). To better understand consumer iteration responses, the authors develop and test a theoretical framework grounded in (1) prior innovations serving as reference states (comparators) for later innovations and (2) consumer desires for both comfort and stimulation. In Study 1’s online game, prior innovations and loss aversion (greater loss than gain impact) moderate evaluations of current innovations, whereby an introduction-weaker-stronger innovation sequence (Periods 1–3 of four periods) generates more entertainment than an introduction-stronger-weaker sequence because the former’s weak-opening-then-rise does less harm than the latter's strong-opening-then-drop. Study 2 replicates Study 1 and shows that an introduction-weaker-weaker sequence produces enough habituation and diminishing negative returns to outperform an introduction-stronger-weaker sequence at Period 4. Study 3 offers marketplace corroboration with a film industry test in which minor (fewer) innovations perform better (e.g., sales, return on investment) earlier in franchises, whereas major (many) innovations perform better later, thereby reconciling prior research’s opposing prescriptions for the use of major versus minor sequel innovations. The framework and results implicate carefully sequenced innovations for managing consumer iteration responses, including the possibility of interspersing weaker/minor innovations among stronger/major innovations.

Title: Rising from the Ashes: How Brands and Categories Can Overcome Product-Harm Crises
Author-Name: Kathleen Cleeren,

Author-Name: Marnik G. Dekimpe
Abstract: Product-harm crises are omnipresent in today's marketplace. Such crises can cause major revenue and market-share losses, lead to costly product recalls, and destroy carefully nurtured brand equity. Moreover, some of these effects may spill over to nonaffected competitors in the category when they are perceived to be guilty by association. The extant literature lacks generalizable knowledge on the effectiveness of different marketing adjustments that managers often consider to mitigate the consequences of such events. To fill this gap, the authors use large household-scanner panels to analyze 60 fast-moving consumer good product crises that occurred in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands and resulted in the full recall of an entire variety. The authors assess the effects of postcrisis advertising and price adjustments on the change in consumers' brand share and category purchases. In addition, they consider the extent to which the effects are moderated by two key crisis characteristics: the extent of negative publicity surrounding the event and whether the affected brand had to publicly acknowledge blame. Using the empirical findings, the authors provide context-specific managerial recommendations on how to overcome a product-harm crisis.

Title: Go Green! Should Environmental Messages Be So Assertive?

Abstract: Environmental communications often contain assertive commands, even though research in consumer behavior, psycholinguistics, and communications has repeatedly shown that gentler phrasing is more effective when seeking consumer compliance. This article shows that the persuasiveness of assertive language depends on the perceived importance of the issue at hand: Recipients respond better to pushy requests in domains that they view as important, but they need more suggestive appeals when they lack initial conviction. The authors examine this effect in three laboratory studies and one field experiment using Google AdWords. Their findings refer to various environmental contexts (i.e., economizing water, recycling plastic containers, reducing air and sea pollution). The key implication of these findings is that issue importance needs to be carefully assessed (or affected) before the language of effective environmental campaigns can be selected.

Title: Creating Major Innovations with Customers: Insights from Small and Young Technology Firms
Author-Name: Nicole E. Coviello, 
Author-Name: Richard M. Joseph
Abstract: The marketing literature typically argues that customers cannot easily be involved with, and contribute to, the creation of major innovation (MI). This article finds otherwise. The authors use an inductive process method to study how six MIs were developed for business-to-business markets by small and young technology firms. Three of the MIs were successful, and three failed. The firms with MI success are distinguished by a nonconventional new product development process that includes five iterative and overlapping activities and up to ten different customer roles. These activities and roles are captured in a multifaceted taxonomy of customer participation. The analysis also uncovers three capabilities relevant to the development of successful MI—capabilities that are effectual rather than adaptive in nature. These findings and the propositions derived from them offer a more complete understanding of customer participation, new product development across contexts, and marketing capabilities.

Title: Return Shipping Policies of Online Retailers: Normative Assumptions and the Long-Term Consequences of Fee and Free Returns
Author-Name: Amanda B. Bower, 
Author-Name: James G. Maxham, III
Abstract: To limit costs associated with product returns, some online retailers have instituted equity-based return shipping policies, requiring customers to pay to return products when retailers determine that customers are at fault. The authors compare the normative assumptions about customers that underlie equity-based return shipping policies with the more realistic, positivist expectations as predicted by attribution, equity, and regret theories. Two longitudinal field studies over four years using two surveys and actual customer spending data indicate that retailer confidence in those normative assumptions is unjustified. Contrary to retailer assumptions, neither the positive consequences of free returns nor the negative consequences of fee returns were reversed when customer perceptions of fairness were taken into account. Depending on the locus and extent of blame, customers who paid for their own return decreased their postreturn spending at that retailer 75%–100% by the end of two years. In contrast, returns that were free to the consumer resulted in postreturn customer spending that was 158%–457% of prereturn spending. The findings suggest that online retailers should either institute a policy of free product returns or, at a minimum, examine their customer data to determine their customers' responses to fee returns.

Title: Optimizing Service Productivity
Author-Name: Roland T. Rust, 
Author-Name: Ming-Hui Huang
Abstract: To increase service productivity, many companies utilize automation extensively to reduce the use of labor. However, greater use of automation does not always result in higher service quality, and the effectiveness of automation in providing service hinges on how advanced the technology level is. Departing from the standard perspective in which productivity is simply treated as an output measure of firm performance, the authors propose service productivity as a strategic decision variable; that is, the firm manages the service productivity level to maximize profits. They develop a theory of optimal service productivity that explains when the optimal productivity level will be higher or lower and distinguishes between short-term effects of service productivity due to labor–automation trade-offs and long-term effects due to the advance of technology. The theory, together with the existing literature, inspires the development of three testable empirical hypotheses, which are confirmed using data from more than 700 service companies in two time periods. The research shows that service productivity should be lower when factors (e.g., higher profit margin, higher price) motivate the provision of better service quality and that service productivity should be higher when factors (e.g., higher market concentration, higher wages) discourage the provision of better service quality. The empirical results also provide preliminary evidence that large service companies may tend to be too productive relative to the optimal level and, if so, should place less emphasis (in the short run) on cost reduction through automation and more emphasis on service quality.

Title: When More Is Less: The Impact of Base Value Neglect on Consumer Preferences for Bonus Packs over Price Discounts
Author-Name: Haipeng (Allan) Chen, 
Author-Name: Howard Marmorstein, 
Author-Name: Michael Tsiros, 
Author-Name: Akshay R. Rao
Abstract: The interpretation of a percentage change often hinges on the base value to which it is attached. The authors identify a tendency among consumers to neglect base values when processing percentage change information and investigate the implications of such base value neglect for how consumers evaluate economically equivalent offers presented in percentage terms, such as bonus packs and price discounts. The authors first document a substantial advantage in sales volume for a bonus pack over an economically equivalent price discount in a field experiment conducted in a retail store. Furthermore, in a mall-intercept survey and multiple lab studies, the authors provide additional evidence in support of the effect and identify managerially useful boundary conditions for when the effect is likely to manifest. The article concludes with a discussion of the theoretical and managerial implications of the findings.

Title: Multiple Identification Foci and Their Countervailing Effects on Salespeople's Negative Headquarters Stereotypes
Author-Name: Jan Wieseke, 
Author-Name: Florian Kraus, 
Author-Name: Michael Ahearne, 
Author-Name: Sven Mikolon
Abstract: Using a large-scale, multilevel data set, this study introduces to the sales management literature the concept of sales representatives' headquarters stereotypes as a negative outcome of social identification. The results suggest that work team identification fosters headquarters stereotyping more strongly when organizational identification is low than when it is high. Salespeople's physical distance from their corporate headquarters increases work team identification and decreases organizational identification. Competitive intensity, as an external threat to salespeople's social identity, strengthens stereotyping and social identification. In addition to important theoretical implications, this research also provides crucial insights for managers. Headquarters stereotypes are critically important because they can have harmful consequences for sales performance and customer satisfaction. Key managerial implications are that managers should foster organizational identification and that using different compensation systems does not remedy the negative effects of stereotypes.

Title: Unprofitable Cross-Buying: Evidence from Consumer and Business Markets
Author-Name: Denish Shah, 
Author-Name: V. Kumar,

Author-Name: Sylia Chen
Abstract: Conventional wisdom, marketing literature, and cross-selling practices to date are based on the notion that customer cross-buying is positively associated with customer profitability. However, this study finds that when certain customers with persistent adverse behavioral traits (e.g., limited spending, excessive revenue reversals, excessive service requests, promotion purchase behavior) engage in cross-buying, they exhibit a downward spiral of unprofitable relationship, with the losses increasing with higher levels of cross-buy. The authors analyze the customer databases of five firms and find that 10%–35% of the firms' customers who cross-buy are unprofitable and account for a significant proportion (39%–88%) of the firms' total loss from its customers. Consequently, the authors present a two-stage framework to enable managers to discern customers who are likely to engage in profitable versus unprofitable cross-buying. Overall, the findings refine the basic understanding of the cross-buy phenomenon and motivate managers to rethink their marketing practices and policies, which are typically designed to maximize cross-buy opportunities for every customer.

Title: Generating Sales While Providing Service: A Study of Customer Service Representatives' Ambidextrous Behavior
Author-Name: Claudia Jasmand, 
Author-Name: Vera Blazevic, 
Author-Name: Ko de Ruyter
Abstract: Cross- and up-selling in inbound call centers is a growing business practice, with the promise of enhanced revenue generation and customer retention. Yet firms struggle to create conditions that are conducive to customer service representatives' (CSRs') concurrent engagement in service and sales. By developing a framework of the antecedents and performance consequences of aligned sales and customer service provision, this study advances understanding of ambidexterity at the employee level. The framework receives strong support from an empirical study based on CSRs' survey responses and matched performance data. A CSR's locomotion orientation facilitates ambidextrous behavior and interacts positively with an assessment orientation. However, team identification and bounded discretion impair this valuable interplay. Ambidextrous behavior also increases customer satisfaction and sales performance but decreases efficiency. Nevertheless, the overall performance effect is positive.

Title: The Innovation Effect of User Design: Exploring Consumers' Innovation Perceptions of Firms Selling Products Designed by Users
Author-Name: Martin Schreier, 
Author-Name: Christoph Fuchs, 
Author-Name: Darren W. Dahl
Abstract: The authors study consumer perceptions of firms that sell products designed by users. In contrast with the traditional design mode, in which professional designers employed by firms handle the design task, common design by users involves the firm's user community in creating new product designs for the broader consumer market. In the course of four studies, the authors find that common design by users does not decrease but actually enhances consumers' perceptions of a firm's innovation ability. This “innovation effect of user design” leads to positive outcomes with respect to purchase intentions, willingness to pay, and consumers' willingness to recommend the firm to others. The authors identify four defining characteristics of common design by users that underlie this innovation inference; namely, the number of consumers, the diversity of their background, the lack of company constraints, and the fact that consumer designers actually use the designed product all contribute in building positive perceptions. Finally, the authors identify consumer familiarity with user innovation and the design task's complexity as important moderators that create boundary conditions for the innovation effect of user design.

Title: Firm Innovativeness and Its Performance Outcomes: A Meta-Analytic Review and Theoretical Integration
Author-Name: Gaia Rubera, 
Author-Name: Ahmet H. Kirca
Abstract: Drawing on the chain-of-effects model as a unifying framework, this meta-analysis indicates that firm innovativeness indirectly affects firm value through its effects on market position and financial position. In addition, the findings suggest that innovativeness has direct positive effects on financial position and firm value. Moreover, the meta-analysis provides evidence of reverse causality in the innovativeness–firm value relationship. Importantly, the results also reveal that the positive effects of firm innovativeness on market position and financial position are stronger for larger firms, for firms that invest more in advertising, for firms in high-tech industries, for innovativeness outputs and for radical innovations. Finally, the meta-analytic evidence also indicates that the relationship between innovativeness and firm value is stronger for smaller firms, for firms that invest more in advertising, for firms in lowtech industries, for innovativeness inputs, for innovativeness culture, and for radical innovations.

Title: The Impact of Brand Equity on Customer Acquisition, Retention, and Profit Margin
Author-Name: Florian Stahl, 
Author-Name: Mark Heitmann, 
Author-Name: Donald R. Lehmann, 
Author-Name: Scott A. Neslin
Abstract: The authors investigate the relationships between brand equity and customer acquisition, retention, and profit margin, the key components of customer lifetime value (CLV). They examine a unique database from the U.S. automobile market that combines ten years of acquisition rate, retention rate, and customer profitability data with measures of brand equity from Young & Rubicam's Brand Asset Valuator (BAV) over the same period. They hypothesize and find that BAV brand equity is significantly associated with the components of CLV in expected and meaningful ways. For example, customer knowledge of a brand has an especially strong positive relationship with all three components of CLV. Notably, however, differentiation is a double-edged sword. While it is associated with higher customer profitability, it is also associated with lower acquisition and retention rates. The authors also find that marketing efforts exert indirect impacts on CLV through brand equity. Simulations show that changes in marketing, or exogenous changes in brand equity, can exert important effects on CLV. Overall, the findings suggest that the “soft” and “hard” sides of marketing need to be managed in a coordinated way. The authors conclude with a discussion of these and other implications for researchers and practitioners.

Title: Employees' Decision Making in the Face of Customers' Fuzzy Return Requests
Author-Name: Sijun Wang, 
Author-Name: Sharon E. Beatty, 
Author-Name: Jeanny Liu
Abstract: Frontline service employees frequently encounter customers' fuzzy requests, defined as requests that are slightly or somewhat outside company policy but not completely unacceptable or detrimental to the company. Employees' compliance decisions can profoundly affect customers, organizations, and employees themselves. However, the complex decision process in which service employees engage is largely unexplored. The authors draw from script and motivated reasoning theories, as well as qualitative interviews, to model employees' responses to customers' fuzzy requests in a retail setting. The results, which are based on a national survey of retail employees, indicate that employees with higher customer orientation and higher conflict avoidance tend to handle fuzzy return requests in a friendlier, more effortful manner, especially when customers demonstrate an affiliative style. In contrast, when customers display a dominant style, employees engage in motivated reasoning and perceive the request to be less legitimate, reducing their likelihood of complying. In addition, the employees' perceived flexibility influences their compliance decisions, but punishment expectations do not. The authors conclude with some managerial implications, including better identification of these requests and more training of employees to handle them appropriately.

Title: Retailers' Use of Partially Comparative Pricing: From Across-Category to Within-Category Effects

Author-Name: Cecilia M.O. Alvarez
Abstract: Prior research suggests that partially comparative pricing—in which a retailer provides price comparisons for some, but not all, of its products—is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, such pricing improves beliefs about the retailer's competitive price advantage on comparatively priced products for which its prices are compared with a competitor. On the other hand, it has been shown to damage perceptions of the retailer's noncomparatively priced products relative to those charged by the competition. However, this latter outcome is based on evidence examining the influence of partially comparative pricing across different product categories. The authors propose and demonstrate in five studies that price comparisons may actually improve relative price beliefs about the noncomparatively priced brands within the same product category. They further show this improvement to be attenuated as the number of price comparisons increase or when the price comparison is attached to a brand perceived as less typical of the product category. The authors conclude by drawing managerial implications and offer suggestions for further research.

Title: Can Automated Group Recommender Systems Help Consumers Make Better Choices?
Author-Name: Thorsten Hennig-Thurau, 
Author-Name: André Marchand, 
Author-Name: Paul Marx
Abstract: Because hedonic products consist predominantly of experience attributes, often with many available alternatives, choosing the “right” one is a demanding task for consumers. Decision making becomes even more difficult when a group, instead of an individual consumer, will consume the product, as is regularly the case for hedonic offerings such as movies, opera performances, and wine. Noting the prevalence of automated recommender systems as decision aids, the authors investigate the power of group recommender systems that consider the preferences of all group members. The authors develop a conceptual framework of the effects of group recommenders and empirically examine these effects through two choice experiments. They find that automated group recommenders offer more valuable information than single recommenders when the choice agent must consume the recommended alternative. However, when agents choose freely among alternatives, the group's social relationship quality determines whether group recommenders actually create higher group value. Finally, group recommenders outperform decision making without automated recommendations if the agent's intention to use the systems is high. A decision tree model of recommender usage offers guidance to hedonic product managers.

Title: The Effects of Positive and Negative Online Customer Reviews: Do Brand Strength and Category Maturity Matter?
Author-Name: Nga N. Ho-Dac

Author-Name: William L. Moore
Abstract: Research has shown brand equity to moderate the relationship between online customer reviews (OCRs) and sales in both the emerging Blu-ray and mature DVD player categories. Positive (negative) OCRs increase (decrease) the sales of models of weak brands (i.e., brands without significant positive brand equity). In contrast, OCRs have no significant impact on the sales of the models of strong brands, although these models do receive a significant sales boost from their greater brand equity. Higher sales lead to a larger number of positive OCRs, and increased positive OCRs aid a brand's transition from weak to strong. This creates a positive feedback loop between sales and positive OCRs for models of weak brands that not only helps their sales but also increases overall brand equity, benefiting all models of the brand. In contrast to the view that brands matter less in the presence of OCRs, we find that OCRs matter less in the presence of strong brands. Positive OCRs function differently than marketing communications in that their effect is greater for weak brands.

Title: Beyond the “Like” Button: The Impact of Mere Virtual Presence on Brand Evaluations and Purchase Intentions in Social Media Settings
Author-Name: Rebecca Walker Naylor,

Author-Name: Patricia M. West
Abstract: By 2011, approximately 83% of Fortune 500 companies were using some form of social media to connect with consumers. Furthermore, surveys suggest that consumers are increasingly relying on social media to learn about unfamiliar brands. However, best practices regarding the use of social media to bolster brand evaluations in such situations remain undefined. This research focuses on one practice in this domain: the decision to hide or reveal the demographic characteristics of a brand's online supporters. The results from four studies indicate that even when the presence of these supporters is only passively experienced and virtual (a situation the authors term “mere virtual presence”), their demographic characteristics can influence a target consumer's brand evaluations and purchase intentions. The findings suggest a framework for brand managers to use when deciding whether to reveal the identities of their online supporters or to retain ambiguity according to (1) the composition of existing supporters relative to targeted new supporters and (2) whether the brand is likely to be evaluated singly or in combination with competing brands.

Author-Name: Maik Hammerschmidt
Abstract: This article introduces customer stewardship control (CSC) to the marketing field. This concept represents a frontline employee's felt ownership of and moral responsibility for customers' overall welfare. In two studies, the authors show that CSC is a more encompassing construct than customer orientation, which reflects a frontline employee's focus on meeting customers' needs. They provide evidence that the former is more potent in shaping in- and extra-role employee behaviors. Moreover, they highlight how CSC operates in conjunction with an organization's agency control system: Stewardship's positive influence on in- and extra-role behavior is weaker in the presence of high agency control. They offer actionable advice about how to solve the resulting managerial control dilemma. Finally, the authors show that CSC depends on drivers that reside at the individual level (employee relatedness), the team level (team competence), or both levels of aggregation (employee and team autonomy). These findings show how to effectively design a frontline employee's work environment to ensure optimal frontline performance.

Title: Alliance Portfolio Resource Diversity and Firm Innovation
Author-Name: Anna S. Cui, 
Author-Name: Gina O'Connor
Abstract: As interfirm collaboration plays an increasingly important role in firm innovation, many firms are engaged in multiple partnerships, forming portfolios of alliances. Research in marketing has predominantly focused on dyadic relationships without considering the important interdependencies among different alliances. This study takes a portfolio approach to examine the resource diversity of multiple alliance partners and its contribution to firm innovation. The authors argue that resource diversity in an alliance portfolio can only benefit innovation when resources and information are shared across alliances. They examine factors that may facilitate or inhibit information and resource sharing across alliances and thus influence the realization of any benefit of portfolio resource diversity. The model identifies various factors along three dimensions, including the composition of an alliance portfolio, alliance management, and the market environment, that moderate the relationship between alliance portfolio resource diversity and firm innovation. This study not only demonstrates the conditions for a firm to benefit from diverse partners but also highlights the importance of coordination among different alliances, suggesting a portfolio approach for alliance research.

Title: Brand Licensing: What Drives Royalty Rates?
Author-Name: Satish Jayachandran
Author-Name: Peter Kaufman
Author-Name: V. Kumar
Author-Name: Kelly Hewett
Abstract: In brand licensing, the brand owner (the licensor) grants another firm (the licensee) the right to use the brand. This differs from franchising, in which a contractual arrangement between a franchisor and a franchisee exists to run a business based on the franchisor's business model. Brand licensing helps generate revenues and protect the brand from misappropriation. In such contractual arrangements, agency theory suggests that when parties to the contract engage in moral hazard (i.e., opportunistic behavior), suboptimal outcomes may result. The authors examine how concerns of moral hazard affect royalty rate, a popular form of compensation in brand licensing. From an agency theory perspective, they discuss how market and contract characteristics influence the risk of moral hazard and shape royalty rates in international brand licensing. The results obtained using data from international licensing contracts indicate that a country's intellectual property rights protection enables licensees to benefit from lower royalty rates and market size enables licensors to demand higher royalty rates. The authors also examine impact of other contract characteristics, such as contract duration and exclusivity, on royalty rate. The results imply that concerns of opportunistic behavior on the part of both the licensor and the licensee influence royalty rates.

Title: Portfolio Dynamics and Alliance Termination: The Contingent Role of Resource Dissimilarity
Author-Name: Anna S. Cui
Abstract: This article takes a portfolio approach to examine how an alliance's propensity of termination is influenced by its resource relationships with other alliances of the firm. Whereas previous research has suggested that similar partner resources in a portfolio create redundancy and that dissimilar resources are beneficial, this study argues that redundancy may be necessary to ensure stable access to resources and that synergies from dissimilar resources may be difficult to realize. Thus, under some conditions, resource dissimilarity may be less supportive of, or even detrimental to, the continuity of an alliance. The author identifies several conditional factors that change the role of resource dissimilarity. While relational connectedness between the focal partner and other partners of the firm is found to strengthen the supporting effect of resource dissimilarity on alliance continuity, vertical connectedness of alliance activities, formation of substituting alliances by the focal partner, and market uncertainty weaken the supporting effect of resource dissimilarity. The findings reveal alliance termination factors beyond dyadic interactions and provide important implications for managing interdependencies within an alliance portfolio to enhance alliance stability.

Title: Supplier-Selected Referrals
Author-Name: Mahima Hada
Author-Name: Rajdeep Grewal
Author-Name: Gary L. Lilien
Abstract: In business-to-business markets, suppliers often ask an existing customer to provide a referral for them (i.e., a supplier-selected referral), in which the supplier selects a referrer to influence a specific potential customer favorably. The selection of the referrer is important because the right referrer providing the right message can generate business for the supplier. To study supplier-selected referrals, the authors extend the dyadic source– message–recipient communication framework to propose a framework that incorporates the supplier and the supplier’s management of the communication between the referrer and the potential customer. They label this framework the Managed Triadic Communication (MaTriC) framework. The authors conduct three experimental studies in which they apply the MaTriC framework to the domain of supplier-selected referrals and focus on the contingent role of supplier uncertainty. The authors find that the benefits of a supplier-selected referral are contingent on supplier uncertainty. For example, their findings imply that an outsupplier should focus on selecting a referrer that would give an all-positive evaluation (vs. a balanced evaluation), whereas an insupplier should focus on selecting a highly credible referrer, even if that referral does not provide an all-positive evaluation of the supplier.

Title: Finding a Home for Products We Love: How Buyer Usage Intent Affects the Pricing of Used Goods
Author-Name: Aaron R. Brough, 
Author-Name: Mathew S. Isaac
Abstract: Consumers often dispose of used products by selling them in a secondary market (e.g., classified advertisements, Craigslist, eBay). When consumers must dispose of products to which they feel emotionally attached, they often expect to sell the product at a price in excess of its market value. However, the authors identify a condition in which product attachment can decrease rather than increase the minimum price sellers are willing to accept. Specifically, they propose that due to concern for how products are used following a transaction, strongly attached sellers may be more willing than weakly attached sellers to provide discounts to potential buyers whose usage intentions are deemed appropriate. Whereas prior research has focused primarily on one particular consequence of attachment, namely, the intensified reluctance of consumers to part with their possessions, this research identifies a novel consequence of attachment: a heightened sensitivity to the manner in which the product will be used following a transaction. Four empirical studies provide converging evidence that sellers' product attachment determines the extent to which their minimum acceptable sales price is influenced by buyer usage intent.

Author-Name: Simon S.K. Lam
Abstract: Extant research confirms the importance of value cocreation through customer participation (CP), but relatively little is known about whether and how it creates an enjoyable experience for customers and service employees and the consequential outcomes of this positive affective experience. This study applies the concept of flow as an overarching framework and draws theoretical support from social cognitive theory, particularly its extension (i.e., the conceptual model of relational efficacy beliefs), to examine how customers and employees derive enjoyment from CP conditional on their perceived efficacy of themselves (self-efficacy [SE]) and their partners (other-efficacy [OE]) in financial services. Empirical results from 223 client–financial adviser dyads confirm that participation enjoyment, in addition to economic and relational values, mediates the impact of CP on participants' satisfaction evaluations, with SE positively moderating CP's impact on participation enjoyment. The synergistic effect of SE and OE on participation enjoyment also differs for clients versus financial advisers: Even incongruent levels of SE and OE can enhance participation enjoyment as long as they help validate role expectations of the respective participants.

Abstract: Salespeople represent a primary source of competitive intelligence (CI), but the contextual factors that influence the performance impact of salesperson CI quality remain underresearched. The authors develop a framework to examine the performance impact of CI quality at the individual salesperson and sales district levels, with sales district CI quality diversity and sales managers’ network centrality as contingencies thereof. The empirical results from multilevel data sets of two U.S.-based corporations reveal that district CI quality diversity weakens the positive performance effect of CI quality at both levels. Sales managers’ centrality in within-district and peer advice networks buffers the performance losses created by district CI quality diversity, but salespeople’s centrality does not have this buffering effect. The study uncovers conditions under which the positive performance impact of salesperson and district CI quality can disappear and even become negative, thus highlighting the role of managers as CI hubs.

In two studies, the authors demonstrate that commitment velocity has a strong impact on performance, beyond the impact of the level of commitment. In Study 1, modeling six years of longitudinal data in a latent growth curve analysis, the authors empirically demonstrate the significance of commitment velocity as a predictor of performance. In Study 2, the authors use matched multiple-source data to investigate the drivers of commitment velocity. Both customer trust and dynamic capabilities for creating value through exchange relationships (i.e., communication capabilities for exploring and investment capabilities for exploiting opportunities) affect commitment velocity. However, trust and communication capabilities become less impactful as a relationship ages, while investment capabilities grow more important. The authors offer three post hoc tenets that represent initial components of a theory of relationship dynamics that integrates two streams of relationship marketing research into a unified perspective.

Title: To Buy or Not to Buy: Consumers' Demand Response Patterns for Healthy Versus Unhealthy Food
Author-Name: Debabrata Talukdar, 
Author-Name: Charles Lindsey
Abstract: The authors integrate research on impulsivity from the psychology area with standard economic theories of consumer demand to make novel predictions about the effects of market price changes on consumers' food consumption behavior. The results from multiple studies confirm that consumers exhibit undesirable asymmetric patterns of demand sensitivity to price changes for healthy and unhealthy food. For healthy food, demand sensitivity is greater for a price increase than for a price decrease. For unhealthy food, the opposite holds true. The research further shows that the undesirable patterns are attenuated or magnified for key policy-relevant factors that have been shown to decrease or increase impulsive purchase behavior, respectively. As the rising obesity trend brings American consumers' food consumption behavior under increased scrutiny, the focal findings hold significant implications for both public policy makers and food marketers.

Title: You Get What You Pay For: The Effect of Top Executives' Compensation on Advertising and R&D Spending Decisions and Stock Market Return
Author-Name: Imran S. Currim, 
Author-Name: Jooseop Lim, 
Author-Name: Joung W. Kim
Abstract: Although there is literature on how top executives' compensation influences general management decisions, relatively little is known about whether and how compensation influences advertising and research-and-development (R&D) spending decisions. This study addresses two questions. First, is there an incentive effect of long- versus short-term compensation on advertising and R&D spending? Second, is there a mediation effect of advertising and R&D spending on the relationship between long- versus short-term compensation and stock market return? The authors address these questions using a combination of ExecuComp, Compustat, and Center for Research in Security Prices data on 842 firms during the 1993–2005 period. They find that an increase in the equity to bonus compensation ratio is positively associated with an increase in advertising and R&D spending as a share of sales. Advertising and R&D spending as a share of sales also mediates the effect of equity to bonus ratio on stock market return. The authors discuss implications for top management seeking to mitigate myopic management of resources by employing compensation to incentivize a longer-term orientation for advertising and R&D spending to improve stock return.

Title: Corporate Social Responsibility, Customer Orientation, and the Job Performance of Frontline Employees
Author-Name: Daniel Korschun
Author-Name: C.B. Bhattacharya
Author-Name: Scott D. Swain
Abstract: This study examines frontline employee responses to corporate social responsibility (CSR) using a multisourced data set at a Global 500 financial services company. The authors find that frontline employees identify with the organization (i.e., organizational identification) and with customers (i.e., employee–customer identification) as a function of how much the employees perceive management and customers (respectively) to support the company's CSR activities. However, these respective effects are stronger among employees for whom CSR is already tied to their sense of self (i.e., CSR importance to the employee). In addition, both organizational identification and employee–customer identification are related to supervisor-rated job performance; however, only the effect of employee–customer identification is mediated by customer orientation, suggesting that these two targets of identification manifest through distinct mechanisms. The research empirically addresses the open questions of whether and when CSR can yield observable changes in employee behavior and alerts researchers to a novel target of identification for frontline employees.

Title: How to Organize Pricing? Vertical Delegation and Horizontal Dispersion of Pricing Authority
Author-Name: Christian Homburg, 
Author-Name: Ove Jensen, 
Author-Name: Alexander Hahn
Abstract: Although pricing is one of the strongest drivers of profitability, little empirical research has examined how a firm should organize pricing internally. This research draws on the information-processing view of organizational design to conceptualize a framework of how firms organize their pricing authority both within the sales function and across the sales, marketing, and finance functions. The authors find a nonlinear, inverted U-shaped relationship between the vertical delegation of pricing authority and profitability as well as a positive relationship between the horizontal dispersion of pricing authority across sales, marketing, and finance and profitability. Another key finding is a positive interaction between vertical delegation and horizontal dispersion, indicating that firms need to jointly design vertical delegation and horizontal dispersion. In addition, the results identify price-related market dynamism as a moderator of the horizontal dispersion of the pricing authority–profitability relationship and emphasis on margin-based incentives as a moderator of vertical delegation of the pricing authority–profitability relationship. The authors also analyze the relationship between the organizational design of pricing authority and sales growth.

Title: An Investigation of the Effectiveness of Uncertainty in Marketing Promotions Involving Free Gifts
Author-Name: Juliano Laran, 
Author-Name: Michael Tsiros
Abstract: The authors provide a framework to predict when uncertainty will have a beneficial or detrimental impact on marketing promotions involving free gifts. Whereas uncertainty (i.e., not knowing which free gift will be offered) decreases purchase likelihood when the decision is cognitive, it increases purchase likelihood when the decision is affective. Using field and laboratory studies, the authors demonstrate that when the decision involves affect, people like to be surprised and appreciate uncertainty in the purchase process. When the decision is cognitive, consumers appreciate having information about the product offer. This research has both theoretical implications for research on affect and uncertainty and practical implications for marketing managers designing and implementing promotional campaigns.

Title: When Value Trumps Health in a Supersized World
Author-Name: Kelly L. Haws, 
Author-Name: Karen Page Winterich
Abstract: Marketers often offer consumers the option to “supersize” a food purchase intended for immediate consumption. Supersized products may be attractive to consumers from the standpoint of the unit pricing because ordering a larger size of the same product results in a per-unit savings and offers consumers the opportunity to meet their value-based financial goals. In this article, the authors show that such pricing strategies not only lead to greater purchase and consumption but do so by affecting important consumer goals in unrelated domains—namely, by decreasing the importance placed on health goals. Although supersized pricing can have a powerful effect on purchase behavior, providing health cues can prevent the decreased focus on health. In addition, supersized pricing can be used to increase size choice of healthy foods. The authors discuss the study's contributions to theory, particularly for understanding decisions regarding the pursuit of multiple goals and, more specifically, those that lie at the intersection of health and finance. In addition, the results suggest both marketing and public policy implications, including those for the obesity epidemic and frequent use of supersized pricing strategies for unhealthy foods.

Title: Double Standard: The Role of Environmental Consciousness in Green Product Usage
Author-Name: Ying-Ching Lin, 
Author-Name: Chiu-chi Angela Chang
Abstract: The results from three studies suggest that consumers' perceptions of product effectiveness are critical in determining the amount of a product they choose to use in a given instance. In general, consumers consider green, or environmentally friendly, products to be less effective than regular products; therefore, consumers increase the amount of the green product they use to make up for the perceived inferiority. Notably, this pattern of green versus regular product usage is more pronounced among consumers who are environmentally conscious. When the perceived effectiveness of a green product is boosted by a credible endorsement, the discrepancy between green and regular product usage disappears.

Title: When Do (and Don't) Normative Appeals Influence Sustainable Consumer Behaviors?
Author-Name: Katherine White, 
Author-Name: Bonnie Simpson
Abstract: The authors explore how injunctive appeals (i.e., highlighting what others think one should do), descriptive appeals (i.e., highlighting what others are doing), and benefit appeals (i.e., highlighting the benefits of the action) can encourage consumers to engage in relatively unfamiliar sustainable behaviors such as “grasscycling” and composting. Across one field study and three laboratory studies, the authors demonstrate that the effectiveness of the appeal type depends on whether the individual or collective level of the self is activated. When the collective level of self is activated, injunctive and descriptive normative appeals are most effective, whereas benefit appeals are less effective in encouraging sustainable behaviors. When the individual level of self is activated, self-benefit and descriptive appeals are particularly effective. The positive effects of descriptive appeals for the individual self are related to the informational benefits that such appeals can provide. The authors propose a goal-compatibility mechanism for these results and find that a match of congruent goals leads to the most positive consumer responses. They conclude with a discussion of implications for consumers, marketers, and public policy makers.

Title: Product Design for the Long Run: Consumer Responses to Typical and Atypical Designs at Different Stages of Exposure
Author-Name: Jan R. Landwehr
Author-Name: Daniel Wentzel
Author-Name: Andreas Herrmann
Abstract: Extant research on product design has suggested that a design's typicality is an important determinant of consumers' aesthetic liking. Yet most studies to date have measured consumers' reactions to designs of varied typicality after a single exposure. In reality, however, consumers usually have multiple opportunities to observe a product before making a decision. Against this background, the authors perform three studies in the automobile domain that examine whether the positive effect of design typicality is moderated by the level of exposure. Study 1 indicates that aesthetic liking of typical car designs is greater at lower exposure levels, whereas people like atypical car designs better at higher exposure levels. Study 2 uses real sales data and indicates that the interaction between design typicality and exposure also affects sales, suggesting that atypical cars may be more successful in the long run. Using experimental manipulations of the key constructs, Study 3 provides evidence for the underlying process and finds renewed support for the notion that design typicality and exposure interact to affect aesthetic liking.

Title: Are Multichannel Customers Really More Valuable? The Moderating Role of Product Category Characteristics
Author-Name: Tarun Kushwaha
Author-Name: Venkatesh Shankar
Abstract: How does the monetary value of customer purchases vary by customer preference for purchase channels (e.g., traditional, electronic, multichannel) and product category? The authors develop a conceptual model and hypotheses on the moderating effects of two key product category characteristics—the utilitarian versus hedonic nature of the product category and perceived risk—on the channel preference–monetary value relationship. They test the hypotheses on a unique large-scale, empirically generalizable data set in the retailing context. Contrary to conventional wisdom that all multichannel customers are more valuable than single-channel customers, the results show that multichannel customers are the most valuable segment only for hedonic product categories. The findings reveal that traditional channel customers of low-risk categories provide higher monetary value than other customers. Moreover, for utilitarian product categories perceived as high (low) risk, web-only (catalog- or store-only) shoppers constitute the most valuable segment. The findings offer managers guidelines for targeting and migrating different types of customers for different product categories through different channels.

Title: Cultural Competence and Cultural Compensatory Mechanisms in Binational Households

Author-Name: Mary C. Gilly
Abstract: Although it is well-known that the U.S. population is increasingly culturally diverse, cultural diversity within U.S. households is less recognized. This study investigates the effects of cultural dynamics on decision roles and influence within the binational household. In particular, the authors study households in which one spouse is from the United States and the other is an immigrant. The analysis uses survey data and in-depth interviews. Cultural competence (i.e., knowledge of country of residence) as a source of expert power and as a form of cultural capital in family decision making emerge as overarching themes. The authors also find that one family member may engage in cultural compensatory mechanisms in consumption in response to the immigrant family member's sacrifices (i.e., moving to the United States). The authors close with a discussion of the implications for family decision-making theory, marketers, and society.

Title: Targeted Online Advertising: Using Reciprocity Appeals to Increase Acceptance Among Users of Free Web Services
Author-Name: Jan H. Schumann
Author-Name: Florian von Wangenheim
Author-Name: Nicole Groene
Abstract: The Internet is dominated by free web services that depend on advertising revenues and powerful marketing tools to support their business models. Targeted online advertising enables websites to increase their advertising revenues by selectively displaying advertisements according to users' browsing behavior, sociodemographics, and interests. Yet targeting also creates negative consumer reactions, and websites confront increasing regulatory pressures to inform consumers about their practices. It is critical for such advertising-supported websites to address those challenges proactively. In one scenario experiment and two field studies, the authors show that a normative reciprocity argument is generally more effective than the current industry practice of using a utilitarian argument related to advertising relevance to increase acceptance of targeted online advertising. However, in some cases, this dominance switches depending on specific website characteristics such as website utility and level of user-generated content. Managers of free websites should remind their users of the free services they enjoy when asking permission to target them online or to use their personal information.

Title: All That Is Users Might Not Be Gold: How Labeling Products as User Designed Backfires in the Context of Luxury Fashion Brands
Author-Name: Christoph Fuchs
Author-Name: Emanuela Prandelli
Author-Name: Martin Schreier
Author-Name: Darren W. Dahl
Abstract: An emerging literature stream posits that drawing on users rather than internal designers in new product creation may benefit firms because the resulting products effectively satisfy consumer needs. Four studies conducted in the context of the luxury fashion industry uncover an important conceptual boundary condition of this positive user-design effect. Contrary to extant research, the results show that being “close” to users does not help but rather harms luxury fashion brands. Specifically, the authors find that user design backfires because consumer demand for a given luxury fashion brand collection is reduced if the collection is labeled as user (vs. company) designed. The results further reveal the underlying rationale for this reversal: user-designed luxury products are perceived to be lower in quality and fail to signal high status, which results in a loss of agentic feelings for the consumer. The authors explore several strategies luxury brands can pursue to overcome this negative user-design effect. Finally, they find that negative outcomes of user design are attenuated for luxury fashion products that are not used for status signaling—that is, product categories of a luxury brand that are characterized by lower status relevance for the consumer.

Title: The Double-Edged Sword of Foreign Brand Names for Companies from Emerging Countries
Author-Name: Valentyna Melnyk, 
Author-Name: Kristina Klein, 
Author-Name: Franziska Völckner
Abstract: Foreign branding—or using brand names that evoke foreign associations through, for example, spelling a brand name in a foreign language—is a popular means in both developed and emerging countries of suggesting a specific country of origin (COO) in the hope that it will evoke certain product qualities. As a result, consumers increasingly encounter products with brand names that imply a COO that differs from the actual COO (where the product is manufactured). In four experiments, the authors find support for the hypothesis that incongruence between the actual COO and implied COO decreases purchase likelihood asymmetrically. Incongruence backfires in hedonic categories but has hardly any effect in utilitarian categories. Furthermore, incongruence decreases purchase likelihood more if the actual COO is an emerging rather than developed country. The authors address the psychological process underlying the asymmetric effect of incongruence by showing that consumers apply different information-processing strategies to hedonic versus utilitarian products. These results have important implications for (foreign) branding decisions.

Abstract: Although the goal of a product recall program is to enhance safety, little is known about whether firms learn from product recalls. This study tests the direct effect of product recalls on future accidents and future recall frequency and their indirect effect through future product reliability in the automobile industry. The authors test the hypotheses on 459 make/year observations involving 27 automobile makers between 1995 and 2011. The findings suggest that increases in recall magnitude lead to decreases in future number of injuries and recalls. This effect, in turn, is partially mediated by future changes in product reliability. The results also suggest that the positive relationship between recall magnitude and future product reliability is (1) stronger for firms with higher shared product assets and (2) weaker for brands of higher prior quality. The findings are robust across alternate measures and alternate model specifications and offer valuable insights for managerial practice and public policy.

Author-Name: Ohad Yassin
Abstract: Traditionally, the value of a product has been assessed according to the direct revenues the product creates. However, products do not exist in isolation but rather influence one another's sales. Such influence is especially evident in e-commerce environments, in which products are often presented as a collection of web pages linked by recommendation hyperlinks, creating a large-scale product network. The authors present a systematic approach to estimate products' true value to a firm in such a product network. Their approach, which is in the spirit of the PageRank algorithm, uses available data from large-scale e-commerce sites and separates a product's value into its own intrinsic value, the value it receives from the network, and the value it contributes to the network. The authors demonstrate their approach using data collected from the product network of books on Amazon.com. Specifically, they show that the value of low sellers may be underestimated, whereas the value of best sellers may be overestimated. The authors explore the sources of this discrepancy and discuss the implications for managing products in the growing environment of product networks.

Title: Consumer-Generated Ads: Does Awareness of Advertising Co-Creation Help or Hurt Persuasion?
Author-Name: Debora V. Thompson, 
Author-Name: Prashant Malaviya
Abstract: Companies increasingly involve consumers in the process of developing advertising and other marketing actions. An important question that has not been explored is whether brands benefit from communicating to consumers who had not been involved in the co-creation process that a target ad was developed by a fellow consumer. The authors propose a skepticism–identification model of ad creator influence, which hypothesizes that disclosing to an audience that an ad was created by a consumer triggers two opposing effects: skepticism about the competence of the ad creator and identification with the ad creator. Four studies demonstrate that the effectiveness of disclosing advertising co-creation depends on factors that hinder skepticism and heighten identification with the ad creator. Specifically, attributing the ad to a consumer is shown to increase persuasion when the audience (1) has limited cognitive resources to scrutinize the message, (2) is given background information about the ad creator that enhances source similarity, and (3) has high loyalty toward the brand. The implications of these findings on marketing theory and practice are discussed.

Abstract: Customer referral programs are an effective means of customer acquisition. By assessing a large-scale customer data set from a global cellular telecommunications provider, the authors show that participation in a referral program also increases existing customers' loyalty. In a field experiment, recommenders' defection rates fell from 19% to 7% within a year, and their average monthly revenue grew by 11.4% compared with a matched control group. A negative interaction between referral program participation and customer tenure reveals that the loyalty effect of voicing a recommendation is particularly pronounced for newer customer–firm relationships. A laboratory experiment further demonstrates that referral programs with larger rewards strengthen attitudinal and behavioral loyalty, whereas smaller rewards affect only the behavioral dimension. This article contributes to our theoretical understanding of the roles played by the commitment–consistency principle and positive reinforcement theory as mechanisms underlying the effectiveness of customer referral programs.

Title: Defining, Measuring, and Managing Business Reference Value
Author-Name: V. Kumar,

Author-Name: Robert P. Leone
Abstract: It is common for business-to-business firms to use references from client firms when trying to influence prospects to become new customers. In this study, the authors define the concept of business reference value (BRV) as the ability of a client's reference to influence prospects to purchase and the degree to which it does so. They develop a three-step method to compute BRV for a given client using a retrospective reported measure of reference value. Next, they use data from a financial services and a telecommunications firm to identify and empirically test the drivers of BRV. These drivers fall into four categories: (1) length of client relationship, (2) client firm size, (3) reference media format, and (4) reference congruency. Next, the authors empirically show that clients that have the highest BRV are not the same as the clients that have the highest customer lifetime value. They also show that an average client that is high on BRV has significantly different characteristics from the average client that is low on BRV. Finally, they derive implications for managing BRV.

Title: Targeting Revenue Leaders for a New Product
Author-Name: Michael Haenlein, 
Author-Name: Barak Libai
Abstract: Historically, when targeting potential adopters of a new product, firms have tended to focus first on people with disproportional effect on others, often labeled “opinion leaders.” The authors highlight the benefit of targeting customers with high lifetime value (CLV), or “revenue leaders.” The authors argue that targeting revenue leaders can create high value both by accelerating adoption among these customers and because of the higher-than-average value that revenue leaders generate by affecting other customers with similarly high CLV. The latter phenomenon is driven by network assortativity, whereby people's social networks tend to be composed of others who are similar to themselves. Analyzing an agent-based model of a seeding program for a new product, the authors contrast revenue leader seeding with opinion leader seeding and compare the factors that influence the effectiveness of each. They show that the distribution of CLV in the population and the seed size play a major role in determining which seeding approach is preferable, and they discuss the managerial implications of these findings.

Abstract: This article integrates relationship marketing and social network perspectives to develop and test a model that links objective sales performance with the informational and cooperative benefits that stem from relationship managers' (RMs') social capital structure (brokerage and density) and relations (formal and informal networks). The authors demonstrate the effect of cross-network and overlap-network synergies on performance. Data about both formal and informal networks of 464 employees, including 101 RMs, demonstrate that RMs' performance improves with cross-network synergy when informational benefits from wide-reaching, nonoverlapping ties in the informal network combine with the cooperative benefits of a densely interconnected formal network. In addition, the effects of formal and informal social capital structure on performance increase significantly when RMs have a high degree of network overlap between their formal and informal networks.

Title: The Effect of In-Store Travel Distance on Unplanned Spending: Applications to Mobile Promotion Strategies
Author-Name: Sam K. Hui, 
Author-Name: J. Jeffrey Inman, 
Author-Name: Yanliu Huang, 
Author-Name: Jacob Suher
Abstract: Typically, shoppers' paths only cover less than half of the areas in a grocery store. Given that shoppers often use physical products in the store as external memory cues, encouraging shoppers to travel more of the store may increase unplanned spending. Estimating the direct effect of in-store travel distance on unplanned spending, however, is complicated by the difficulty of collecting in-store path data and the endogeneity of in-store travel distance. To address both issues, the authors collect a novel data set using in-store radio frequency identification tracking and develop an instrumental variable approach to account for endogeneity. Their analysis reveals that the elasticity of unplanned spending on travel distance is 57% higher than the uncorrected ordinary least squares estimate. Simulations based on the authors' estimates suggest that strategically promoting three product categories through mobile promotion could increase unplanned spending by 16.1%, compared with the estimated effect of a benchmark strategy based on relocating three destination categories (7.2%). Furthermore, the authors conduct a field experiment to assess the effectiveness of mobile promotions and find that a coupon that required shoppers to travel farther from their planned path resulted in a substantial increase in unplanned spending ($21.29) over a coupon for an unplanned category near their planned path ($13.83). The results suggest that targeted mobile promotions aimed at increasing in-store path length can increase unplanned spending.

Abstract: This study examines how household members' personal characteristics and key marketing factors affect the healthfulness of food purchased for in-home consumption; it further considers how food intake changes following a diagnosis of Type 2 diabetes in the household. Using a combination of grocery purchases over four years, survey data about health status, and the nutrition content of 13 of the largest packaged food categories, this study shows that households with higher education and nutrition interest consume fewer calories, sugar, and total carbohydrates, whereas those with higher self-control consume more, because they offset their lower intake of “unhealthy” categories (e.g., soft drinks) with higher intake of “healthy” categories (e.g., cereal). The consumption of sugar and carbohydrates decreases significantly in response to a diabetes diagnosis, whereas the intake of fat and sodium increases. Education, nutrition interest, and self-control are not associated with healthier changes in response to a diagnosis, but younger and higher-income households, as well as those in which the diabetes patient is female, make healthier changes. These findings have notable implications for marketers, consumers, consumer researchers, and public health professionals.

Title: Good and Guilt-Free: The Role of Self-Accountability in Influencing Preferences for Products with Ethical Attributes
Author-Name: John Peloza, 
Author-Name: Katherine White, 
Author-Name: Jingzhi Shang
Abstract: The market share of brands positioned using ethical attributes typically lags behind brands that promote attributes related to product performance. Across four studies, the authors show that situational factors that heighten consumers' self-accountability (i.e., activation of their desire to live up to their self-standards) lead to increased preferences for products promoted through their ethical attributes. They investigate their predictions regarding self-accountability in multiple ways, including examining the moderating roles of awareness of the discrepancy between a person's internal standards and actual behavior, self-accountability priming, and the presence of others in the decision context. Furthermore, they demonstrate that the subtle activation of self-accountability leads to more positive reactions to ethical appeals than explicit guilt appeals. Finally, they show that preference for a product promoted through ethical appeals is driven by the desire to avoid anticipated guilt, beyond the effects of impression management. Taken together, the results suggest that marketers positioning products through ethical attributes should subtly activate consumer self-accountability rather than using more explicit guilt appeals.

Title: What Drives Managerial Use of Marketing and Financial Metrics and Does Metric Use Affect Performance of Marketing-Mix Activities?
Author-Name: Ofer Mintz, 
Author-Name: Imran S. Currim
Abstract: To increase marketing's accountability, Journal of Marketing, Marketing Science Institute, and the Institute for the Study of Business Markets have advocated development of marketing metrics and linking marketing-mix activities with financial metrics. Although the marketing field has made progress, researchers have paid less attention to what drives managerial use of marketing and financial metrics and whether metric use is associated with marketing-mix performance. The authors propose a conceptual model that links firm strategy, metric orientation, type of marketing-mix activity, and managerial, firm, and environmental characteristics to marketing and financial metric use, which in turn are linked to performance of marketing-mix activities. An analysis of 1287 marketing-mix activities reported by 439 U.S. managers reveals that firm strategy, metric orientation, type of marketing-mix activity, and firm and environmental characteristics are more useful than managerial characteristics in explaining use of marketing and financial metrics and that use of metrics is positively associated with marketing-mix performance. The results help identify conditions under which managers use fewer metrics and how metric use can be increased to improve marketing-mix performance.

Title: When Does Recognition Increase Charitable Behavior? Toward a Moral Identity-Based Model
Author-Name: Karen Page Winterich, 
Author-Name: Vikas Mittal, 
Author-Name: Karl Aquino
Abstract: Each year, people in the United States donate more than $200 billion to charitable causes. Despite the lack of understanding of whether and how recognition increases charitable behavior, charities often offer it to motivate donor action. This research focuses on how the effectiveness of recognition on charitable behavior is dependent on the joint influence of two distinct dimensions of moral identity: internalization and symbolization. Three studies examining both monetary donations and volunteering behavior show that recognition increases charitable behavior among those characterized by high moral identity symbolization and low moral identity internalization. Notably, those who show high levels of moral identity internalization are uninfluenced by recognition, regardless of their symbolization. By understanding correlates of the two dimensions of moral identity among donors, nonprofits can strategically recognize potential donors to maximize donation and volunteering behavior.

Abstract: This research examines how branded service encounters, in which frontline service employee behavior is aligned with a firm's brand positioning, may positively affect customer responses to brands. Across two brand personality contexts, Study 1 demonstrates that employee–brand alignment increases overall brand evaluations and customer-based brand equity, with more pronounced results for unfamiliar brands. Study 2 shows that conceptual fluency underlies the effect of employee–brand alignment on overall brand evaluations for unfamiliar brands. Study 3 reveals that employee authenticity enhances the effectiveness of employee–brand alignment. Finally, a critical incident study (Study 4) extends the generalizability of these findings to a wider variety of service contexts. This research is the first to demonstrate how firms can leverage employee behavior as a brand-building advantage, particularly for new or unfamiliar brands as they establish their positioning with customers.

Author-Name: Stephen M. Nowlis
Abstract: The current research explores how shelf display organization and limited product quantity together influence consumer purchase. The authors find that, in certain cases, shelves that are disorganized and not fully stocked tend to reduce sales, but in other cases, disorganized shelves that are not fully stocked tend to increase sales. In particular, for products that are ingested (e.g., juice), purchase likelihood is reduced when the product appears to be disorganized and product quantity is limited. However, for products that are not ingested (e.g., fabric softener), purchase likelihood increases when the product appears to be disorganized and product quantity is limited. Importantly, the authors also show that brand familiarity moderates these effects.

Title: When Three Charms but Four Alarms: Identifying the Optimal Number of Claims in Persuasion Settings
Author-Name: Suzanne B. Shu
Author-Name: Kurt A. Carlson
Abstract: How many positive claims should firms use to produce the most positive impression of a product or service? This article posits that when consumers know that the message source has a persuasion motive, the optimal number of positive claims is three. Increasing the number of claims improves consumer perceptions until the fourth claim, at which point consumers' persuasion knowledge causes them to view all the claims with skepticism. The studies herein establish and explore this pattern, which the authors refer to as the “charm of three.” An initial experiment indicates that impressions peak at three claims for sources with a persuasion motive but not for sources without a persuasion motive. The second experiment indicates that this effect occurs for attitudes and impressions and that increased skepticism at four or more claims explains the effect. Two final experiments examine the mental process by which the charm of three occurs by investigating how cognitive load and sequential claims influence the effect.

Title: Not All Repeat Customers Are the Same: Designing Effective Cross-Selling Promotion on the Basis of Attitudinal Loyalty and Habit
Author-Name: Yuping Liu-Thompkins
Author-Name: Leona Tam
Abstract: Not all repeat purchases are created equal. They can be driven by both positive reaction toward a brand (i.e., attitudinal loyalty) and automaticity triggered by non-brand-related contextual cues (i.e., habit). Combining the loyalty literature with recent habit research, the authors suggest ways to distinguish the two drivers of repeat purchase and examine how they affect consumer response to cross-selling promotions. In Study 1, the authors propose a method to derive individual-level habit strength from consumer transaction records and demonstrate the influence of both attitudinal loyalty and habit on repeat purchase. Studies 2a and 2b then show that attitudinal loyalty facilitates cross-selling, whereas habit has the opposite effect. Finally, in Study 3, the authors suggest a specific promotional design that works better for habitual consumers than for those with attitudinal loyalty and demonstrate that ignoring these two underlying drivers can lead to unintended negative consequences on consumer behavior. This research adds to a richer understanding of repatronage and yields important managerial insights into more effective cross-selling to repeat customers.

Title: When Humanizing Brands Goes Wrong: The Detrimental Effect of Brand Anthropomorphization Amid Product Wrongdoings
Author-Name: Marina Puzakova, 
Author-Name: Hyokjin Kwak, 
Author-Name: Joseph F. Rocereto
Abstract: The brand relationship literature shows that the humanizing of brands and products generates more favorable consumer attitudes and thus enhances brand performance. However, the authors propose negative downstream consequences of brand humanization; that is, the anthropomorphization of a brand can negatively affect consumers' brand evaluations when the brand faces negative publicity caused by product wrongdoings. They find that consumers who believe in personality stability (i.e., entity theorists) view anthropomorphized brands that undergo negative publicity less favorably than nonanthropomorphized brands. In contrast, consumers who advocate personality malleability (i.e., incremental theorists) are less likely to devalue an anthropomorphized brand from a single instance of negative publicity. Finally, the authors explore three firm response strategies (i.e., denial, apology, and compensation) that can affect the evaluations of anthropomorphized brands for consumers with different implicit theory perspectives. They find that entity theorists have more difficulty in combating the adverse effects of brand anthropomorphization than incremental theorists. Furthermore, they demonstrate that compensation (vs. denial or apology) is the only effective response among entity theorists.

Title: Not All Fun and Games: Viral Marketing for Utilitarian Products
Author-Name: Christian Schulze
Author-Name: Lisa Schöler
Author-Name: Bernd Skiera
Abstract: The success of products such as FarmVille has prompted many firms to engage in viral marketing on Facebook and other social media websites. Yet is the viral marketing approach adopted for games suitable for other, more utilitarian products? This study aims to answer questions that link product characteristics and contexts to viral marketing success: Should primarily utilitarian products rely on the same sharing mechanisms for their viral marketing campaigns as less utilitarian products? If not, why is this the case, and how should viral marketing for primarily utilitarian products differ? This empirical study analyzes the Facebook viral marketing campaigns of 751 products and reveals that the same sharing mechanism that made FarmVille so successful is the worst possible mechanism for promoting primarily utilitarian products. These findings are in line with theory from social psychology: because consumers do not visit Facebook to learn about utilitarian products, they rely on simple cues and heuristics to process viral marketing messages about these products. This study thus contributes to literature on viral marketing in general and sharing mechanisms in particular; it also offers practical, hands-on recommendations to marketing managers in charge of designing viral marketing campaigns for both more and less utilitarian products.

Abstract: This article examines how firms in interorganizational relationships respond differently to active and passive opportunism and observes how these opportunism forms erode satisfaction with the performance of these relationships. The multimethod approach of two experiments and one longitudinal field study demonstrate that firms tolerate more passive opportunism than active opportunism (Study 1) and that transaction costs play a mediating role between opportunism form and satisfaction with performance of the relationship (Study 2). Finally, the field study reveals that, over time, passive opportunism has a more corrosive impact on satisfaction with performance than active opportunism (Study 3). Together, the findings underscore the importance of distinguishing passive and active opportunism and the need to develop a better understanding of its management and consequences.

Title: Can Brands Move In from the Outside? How Moral Identity Enhances Out-Group Brand Attitudes
Author-Name: Woo Jin Choi, 
Author-Name: Karen Page Winterich
Abstract: Consumers tend to have more favorable attitudes for their in-group brands than their out-group brands. However, little is known regarding how brand managers can overcome consumers' negative attitudes toward out-group brands. Drawing on the moral identity literature, the authors theorize that moral identity may enhance out-group (but not in-group) brand attitudes through decreased psychological distance. Four studies demonstrate that moral identity increases out-group brand attitudes. The authors also identify two important boundary conditions of this moral identity effect. These findings suggest that brand managers who want to overcome the less-than-favorable perceptions associated with out-group brands may benefit from drawing on consumers' moral identity in marketing communications. Theoretically, this research establishes that moral identity extends beyond prosocial behaviors to influence marketplace judgments (i.e., brand attitudes and categorization).

Abstract: Customers increasingly rely on other consumers' reviews to make purchase decisions online. New insights into the customer review phenomenon can be derived from studying the semantic content and style properties of verbatim customer reviews to examine their influence on online retail sites' conversion rates. The authors employ text mining to extract changes in affective content and linguistic style properties of customer book reviews on Amazon.com. A dynamic panel data model reveals that the influence of positive affective content on conversion rates is asymmetrical, such that greater increases in positive affective content in customer reviews have a smaller effect on subsequent increases in conversion rate. No such tapering-off effect occurs for changes in negative affective content in reviews. Furthermore, positive changes in affective cues and increasing congruence with the product interest group's typical linguistic style directly and conjointly increase conversion rates. These findings suggest that managers should identify and promote the most influential reviews in a given product category, provide instructions to stimulate reviewers to write powerful reviews, and adapt the style of their own editorial reviews to the relevant product category.

Title: Retailer Private-Label Margins: The Role of Supplier and Quality-Tier Differentiation
Author-Name: Anne ter Braak
Author-Name: Marnik G. Dekimpe
Author-Name: Inge Geyskens
Abstract: The authors show how new realities in the private-label (PL) landscape, including differential PL-sourcing relationships and differentiated, three-tiered PL portfolios, affect the gross margins that retailers realize on their PLs. In addition, they examine the moderating role of the identity of the PL supplier (dual brander vs. dedicated supplier). Retailer PL margins are lower for stockkeeping units from PL suppliers with whom the retailer shares a more intense relationship, as reflected in their relationship breadth and depth, but this negative effect can be countered through multisourcing. Building prolonged relationships with PL suppliers also results in lower retailer PL margins, but only for more national brand–oriented suppliers. Dedicated PL suppliers have little to gain by building long-term retailer relationships, but they are less vulnerable to the retailer's practice of multisourcing than dual branders. Although economy PLs may appeal to conventional supermarkets to keep (hard) discounters at bay, they result in lower margins (percentage-wise and absolute) than the standard PLs they cannibalize. Premium PLs, in turn, offer the retailer a higher margin, but only when produced by suppliers with a sufficient extent of national brand focus. However, the higher promotional support often given to premium PLs tends to mitigate the actual margin advantage.

Title: Does Knowledge Base Compatibility Help or Hurt Knowledge Sharing Between Suppliers in Coopetition? The Role of Customer Participation
Author-Name: Hillbun (Dixon) Ho
Author-Name: Shankar Ganesan
Abstract: Competing suppliers that collaborate to serve downstream original equipment manufacturer customers often encounter partners with overlapping and compatible knowledge bases. Such knowledge base compatibility provides supplier partners the opportunity to exchange knowledge efficiently, leading to greater knowledge sharing. However, the ease of misappropriation of the shared knowledge can offset this beneficial effect. This research proposes that the effect of knowledge base compatibility on supplier partners' knowledge sharing is moderated by the customer's participation in the collaborative effort and by the customer value such effort creates. The results of two empirical studies show that when levels of both customer participation and customer value are high, knowledge base compatibility between supplier partners leads to greater knowledge sharing. In contrast, when customer participation is high but customer value is low, knowledge base compatibility leads to lower levels of supplier knowledge sharing. This investigation validates the importance of key factors related to supplier partners' opportunity and motivation to share knowledge in coopetitive partnerships.

Title: Dynamic Effects of Social Influence and Direct Marketing on the Adoption of High-Technology Products

Author-Name: Tammo H.A. Bijmolt
Abstract: Many firms capitalize on their customers' social networks to improve the success rate of their new products. In this article, the authors analyze the dynamic effects of social influence and direct marketing on the adoption of a new high-technology product. Social influence is likely to play a role because the decision to adopt a high-involvement product requires extensive information gathering from various sources. The authors use call detail records to construct ego networks for a large sample of customers of a Dutch mobile telecommunications operator. Using a fractional polynomial hazard approach to model adoption timing and multiple social influence variables, they provide a fine-grained analysis of social influence. They show that the effect of social influence from cumulative adoptions in a customer's network decreases from the product introduction onward, whereas the influence of recent adoptions remains constant. The effect of direct marketing is also positive and decreases from the product introduction onward. This study provides new insights into the adoption of high-technology products by analyzing dynamic effects of social influence and direct marketing simultaneously.

Title: Consumer Well-Being: Effects of Subgoal Failures and Goal Importance
Author-Name: Berna Devezer
Author-Name: David E. Sprott

Author-Name: Sandor Czellar
Abstract: Although there is increased awareness of issues surrounding consumer well-being, consumers often lack the personal commitment to improve their quality of life. This article builds on the concept of a goal hierarchy to propose that small acts may have unintended, large consequences on various domains of consumer well-being. A decrease in commitment to well-being goals (e.g., sustaining the natural environment) may stem from people's failure to achieve everyday subgoals (e.g., failing to recycle a newspaper). Four experiments in three contexts (i.e., consumer overspending, environmentally friendly behaviors, and charitable donations) show that when people perceive the endgoal as unimportant, even a single behavioral failure may reduce commitment to a well-being endgoal and weaken future intentions to perform behaviors that improve their quality of life. In addition, goal importance moderates the adverse relationship between subgoal performance and endgoal commitment. The authors present consumer-specific and marketer-controlled drivers of goal importance (i.e., goal visualization, self-relevance of goals, and aversive consequences of subgoal failure) and discuss actionable insights for practitioners.

Title: When Do Transparent Packages Increase (or Decrease) Food Consumption?
Author-Name: Xiaoyan Deng
Author-Name: Raji Srinivasan
Abstract: Transparent packages are pervasive in food consumption environments. Yet prior research has not systematically examined whether and how transparent packaging affects food consumption. The authors propose that transparent packaging has two opposing effects on food consumption: it enhances food salience, which increases consumption (salience effect), and it facilitates consumption monitoring, which decreases consumption (monitoring effect). They argue that the net effect of transparent packaging on food consumption is moderated by food characteristics (e.g., unit size, appearance). For small, visually attractive foods, the monitoring effect is low, so the salience effect dominates, and people eat more from a transparent package than from an opaque package. For large foods, the monitoring effect dominates the salience effect, decreasing consumption. For vegetables, which are primarily consumed for their health benefits, consumption monitoring is not activated, so the salience effect dominates, which ironically decreases consumption. The authors' findings suggest that marketers should offer small foods in transparent packages and large foods and vegetables in opaque packages to increase postpurchase consumption (and sales).

Abstract: Although an extensive body of research has emerged on marketing in computer-mediated environments, the literature remains fragmented. As a result, insights and findings have accumulated without an overarching framework to provide structure and guidance to the rapidly increasing research stream, which is detrimental to long-term knowledge development in this area. To address this issue, the authors organize and synthesize findings from the literature using a framework structured around four key interactions in computer-mediated environments: consumer–firm interactions, firm–consumer interactions, consumer–consumer interactions, and firm–firm interactions. The proposed framework serves a valuable organizational function and helps identify a broad spectrum of gaps in the literature to advance the next generation of knowledge development.

Title: How Images of Other Consumers Influence Subsequent Taste Perceptions
Author-Name: Morgan Poor
Author-Name: Adam Duhachek
Author-Name: H. Shanker Krishnan
Abstract: Images of food are seemingly everywhere, and yet the influence that such images have on important consumer outcomes is not well understood. The authors propose that the effect that image exposure has on taste perceptions largely depends on the interaction between the type of food (healthy vs. unhealthy) and whether the image shows the food alone (food image) or the food being consumed by a person (consummatory image). Specifically, the authors show that exposure to consummatory images of unhealthy (vs. healthy) foods increases taste perceptions relative to food images. To explain this effect, the authors argue that seeing an image of someone else indulging in an unhealthy food serves as social proof of the appropriateness and acceptability of indulgent consumption. As such, images of consumers eating act as a justification agent for real consumers, thereby reducing the conflict associated with the subsequent indulgent consumption experience and, in effect, increasing taste perceptions. The authors test this effect across five studies and eliminate rival explanations pertaining to emotional contagion, goal contagion, and source attractiveness.

Title: Consumer Adoption of New Products: Independent Versus Interdependent Self-Perspectives
Author-Name: Zhenfeng Ma

Author-Name: Mehdi Mourali
Abstract: In five studies, the authors examine the impact of an independent (vs. interdependent) mindset on consumer adoption of new products. Study 1 demonstrates that consumers in a predominantly independent (vs. interdependent) culture are more willing to adopt really new products, whereas consumers in a predominantly interdependent (vs. independent) culture are more willing to adopt incrementally new products. Studies 2 and 3 conceptually replicate these findings using situationally activated mindsets and demonstrate that this effect is driven by the perceived fit between the product’s newness level and the optimal level of distinctiveness consumers want. Finally, Studies 4a and 4b show that the presence of distinctiveness-dampening cues (i.e., popularity cues) and distinctiveness-enhancing cues (i.e., scarcity cues) can reverse the effect of self-perspective such that the independent self becomes less willing to adopt really new products and more willing to adopt incrementally new products than does the interdependent self. These findings offer practical implications for managing innovation adoption in both domestic and international marketplaces.

Title: Consumer Evaluations of Sale Prices: Role of the Subtraction Principle

Author-Name: Dhruv Grewal
Abstract: How exactly does the display location of a sale price relative to the original price affect consumers' evaluations? Across multiple studies, including field studies with actual choices and studies with nonstudent samples, this article shows that consumer evaluations are a function of the display location of the sale price, but such evaluations are moderated by discount depth. First, presenting the smaller number to the right (vs. left) makes it easier to initiate the subtraction task, a phenomenon the authors refer to as the “subtraction principle.” Second, given that evaluating sale prices inherently involves a subtraction task, locating sale prices to the right (vs. left) of the original price facilitates calculation of discount depth, increasing evaluations for moderate discounts but not for low discounts. These effects are potentially reversed in cases of both very low discounts and exaggerated discounts. The findings in this article offer novel and nonintuitive insights into how sale price display locations and discount depth interact to influence numerical cognitions, processing of sale prices, and subsequent evaluations.

Abstract: Although interest in smart shopping carts is increasing, both retailers and consumer groups have concerns about how real-time spending feedback will influence shopping behavior. Building on budgeting and spending theories, the authors conduct three lab and grocery store experiments that robustly show that real-time spending feedback has a diverging impact on spending depending on whether a person is budget constrained (“budget” shoppers) or not (“nonbudget” shoppers). Real-time spending feedback stimulates budget shoppers to spend more (by buying more national brands). In contrast, this feedback leads nonbudget shoppers to spend less (by replacing national brands with store brands). Furthermore, smart shopping carts increase repatronage intentions for budget shoppers while keeping them stable for nonbudget shoppers. These findings underscore fundamental unexplored differences between budget and nonbudget shoppers. Moreover, they have key implications for both brick-and-mortar and online retailers as well as app developers.

Abstract: Firms raise a significant amount of funds and gain competitive advantage over their rivals through equity financing, namely through initial public offerings and seasoned equity offerings. The authors find that both initial public offering firms and seasoned equity offering firms adopt a more aggressive marketing strategy during the two years following their offering. However, not all equity issuers benefit equally from increased marketing spending, which can help signal companies' growth prospects to investors. A key moderator of the link between marketing investment and firm value is the strategic flexibility of rivals with respect to issuers. In particular, the stock market reacts favorably to an aggressive marketing strategy initiated by issuers competing against rivals with relatively less flexibility, whereas increased marketing expenditures do not translate into higher firm value when rivals have greater flexibility. Furthermore, the authors show that marketing expenditures create value within context: the role of marketing in enhancing shareholder value and the moderating effect of rivals' strategic flexibility are more pronounced in the two-year window immediately following an equity offering than at any other time. The authors conclude with a discussion of implications for theory and practice.

Title: Corporate Social Responsibility in Business-to-Business Markets: How Organizational Customers Account for Supplier Corporate Social Responsibility Engagement
Author-Name: Christian Homburg

Author-Name: Torsten Bornemann
Abstract: Despite the high relevance of corporate social responsibility (CSR) in current business practice and the considerable research on CSR outcomes in consumer markets, investigations of its influence on organizational business relationships are scarce. Relying on instrumental stakeholder theory, the authors develop and empirically test a framework of the influence of a supplier's CSR engagement on organizational customer outcomes. Findings from an examination of 200 cross-industry supplier–customer dyads reveal positive effects of two facets of a supplier's CSR efforts on customer loyalty through distinct mechanisms. Business practice CSR fosters customers' trust, whereas philanthropic CSR strengthens customer–company identification. The authors distinguish a supplier's actual CSR engagement and customers' perception of these CSR activities. In addition, they consider central contingency factors reflecting uncertainty and dependence in business-to-business relationships that determine the effectiveness of CSR.

Title: An Examination of Social Influence on Shopper Behavior Using Video Tracking Data

Author-Name: Alex Leykin
Abstract: This research investigates how the social elements of a retail store visit affect shoppers' product interaction and purchase likelihood. The research uses a bivariate model of the shopping process, implemented in a hierarchical Bayes framework, which models the customer and contextual factors driving product touch and purchase simultaneously. A unique video tracking database captures each shopper's path and activities during the store visit. The findings reveal that interactive social influences (e.g., salesperson contact, shopper conversations) tend to slow the shopper down, encourage a longer store visit, and increase product interaction and purchase. When shoppers are part of a larger group, they are influenced more by discussions with companions and less by third parties. Stores with customers present encourage product interaction up to a point, beyond which the density of shoppers interferes with the shopping process. The effects of social influence vary by the salesperson's demographic similarity to the shopper and the type of product category being shopped. Several behavioral cues signal when shoppers are in a potentially high need state and may be good sales prospects.

Title: The Informational Value of Social Tagging Networks
Author-Name: Hyoryung Nam
Author-Name: P.K. Kannan
Abstract: Social tagging is a new way to share and categorize online content that enables users to express their thoughts, perceptions, and feelings with respect to diverse concepts. In social tagging, content is connected through usergenerated keywords—“tags”—and is readily searchable through these tags. The rich associative information that social tagging provides marketers new opportunities to infer brand associative networks. This article investigates how the information contained in social tags can act as a proxy measure for brand performance and can predict the financial valuation of a firm. Using data collected from a social tagging and bookmarking website, Delicious, the authors examine social tagging data for 44 firms across 14 markets. After controlling for accounting metrics, media citations, and other user-generated content, they find that social tag–based brand management metrics capturing brand familiarity, favorability of associations, and competitive overlaps of brand associations can explain unanticipated stock returns. In addition, they find that in managing brand equity, it is more important for strong brands to enhance category dominance, whereas it is more critical for weak brands to enhance connectedness. These findings suggest a new way for practitioners to track, measure, and manage intangible brand equity; proactively improve brand performance; and influence a firm's financial performance.

Title: Who or What to Believe: Trust and the Differential Persuasiveness of Human and Anthropomorphized Messengers
Author-Name: Maferima Touré-Tillery, 
Author-Name: Ann L. McGill
Abstract: Participants in three studies read advertisements in which messages were delivered either by people or by anthropomorphized agents—specifically, “talking” products. The results indicate that people low in interpersonal trust are more persuaded by anthropomorphized messengers than by human spokespeople because low trusters are more attentive to the nature of the messenger and believe that humans, more than partial humans (i.e., anthropomorphized agents), lack goodwill. People high in interpersonal trust are less attentive about who is trying to persuade them and so respond similarly to human and anthropomorphized messengers. However, when prompted to be attentive, they are more persuaded by human spokespeople than by anthropomorphized messengers due to their belief that humans, more than partial humans, act with goodwill. Under conditions in which attentiveness is low for all consumers, high and low trusters alike are unaffected by the nature of persuasion agents. The authors discuss the implications of the findings for advertisers considering the use of anthropomorphized “spokespeople.”

Title: Gratitude Versus Entitlement: A Dual Process Model of the Profitability Implications of Customer Prioritization
Author-Name: Hauke A. Wetzel

Author-Name: Alex R. Zablah
Abstract: Customer prioritization strategies, which focus a firm's efforts on its most important customers, are expected to improve account profitability. Anecdotal evidence suggests, however, that such strategies may also undermine account profitability by inducing customers to become overly demanding. Building on social exchange theory, this research evaluates these competing perspectives across two field studies and finds that prioritization is best understood as a double-edged sword. Specifically, the results reveal that prioritization efforts initiate both a gratitude-driven process, which enhances sales and profit, and an entitlement-driven process, which increases service costs and reduces profit. Importantly, the findings indicate that prioritization tactics differ in the extent to which they trigger these competing processes and thus in their ability to influence account profitability. Finally, the results also reveal that critical moderators (competitive intensity and prioritization transparency) determine the extent to which the entitlement-driven process undermines the gratitude-driven process. For managers, the findings suggest that both the tactics employed and moderating conditions determine whether prioritization has a positive, negative, or negligible effect on prioritized accounts' profitability.

Title: Firm Value Creation Through Major Channel Expansions: Evidence from an Event Study in the United States, Germany, and China
Author-Name: Christian Homburg
Author-Name: Josef Vollmayr
Author-Name: Alexander Hahn
Abstract: Although changes to the channel system are among a firm's most critical decisions, prior research has neglected to examine the impact of channel expansions on firm value. This article investigates whether a firm's announcement of an increase in distribution intensity or the establishment of a new channel influences firm value. The authors also consider the moderating role of context-specific firm, market, and channel strategy contingencies. They test their hypotheses with an event study of 240 announcements of major channel expansions in the United States, Germany, and China. The results indicate that channel expansions affect firm value (i.e., through abnormal stock returns). However, the two types of channel expansions affect firm value differently. Whereas the establishment of a new channel positively influences firm value, reactions to an increase in distribution intensity are highly contingent. For example, firms operating in exceedingly turbulent or competitive markets experience firm value reductions in response to an increase in distribution intensity. Notably, the same two environmental contingencies enhance firm value when the firm establishes a new channel.

Title: Competently Ordinary: New Middle Class Consumers in the Emerging Markets
Author-Name: Olga Kravets
Author-Name: Ozlem Sandikci
Abstract: Although the new middle classes in emerging markets are a matter of significant interest for marketing scholars and managers, there has been little systematic research on their values and preoccupations. This article focuses on new middle class consumers to identify the new, shared socio-ideological sensibilities informed by the recent neoliberal reforms in emerging markets and examines how these sensibilities are actualized in consumption. Through an ethnographic study of fashion consumption in Turkey, the authors explicate three salient new middle class sensibilities, which implicate the mastery of the ordinary in pursuit of connections with people, institutions, and contexts. These sensibilities crystallize into a particular mode of consumption—“formulaic creativity”—which addresses consumers' desire to align with the middle and helps them reconcile the disjuncture between the promises of neoliberalism and the realities of living in unstable societies. The article provides recommendations on product portfolio management, positioning strategies, and marketing mix adaptation decisions.

Title: The Role of Brands and Mediating Technologies in Assembling Long-Distance Family Practices
Author-Name: Amber M. Epp
Author-Name: Hope Jensen Schau
Author-Name: Linda L. Price
Abstract: Increasingly, circumstances such as divorce, employment commuting, and military service have resulted in the geographic dispersion of family networks, and this reality holds both risks and opportunities for brands, products, and services embedded in family life. The authors leverage a longitudinal design including group interviews (initial/follow-up) and participant diaries to track how families' consumption practices shift in response to separation, morphing across time and place to retain and strengthen family bonds. Their findings generate a framework that explains how and when colocated consumption practices reassemble through technologies across distances. The framework considers practice dimensions, separation type, motivation, potential/realized capacities, and mobilized technologies to forecast potential practice trajectories under conditions of extended separation. Five potential trajectories emerge: no trial, heroic quests, failed trial, easy translations, and sacred pieces. The authors' discussion of managerial implications provides suggestions to enable companies to anticipate trajectories and take action to enhance brand use and loyalty to ensure that their brands survive reassembly within existing family practices or become integral to new family practices that feature the brand.

Title: Predicting and Managing Consumers' Package Size Impressions
Author-Name: Nailya Ordabayeva
Author-Name: Pierre Chandon
Abstract: With rising public concerns about waste and overconsumption, predicting and effectively managing consumers' package size impressions have become critical for both marketers and public health advocates. The AddChange heuristic model of size impression assumes that people add (rather than multiply) the percentage changes in the height, width, and length of objects to compute their volume. This simple deterministic model does not require any data to accurately predict consumers' perceptions of product downsizing and supersizing when one, two, or all three dimensions change proportionately. It also explains why consumers perceive size reductions accurately when only one dimension of the package is reduced but completely fail to notice up to a 24% downsizing when the product is elongated in the manner specified by the model, even when they pay close attention or weigh the product by hand. The model can be used to determine the dimensions of packages that create accurate size perceptions or that increase consumers' acceptance of downsizing.

Title: Managing Customer and Organizational Complexity in Sales Organizations
Author-Name: Christian Schmitz
Author-Name: Shankar Ganesan
Abstract: Salespeople face increasingly complex work environments, both externally with customers and internally with various departments in their own organizations. Because managing such customer and organizational complexity is crucial to performance, the authors conceptualize and develop measures of customer and organizational complexity and examine the effects on salesperson outcomes. In line with job demands-resources theory, salespeople leverage personal and supervisory resources to manage complexity. The test of the conceptual model uses matched salespeople–sales manager data gathered from a large business-to-business firm. The empirical findings reveal that personal resources (sales self-efficacy) help manage complexity in general but create greater role stress in the face of customer complexity. The effectiveness of supervisory resources (transactional leadership behavior) is contingent on the type of complexity and the personal resources available to a salesperson. These results indicate not only how salespeople manage different complexities but also how sales managers should adapt their leadership behaviors to enhance salesperson performance.

Title: Sizing Up the Effect of Portion Size on Consumption: A Meta-Analytic Review
Author-Name: Natalina Zlatevska

Author-Name: Stephen S. Holden
Abstract: Food marketing is facing increasing challenges in using portion size (e.g., “supersizing”) as a marketing tool. Marketers have used portion size to attract customers and encourage purchase, but social agencies are expressing concern that larger portion sizes encourage greater consumption, which can cause excessive consumption and obesity. This article addresses two questions that are central to this debate: (1) How much effect does portion size have on consumption? and (2) Are there limits to this effect? A meta-analytic review reveals that, for a doubling of portion size, consumption increases by 35% on average. However, the effect has limits. An extended analysis shows that the effect of portion size is curvilinear: as portions become increasingly larger, the effect diminishes. In addition, although the portion-size effect is widespread and robust across a range of individual and environmental factors, the analysis shows that it is weaker among children, women, and overweight individuals, as well as for nonsnack food items and in contexts in which more attention is given to the food being eaten.

Title: Marketing Doctrine: A Principles-Based Approach to Guiding Marketing Decision Making in Firms
Author-Name: Goutam Challagalla
Author-Name: Brian R. Murtha
Author-Name: Bernard Jaworski
Abstract: The authors introduce and examine a new marketing concept that a small set of leading firms has begun to adopt: marketing doctrine. Marketing doctrine refers to a firm's unique principles, distilled from its experiences, which provide firm-wide guidance on market-facing choices. As such, marketing doctrine provides a firm-wide common approach to decision making. Importantly, marketing doctrine helps a firm address the classic consistency–flexibility conundrum by providing high-level guidance to all decision makers in the firm (thus ensuring consistency) but not specifying execution details (thus allowing for local flexibility). Across three samples, the authors explore the concept using a discovery-oriented, theories-in-use approach with 35 executives from several industries. This article makes four contributions. First, it offers a parsimonious definition of the marketing doctrine construct and contrasts it with related constructs. Second, it offers insight into how firms can develop marketing doctrine. Third, it develops a conceptual model that identifies the antecedents and consequences of marketing doctrine use. Finally, the authors explore the moderating effects of three unpredictable environments (competitive intensity, market turbulence, and structural flux) on the marketing doctrine use–performance relationship.

Title: Customer Complaints and Recovery Effectiveness: A Customer Base Approach
Author-Name: George Knox
Author-Name: Rutger van Oest
Abstract: Although customer complaints are a well-studied aspect of business, no study has measured the impact of actual complaints and recoveries on subsequent customer purchasing. The authors develop a customer base model to investigate the effectiveness of recovery in preventing customer churn. They calibrate it on panel data that track actual purchases, complaints, and recoveries for 20,000 new customers of an Internet and catalog retailer over 2.5 years. Complaints are associated with a substantial increase in the probability that the customer stops buying, but the size of the increase depends on prior customer experiences: prior purchases mitigate the effect, and their impact is long-lasting, whereas prior complaints exacerbate the effect, but their impact is short-lived. Thus, unless the customer leaves the company after a complaint, or a second failure occurs shortly after the first, the relationship quickly returns to normal. Recovery counters the effect of the complaint but, in almost all cases, does not entirely offset it. The authors use simulation to translate the results to financial impact and discuss implications for researchers and managers.

Title: Making Choices While Smelling, Tasting, and Listening: The Role of Sensory (Dis)similarity When Sequentially Sampling Products
Author-Name: Dipayan Biswas
Author-Name: Lauren I. Labrecque
Author-Name: Donald R. Lehmann
Author-Name: Ereni Markos
Abstract: Marketers are increasingly allowing consumers to sample sensory-rich experiential products before making purchase decisions. The results of seven experimental studies (two conducted in field settings, three conducted in a laboratory, and two conducted online) demonstrate that the order in which consumers sample products and the level of (dis)similarity between the sensory cues of the products influence choices. In the absence of any moderators, when sampling a sequence of sensory-rich experiential products (e.g., fragrances, chocolates, flavored beverages, music) with similar sensory cues (e.g., smell, taste, color, sound), consumers prefer the first product in the sequence. However, when sampling a sequence of products with dissimilar sensory cues, consumers prefer the last product. These findings (1) contribute to a better understanding of the role of sequential sensory cues on consumer choice formation, (2) have implications for effects related to sensory habituation and sensory trace fading, and (3) help resolve apparent inconsistencies in prior research on order effects in the context of choices for sequentially sampled experiential products.

Title: Indirect Learning: How Emerging-Market Firms Grow in Developed Markets

Author-Name: Rajesh K. Chandy
Abstract: Some emerging-market firms have recently achieved substantial growth in developed markets despite having had little prior experience in these markets. What explains the performance of these firms? Building on the organizational learning literature, the authors argue that indirect learning (i.e., learning from the experience of others) plays a crucial role in explaining this phenomenon. Specifically, they propose that emerging-market firms that grow in developed markets overcome their lack of direct experience in such markets by learning indirectly through their leaders, competitors, and interfirm networks. The authors test their thesis by comparing the international growth in developed markets of a sample of emerging-market firms (116 Indian firms) with a sample of developed-market firms (160 U.K. firms). The results support the authors' thesis about the importance of indirect learning in explaining the international growth of emerging-market (relative to developed-market) firms in developed markets. The authors discuss the implications of these findings for policy makers in the areas of higher education, competition policy, and international trade as well as for managers in the areas of middle-management recruitment, competitor analysis and tracking, and managing interfirm networks.

Title: Price Promotion for Emotional Impact
Author-Name: Aylin Aydinli

Author-Name: Anja Lambrecht
Abstract: Managers and academics often think of price promotions merely as incentives that entice consumers to accept offers that they might not have considered otherwise. Yet the prospect of paying a lower price for a product of given quality can also discourage deliberation, in a sense “dumbing down” the purchase encounter by making it less consequential. The authors examine this possibility in a dual-system theory of consumer behavior. Specifically, they argue that price promotion lowers a consumer's motivation to exert mental effort, in which case purchase decisions are guided less by extensive information processing and more by a quicker, easier, strong conditioner of preference: affect. Field data from a large daily deal company and four controlled experiments support this idea and document its implications primarily for product choice, in turn providing insight into the form and cause of brand switching that manufacturers and retailers can leverage to improve the allocation of promotional budgets and category management.

Title: When to Take or Forgo New Product Exclusivity: Balancing Protection from Competition Against Word-of-Mouth Spillover
Author-Name: Renana Peres
Author-Name: Christophe Van den Bulte
Abstract: Manufacturers or resellers introducing a new product often must decide whether and for how long to be its exclusive seller. Standard models of competition and conventional wisdom suggest that exclusivity boosts profits. However, using both agent-based simulations and game-theoretic modeling, the authors find that positive word of mouth (WOM) from customers of rival firms can make exclusivity unprofitable. This reversal of conventional wisdom occurs because WOM creates a positive externality, and a firm holding exclusivity cannot benefit from the WOM spillover generated by customers of other firms. The benefits of forgoing exclusivity are magnified by (1) the presence of locked-in customers who consider buying from only a single firm, (2) the extent to which opinion leaders are among a firm's own locked-in customers rather than those of competitors, and (3) customers' low price sensitivity. In addition, firms sometimes benefit from forgoing exclusivity even without WOM from rivals' customers, but only when the combination of large-scale lock-in, high price sensitivity, and strong WOM among the firm's customers exists.

Title: Authority Relinquishment in Agency Relationships
Author-Name: Gülnur Tumbat
Author-Name: Kent Grayson
Abstract: A key decision for the design of principal–agent agreements is how much control or authority the buyer (or principal) should be allowed to exercise in relation to the seller (or agent). Historically, agency theory has viewed exchange agreements as ranging from those in which the buyer has very high authority over the seller (formal authority) to those in which the buyer and seller are relatively independent so there is little or no authority relation (market exchange). However, some principal–agent agreements reverse the authority relationship usually assumed in agency theory by allowing the seller to exercise authority over the buyer. The authors study this unexplored type of agency agreement and refer to it as “authority relinquishment.” Using data collected from interviews with clients and guides on commercial high-altitude mountain expeditions, the authors identify conditions that make authority relinquishment likely. They also identify the benefits and drawbacks of authority relinquishment and compare them with the benefits and drawbacks of two frequently studied approaches to managing agency relationships—formal authority and authority decentralization.

Title: What Goes Around Comes Around: The Impact of Marketing Alliances on Firm Risk and the Moderating Role of Network Density
Author-Name: Felipe Thomaz
Author-Name: Vanitha Swaminathan
Abstract: Although the value gained from partnership formation (through alliances) or through the firm's position in a network has received significant research attention, little is known about the risks that can accompany this increasing reliance on partners. The authors investigate the change in firm idiosyncratic and systematic risks after the announcement of marketing alliances and analyze whether the density of the firm's network of alliance partners moderates the risk exposure, demonstrated through investors' expectations of a firm's risk or the equity risk of a firm. The results indicate that marketing alliances reduce firm risk, so long as the alliance is a novel connection between the partnering firms. Furthermore, at high levels, the interconnectedness of partners or density of a firm's network can cause idiosyncratic risk to increase, and the density of a partner's network can also result in increases in systematic risk of a firm after alliance formation.

Title: Gambled Price Discounts: A Remedy to the Negative Side Effects of Regular Price Discounts
Author-Name: Sascha Alavi
Author-Name: Torsten Bornemann
Author-Name: Jan Wieseke
Abstract: In the context of price discounts, a special type of price promotion, in which savings depend on the outcome of a gamble and are thus uncertain, has recently achieved some popularity. The question arises as to whether such gambled price discounts (GPDs) incur the negative reference price effect—that is, a downward shift in customers' internal reference price (IRP)—which is often associated with regular price discounts (RPDs). From several studies, including two longitudinal field experiments, the authors find that GPDs indeed alleviate the negative reference price effect: IRPs and actual repurchasing tend to be lower for RPDs than for GPDs and a no-discount control condition. Moreover, the authors explore the psychological underpinnings of these effects and show that the different consequences of GPDs versus RPDs on IRPs are more pronounced if information regarding product quality is limited. The authors demonstrate that findings are robust to variations of GPD discount levels and the probability of winning.

Title: Cross-Selling Performance in Complex Selling Contexts: An Examination of Supervisory- and Compensation-Based Controls
Author-Name: Christian Schmitz
Author-Name: You-Cheong Lee
Author-Name: Gary L. Lilien
Abstract: Although cross-selling offers significant benefits for both vendors and customers, three-quarters of all cross-selling initiatives fail, typically for sales force–related reasons. Prior research examining the antecedents of salespeople's product adoption has not yet shown whether or under which conditions such adoption behavior leads to better salesperson cross-selling performance. The authors develop a model of the role of supervisory behavior, compensation-based controls, and their interactions in enhancing the effect of salespeople's adoption behavior on cross-selling performance in a complex selling context. To test the model, the authors use a matched, multilevel data set from company records and surveys of salespeople and sales managers working in a biotech firm. The analysis shows that transformational leadership enhances the effect of salespeople's product portfolio adoption on cross-selling performance, whereas transactional leadership diminishes the effect. Furthermore, the effect of leadership type depends on whether cross-selling incentives are provided: the positive performance effect of transformational leadership is crowded out when monetary incentives are provided, and the negative effect of transactional leadership becomes even more negative. These results have significant theoretical and managerial implications.

Title: Group-Buying Deal Popularity

Abstract: Group-buying (GB) deals entail a two-phase decision process. First, consumers decide whether to buy a deal. Second, they decide when to redeem the deal, conditional on purchase. Guided by theories of social influence and observational learning, the authors develop a framework predicting that (1) deal popularity increases consumers' purchase likelihood and decreases redemption time, conditional on purchase, and (2) the social influence–related factors of referral intensity and group consumption amplify these effects. The authors test this framework and support it using a unique data set of 30,272 customers of a GB website with several million data points. Substantially, these findings reveal a two-phase perspective of GB, longevity effects of deal popularity, and the amplifying role of customer referrals (influencing others) in the effects of deal popularity (others' influence). In light of the criticism of GB industry practice, this study builds the case for GB websites and merchants to heed deal popularity information and the social influence–related contingencies.

Title: Customer Orientation Structure for Internet-Based Business-to-Business Platform Firms
Author-Name: Anindita Chakravarty
Author-Name: Alok Kumar
Author-Name: Rajdeep Grewal
Abstract: Internet-based business-to-business platforms involve a buyer side transacting with a seller side, both of which are customers of an intermediary platform firm. Dyadic viewpoints implicit in conventional theories of customer orientation thus must be modified to apply to a triadic relationship system (seller–platform–buyer) in platform settings. The authors propose that customer orientation of platform firms consists of total customer orientation (customer orientation toward both the buyer and seller sides) and customer orientation asymmetry (customer orientation in favor of the seller relative to the buyer side) and examine the antecedents and consequences of these orientations. Data from 109 business-to-business electronic platforms reveal that buyer- (seller-) side concentration increases total customer orientation and customer orientation asymmetry toward sellers (buyers). These positive effects are weaker when buyers and sellers interact directly (two-sided matching) versus indirectly (one-sided matching) and are stronger when the offering prices vary (dynamic price discovery) versus remain stable (static price discovery) during negotiations. Finally, total customer orientation increases platform performance by itself and in interaction with customer concentration, but orientation asymmetry increases performance only in conjunction with customer concentration.

Title: Leveraging Trends in Online Searches for Product Features in Market Response Modeling
Author-Name: Rex Yuxing Du

Author-Name: Sina Damangir
Abstract: Evolving tastes can change the relative importance of product features in shaping consumers' purchase decisions, which in turn can shift the relative attractiveness of products with different feature levels. The challenge lies in finding a reliable yet cost-effective way to monitor the weights consumers place on various product features. In the context of the U.S. automotive market, the authors explore the potential of using trends in online searches for feature-related keywords as indicators of trends in the relative importance of the corresponding features (e.g., fuel economy, acceleration, cost to buy, cost to operate, body type). By augmenting marketing-mix data with feature search data in a market response model, they show substantial improvements in goodness-of-fit both in and out of sample. The authors find empirical support for the hypothesis that feature search trends are positively correlated with feature importance trends. They discuss how managers may make better decisions by monitoring feature search trends and leveraging those trends strategically.

Abstract: This article investigates the sales force socialization process, wherein newly hired salespeople often face failure-prone environments. Drawing from the learned helplessness paradigm, the authors hypothesize that cumulative periods of sales performance failure are associated with sales-oriented behavior intentions. In addition, the authors examine the influence of leadership, expecting core transformational leadership to have a diminishing effect as unmet sales goals accumulate. Study 1 finds support for these hypotheses using panel survey data from 221 new hires during six months of a furniture retailer's sales force socialization process. Then, aiming to uncover the underlying mechanism driving salesperson helplessness and a managerial approach that has a sustained impact, the authors conduct Study 2, a scenario-based experiment focused on the business-to-business insurance industry. The authors find that perceived task difficulty mediates the focal relationship and that error management enables core transformational leadership to have a lasting effect such that new hires have the lowest sales-oriented behavior intentions when transformational sales managers encourage them to make errors during their interactions with customers and to actively learn from their failures.

Abstract: Although ethnography has become a popular research approach in many organizations, major gaps exist in the field's understanding of the way it operates in the corporate world, particularly in how ethnography facilitates market learning. Drawing from extensive fieldwork in the world of commercial ethnography, the authors describe how ethnographic stories give executives a unique means of understanding market realities. By working through the rich details of ethnographic stories infused with the tensions, contradictions, and emotions of people's everyday lives, executives are better able to grasp the complexity of consumer cultures. Overall, this research should help managers leverage the catalytic effects of ethnographic storytelling in their efforts to learn about and understand market contexts.

Title: Service Quality: The Impact of Frequency, Timing, Proximity, and Sequence of Failures and Delights
Author-Name: K. Sivakumar

Author-Name: Beibei Dong
Abstract: Service delivery often involves a series of events or stages of exchange between a service provider and its customer. At each stage, performance can meet, exceed, or fall below the customer's expectations. This article contributes to the literature by examining how the patterns of distribution (frequency, timing, proximity, and sequence) of service failures and delights affect customers' perceptions of service quality. The authors propose a conceptual model based on mental accounting principles derived from prospect theory and develop a series of research propositions to explicate the links between distribution patterns of service failures/delights and service quality perceptions. The study integrates prospect theory with service encounter research and provides a comprehensive theory-driven platform for exploring the impact of various service failure and delight distribution patterns. In addition, it offers important managerial implications for service design and resource allocation regarding when, how often, how close, and in what order delights and failures should take place to maximize gains from delights and minimize losses from failures.

Title: Looking Beyond the Horizon: How to Approach the Customers' Customers in Business-to-Business Markets
Author-Name: Christian Homburg
Author-Name: Halina Wilczek
Author-Name: Alexander Hahn
Abstract: Suppliers in business-to-business (B2B) markets often approach their customers' customers with marketing activities. However, marketing research lacks an integrative conceptualization of this phenomenon. The authors address this void by conceptualizing a B2B supplier's marketing approaches to indirect customers. Drawing on a literature review and a qualitative empirical study, the authors identify three indirect customer marketing approaches: direct customer downstream support, cooperative indirect customer marketing, and independent indirect customer marketing. They also propose external (value chain–related) and internal (B2B supplier–related) moderators that influence the relationship between a B2B supplier's marketing approaches to indirect customers and its financial performance. The authors argue that although power constellations and product value contribution in the value chain determine the specific indirect customer marketing approach that will lead to financial success, internal professionalization of a B2B supplier's organizational structure and processes further strengthens the positive financial impact of each approach.

Title: Consumers' Response to Commercials: When the Energy Level in the Commercial Conflicts with the Media Context
Author-Name: Nancy M. Puccinelli
Author-Name: Keith Wilcox
Author-Name: Dhruv Grewal
Abstract: This research examines how media-induced consumer activation level affects consumer response to highly energetic commercials. Over six studies, including a Hulu field experiment, the authors report that consumers who are experiencing a deactivating emotion (e.g., sadness induced by a movie) find it more difficult to watch highly energetic commercials compared with consumers who are not experiencing a deactivating emotion. As a result, consumers experiencing a deactivating emotion are less likely to watch highly energetic commercials and recall the advertiser compared with consumers who are not experiencing a deactivating emotion. The authors do not observe these effects when consumers experiencing a deactivating emotion watch commercials that are moderately energetic or when consumers do not experience a deactivating emotion. These findings suggest that when advertisers run commercials in a media context that induces a deactivating emotion (e.g., sadness, relaxation, contentment), they should avoid running highly energetic commercials (e.g., with upbeat, enthusiastic spokespeople). In addition, this research recommends that when advertisers are unable to determine the emotions induced by the media context, they should run commercials that are moderate in energy. The results of a meta-analysis across the present studies show that consumers experiencing a deactivating emotion will respond as much as 50% more favorably to moderately energetic commercials compared with highly energetic commercials.

Title: Touch Versus Tech: When Technology Functions as a Barrier or a Benefit to Service Encounters
Author-Name: Michael Giebelhausen
Author-Name: Stacey G. Robinson

Author-Name: Michael K. Brady
Abstract: Interpersonal exchanges between customers and frontline service employees increasingly involve the use of technology, such as point-of-sale terminals, tablets, and kiosks. The present research draws on role and script theories to demonstrate that customer reactions to technology-infused service exchanges depend on the presence of employee rapport. When rapport is present during the exchange, the use of technology functions as an interpersonal barrier preventing the customer from responding in kind to employee rapport-building efforts, thereby decreasing service encounter evaluations. However, during service encounters in which employees are not engaging in rapport building, technology functions as an interpersonal barrier, enabling customers to retreat from the relatively unpleasant service interaction, thereby increasing service encounter evaluations. Two analyses using J.D. Power Guest Satisfaction Index data support the barrier and beneficial effects of technology use during service encounters with and without rapport, respectively. A follow-up experiment replicates this data pattern and identifies psychological discomfort as a key process that governs the effect. For managers, the results demonstrate the inherent incompatibility of initiatives designed to encourage employee–customer rapport with those that introduce technology into frontline service exchanges.

Title: Name-Letters and Birthday-Numbers: Implicit Egotism Effects in Pricing
Author-Name: Keith S. Coulter
Author-Name: Dhruv Grewal
Abstract: This research examines how the implicit egotism resulting from consumers' positive self-associations affects their evaluations of product prices. The effects can occur when the product's price and the consumer share either name-letters (name-letter/price effect) or birthday-numbers (birthday-number/price effect).Through a series of studies, the authors demonstrate that the positive affect linked to name-letters and birthday-numbers transfers directly to consumers' price predilections and ultimately affects their purchase intentions. More specifically, consumers like prices (e.g., “fifty-five dollars”) that contain digits beginning with the same first letter (e.g., “F”) as their own name (e.g., “Fred,” “Mr. Frank”) more than prices that do not. Similarly, prices that contain cents digits (e.g., $49.15) that correspond to a consumer's date of birth (e.g., April 15) also enhance pricing liking and purchase intentions. Across groups of consumers, the authors' findings demonstrate that implicit egotism effects can result in greater purchase intentions for a higher-priced product compared with a lower-priced product.

Title: Moderating Effects of the Relationship Between Private Label Share and Store Loyalty
Author-Name: Nicole Koschate-Fischer

Author-Name: Wayne D. Hoyer
Abstract: A key benefit of private labels for retailers is their potential to increase customers' store loyalty. However, previous research has not examined how this relationship varies across customers and situations. This study contributes to knowledge in this area by developing a conceptual framework that guides the investigation of the role of four moderating factors in strengthening the private label brand share–store loyalty link: (1) customers' price-oriented behavior, (2) degree of commoditization of the product category, (3) product category involvement, and (4) the retailer's price positioning. This article draws on a large-scale empirical study using a household panel and questionnaire data for 35 diverse fast-moving consumer goods product categories. The results of this study show that the relationship between private label share and store loyalty is more complex than previous research has suggested. Specifically, the private label brand share–store loyalty link is stronger for customers with high price-oriented behavior, retailers with a low price positioning, and product categories that are less commoditized and have relatively higher involvement.

Title: Willing to Pay More, Eager to Pay Less: The Role of Customer Loyalty in Price Negotiations
Author-Name: Jan Wieseke
Author-Name: Sascha Alavi
Author-Name: Johannes Habel
Abstract: This article is the first to empirically examine the effect of customer loyalty in retail price negotiations. Across three field studies and one negotiation experiment, the authors establish what they call the “loyalty–discount cycle”: in price negotiations with salespeople, loyal customers receive deeper discounts that, in turn, increase customer loyalty, resulting in a downward spiral of a company's price enforcement. The reason for the positive effect of customer loyalty on discount is twofold: (1) loyal customers demand a reward for their loyalty and invoke their elevated perceived negotiation power, and (2) to retain loyal customers, salespeople grant discounts more willingly. Furthermore, the mechanisms are moderated by the basis of a customer's loyalty (price vs. quality) and the length of the relationship between the salesperson and the customer. To escape the loyalty–discount cycle, salespeople can use functional and relational customer-oriented behaviors. The study helps managers and salespeople optimize their price enforcement and servicing of loyal customers.

Title: Multidyadic Industrial Channels: Understanding Component Supplier Profits and Original Equipment Manufacturer Behavior
Author-Name: Steven H. Dahlquist
Author-Name: David A. Griffith
Abstract: Industrial component suppliers (CSs) work to enhance profitability by building brand differentiation with original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and indirect industrial buyers (IIBs) through their marketing investments to each member. However, as a CS increases its marketing investments to its IIB, the OEM's profit position is threatened, motivating the OEM to respond with aligning or opposing behavior. The results from a three-study, multimethod design indicate that a CS's strategy of allocating its marketing investments between its OEM and IIB increases its brand differentiation, which allows it to capture increased profits subject to conditions of uncertainty. However, the results also demonstrate that the OEM does not sit idly by as its CS invests in building brand differentiation with the IIB; rather, it reacts with both aligning and opposing behaviors to benefit from the CS's investments as well as offset the CS's gains.

Title: The Role of Culture in International Relationship Marketing
Author-Name: Stephen A. Samaha
Author-Name: Joshua T. Beck
Author-Name: Robert W. Palmatier
Abstract: International relationships are increasingly critical to business performance. Yet despite a recent surge in international research on relationship marketing (RM), it is unclear whether or how RM should be adapted across cultures. The authors adopt Hofstede's dimensions of culture to conduct a comprehensive, multivariate, metaregression analysis of 47,864 relationships across 170 studies, 36 countries, and six continents. To guide theory, they propose four tenets that parsimoniously capture the essence of culture's effects on RM. Study 1 affirms these tenets and emphasizes the importance of taking a fine-grained perspective to understand the role of culture in RM because of the high degree of heterogeneity across different cultural dimensions and RM linkages. For example, the magnitude of individualism's effect is 71% greater on RM than other cultural dimensions, whereas masculinity has almost no effect; however, accounting only for individualism ignores significant moderating effects of power distance and uncertainty avoidance dimensions. To guide managers, Study 2 adopts a country-level approach and reveals that RM is much more effective outside the United States such that relationships are 55% more effective, on average, for increasing business performance in Brazil, Russia, India, and China.

Title: Understanding the Impact of In-Process Promotional Messages: An Application to Online Auctions
Author-Name: Caroline Ducarroz
Author-Name: Sha Yang
Author-Name: Eric A. Greenleaf
Abstract: In-process promotions focus on promotional activities during marketing events such as auctions, crowdfunding, or fund-raising. Firms can observe consumers’ responses to these promotions and use this information to adjust future promotions sent during the same events. The authors study the impact of promotions on market outcomes and focus on one use of such promotions: messages sent during online auctions, in which the outcome is the final auction price. They propose that the effect of these messages can be understood by observing their aggregate impact on final auction prices and by examining how messages affect behaviors at the bid level, namely, new-bidder entry and jump bidding. These bid-level behaviors can, when summed at the auction level, affect auction prices. Besides examining the messages’ impact on bidder behavior, the authors study the auctioneer’s strategy in issuing these messages. They distinguish between informative messages, which focus on product attributes, and persuasive messages, which try to motivate the message recipients to bid. They test hypotheses derived from their framework using data from online auctions of Air France airline tickets. The authors also conduct “what-if” simulations to help auctioneers identify the optimal number of messages to send during an auction.

Abstract: The media industry has undergone a fundamental shift over the past decade as new online distribution channels have proliferated in an unprecedented manner. Although mobile devices have experienced rapid adoption among consumers, their effect on consumer behavior and their subsequent implications for publishers and advertisers have yet to be understood. The authors examine consumers' news consumption behavior on mobile news websites in response to the introduction of a mobile news app. Pseudo-panel analysis based on repeated cross-sectional data suggests that the introduction of a mobile app by a major national media company leads to a significant increase in demand at the corresponding mobile news website. In addition, the authors report that this effect is greater for consumers with (1) greater appreciation for concentrated news content, (2) stronger propensity for a particular political viewpoint, and (3) fewer time constraints. The results are consistent with the interpretation that the adoption of a provider's news app stimulates corresponding mobile news website visits. The authors discuss the implications of these findings for advertisers, media publishers, and policy makers.

Title: Improving Online Idea Generation Platforms and Customizing the Task Structure on the Basis of Consumers' Domain-Specific Knowledge
Author-Name: Lan Luo
Author-Name: Olivier Toubia
Abstract: The authors explore how firms can enhance consumer performance in online idea generation platforms. Most, if not all, online idea generation platforms offer all consumers identical tasks in which (1) participants are granted access to ideas from other participants and (2) ideas are classified into categories, but consumers can navigate freely across idea categories. The former is linked to stimulus ideas, and the latter may be viewed as a first step toward problem decomposition. The authors propose that the effects of both stimulus ideas and problem decomposition are moderated by consumers' domain-specific knowledge. In particular, concrete cues such as stimulus ideas are more beneficial to low-knowledge consumers, and high-knowledge consumers are better served with abstract cues such as the ones offered by problem decomposition. The authors' hypotheses are supported by an extensive empirical investigation involving more than 6,000 participants. The findings suggest that online idea generation platforms should use problem decomposition more explicitly and that firms should not immediately show other participants' ideas to high-knowledge consumers when they access the platform. In other words, online idea generation platforms should customize the task structure on the basis of each participant's domain-specific knowledge.

Abstract: Adopting an institutional theoretic framework, this article examines the evolution and competitive dynamics of markets composed of multiple practices, beliefs, and rule systems. The 30-year historical analysis of the U.S. yoga market illustrates the coexistence of spirituality, medical, fitness, and commercial logics. Using data gathered through archival sources, netnography, in-depth interviews, and participant observations, the authors link shifting emphases on institutional logics and their sustenance to institutional entrepreneurs' accumulation and transmission of cultural capital, strategies to legitimize plural logics, distinct branding practices, and contestations among the pervading logics. The study offers a managerial framework for managing conflicting demands of logics, conveying brand legitimacy, and creating a coherent brand identity in plural logic markets; in addition, it develops a theoretical account of links between institutional logics, competitive dynamics, and market evolution.

Title: Managing Revenue Across Retail Channels: The Interplay of Service Performance and Direct Marketing
Author-Name: Donald J. Lund
Author-Name: Detelina Marinova
Abstract: Increased internal pressure to make marketing accountable, combined with market pressure from the proliferation of new service delivery channels, requires retailers to better understand the differential impacts of marketing efforts across channels now more than ever. In this article, the authors (1) develop and test a theoretically grounded framework for the interplay of objective service performance and direct marketing in shaping retail revenue over time through two distinct service delivery channels (on-site and remote) and (2) conceptualize service delivery channel–specific servicescapes as facilitative mechanisms for the effectiveness of objective service performance and direct marketing. The authors test the conceptual framework with multisource data from a major national pizza retailer comprising a field study based on a time series of 223 weeks across five stores of objective marketing and performance data (delivery time) and a cross-sectional survey of the retailer's customers. They find that objective service performance and direct marketing interact by exhibiting a trade-off effect contingent on specific aspects of the servicescape. When both objective service performance and direct marketing levels are high, servicescape quality design perceptions alleviate the trade-off effect in on-site delivery channels, and servicescape time/effort cost perceptions do so in remote delivery channels. The authors conclude with a discussion of implications for research and practice.

Title: BYOB: How Bringing Your Own Shopping Bags Leads to Treating Yourself and the Environment
Author-Name: Uma R. Karmarkar
Author-Name: Bryan Bollinger
Abstract: As concerns about pollution and climate change become more mainstream, the belief that shopping with reusable grocery bags is an important environmental and socially conscious choice has gained prevalence. In parallel, firms have joined policy makers in using a variety of initiatives to reduce the use of disposable plastic bags. However, little is known about how these initiatives might alter other elements of consumers' in-store behavior. Using scanner panel data from a single California location of a major grocery chain, and controlling for consumer heterogeneity, the authors demonstrate that bringing one's own bags increases purchases of not only environmentally friendly organic foods but also indulgent foods. They use experimental methods to further explore the expression of these effects and to consider the effects of potential moderators, including competing goals and store policies. The findings have implications for decisions related to product pricing, placement and assortment, store layout, and the choice of strategies employed to increase the use of reusable bags.

Title: Place the Logo High or Low? Using Conceptual Metaphors of Power in Packaging Design
Author-Name: Aparna Sundar
Author-Name: Theodore J. Noseworthy
Abstract: Across three studies, this research examines how marketers can capitalize on their brand's standing in the marketplace through strategic logo placement on their packaging. Using a conceptual metaphor framework, the authors find that consumers prefer powerful brands more when the brand logo is featured high rather than low on the brand's packaging, whereas they prefer less powerful brands more when the brand logo is featured low rather than high on the brand's packaging. Furthermore, the authors confirm that the underlying mechanism for this shift in preference is a fluency effect derived from consumers intuitively linking the concept of power with height. Given this finding, the authors then demonstrate an important boundary condition by varying a person's state of power to be at odds with the metaphoric link. The results demonstrate when and how marketers can capitalize on consumers' latent associations through package design.

Abstract: The present research examines how ambient scents affect consumers' spatial perceptions in retail environments, which in turn influence customers' feelings of power and, thus, product preference and purchasing behavior. Specifically, the authors demonstrate that in a warm- (vs. cool-) scented and thus perceptually more (vs. less) socially dense environment, people experience a greater (vs. lesser) need for power, which manifests in increased preference for and purchase of premium products and brands. This research extends knowledge on store atmospherics and customer experience management through the effects of ambient scent on spatial perceptions and builds on recent research on power in choice contexts.

Title: Comparing the Effect of Store Remodeling on New and Existing Customers
Author-Name: Tracey S. Dagger
Author-Name: Peter J. Danaher
Abstract: Although retailers invest millions of dollars in redesigning, refreshing, and remodeling their stores, it is unclear that such large investments are worthwhile. Prior research has indicated that remodeling has only a short-term effect. However, a previously unexplored area is its effect on those who visit the store for the first time after it is remodeled (new customers) versus those who had visited before the remodeling (existing customers). This study contrasts the effect of store remodeling on new and existing customers in two field experiments with stores that underwent a major remodeling. Treatment and control stores are used in both experiments. The authors measure sales before and after the remodeling for new and existing customers; in one store, they also measure customers' psychological responses. In both cases, sales increased after the remodeling effort. However, sales for new customers are significantly higher than sales for existing customers after the remodel, and this difference persists for a year. Higher sales to new customers are primarily due to more new customers being drawn to the remodeled store, their higher spend per visit, and their subsequent increased visit frequency.

Most current literature on changing strategic orientations has focused on an antecedents and outcomes approach to business orientations. Intimated, but rarely addressed, are the notions that (1) strategic orientations may be thought of as ideologies and (2) such ideologies are likely to contend with each other. Taking such a perspective may be helpful in discussing why it is challenging to transition to more sustainable strategic orientations even in the presence of financial incentives to do so. In assessing the transition to organic production and marketing in a commodity agriculture context, the authors find that contending ideologies restrict its adoption. In addition, they suggest that strategic orientations are not adopted or contested solely within firms but also among them. The authors find that ideological contestation among firms in this context takes the form of a marketplace drama between a chemical, productionist orientation and an organic orientation in which protagonists mobilize several forms of legitimacy.

Title: The Role of Within-Trip Dynamics in Unplanned Versus Planned Purchase Behavior
Author-Name: Timothy J. Gilbride
Author-Name: J. Jeffrey Inman
Author-Name: Karen Melville Stilley
Abstract: The recent surge in the importance of shopper marketing has led to an increased need to understand the drivers of unplanned purchases. The authors address this issue by examining how elements of the current shopping trip (e.g., lagged unplanned purchase, cumulative purchases) and previous shopping trips (e.g., average historical price paid by the shopper) determine unplanned versus planned purchases on the current trip. Using a grocery field study and frequent-shopper-program data, the authors estimate competing models to test behavioral hypotheses using a hierarchical Bayesian probit model with state dependence and serially correlated errors. The results indicate that shoppers with smaller trip budgets tend to exhibit behavior consistent with a self-regulation model (i.e., an unplanned purchase decreases the probability of a subsequent unplanned vs. planned purchase), but this effect reverses later in the trip. In contrast, shoppers with medium-sized trip budgets tend to exhibit behavior consistent with a cuing theory model (i.e., an unplanned purchase increases the probability of a subsequent unplanned vs. planned purchase), and this effect increases as the trip continues. The article concludes with a discussion of implications for research and practice.

Abstract: Firms often utilize salesperson intelligence in marketing strategies to improve sales performance. However, this approach is problematic if the information is based on inaccurate perceptions. In light of this, the authors introduce a theoretical model to study the antecedents and profit impact of salesperson perceptions of customer relationship quality. Dyadic analyses using matched survey responses from salesperson–customer dyads and secondary performance data reveal several insightful findings. Results show that self-efficacious salespeople are upwardly biased, whereas customer-oriented salespeople are downwardly biased in their perceptions of customer relationship quality. However, managers can correct these inaccuracies using a behavior-based control system. Response surface analyses illustrate that the effects of salesperson accuracy and inaccuracy are distinct and curvilinear. During later relationship phases, salespeople profit more from salesperson accuracy in high- and low-quality relationships (i.e., a U-shaped effect). Yet the increasingly harmful impact of salesperson inaccuracy on profit is more severe during earlier relationship phases. Together, these findings highlight the benefits of measuring salesperson perceptions and how to manage them.

Title: Is Neutral Really Neutral? The Effects of Neutral User-Generated Content on Product Sales
Author-Name: Tanya (Ya) Tang

Author-Name: Feng Wang
Abstract: This article aims to specify the performance implications of neutral user-generated content (UGC) on product sales by differentiating mixed-neutral UGC, which contains an equal amount of positive and negative claims, from indifferent-neutral UGC, which includes neither positive nor negative claims. The authors propose that positive and negative UGC only provide opportunities for consumers to process product-related information, whereas both mixed- and indifferent-neutral UGC affect consumers' motivation and ability to process positive and negative UGC. The results of three studies using multiple measures (text and numerical UGC), contexts (automobiles, movies, and tablets), and methods (empirical and behavioral experiment) indicate contrasting premium and discount effects such that mixed-neutral UGC amplifies the effects of positive and negative UGC, whereas indifferent-neutral UGC attenuates them. Empirical evidence further indicates that ignoring mixed- or indifferent-neutral UGC leads to substantial under- or overestimates of the effects of positive and negative UGC. The effects of neutral UGC on product sales thus are not truly neutral, and the direction of the bias depends on both the type of UGC and the distribution of positive and negative UGC.

Title: What Makes It Green? The Role of Centrality of Green Attributes in Evaluations of the Greenness of Products
Author-Name: Andrew D. Gershoff
Author-Name: Judy K. Frels
Abstract: An increasing body of research addresses consumers' green product purchasing behavior, and yet little work has examined how consumers form perceptions of the greenness of products in the first place. Drawing on theories of attribute centrality (the degree to which an attribute is integral in defining an object), the authors argue that products with identical environmental benefits will be judged more or less green depending on whether the benefit stems from a central versus a peripheral attribute. They present four studies that support the hypotheses and explore factors that influence the effect of central attributes, including product category membership and integration of the green attribute with other elements of the product. They include controls for firm motivations and importance of the attribute to the individual consumer. The authors conclude the article with managerial and public policy implications, such as advice for firms on where to make green investments for maximum consumer impact and insight for public policy makers on the need for consumer assistance in objectively evaluating products with identical environmental benefits that achieve those benefits in different ways.

Title: From Finance to Marketing: The Impact of Financial Leverage on Customer Satisfaction
Author-Name: Ashwin Malshe
Author-Name: Manoj K. Agarwal
Abstract: The authors examine how a firm's financial leverage affects marketing outcomes and consequent firm value. They find that leverage has a dual effect: it reduces customer satisfaction and moderates the relationship between satisfaction and firm value. The burden of making regular interest payments to debt holders pressures managers to generate adequate cash flows. The authors theorize that this may lead marketers to adopt short-term actions such as cutting advertising and research-and-development spending, which can hurt customer satisfaction by lowering perceived quality and perceived value. Furthermore, higher leverage reduces financial flexibility by constraining marketers from exploiting growth opportunities resulting from higher customer satisfaction. The authors empirically show that leverage leads to lower customer satisfaction, with advertising intensity mediating this effect. The negative impact of leverage on satisfaction is more pronounced for service firms and firms in competitive markets. Finally, leverage negatively moderates the customer satisfaction–firm value link. Increases in customer satisfaction are value enhancing at modest levels of leverage, but at very high levels of leverage, increases in satisfaction are value reducing.

Title: Green Claims and Message Frames: How Green New Products Change Brand Attitude
Author-Name: Mitchell C. Olsen

Author-Name: Sandeep R. Chandukala
Abstract: In response to a top ten global consumer trend, firms are increasingly introducing environmentally sustainable (“green”) new products. Firms allocate significant resources to this area; thus, the authors consider the brand-level implications by investigating how the introduction of green new products changes attitude toward the brand. In examining this relationship, they draw from social identity and framing theories to investigate drivers of green new product introductions as well as the moderating effects of message framing, source credibility, and product type. Estimating a three-stage least squares model based on new product introductions from 75 brands across a four-year time period (2009-2012), the authors find that green new product introductions can indeed improve brand attitude and that both the brand and category's positioning influence the introduction of green new products. They also find that the quantity of green messages, the product type, and their source credibility influence the extent to which green new products change brand attitude. The authors use these findings to provide guidance for managers as they attempt to effectively link their green innovation efforts to improve consumer attitudes toward their brands.

Title: Better Not Smile at the Price: The Differential Role of Brand Anthropomorphization on Perceived Price Fairness
Author-Name: Hyokjin Kwak
Author-Name: Marina Puzakova
Author-Name: Joseph F. Rocereto
Abstract: This research shows that brand anthropomorphization increases the perceived unfairness of price increases and the perceived fairness of price decreases. First, analyzing a household panel data set, the authors demonstrate the real-world consequences of brand humanization on consumers' price sensitivity. Second, building on the theoretical premise that fairness judgments depend on consumer focus on the self versus others, they find that brand humanization enhances perceived unfairness of price increases for agency-oriented consumers, who tend to maximize their own self-interests. However, for communion-oriented consumers, who generally consider the needs of others, brand humanization increases perceived fairness of both price increases and decreases. Furthermore, because consumers' focus on the self versus others also depends on relationship goals, the nature of consumer–brand relationships interacts with agency–communion orientation to influence the effect of brand humanization on perceived price fairness. For example, exchange relationship norms reduce the power of brand anthropomorphization to enhance perceived fairness of price changes for communion-oriented consumers. In contrast, the communal nature of these relationships makes both agency- and communion-oriented consumers infer greater positive intent from a humanized (vs. nonhumanized) brand, thus leading to a more positive effect of brand humanization on price fairness for price decreases.

Title: Beyond Fungible: Transforming Money into Moral and Social Resources
Author-Name: Tonya Williams Bradford
Abstract: An essential characteristic of marketing practice and theory is the promotion of exchanges, many of which are funded by money. Marketing literature thus places great emphasis on determining what factors influence consumers to engage in the marketplace. Less understood, however, is how consumers allocate monetary resources to fund exchanges. Scholars have demonstrated that people employ earmarks to segregate money by source, meaning, or purpose. The ethnographic study of provisioning in the current research adds to prior scholarship with an explanation of how money, as a fungible resource, is transformed into moral and social resources by the behavioral process of ascribing earmarks and approaching provisioning. As part of this study, the author develops a typology that incorporates thrift provisioning and splurge provisioning approaches to categorize consumer goals derived from the use of prosaic and indexical earmarks. These goals are defined as economizing, sustaining, treating, and rewarding. The article closes with a discussion of implications for marketing managers and potential avenues for further research.

Title: The Influence of Initial Possession Level on Consumers' Adoption of a Collection Goal: A Tipping Point Effect

Author-Name: Itamar Simonson
Abstract: Previous research has typically treated collection as a top-down process and focused on its later stages. However, collections may start by accident and are often triggered by incidental, bottom-up factors. The authors propose that a small number of possessions (i.e., a few more than one) represent an unjustified and, thus, unstable possession level that prompts a status change. They examine the collection tipping point at which obtaining items belonging to a series (e.g., a couple of collectible Coke cans) often gives rise to a decision to start a collection. Consumers then seek additional items to fulfill their emerging goal. In six lab studies and one field study, the authors investigate the tipping point at which a collection “project” begins and explore the psychological processes underlying that tipping point. In addition, they discuss the theoretical and managerial implications of this research.

Title: Marketing Communication Strategies and Consumer Financial Decision Making: The Role of National Culture
Author-Name: J. Andrew Petersen
Author-Name: Tarun Kushwaha
Author-Name: V. Kumar
Abstract: Consumers frequently make important financial decisions that have short- and long-term impacts on their welfare. The authors expect that these financial decisions are a function of consumers' past experiences and interactions with a financial services firm as well as consumers' long-term priorities (e.g., national culture). They determine how three cultural dimensions (long-term orientation, uncertainty avoidance, and masculinity) and marketing communication type (promotion focused vs. prevention focused) affect three key consumer financial decisions: (1) savings rate, (2) use of credit, and (3) spending pattern. To do so, they empirically test both the direct effect of national culture on consumer financial decision making and its moderating effect on the link between a firm's marketing efforts and consumer financial decision making. Drawing on regulatory focus theory, the authors develop and empirically test their hypotheses using a customer database from a multinational financial services firm based in the United Arab Emirates, with customers originating from 34 countries. They find that national culture directly affects consumer financial decision making and moderates the impact of marketing efforts by the financial services firm, which suggests that financial services firms should account for national culture when managing customers.

Title: The Timing of Codevelopment Alliances in New Product Development Processes: Returns for Upstream and Downstream Partners
Author-Name: Eric (Er) Fang

Author-Name: Zhi Yang
Abstract: Upstream biotech firms (i.e., upstream partners) and downstream pharmaceutical firms (i.e., downstream partners) often form alliances to cope with performance uncertainty and to exploit product specificity in new product development. Although the performance implications of such alliances have been investigated, research has not offered insight into how the timing of such codevelopment alliances influences partner returns. The authors develop and test predictions that timing changes the costs and benefits accruing to upstream and downstream partners and that the effect of timing is influenced by a set of alliance, firm, and market conditions. An event study of 276 codevelopment agreements between biotech and pharmaceutical firms during 1998–2010 reveals that alliance governance structure, partner technological capability, and the competitiveness of market environments change the abnormal returns achieved by partners entering these relationships in important ways.

Title: The Importance of Starting Right: The Influence of Accurate Intuition on Performance in Salesperson–Customer Interactions
Author-Name: Zachary R. Hall
Author-Name: Michael Ahearne
Author-Name: Harish Sujan
Abstract: Salespeople make two types of judgments about customers in face-to-face interactions: those that are more intuitive and those that are more deliberative. The authors evaluate the influence of accurate intuitive and deliberative judgments on the performance of salespeople. To evaluate this influence, the authors employ matched survey, observational, and objective field data obtained before, during, and after salesperson–customer interactions. The results reveal that accurate intuitive judgments improve selling performance by enabling more appropriate initial sales strategies. These judgments not only help increase the effectiveness of salespeople's selling efforts but also reduce the amount of selling time, resulting in improved selling efficiency. However, performance is compromised when inaccurate deliberative judgments follow accurate intuitive judgments. The findings also identify different antecedents to judgment accuracy. Intuitive accuracy is influenced by domain-specific experience, similarity to the customer, and empathy for the customer, whereas listening skills and customer orientation influence deliberative accuracy.

Title: Footprints in the Sands of Time: A Comparative Analysis of the Effectiveness of Customer Satisfaction and Customer–Company Identification over Time
Author-Name: Till Haumann

Author-Name: Mario Rese
Abstract: Previous research has identified customer satisfaction and customer–company identification as two of the most important concepts in relationship marketing. Yet despite their proclaimed importance, research on their long-term effectiveness is surprisingly scarce. Furthermore, comparative research acknowledging the concepts' different theoretical roots and illuminating the differences in their long-term effectiveness is lacking. In addition, little is known about how competitive actions affect the long-term effectiveness of both concepts. This study makes a first attempt to address these research gaps and offers a comparative analysis of the effectiveness of customer satisfaction and customer–company identification in driving important customer outcomes over time. Latent growth analyses of rich longitudinal data from customers over nine measurement points spanning 43 weeks (n = 6,930) show that customer satisfaction and customer–company identification have positive initial effects on customers' loyalty and willingness to pay but differ in their ability to maintain these positive effects over time. Whereas the positive effects of customer satisfaction decrease more rapidly, the effects of customer–company identification are significantly more persistent. Analysis of the moderating effects of relative competitive advertising suggests that customer–company identification is more effective at immunizing customers against competitive actions.

Abstract: Manufacturers and online retailers are readily availing themselves of new technologies to present their merchandise using a variety of formats, including static (still image) and dynamic (video) portrayal. Building on vividness theory, the authors propose and demonstrate that presenting products and services using a dynamic visual format enhances consumer preference for hedonic options and willingness to pay for those options. The dynamic presentation format increases involvement with the product/service experience in a manner presumably similar to that of the actual product experience. The result is an increased preference for and valuation of hedonic options. This holds true for experiential and search products in single and joint evaluations and carries over to subsequent choices. Across all studies, the results demonstrate that a dynamic (relative to static) presentation format enhances choice of the hedonically superior (vs. utilitarian-superior) option by more than 79%.

Abstract: This study empirically investigates marketing department power in U.S. firms throughout 1993–2008 and assesses its impact on firm performance. Using a new objective measure of marketing department power and a cross-industry sample of 612 public firms in the United States, the results reveal that, in general, marketing department power increased during this time period. Furthermore, the analyses show that a powerful marketing department enhances firms' longer-term future total shareholder returns beyond its positive effect on firms' short-term return on assets (ROA). The findings also reveal that a firm's long-run market-based-asset-building and short-run market-based- asset-leveraging capabilities partially mediate the effect of a firm's marketing department power on its longer-term shareholder value performance and fully mediate the effect on its short-term ROA performance. This research provides new insights for marketing scholars and managers with regard to both marketing's influence within the firm and how investments in building a powerful marketing department affect firm performance.

Title: Bringing “Place” Back In: Regional Clusters, Project Governance, and New Product Outcomes
Author-Name: Paul Tracey
Author-Name: Jan B. Heide
Author-Name: Simon J. Bell
Abstract: The authors examine new product outcomes in the context of regional clusters. On the basis of prior research on marketing relationships, clusters, and social networks, they propose that the overall configuration of a cluster helps promote particular governance practices among its members. These practices have distinct value-creating properties, and when they are brought to bear on a specific new product development project within a cluster, they promote performance outcomes such as product novelty and speed to market. Ultimately, these performance effects are reinforced by the configuration of the cluster itself. In general, the authors propose that new product outcomes result from complex interactions between a cluster's macro-level configuration and its micro-level governance processes. More broadly, their framework points to the importance of geographical variables and to the role of “place” in marketing decision making.

Title: Cause Marketing Effectiveness and the Moderating Role of Price Discounts

Abstract: Can cause marketing (CM) be effective? If so, do price discounts moderate CM effectiveness? Despite the prevalence of linking product sales with donations to charity, field evidence of CM effectiveness is lacking. This is of particular concern for managers who wonder whether the findings of laboratory experiments extend to actual consumer purchases. Using large-scale randomized field experiments with more than 17,000 consumers, this research documents that CM can significantly increase consumer purchases. Notably, the answer to the second question is more complicated. Under the moderating role of price discounts, the impact of CM on sales purchases may follow an inverted U-shaped relationship—that is, strongest when price discounts are moderate rather than deep or absent. Follow-up lab experiments reveal that consumers' warm-glow good feelings from CM represent the underlying process. These findings provide novel insights into the boundary conditions and mechanisms of the sales impact of CM for researchers and managers alike.

Title: The Handmade Effect: What's Love Got to Do with It?

Abstract: Despite the popularity and high quality of machine-made products, handmade products have not disappeared, even in product categories in which machinal production is common. The authors present the first systematic set of studies exploring whether and how stated production mode (handmade vs. machine-made) affects product attractiveness. Four studies provide evidence for the existence of a positive handmade effect on product attractiveness. This effect is, to an important extent, driven by perceptions that handmade products symbolically “contain love.” The authors validate this love account by controlling for alternative value drivers of handmade production (effort, product quality, uniqueness, authenticity, and pride). The handmade effect is moderated by two factors that affect the value of love. Specifically, consumers indicate stronger purchase intentions for handmade than machine-made products when buying gifts for their loved ones but not for more distant gift recipients, and they pay more for handmade gifts when purchased to convey love than simply to acquire the best-performing product.

Title: The Effectiveness of Customer Participation in New Product Development: A Meta-Analysis
Author-Name: Woojung Chang
Author-Name: Steven A. Taylor
Abstract: Although the returns of customer participation on new product development (NPD) performance can vary substantially, the current literature lacks a systematic conceptual and empirical integration showing when customer participation is valuable in enhancing NPD performance. Building on knowledge management theory, the authors present a conceptual framework that synthesizes a variety of contingency factors. A meta-analysis empirically examines the moderating effects of contextual factors between customer participation and NPD performance. The analysis reveals that involving customers in the ideation and launch stages of NPD improves new product financial performance directly as well as indirectly through acceleration of time to market, whereas customer participation in the development phase slows down time to market, deteriorating new product financial performance. Furthermore, the benefits of customer participation on NPD performance are greater in technologically turbulent NPD projects, in emerging countries, in low-tech industries, for business customers, and for small firms. The authors discuss several theoretical and managerial implications about when to engage customers in the innovation process.

Title: Should Firms Use Small Financial Benefits to Express Appreciation to Consumers? Understanding and Avoiding Trivialization Effects
Author-Name: Peggy J. Liu

Author-Name: Kelly L. Haws
Abstract: Firms commonly add small financial benefits to communications designed to acknowledge consumers' loyalty or support. Yet is it always better to provide some financial benefit as opposed to simply saying “thank you”? Although this question has important implications for customer relationship management, research has not yet provided an answer. This article demonstrates that, indeed, a financial acknowledgment (defined as an acknowledgment with a monetary benefit) can lead to less positive outcomes than offering a verbal acknowledgment (defined as an acknowledgment without a monetary benefit), a phenomenon termed the “trivialization effect.” The results explain this effect in terms of shifting evaluation standards: whereas a verbal acknowledgement is evaluated relative to verbal gratitude expression norms, a financial acknowledgment is evaluated relative to both verbal norms and customers' monetary expectations. The authors also demonstrate two practical, theory-consistent ways firms can structure financial acknowledgments to eliminate the trivialization effect. Thus, this research shows both the peril of small financial benefits as a means of expressing customer appreciation and practical, low-cost ways to salvage their potential.

Title: Harmful Upward Line Extensions: Can the Launch of Premium Products Result in Competitive Disadvantages?
Author-Name: Fabio Caldieraro
Author-Name: Ling-Jing Kao
Author-Name: Marcus Cunha Jr.
Abstract: Companies often extend product lines with the goal of increasing demand for their products and responding to competitive threats. Although line extensions may lead to cannibalization and reduction of overall profit, the bulk of theoretical and empirical research has suggested that product line extensions result in a net gain of overall demand and market share. To mitigate cannibalization, the extant literature prescribes the addition of premium versions of products, or “upward line extensions,” with the intention of achieving gains not only in demand and market share but also in overall profit. In this research, the authors employ analytical and empirical methods to make the case that upward line extensions aimed at matching a competing product’s attribute may lead consumers to reassess their perceptions about the brand and the attributes of products in the market in a way that erodes the advantages of the extending firm. Ultimately, this can result in a loss of demand, market share, and profit for the extending firm.

Title: Regaining “Lost” Customers: The Predictive Power of First-Lifetime Behavior, the Reason for Defection, and the Nature of the Win-Back Offer
Author-Name: V. Kumar
Author-Name: Yashoda Bhagwat
Author-Name: Xi (Alan) Zhang
Abstract: Service firms, which have high attrition rates, are finding it exceedingly difficult to grow their customer base. Despite their extensive retention efforts, customers still defect. For these firms, “lost” customers may pose a rewarding “last-resort” opportunity. Reacquiring customers who left the firm may help these firms not only regain their lost profits but also usurp profits from competitors. However, some pertinent questions remain as to whether lost customers are worth the investment in reacquisition and whether they will remain profitable if reacquired. This is the first study to empirically demonstrate how (1) the lost customers' first-lifetime experiences and behaviors, (2) the reason for defection, and (3) the nature of the win-back offer made to lost customers are all related to the likelihood of their reacquisition, their second-lifetime duration, and their second-lifetime profitability per month. The study shows that the stronger the first-lifetime relationship with the firm, the more likely a customer is to accept the win-back offer. This study also presents relevant implications for managers interested in identifying new avenues for growth through effective resource allocation on the reacquisition and management of lost customers. Finally, the authors outline if and when managers should choose between maximizing reacquisition and profitability.

Title: Organizational Multichannel Differentiation: An Analysis of Its Impact on Channel Relationships and Company Sales Success
Author-Name: Andreas Fürst
Author-Name: Martin Leimbach
Author-Name: Jana-Kristin Prigge
Abstract: This article examines whether and how a company’s division of segment- and task-related responsibilities among multiple sales channels affects the relationships in the multichannel (MC) system and, ultimately, the company’s sales success. Building on open systems theory, the authors develop an overarching framework of organizational MC differentiation that distinguishes between two generic approaches: segment differentiation and task differentiation. They predict that these two approaches affect key relationship and performance outcomes of an MC system, but do so differently and contingent on key characteristics of the company’s customers. Drawing on a multi-informant survey in a business-to-business context as well as on objective performance data, the authors find that segment differentiation tends to mitigate horizontal conflict and inhibit cooperation, while task differentiation reduces primarily vertical conflict and promotes cooperation. Moreover, depending on customer characteristics, segment differentiation may damage channel relationships overall and, in turn, limit company sales success, whereas task differentiation unambiguously promotes channel relationships and thus drives company sales success. These findings offer novel insights into the relationship and performance impact of MC systems’ organizational structure and provide useful guidance on how managers should allocate segment- and task-related responsibilities among multiple sales channels.

Title: Product Concept Demonstrations in Trade Shows and Firm Value
Author-Name: Taewan Kim
Author-Name: Tridib Mazumdar
Abstract: Trade shows are a popular venue for firms to demonstrate their portfolio of market-ready new products as well as product concepts under different stages of development. Utilizing auto shows as a context, the authors investigate the effects of concept and product demonstrations on the demonstrating firm’s value. Event study results show that abnormal returns follow an inverted U-shaped effect of product development stages: that is, previously demonstrated concepts approaching potential launch have the strongest positive effect, followed by early-stage concepts demonstrated for the first time to the world (i.e., debuts), and then market-ready new products. Trade show locations mediate these effects. The effects of early-stage debut demonstrations appear only when concepts are presented in trade shows located in the home country of the demonstrating firm. However, the effects of displaying previously demonstrated concepts, which have survived product development hurdles, are present in venues within as well as outside the firm’s home country.

Title: A Meta-Analysis of Electronic Word-of-Mouth Elasticity
Author-Name: Ya You

Abstract: The authors conduct a meta-analysis on the effect of electronic word of mouth on sales by examining 51 studies (involving 339 volume and 271 valence elasticities) and primary data collected on product characteristics (durability, trialability, and usage condition), industry characteristics (industry growth and competition), and platform characteristics (expertise and trustworthiness). Their analysis reveals that electronic word-of-mouth volume (valence) elasticity is .236 (.417). More importantly, the findings show that volume and valence elasticities are higher for privately consumed, low-trialability products that operate in less competitive industries and whose reviews are carried on independent review sites. Furthermore, volume elasticities are higher for durable goods and for reviews on specialized review sites, whereas valence elasticities are greater for community-based sites. Drawing on the results, they discuss several implications for managers and researchers and explain why valence elasticities are often found to be insignificant. Finally, they propose numerous directions for future research in the area on the basis of their findings.

Title: Does the Customer Matter Most? Exploring Strategic Frontline Employees’ Influence of Customers, the Internal Business Team, and External Business Partners
Author-Name: Christopher R. Plouffe

Author-Name: Joseph A. Cote
Author-Name: Bryan Hochstein
Abstract: Marketing relationships have evolved from simple dyadic transactions between the firm and its customers into scenarios in which the firm’s frontline employees are required to manage a portfolio of stakeholder relationships. The authors begin by characterizing the “strategic” frontline employee (SFLE) as a focal marketing employee who, in the execution of his or her work, must influence a variety of stakeholder target groups, including (1) customers, (2) the internal business team, and (3) external business partners. The authors leverage data from SFLEs at two firms to explore the similarities and differences in SFLE influence tactic effectiveness across the three stakeholder groups. They find that the effectiveness of influence tactics in driving performance differs across stakeholder target types and, somewhat surprisingly, that the SFLE’s influence of both the internal business team and external business partners has a greater effect on his or her performance than does influence directed at customers. The authors close with a discussion of the implications for theory and practice.

Abstract: Product design is a source of competitive advantage for companies and is an important driver of company performance. Drawing on an extensive literature review and consumer interviews, the authors define product design and its dimensions. Using data from three samples (6,418 U.S. consumers and 1,083 and 583 European consumers), the authors develop and validate a new scale to measure product design along the dimensions of aesthetics, functionality, and symbolism. In addition, they investigate the impact of these design dimensions on purchase intention, word of mouth, and willingness to pay. The results indicate that the design dimensions positively influence willingness to pay and also have a positive effect on purchase intention and word of mouth, both directly and indirectly through brand attitude.

Title: United We Stand: The Impact of Buying Groups on Retailer Productivity
Author-Name: Inge Geyskens

Abstract: In diverse industries, from grocery retailing to health care, retailers join buying groups to achieve better terms with suppliers. The authors track the buying group membership of Europe's largest grocery retailers over a 15-year period and evaluate why some buying groups are better than others in increasing retailer performance and why different members belonging to the same group do not always benefit equally from their membership. They find that, on average, buying groups indeed generate scale advantages for their members: group scale increases group members' productivity and sales and decreases their cost of goods sold. Still, bigger is not always better. Retailers benefit less from buying group scale when the group is more heterogeneous in terms of member size and when it extends its scope across too many markets. Moreover, the smaller a member is within the group and the more it overlaps with fellow members, the less it benefits.

Title: Relating Online, Regional, and National Advertising to Firm Value

Author-Name: Rajdeep Grewal
Abstract: Firms spend billions of dollars on advertising every year but remain uncertain about allocation across various advertising vehicles. Allocation decisions are even more complex as online advertising has proliferated and consumers’ media usage patterns have become more fragmented. To determine advertising effectiveness, the authors group firms’ advertising vehicle choices into three theoretically grounded and empirically verified smaller subsets: national, regional, and online advertising. Subsequently, they assess how the three advertising vehicles independently and jointly affect firm performance. Using 12 years of data covering 662 manufacturing firms, the authors find that while national, regional, and online advertising each have a positive and significant main effect on firm performance, each advertising vehicle weakens the effectiveness of the respective other two advertising vehicles (e.g., a 1% increase in online advertising increases firm performance by .32% but also decreases national [.15%] and regional [.03%] advertising effectiveness). A battery of robustness checks triangulates this result. Although all three media vehicles contribute to net increases in performance, the authors discuss the need to strategically integrate them to maximize combined effectiveness.

Title: The Chief Marketing Officer Matters!
Author-Name: Frank Germann
Author-Name: Peter Ebbes
Author-Name: Rajdeep Grewal
Abstract: Marketing academics and practitioners alike remain unconvinced about the chief marketing officer's (CMO's) performance implications. Whereas some studies propose that firms benefit financially from having a CMO in the C-suite, other studies conclude that the CMO has little or no effect on firm performance. Accordingly, there have been strong calls for additional academic research regarding the CMO's performance implications. In response to these calls, the authors employ model specifications with varying identifying assumptions (i.e., rich data models, unobserved effects models, instrumental variable models, and panel internal instruments models) and use data from up to 155 publicly traded firms over a 12-year period (2000–2011) to find that firms can indeed expect to benefit financially from having a CMO at the strategy table. Specifically, their findings suggest that the performance (measured in terms of Tobin's q) of the sample firms that employ a CMO is, on average, approximately 15% greater than that of the sample firms that do not employ a CMO. This result is robust to the type of model specification used. Marketing academics and practitioners should find the results intriguing given the existing uncertainty surrounding the CMO's performance implications. The study also contributes to the methodology literature by collating diverse empirical model specifications that can be used to model causal effects with observational data into a coherent and comprehensive framework.

Abstract: Given the unprecedented reach of social media, firms are increasingly relying on it as a channel for marketing communication. The objective of this study is to examine the effect of firm-generated content (FGC) in social media on three key customer metrics: spending, cross-buying, and customer profitability. The authors further investigate the synergistic effects of FGC with television advertising and e-mail communication. To accomplish their objectives, the authors assemble a novel data set comprising customers’ social media participation data, transaction data, and attitudinal data obtained through surveys. The results indicate that after the authors account for the effects of television advertising and e-mail marketing, FGC has a positive and significant effect on customers’ behavior. The authors show that FGC works synergistically with both television advertising and e-mail marketing and also find that the effect of FGC is greater for more experienced, tech-savvy, and social media–prone customers. They propose and examine the effect of three characteristics of FGC: valence, receptivity, and customer susceptibility. The authors find that whereas all three components of FGC have a positive impact, the effect of FGC receptivity is the largest. The study offers critical managerial insights regarding how to leverage social media for better returns.

Title: Should Ad Spending Increase or Decrease Before a Recall Announcement? The Marketing–Finance Interface in Product-Harm Crisis Management
Author-Name: Haibing Gao

Author-Name: Qi Wang
Author-Name: Kenneth C. Wilbur
Abstract: Product recalls tend to damage the stock price of the recalling firm. This article proposes and empirically demonstrates that adjustments to prerecall advertising spending can be used as a tool to moderate this financial damage. Using data on automobile recalls and detailed advertising expenditures from 2005 to 2012, the authors show that adjustments to a firm's prerecall advertising expenditure can either mitigate or amplify the negative effect of the recall on stock market value, depending on the direction of advertising adjustment and the recall characteristics. Boosting ad spending before a recall announcement softens the stock price loss when the recall involves a newly introduced product with a minor hazard but sharpens the loss when the recalled product is an established model with a major hazard. Cutting prerecall advertising worsens the stock price loss when the recall involves a new product, regardless of the hazard. This research also reveals that in product-harm crisis management, profit maximization and shareholder value maximization can conflict with each other, underscoring the importance of developing an integrated crisis management strategy.

Title: How Kinetic Property Shapes Novelty Perceptions
Author-Name: Junghan Kim
Author-Name: Arun Lakshmanan
Abstract: This article demonstrates a new substantive finding: that kinetic property in advertising, defined as direction changes in the paths of moving on-screen ad elements, enhances consumer judgments of product novelty. Across six studies, the authors first outline an inference-based theory as to why the novelty-enhancing effect of kinetic property manifests: kinetic property generates impressions of how visually lively an ad is, which leads to inferences of product atypicality and, consequently, higher novelty judgments. Second, they demonstrate boundary conditions by showing that (1) the positive effect for kinetic property is evident with incremental (and not radical) innovations, (2) the effect dissipates when figure-ground contrast in the ad makes kinetic property less discriminable, (3) contextual adaptation to kinetic property can mitigate this effect, and (4) kinetic property enhances novelty judgments primarily when product category characteristics such as perceived market dynamism match with kinetic property–based executions. The authors offer substantive implications for firms marketing new products as well as for multimedia advertising.

Title: Have We Progressed Marketing Knowledge? A Meta-Meta-Analysis of Effect Sizes in Marketing Research
Author-Name: Martin Eisend
Abstract: This study measures the value and progress of knowledge produced in marketing research by using meta-analytic effect sizes as a measure of scientific knowledge. The author combines the results of 176 meta-analyses that include data from more than 7,500 primary studies published between 1918 and 2012. The 1,841 meta-analytic effect sizes show that a considerable body of marketing knowledge has been developed, as expressed by a meta-meta-analytic correlation of .24. This medium-sized effect is as strong or stronger than effects that have been found in compilations of meta-analyses in other, more basic fields of inquiry (e.g., psychology), which shows that marketing is a successful academic discipline. The effect sizes vary across subject areas, with pricing showing the strongest effects, followed by consumer behavior; methods and new product development show the weakest effects. This finding reveals different degrees of knowledge production and varying benchmarks to assess the contribution of future research outcomes in these subject areas. Marketing knowledge follows a discontinuous model of progress: knowledge has increased over time, but at a decreasing rate; the marketing field, which is currently characterized by fragmentation and specialization, has reached a stage of maturity. The findings provide implications for further research regarding how to measure, evaluate, and progress knowledge in marketing.

Title: New Product Creativity: Understanding Contract Specificity in New Product Introductions
Author-Name: Tereza Dean
Author-Name: David A. Griffith
Author-Name: Roger J. Calantone
Abstract: Introducing new products necessitates that manufacturers not only carefully craft the initial contract terms with retailers but also consider how the specificity of the terms influences a retailer’s relational behaviors throughout the duration of the contract, contingent upon the new product’s success. The authors develop a series of hypotheses to investigate new product introductions using a multimethod design consisting of a survey of manufacturers and a repeated measures experiment with retailers. The results indicate that manufacturers craft increasingly specific contract terms as new product creativity increases when frequency of new product introductions and performance ambiguity are higher. When they are lower, the positive influence of new product creativity on contract specificity weakens and can in some instances become negative. The results also indicate that there is no significant change in a retailer’s relational behaviors throughout a contract’s duration when contract specificity is lower, regardless of the new product’s success. However, under the condition of higher contract specificity, the retailer’s relational behaviors increase (decrease) over a contract’s duration when the new product is successful (unsuccessful).

Title: Developing Donor Relationships: The Role of the Breadth of Giving
Author-Name: Farnoosh Khodakarami

Author-Name: Rajkumar Venkatesan
Abstract: This research proposes a mechanism to develop long-term donor relationships, a major challenge in the nonprofit industry. The authors propose a metric, donation variety, which captures a donor’s breadth of donations with a given nonprofit organization, controlling for the distribution of donations to different initiatives. Using donation data spanning 20 years from a major U.S. public university, the authors find that improvements in donation variety increase the likelihood that the donor will make a subsequent donation, increase the donation amount, and reduce the sensitivity of donations to negative macroeconomic shocks. In the acquisition phase, most donors give to a single initiative, and these decisions are more influenced by a donor’s intrinsic motivations. In contrast, as the donor–nonprofit organization relationship develops over time, nonprofit marketing efforts have a more significant influence on a donor’s decision to give to multiple initiatives. Finally, the authors conduct a field study that validates the econometric analysis and provides causal evidence that marketing efforts by nonprofit organizations can encourage donors to spread donations across multiple initiatives.

Title: Engaging Customers in Coproduction Processes: How Value-Enhancing and Intensity-Reducing Communication Strategies Mitigate the Negative Effects of Coproduction Intensity

Author-Name: Jan Wieseke
Abstract: Coproduction offerings, in which customers engage in the production of goods and services, are ubiquitous (e.g., ready-to-assemble products, self-service technologies). However, although previous research has predominantly identified beneficial aspects of coproduction in contrast to traditional firm production, the pivotal role of coproduction intensity within coproduction processes has largely been neglected. Furthermore, little is known about strategies that firms can employ to positively influence customers’ perceptions of coproduction processes. Drawing on a large field experiment with 803 customers engaging in actual coproduction processes, the current study makes a first attempt to address these research voids. The results show that coproduction intensity negatively affects customers’ satisfaction with the coproduction process. Furthermore, the study offers first insights into how firms can mitigate these negative effects by employing corporate communication strategies that either emphasize specific coproduction value propositions (value-enhancing communication strategies) or highlight additional coproduction service supplements (intensity-reducing communication strategies).

Title: What Drives a Firm’s Choice of Product Recall Remedy? The Impact of Remedy Cost, Product Hazard, and the CEO
Author-Name: Angela Xia Liu
Author-Name: Yong Liu
Author-Name: Ting Luo
Abstract: When product recalls occur, companies provide corrective or compensation measures to consumers for the defective products they have purchased. These remedies directly affect consumers and the effectiveness of recall. This article examines the determinants of remedy choices with a theoretical framework rooted in the basic trade-off between remedy cost and consumer harm. In addition to recall and company characteristics, the authors also consider the impact of the CEO’s personal incentives. Using recalls issued by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, the authors find that companies prefer to avoid full remedy when remedy cost is high, yet they are more likely to provide full remedy for more severe product hazards. The results show that CEOs’ personal interests interfere with remedy decisions: full remedy is less likely when the CEO receives greater cash compensation or less equity incentive, and when the CEO has longer tenure in the position. Importantly, the CEO’s financial interests further moderate the effects of remedy cost and consumer harm. The findings have important implications for recall strategy, consumer welfare, public policy, and leadership ethics.

Title: Warm Glow or Extra Charge? The Ambivalent Effect of Corporate Social Responsibility Activities on Customers’ Perceived Price Fairness
Author-Name: Johannes Habel
Author-Name: Laura Marie Schons
Author-Name: Sascha Alavi
Author-Name: Jan Wieseke
Abstract: Prior research has firmly established that consumers draw benefits from a firm’s engagement in corporate social responsibility (CSR), especially the feeling of a “warm glow.” These benefits positively affect several desirable outcomes, such as willingness to pay and customer loyalty. The authors propose that consumers do not blindly perceive benefits from a firm’s CSR engagement but tend to suspect that a firm’s prices include a markup to finance the CSR engagement. Taking customers’ benefit perceptions and price markup inferences into account, the authors suggest that CSR engagement has mixed effects on consumers’ evaluation of price fairness and, thus, on subsequent outcomes such as customer loyalty. The authors conduct one qualitative study and four quantitative studies leveraging longitudinal field and experimental data from more than 4,000 customers and show that customers indeed infer CSR price markups, entailing mixed effects of firms’ CSR engagement on price fairness. The authors find that perception critically depends on customers’ CSR attributions, and they explore the underlying psychological mechanisms. They propose communication strategies to optimize the effect of CSR engagement on perceived price fairness.

Title: Motivating Sales Reps for Innovation Selling in Different Cultures
Author-Name: Sebastian Hohenberg
Author-Name: Christian Homburg
Abstract: Innovation commercialization, an important managerial challenge, depends heavily on the sales force for its success. However, little empirical research has examined how firms should direct sales reps in this task in a global, multicultural context. Drawing on self-determination theory, this study investigates how to motivate sales reps for innovation selling in different cultures with various financial and nonfinancial steering instruments. The authors collected data in two waves from sales reps in 38 countries on four continents, making this study one of the largest international investigations in sales research. Results reveal that steering instruments should correspond closely with reps’ national culture in terms of power distance, individualism, uncertainty avoidance, and long-term orientation. For example, findings show that whereas individualism strengthens the positive relationship between variable compensation for innovation-sales results and financial innovation performance through innovation-selling motivation, power distance and uncertainty avoidance weaken this relationship. Results also reveal that long-term orientation strengthens the positive relationship between supervisor appreciation for innovation-sales results and financial innovation performance through innovation-selling motivation.

Abstract: Although the study of salesperson performance traditionally has focused on salespeople’s activities and relationships with customers, scholars recently have proposed that salespeople’s intraorganizational relationships and activities also play a vital role in driving sales performance. Using data from 286 salespeople in a unique social network analysis, the authors explore the effects of salespeople’s intraorganizational relationships on objective salesperson performance as well as the role of political skill in developing intraorganizational relationships. The results indicate that two types of social network characteristics (i.e., relational centrality and positional centrality) contribute substantially to salesperson performance. Moreover, salespeople’s political skill is shown to be an antecedent to relational centrality but, surprisingly, not positional centrality. This finding demonstrates that researchers should not assume that all centralities represent similar underlying network characteristics. In light of these results, the authors discuss several implications for both managers and researchers as well as directions for further research.

Title: Adjusting the Warm-Glow Thermostat: How Incentivizing Participation in Voluntary Green Programs Moderates Their Impact on Service Satisfaction
Author-Name: Michael Giebelhausen
Author-Name: HaeEun Helen Chun
Author-Name: J. Joseph Cronin Jr.
Author-Name: G. Tomas M. Hult
Abstract: In Study 1, the authors find that people are more satisfied with a service experience when they choose to participate in the provider’s voluntary green program (e.g., recycling)—an effect mediated by the “warm glow” of participation. The downside, however, is that this same mechanism decreases satisfaction among people who choose not to participate. In Study 2, analysis of data from the J.D. Power Guest Satisfaction Index suggests that incentivizing the program (i.e., compensating the program participants) paradoxically increases satisfaction for those who do not participate but decreases satisfaction among those who do. Studies 3 and 4 explore how manipulating incentive characteristics might enable managers to maximize satisfaction for both groups. Study 3 indicates that, compared with no incentive, an “other-benefiting” incentive increases warm glow and satisfaction for green program participants but decreases them among nonparticipants. Study 4, however, suggests that mixed incentive bundles (i.e., providing both self-benefiting and other-benefiting options) maximize warm glow and satisfaction for both groups—the ideal outcome for managers.

Title: When Hostile Consumers Wreak Havoc on Your Brand: The Phenomenon of Consumer Brand Sabotage
Author-Name: Andrea Kähr

Author-Name: Wayne D. Hoyer
Abstract: In recent years, companies have been confronted with a new type of negative consumer behavior: consumers who have turned hostile and who are strongly determined to cause damage to the brand. Empowered by new technological possibilities, an individual consumer can now wreak havoc on a brand with relatively little effort. In reflection of this new phenomenon, the authors introduce the concept of consumer brand sabotage (CBS). On the basis of different underlying motives, a conceptual framework distinguishes CBS (a form of hostile aggression: harming the brand as dominant motive) from other forms of negative consumer behavior, such as customer retaliation and negative word of mouth (instrumental aggression: harming a brand is only a means to achieve other objectives, e.g., restoring equity). This framework adapts insights from aggression and appraisal theories as well as qualitative interviews with actual saboteurs to a consumer–brand relationship context in order to develop an improved theoretical understanding of the under-researched phenomenon of CBS. The authors analyze the mental escalation processes of individual consumers toward CBS and develop a road map for future research.

Abstract: Despite the positive societal implications of corporate social responsibility (CSR), there remains an extensive debate regarding its consequences for firm shareholders. This study posits that marketing capability plays a complementary role in the CSR–shareholder wealth relationship. It further argues that the influence of marketing capability will be higher for CSR types with verifiable benefits to firm stakeholders (i.e., consumers, employees, channel partners, and regulators). An analysis utilizing secondary information for a large sample of 1,725 firms for the years 2000–2009 indicates that the effects of overall CSR efforts on stock returns and idiosyncratic risk are not significant on their own but only become so in the presence of marketing capability. Furthermore, the results reveal that although marketing capability has positive interaction effects with verifiable CSR efforts—environment (e.g., using clean energy), products (e.g., providing to economically disadvantaged), diversity (e.g., pursuing diversity in top management), corporate governance (e.g., limiting board compensation), and employees (e.g., supporting unions)—on stock returns (and negative interaction effects with these CSR efforts on idiosyncratic risk), it has no significant interaction effect with community-based efforts (e.g., charitable giving).

Title: Understanding Value-Added Resellers’ Assortments of Multicomponent Systems
Author-Name: Sourav Ray

Author-Name: George John
Abstract: Interconnect standards increase choices. For example, in cardiac pacemakers, the IS-1 standard enables the “pulse generator” from 6 manufacturers to be combined with the “lead set” from the other 5 to create up to 30 additional mixed-brand pacemakers. However, observed assortment additions are much smaller, which is puzzling because manufacturers in extant models have welcomed such additions to reduce price competition and increase variety. Instead, conflict with the value-added resellers that create and carry these additions is commonplace. The authors extend the literature with an analytical model showing that value-added resellers limit the number and composition of additions to gain better upstream terms. This conflict is exacerbated when “keystone” components are relatively more decisive in influencing customer choices, so their exclusion from an addition represents a larger loss. The empirical study of the multibillion-dollar auto paint refinish market finds assortment additions consistent with the authors’ predictions. The article concludes with a discussion of the role of channel support programs in ameliorating these conflicts.

Title: Brand Buzz in the Echoverse
Author-Name: Kelly Hewett

Author-Name: Harald J. van Heerde
Abstract: Social media sites have created a reverberating “echoverse” for brand communication, forming complex feedback loops (“echoes”) between the “universe” of corporate communications, news media, and user-generated social media. To understand these feedback loops, the authors process longitudinal, unstructured data using computational linguistics techniques and analyze them using econometric methods. By assembling one of the most comprehensive data sets in the brand communications literature with corporate communications, news stories, social media, and business outcomes, the authors document the echoverse (i.e., feedback loops between all of these sources). Furthermore, the echoverse has changed as online word of mouth has become prevalent. Over time, online word of mouth has fallen into a negativity spiral, with negative messages leading to greater volume, and firms are adjusting their communications strategies in response. The nature of brand communications has been transformed by online technology as corporate communications move increasingly from one to many (e.g., advertising) to one to one (e.g., Twitter) while consumer word of mouth moves from one to one (e.g., conversations) to one to many (e.g., social media). The results indicate that companies benefit from using social media (e.g., Twitter) for personalized customer responses, although there is still a role for traditional brand communications (e.g., press releases, advertising). The evolving echoverse requires managers to rethink brand communication strategies, with online communications becoming increasingly central.

Title: Designed to Succeed: Dimensions of Product Design and Their Impact on Market Share

Abstract: This research examines the relationship between product design and market share, a topic of considerable significance that has not been addressed in the published literature. Drawing from diverse disciplines such as marketing, industrial design, and engineering, the authors conceptualize design as being composed of three distinct product-level dimensions: function, form, and ergonomics. Furthermore, the authors examine the interplay among these design dimensions and their impact on the market share of a product. Empirical results using integrated repeated cross-sectional data obtained from several different sources in the U.S. light vehicle industry reveal an important strategic trade-off concerning design capabilities. Firms can either “design for satisfaction,” by investing in both function and ergonomics, or “design for delight,” by investing in form design capabilities so as to reap share rewards. The authors also show that older-generation vehicles with superior form designs do much better in terms of share than corresponding older vehicles with higher levels of either function or ergonomics. Implications of these results for academic researchers and managers are discussed.

Title: The Perils of Category Management: The Effect of Product Assortment on Multicategory Purchase Incidence
Author-Name: Sungtak Hong

Author-Name: Naufel J. Vilcassim
Abstract: Retailers determine the assortment for a mix of product categories in a particular space (e.g., the checkout aisle, endcaps, freezer space). Within such a “target” space, shoppers are exposed to a selection of product categories that are not necessarily correlated in consumption. In this article, the authors examine whether the assortment of one category affects consumers’ purchase incidence decision in another, independent category that shares a common display space (e.g., frozen meals and ice cream). They use a multivariate probit model of purchase incidence and incorporate assortment variety captured by an entropy measure. Results from analyses of IRI data and an online experiment provide strong evidence that consumers are less likely to purchase from a category of a given assortment when it is presented with another category assortment of greater variety and that this effect is driven by the display proximity. Furthermore, results from an eye-tracking study indicate consumers’ allocation of limited attention to category assortments as an explanation for the finding. This work serves as one of the first studies to document the impact of product assortment beyond a focal category, and the results highlight a limitation of individual category management when grocery retailers make product assortment decisions.

Title: Dynamic Relationship Marketing

Author-Name: Rajiv P. Dant
Abstract: Firms routinely engage in relationship marketing (RM) efforts to improve their relationships with business partners, and extant research has documented the effectiveness of various RM strategies. According to the perspective proposed in this article, as customers migrate through different relationship states over time, not all RM strategies are equally effective, so it is possible to identify the most effective RM strategies given customers’ states. The authors apply a multivariate hidden Markov model to a six-year longitudinal data set of 552 business-to-business relationships maintained by a Fortune 500 firm. The analysis identifies four latent buyer–seller relationship states, according to each customer’s level of commitment, trust, dependence, and relational norms, and it parsimoniously captures customers’ migration across relationship states through three positive (exploration, endowment, recovery) and two negative (neglect, betrayal) migration mechanisms. The most effective RM strategies across migration paths can help firms promote customer migration to higher performance states and prevent deterioration to poorer ones. A counterfactual elasticity analysis compares the relative importance of different migration strategies at various relationship stages. This research thus moves beyond extant RM literature by focusing on the differential effectiveness of RM strategies across relationship states, and it provides managerial guidance regarding efficient, dynamic resource allocations.

Abstract: Exchange events are fundamental building blocks of business relationships and essential to relationship development. However, some events contribute to incremental relationship development, as predicted by life cycle theories, whereas others spark “turning points” with dramatic impacts on the relationship. Such transformational relationship events are encounters between exchange partners that significantly disconfirm relational expectations (positively or negatively); they result in dramatic, discontinuous change to the relationship's trajectory and often reformulate the relationship itself. With a three-study, multimethod design, the authors (1) establish a foundation for differentiating dramatic and incremental exchange events on the basis of relational versus product expectations and disconfirmations, thus revealing that strong relationships benefit product disconfirmations but harm relational disconfirmations, and (2) conceptualize, define, and differentiate transformational relationship events from other types of disconfirming events and then link them to exchange performance.

Title: How Business Customers Judge Solutions: Solution Quality and Value in Use
Author-Name: Emma K. Macdonald
Author-Name: Michael Kleinaltenkamp
Author-Name: Hugh N. Wilson
Abstract: Many manufacturers look to business solutions to provide growth; however, success is far from guaranteed, and it is unclear how such solutions can create superior perceived value. This article explores what constitutes value for customers from solutions over time—conceptualized as “value in use”—and how this arises from quality perceptions of the solution’s components. The authors develop a framework for solution quality and value in use through 36 interviews combining repertory grid technique and means-end chains. The findings significantly extend the extant view of quality as a function of the supplier’s products and services, and show that customers also assess the quality of their own resources and processes, as well as the quality of the joint resource integration process. The authors report that value in use corresponds not just to collective, organizational goals but also to individuals’ goals, a finding that strongly contrasts with prior research. Four moderators of the quality–value relationship demonstrate customer heterogeneity across both firms and roles within what the authors term the “usage center.” When shifting toward solutions, manufacturers require very different approaches to market research; account management; solution design; and quality control, including the need for value-auditing processes.

Title: Exploring the Effects of “What” (Product) and “Where” (Website) Characteristics on Online Shopping Behavior

Author-Name: Qing Liu
Abstract: Understanding factors that influence online shopping and managing consumer relationships is not a trivial task for firms, considering the many pertinent factors that influence behavior, including the product being shopped (i.e., the “what”) and the context of the website itself (i.e., the “where”). This study investigates the impact of these characteristics on an online transaction’s basket value, after incorporating the role of other aspects of the browsing process including page views and visit duration. The authors estimate a multivariate mixed-effects Type II Tobit model with a system of equations to explain variation in shopping basket value, using data involving 773,262 browsing sessions resulting in 9,664 transactions across 43 product categories from 385 unique websites. The results support the assertions that contextual factors are associated with online browsing. For example, a website’s scope in terms of product variety is associated positively with visit durations and basket values but negatively with page views. Furthermore, a website’s communication functionality is positively associated with basket value for hedonic products. Insights suggest managerial implications involving product and website strategies for online retailers.

Author-Name: Jaakko Aspara
Abstract: Market orientation (MO) and marketing performance measurement (MPM) are two of the most widespread strategic marketing concepts among practitioners. However, some have questioned the benefits of extensive investments in MO and MPM. More importantly, little is known about which combinations of MO and MPM are optimal in ensuring high business performance. To address this research gap, the authors analyze a unique data set of 628 firms with a novel method of configurational analysis: fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis. In line with prior research, the authors find that MO is an important determinant of business performance. However, to reap its benefits, managers need to complement it with appropriate MPM, the level and focus of which vary across firms. For example, whereas large firms and market leaders generally benefit from comprehensive MPM, small firms may benefit from measuring marketing performance only selectively or by focusing on particular dimensions of marketing performance. The study also finds that many of the highest-performing firms do not follow any of the particular best practices identified.

Title: Let Your Banner Wave? Antecedents and Performance Implications of Retailers’ Private-Label Branding Strategies
Author-Name: Kristopher O. Keller

Author-Name: Inge Geyskens
Abstract: The authors study the drivers and performance implications of retailers’ branding strategies for their premium and economy private-label tiers. Retailers can opt for store-banner branding and use their store-banner name and/or logo to reveal their ownership, or they can use stand-alone branding and avoid an explicit link between store brand and retail banner. Hypotheses are tested on a large pan-European sample of premium and economy tiers that were introduced over almost 15 years. For the premium tier, retailers’ propensity to use store-banner branding is higher when they have a hi–lo price format and a higher brand equity, and when they have used store-banner branding in the past (on their standard tier and in other markets). The attractiveness of using store-banner branding for the premium tier also varies across countries: it is more likely to be chosen when the retail environment is less concentrated, when uncertainty avoidance and rule of law are higher, and when power distance is lower. For most of these drivers, the effect is significantly weaker for the economy tier. Retailers whose premium-tier branding decision is congruent with the proposed contingency framework perform better. For the economy tier, congruence is not associated with higher performance.

Title: Stock Returns on Customer Satisfaction Do Beat the Market: Gauging the Effect of a Marketing Intangible
Author-Name: Claes Fornell
Author-Name: Forrest V. Morgeson III
Author-Name: G. Tomas M. Hult
Abstract: A debate about whether firms with superior customer satisfaction earn superior stock returns has been persistent in the literature. Using 15 years of audited returns, the authors find convincing empirical evidence that stock returns on customer satisfaction do beat the market. The recorded cumulative returns were 518% over the years studied (2000–2014), compared with a 31% increase for the S&P 500. Similar results using back-tested instead of real returns were found in the United Kingdom. The effect of customer satisfaction on stock price is, at least in part, channeled through earnings surprises. Consistent with theory, customer satisfaction has an effect on earnings themselves. In addition, the authors examine the effect of stock returns from earnings on stock returns from customer satisfaction. If earnings returns are included among the risk factors in the asset pricing model, the earnings variable partially mitigates the returns on customer satisfaction. Because of the long time series, it is also possible to examine time periods when customer satisfaction returns were below market. The reversal of the general trend largely resulted from short-term market idiosyncrasies with little or no support from fundamentals. Such irregularities have been infrequent and eventually self-correcting. The authors provide reasons why irregularities may occur from time to time.

Title: Binge Watching and Advertising
Author-Name: David A. Schweidel
Author-Name: Wendy W. Moe
Abstract: How users consume media has shifted dramatically as viewers migrate from traditional broadcast channels toward online channels. Rather than following the schedule dictated by television networks and consuming one episode of a series each week, many viewers now engage in binge watching, which involves consuming several episodes of the same series in a condensed period of time. In this research, the authors decompose users’ viewing behavior into (1) whether the user continues the viewing session after each episode viewed, (2) whether the next episode viewed is from the same or a different series, and (3) the time elapsed between sessions. Applying this modeling framework to data provided by Hulu.com, a popular online provider of broadcast and cable television shows, the authors examine the drivers of binge watching behavior, distinguishing between user-level traits and states determined by previously viewed content. The authors simultaneously investigate users’ response to advertisements. Many online video providers support their services with advertising revenue; thus, understanding how users respond to advertisements and how advertising affects subsequent viewing is of paramount importance to both advertisers and online video providers. The results of the study reveal that advertising responsiveness differs between bingers and nonbingers and that it changes over the course of online viewing sessions. The authors discuss the implications of their results for advertisers and online video platforms.

Title: When 1 + 1 > 2: How Investors React to New Product Releases Announced Concurrently with Other Corporate News
Author-Name: Nooshin L. Warren
Author-Name: Alina Sorescu
Abstract: Firms routinely use press releases to announce the launch of their new products. An examination of these press releases shows that in approximately 7% of cases, firms issue new product announcements concurrently with other corporate announcements. However, the consequences of these actions are unknown because event studies typically eliminate concurrent announcements in an attempt to avoid their confounding effects. The authors use a comprehensive sample of press releases issued by publicly traded U.S. firms to document the consequences of firms announcing the release of a new product concurrently with another corporate announcement that conveys good news. Drawing on Merton’s (1987) model of capital market equilibrium with incomplete information, the authors identify three conditions that are conducive to the issuance of concurrent new product announcements. They then verify that under these conditions, the increase in shareholder value associated with concurrent announcements is higher than that associated with issuing two similar announcements separately. This research provides insights into how firms can leverage corporate communications to increase stock prices.

Title: The Clash of the Titans: On Retailer and Manufacturer Vulnerability in Conflict Delistings
Author-Name: Sara Van der Maelen

Abstract: The days of dominant manufacturers dictating the game to obedient retailers are long gone. When parties believe they have equal bargaining power, negotiations end in deadlock more frequently and result in conflict delistings wherein the manufacturers’ brands get removed from the retailers’ assortments. This might cause major sales losses as consumers are forced to change stores or brands. The authors study both parties’ vulnerabilities by investigating their market share shifts during a highly publicized real-life conflict delisting executed by a major retailer against a major manufacturer, involving multiple brands and categories. Generally, both parties lost sales, yet the retailer was the most vulnerable party. Manufacturer-brand and retailer-assortment characteristics moderated both parties’ vulnerability: the manufacturer and retailer became respectively less and more vulnerable when a high-equity brand was delisted in a small assortment. Both parties lost more in necessity than in impulse categories. The authors additionally investigate long-term consequences that occurred after the conflict was settled: the retailer’s market share recovered to the predelisting level, whereas the manufacturer’s share underwent a long-term level rise.

Abstract: Research in marketing has increasingly focused on building knowledge about how firms’ marketing contributes to performance outcomes. A key precursor to accurately diagnosing the value firms’ marketing creates is conceptualizing and operationalizing appropriate ways to assess performance outcomes. Yet, to date, there has been little conceptual development and no systematic examination of how researchers in marketing should conceptualize and measure the performance outcomes associated with firms’ marketing. The authors develop a theory-based performance evaluation framework and examine the assessment of such performance outcomes in 998 empirical studies published in the top 15 marketing journals from 1981 through 2014. The results reveal a large number of different performance outcome measures used in prior empirical research that may be only weakly related to one another, making it difficult to synthesize findings across studies. In addition, the authors identify significant problems in how performance outcomes in marketing are commonly conceptualized and operationalized. They also reveal several theoretically and managerially important performance areas in which empirical knowledge of marketing’s impact is limited or absent. Finally, they examine the implications of the results, provide actionable guidelines for researchers, and suggest a road map for systematically improving research practice in the future.

Abstract: This study examines customization as a coordination problem in transactions with business customers. Marketing research has investigated challenges associated with customized offers from the customer side; however, scant research has examined the supplier’s challenges and their performance implications. The authors distinguish between project revenues and costs to reveal a fundamental dilemma that suppliers face during customization. Analyses of dyadic survey data collected from a software supplier and its business customers, as well as objective revenue and cost data, reveal a tension between project revenues and costs. The outcomes of customization depend on factors that relieve the coordination problem, such as customer demand ambiguity, customer participation, product modularity, project team technological capability, and relational embeddedness. These findings provide a basis to assess the value of customization as a tool to implement a customer-oriented business-to-business marketing strategy.

Title: Why the Dynamics of Competition Matter for Category Profitability
Author-Name: Sudhir Voleti
Author-Name: Manish Gangwar
Author-Name: Praveen K. Kopalle
Abstract: Category management (CM) has become a widespread trade practice in recent years. A category manager’s decision problem is complex and multifaceted owing to demand dependencies across products and across time. Extant research on CM has typically focused on one or the other of these dependencies, but seldom both. The authors address this research gap by presenting a competition framework that reconciles cross-sectional breadth (large numbers of stockkeeping units in any given period) with longitudinal depth (demand effects across time). The endeavor is to offer retailers a general, realistic, and practical CM approach by comprehensively accounting for competitive effects. The authors demonstrate their approach using real-world data in the beer category for a midsize grocery chain in the northeastern United States. After determining the optimal weekly prices for the entire assortment over 23 weeks, the authors report a profit yield that is 3.30% more than in the benchmark logit model and substantially more than in the retailer’s current everyday low price policy.

Author-Name: Subramanian Balachander
Abstract: A product’s physical appearance is difficult to quantify, and the impact of product appearance on demand has rarely been studied using market data. The authors adopt a recently developed morphing technique to measure a product’s aesthetic design and investigate its effect on consumer preference. Drawing upon categorization theory, the authors consider the effects of three dimensions of aesthetic design—segment prototypicality (SP), brand consistency (BC), and cross-segment mimicry (CSM)—and their moderating effects on marketing mix effectiveness in a unified framework. The empirical analysis uses a unique, large data set consisting of 202 car models from 33 brands sold in the United States from 2003 to 2010. The authors find that consumer preference peaks at moderate levels of SP and BC and that economy-segment products benefit from CSM of luxury products. Moreover, SP intensifies price sensitivity, and BC muffles price sensitivity while increasing advertising effectiveness. Two what-if studies illustrate how managers can use the empirical model to evaluate alternative aesthetic design choices.

Title: Washing Away Your Sins? Corporate Social Responsibility, Corporate Social Irresponsibility, and Firm Performance
Author-Name: Charles Kang
Author-Name: Frank Germann
Author-Name: Rajdeep Grewal
Abstract: The authors address the questions of whether and how corporate social responsibility (CSR) relates to firm performance and, in so doing, identify four mechanisms pertaining to this relationship: (1) slack resources lead to CSR (i.e., slack resources mechanism) (2) CSR improves performance (i.e., good management mechanism), (3) CSR makes amends for past corporate social irresponsibility (CSI) (i.e., penance mechanism), and (4) CSR insures against subsequent CSI (i.e., insurance mechanism). Using an integrative approach, the authors incorporate the four mechanisms in their empirical model specification. Specifically, to model the interplay among CSR, CSI, and firm performance and to test the four mechanisms simultaneously, they propose a structural panel vector autoregression specification. In support of the good management mechanism, results from an unbalanced panel data set of more than 4,500 firms and up to 19 years suggest that firms that engage in CSR are likely to benefit financially from their CSR investments. Moreover, the authors do not find support for the slack resources or the insurance mechanism. In contrast, and in support of the penance mechanism, often firms’ CSR seems to trail their CSI. However, the results also suggest that the penance mechanism is ineffective in offsetting negative performance effects due to CSI.

Title: When Does (Mis)Fit in Customer Orientation Matter for Frontline Employees’ Job Satisfaction and Performance?

Author-Name: Yeon Sung Jung
Abstract: The role of coworkers’ customer orientation (CO) in influencing an employee’s CO has received sparse attention in the literature. This research serves two purposes. First, the study draws on person–group fit theory to develop and test a model of a frontline employee’s CO relative to that of his or her coworkers as well as the effects of CO (mis)fit on job satisfaction and service performance through coworker relationship quality. Second, the authors propose three work-group characteristics—group size, service climate strength, and leader‒member exchange differentiation—that they expect to mitigate the (negative) positive effect of employee‒coworker CO (mis)fit on coworker relationship quality. Data collected in a multirespondent (i.e., frontline employees and supervisors) longitudinal research design indicate that as group size increases, service climate becomes stronger, and group leaders develop different exchange relationships with employees, the inherently (negative) positive role of employee–coworker CO (mis)fit in influencing coworker relationship quality diminishes. Furthermore, coworker relationship quality fully mediates the associations of employee–coworker CO (mis)fit with job satisfaction and service performance. The authors close with a discussion of the theoretical and practical implications of the boundary conditions of CO (mis)fit.

Title: The Effects of Advertised Quality Emphasis and Objective Quality on Sales

Abstract: Given that consumers value quality, and advertising content informs consumers’ beliefs about quality, it is not surprising that high-quality brands emphasize quality in their advertising content. What is less obvious is whether firms with lower-quality brands should also follow suit and emphasize quality in their advertising to signal a higher quality. We examine this issue and study the effectiveness of quality-based advertising messages. Our field study relates brands’ monthly sales to their advertised quality claims across 1,876 print ads in national magazines and Consumer Reports–based product quality ratings over more than two decades. Contrary to the generally held yet erroneous belief in the efficacy of low-quality products emphasizing quality in their advertising, we demonstrate that (1) it is not beneficial for a low-quality firm to emphasize quality in its advertising, and (2) it is effective for a high-quality firm to do so. An analysis of parameter values from a published category-agnostic simulation and an experiment that examines consumers’ responses to quality claims in a second product category yields convergent insights.

Title: Sales Representative Departures and Customer Reassignment Strategies in Business-to-Business Markets

Abstract: When a sales representative (rep) leaves a business-to-business firm, a crucial link with the rep’s customers becomes severed. The firm reassigns those customers to different sales reps (either existing reps or new hires) in a manner that mitigates potential sales losses. What causal effect do sales rep departures have on customer-level revenue, and which sales rep replacement strategies are more effective? Using data from a Fortune 500 firm and a difference-in-differences analysis with correction for selection bias, the authors show that sales rep transitions lead to 13.2%–17.6% losses in annual sales. New hires are less effective than existing sales reps in mitigating sales losses. Existing sales reps who are similar (vs. dissimilar) to the departing reps (in terms of past industry experience) are more effective in mitigating sales losses; however, reps with high past performance do not exhibit greater efficacy for mitigating sales losses than reps with average or low past performance. The analysis presents means to quantify the economic consequences of losing a sales rep and to determine how to reassign customers to sales reps according to the resulting economic impact.

Title: Doing Well Versus Doing Good: The Differential Effect of Underdog Positioning on Moral and Competent Service Providers
Author-Name: Amna Kirmani

Author-Name: Shannon Lantzy
Abstract: This research examines how consumers make trade-offs between highly competent, less moral service providers and highly moral, less competent service providers. Counter to research on general impression formation, which shows that moral traits dominate competence traits, the authors demonstrate that when choosing between service providers, consumers systematically value competence more than morality. However, underdog positioning moderates this effect. When a moral service provider is positioned as an underdog, consumers feel empathy, thereby attenuating the dominance of competence. Notably, although underdog positioning can help a moral provider overcome a deficit in competence, it does not help a competent service provider overcome a deficit in morality or a warm provider overcome a deficit in competence. Thus, underdog positioning is particularly well suited for less competent service providers who are highly moral.

Title: Optimizing a Menu of Multiformat Subscription Plans for Ad-Supported Media Platforms
Author-Name: Vamsi K. Kanuri
Author-Name: Murali K. Mantrala
Author-Name: Esther Thorson
Abstract: Media content distribution has changed extensively in the past decade. Content that was once distributed through traditional formats such as television, radio, and print is now available through contemporary digital formats such as smartphone and tablet apps, with many possible versions (e.g., presence or absence of ads). Consequently, many media firms that face heterogeneous markets of consumers with varying content consumption preferences are now offering “menus” of multiformat and multiversion subscription bundles for their customers to choose from. Yet, little systematic model-based guidance exists for configuring and pricing menu options. Moreover, most media firms are audience-building platforms that serve at least two distinct customer groups (content consumers and advertisers) with interrelated demands. Therefore, constructing a menu of content subscription bundles that maximizes total profit from both consumers and advertisers is a formidable challenge. This research proposes a theory-driven implementable model-based approach that can aid media platforms in addressing this challenge. The proposed approach is then demonstrated for a U.S. newspaper, and insights into profit-maximizing menus under various business model and format strategies are provided.

Title: Gamified Information Presentation and Consumer Adoption of Product Innovations
Author-Name: Jessica Müller-Stewens
Author-Name: Tobias Schlager
Author-Name: Gerald Häubl
Author-Name: Andreas Herrmann
Abstract: This research examines the effect of gamified information presentation—conveying information about a product innovation in the form of a game—on consumer adoption of that innovation. The key hypothesis is that gamified information presentation promotes consumer innovation adoption and that it does so through two parallel psychological processes—by increasing consumer playfulness, which stimulates curiosity about the innovation, and by enhancing the perceived vividness of information presentation, which increases the perceived advantage of the innovation relative to (less innovative) competing products. Evidence from seven studies, including two field experiments, supports this theorizing. The results also show that for gamified information presentation to increase innovation adoption, it is essential that the information is integrated into the game. These findings advance the understanding of the psychological forces that govern how consumers respond to receiving product information in the form of games, and they have important practical implications for how firms might use gamified information presentation to promote sales of new products.

Title: How to Separate the Wheat from the Chaff: Improved Variable Selection for New Customer Acquisition
Author-Name: Sebastian Tillmanns
Author-Name: Frenkel Ter Hofstede
Author-Name: Manfred Krafft
Author-Name: Oliver Goetz
Abstract: Steady customer losses create pressure for firms to acquire new accounts, a task that is both costly and risky. Lacking knowledge about their prospects, firms often use a large array of predictors obtained from list vendors, which in turn rapidly creates massive high-dimensional data problems. Selecting the appropriate variables and their functional relationships with acquisition probabilities is therefore a substantial challenge. This study proposes a Bayesian variable selection approach to optimally select targets for new customer acquisition. Data from an insurance company reveal that this approach outperforms nonselection methods and selection methods based on expert judgment as well as benchmarks based on principal component analysis and bootstrap aggregation of classification trees. Notably, the optimal results show that the Bayesian approach selects panel-based metrics as predictors, detects several nonlinear relationships, selects very large numbers of addresses, and generates profits. In a series of post hoc analyses, the authors consider prospects’ response behaviors and cross-selling potential and systematically vary the number of predictors and the estimated profit per response. The results reveal that more predictors and higher response rates do not necessarily lead to higher profits.

Title: The Sting of Social: How Emphasizing Social Consequences in Warning Messages Influences Perceptions of Risk
Author-Name: Mitchel R. Murdock
Author-Name: Priyali Rajagopal
Abstract: This research examines the effects of warning messages that emphasize the social consequences of negative health outcomes. The authors demonstrate that highlighting social (vs. health) consequences leads to greater perceived temporal proximity of and increased perceived vulnerability to the outcome, thereby affecting risk perceptions, behavioral intentions, and customer perceptions of actual experience. They document this effect across five studies in different health domains including flossing (Study 1), soda consumption (Study 2), smoking (Study 3), and unprotected ultraviolet light exposure (Studies 4 and 5). These findings point to the important role of the consequence type highlighted in warning messages, which can have a significant impact on risk perceptions and consumer experiences.

Title: Creating Enduring Customer Value
Author-Name: V. Kumar
Author-Name: Werner Reinartz
Abstract: One of the most important tasks in marketing is to create and communicate value to customers to drive their satisfaction, loyalty, and profitability. In this study, the authors assume that customer value is a dual concept. First, in order to be successful, firms (and the marketing function) have to create perceived value for customers. Toward that end, marketers have to measure customer perceived value and have to provide customer perceptions of value through marketing-mix elements. Second, customers in return give value through multiple forms of engagement (customer lifetime value, in the widest sense) for the organization. Therefore, marketers need to measure and manage this value of the customer(s) to the firm and have to incorporate this aspect into real-time marketing decisions. The authors integrate and synthesize existing findings, show the best practices of implementation, and highlight future research avenues.

Title: A Thematic Exploration of Digital, Social Media, and Mobile Marketing: Research Evolution from 2000 to 2015 and an Agenda for Future Inquiry
Author-Name: Cait Lamberton
Author-Name: Andrew T. Stephen
Abstract: Over the past 15 years, digital media platforms have revolutionized marketing, offering new ways to reach, inform, engage, sell to, learn about, and provide service to customers. As a means of taking stock of academic work’s ability to contribute to this revolution, this article tracks the changes in scholarly researchers’ perspectives on three major digital, social media, and mobile (DSMM) marketing themes from 2000 to 2015. The authors first use keyword counts from the premier general marketing journals to gain a macro-level view of the shifting importance of various DSMM topics since 2000. They then identify key themes emerging in five-year time frames during this period: (1) DSMM as a facilitator of individual expression, (2) DSMM as decision support tool, and (3) DSMM as a market intelligence source. In both academic research to date and corresponding practitioner discussion, there is much to appreciate. However, there are also several shortcomings of extant research that have limited its relevance and created points of disconnect between academia and practice. Finally, in light of this, an agenda for future research based on emerging research topics is advanced.

Title: Demonstrating the Value of Marketing
Author-Name: Dominique M. Hanssens
Author-Name: Koen H. Pauwels
Abstract: Marketing departments are under increased pressure to demonstrate their economic value to the firm. This challenge is exacerbated by the fact that marketing uses attitudinal (e.g., brand awareness), behavioral (e.g., brand loyalty), and financial (e.g., sales revenue) performance metrics, which do not correlate highly with each other. Thus, one metric could view marketing initiatives as successful, whereas another could interpret them as a waste of resources. The resulting ambiguity has several consequences for marketing practice. Among these are that the scope and objectives of marketing differ widely across organizations. There is confusion about the difference between marketing effectiveness and efficiency. Hard and soft metrics and offline and online metrics are typically not integrated. The two dominant tools for marketing impact assessment, response models and experiments, are rarely combined. Risk in marketing planning and execution receives little consideration, and analytic insights are not communicated effectively to drive decisions. The authors first examine how these factors affect both research and practice. They then discuss how the use of marketing analytics can improve marketing decision making at different levels of the organization. The authors identify gaps in marketing’s knowledge base that set the stage for further research and enhanced practice in demonstrating marketing’s value.

Abstract: With the challenges presented by new media, shifting media patterns, and divided consumer attention, the optimal integration of marketing communications takes on increasing importance. Drawing on a review of relevant academic research and guided by managerial priorities, the authors offer insights and advice as to how traditional and new media such as search, display, mobile, TV, and social media interact to affect consumer decision making. With an enhanced understanding of the consumer decision journey and how consumers process communications, the authors outline a comprehensive framework featuring two models designed to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of integrated marketing communication programs: a “bottom-up” communications matching model and a “top-down” communications optimization model. The authors conclude by suggesting important future research priorities.

Title: Understanding Customer Experience Throughout the Customer Journey
Author-Name: Katherine N. Lemon
Author-Name: Peter C. Verhoef
Abstract: Understanding customer experience and the customer journey over time is critical for firms. Customers now interact with firms through myriad touch points in multiple channels and media, and customer experiences are more social in nature. These changes require firms to integrate multiple business functions, and even external partners, in creating and delivering positive customer experiences. In this article, the authors aim to develop a stronger understanding of customer experience and the customer journey in this era of increasingly complex customer behavior. To achieve this goal, they examine existing definitions and conceptualizations of customer experience as a construct and provide a historical perspective of the roots of customer experience within marketing. Next, they attempt to bring together what is currently known about customer experience, customer journeys, and customer experience management. Finally, they identify critical areas for future research on this important topic.

Title: Organizing for Marketing Excellence
Author-Name: Christine Moorman
Author-Name: George S. Day
Abstract: Marketing organization is the interface of the firm with its markets and where the work of marketing gets done. This review of the past 25 years of scholarship on marketing organization examines the individual and integrative roles of four elements of marketing organization—capabilities, configuration (including structure, metrics, and incentives), culture, and the human capital of marketing leadership and talent. The authors indicate that these four elements are mobilized through seven marketing activities (7As) that occur during the marketing strategy process. These activities enable the firm to anticipate market changes, adapt the strategy to stay ahead of competition, align the organization to the strategy and market, activate effective implementation, ensure accountability for results, attract resources, and manage marketing assets. How well the firm manages these seven activities throughout the marketing strategy process determines the performance payoffs from marketing organization. Future research priorities outlined for the elements of marketing organization, their integration, and their impact on the 7As offer directions for the study of organizing for marketing excellence.

Title: When It Pays to Wait: Optimizing Release Timing Decisions for Secondary Channels in the Film Industry
Author-Name: Sumaiya Ahmed
Author-Name: Ashish Sinha
Abstract: This study examines the optimization of interrelease timing decisions, focusing on box office and DVD sales in the U.S. motion picture industry. It aims to improve managerial decision making by jointly modeling the revenue in these two channels through a copula modeling approach. As in previous studies, the authors find that the time lag from box office release to DVD release should be increased to optimize total movie performance, but they conclude that previous studies have systematically underestimated the optimal time lag. This study is the first to challenge the assumption of a negative decay in DVD performance as a function of time; its results suggest that a delayed DVD release is still optimal for maximizing revenue in the DVD channel. This study’s model suggests that, on average, individual movies are approximately eight weeks away from their optimal lag and that the net impact of optimizing would be improvements in total and DVD revenue by 2.5% and 5.6%, respectively. Therefore, this model is expected to enhance managerial decision making by offering the ability to predict the optimal time lag for individual movies.

Title: Data Privacy: Effects on Customer and Firm Performance
Author-Name: Kelly D. Martin

Author-Name: Robert W. Palmatier
Abstract: Although marketers increasingly rely on customer data, firms have little insight into the ramifications of such data use and do not know how to prevent negative effects. Data management efforts may heighten customers’ vulnerability worries or create real vulnerability. Using a conceptual framework grounded in gossip theory, the authors link customer vulnerability to negative performance effects. Three studies show that transparency and control in firms’ data management practices can suppress the negative effects of customer data vulnerability. Experimental manipulations reveal that mere access to personal data inflates feelings of violation and reduces trust. An event study of data security breaches affecting 414 public companies also confirms negative effects, as well as spillover vulnerabilities from rival firms’ breaches, on firm performance. Severity of the breach hurts the focal firm but helps the rival firm, which provides some insight into mixed findings in prior research. Finally, a field study with actual customers of 15 companies across three industries demonstrates consistent effects across four types of customer data vulnerability and confirms that violation and trust mediate the effects of data vulnerabilities on outcomes.

Title: Valuing Subscription-Based Businesses Using Publicly Disclosed Customer Data
Author-Name: Daniel M. McCarthy

Author-Name: Bruce G.S. Hardie
Abstract: The growth of subscription-based commerce has changed the types of data that firms report to external shareholders. More than ever, companies are discussing and disclosing information on the number of customers acquired and lost, customer lifetime value, and other data. This has fueled an increasing interest in linking the value of a firm’s customers to the overall value of the firm, with the term “customer-based corporate valuation” being used to describe such efforts. Although several researchers in the fields of marketing and accounting have explored this idea, their underlying models of customer acquisition and retention do not adequately reflect the empirical realities associated with these behaviors, and the associated valuation models do not meet the standards of finance professionals. The authors develop a framework for valuing subscription-based firms that addresses both issues, and they apply it to data from DISH Network and Sirius XM Holdings.

Title: (When) Are We Dynamically Optimal? A Psychological Field Guide for Marketing Modelers
Author-Name: Robert J. Meyer
Author-Name: J. Wesley Hutchinson
Abstract: A common assumption made in structural approaches to empirical strategy research in marketing is that firms and consumers satisfy the assumptions of dynamic optimality when making decisions. When faced with problems of how best to allocate resources, firms are assumed consider the future consequences of different strategic options and, in each point in time, choose the option that maximizes long-term utility. The validity of such assumptions, however, is often called into question by behavioral researchers who point to work in psychology that finds that assumptions of optimality are frequently violated in experimental settings. If this is indeed the case, it would lend support to approaches that argue that markets have inefficiencies that can be discovered and exploited by simpler, largely correlational, methods. In this article, the authors attempt to reconcile these contrasting views by proposing a framework for assessing when assumptions of dynamic optimality are likely to be good ones and when they are likely to be untenable in empirical analysis.

Title: Customer Satisfaction and Long-Term Stock Returns
Author-Name: Alina Sorescu
Author-Name: Sorin M. Sorescu
Abstract: The authors reexamine the relation between customer satisfaction (measured by the American Customer Satisfaction Index) and long-term stock returns using statistical tests that are well specified in the presence of industry clustering. Their results are consistent with those of Fornell, Morgeson, and Hult (2016), who find positive abnormal stock returns for companies with high levels of customer satisfaction. However, the authors also identify three caveats that could affect the robustness of this conclusion. First, the results critically depend on the manner in which industry is defined. Second, because Fornell, Morgeson, and Hult use a proprietary trading strategy that has not been disclosed to the general public, the authors are unable to discern what fraction of their reported performance is due to customer satisfaction as opposed to other characteristics of the trading strategy. Finally, because the authors also find positive abnormal returns for the entire American Customer Satisfaction Index sample, at least some of the performance reported by Fornell, Morgeson, and Hult might be driven by sample characteristics unrelated to customer satisfaction. This article also provides useful guidance for measuring long-term abnormal returns in the presence of industry clustering.

Abstract: The question of whether customer satisfaction is mispriced by the stock market has been debated over the past decade, yet it remains unintegrated with the broader asset pricing literature. The authors critique Fornell, Morgeson, and Hult (2016), focusing on that article’s missed opportunities in addressing theoretical lacuna and empirical challenges that might establish the satisfaction mispricing anomaly. In doing so, they distinguish mispricing from value relevance, classify two broad avenues for satisfaction mispricing research, and detail the scope of future research under each avenue. They conclude by summarizing specific research opportunities and presenting implications for managers, investors, and educators that could lead marketing to become a net contributor to the marketing–finance dialogue.

Abstract: Sorescu and Sorescu (2016) and Bharadwaj and Mitra (2016) have made a number of insightful observations and suggestions for future research regarding stock returns on customer satisfaction. They have also provided a series of assessments of a study by Fornell, Morgeson, and Hult (2016) that focus on abnormal returns on customer satisfaction. Building on the original study, as well as the two commentaries and previous research, the study’s authors argue that the published empirical evidence is quite consistent in favor of abnormal returns on customer satisfaction. These findings are also supported by the new analysis of Sorescu and Sorescu, who make several important contributions, not only regarding the persistence of abnormal returns over and beyond the technology sector but also with respect to the critical importance of industry classification in the context of customer satisfaction—something that definitely calls for more research attention. In fact, there are many avenues for future research on the economic and financial impact of customer satisfaction, as laid out in the commentaries, the authors’ original article, and this response.

Title: The Formation of Buyer—Supplier Relationships: Detailed Contract Drafting and Close Partner Selection
Author-Name: Stefan Wuyts, 
Author-Name: Inge Geyskens
Abstract: Firms face two strategic decisions when engaging in a new purchase transaction: the decision whether to draft a detailed contract and the decision whether to select a partner with which they share a close tie. The authors study how organizational culture affects these decisions and the effectiveness of these decisions in curtailing the partner's opportunistic behavior. The results suggest that organizational culture exerts an important but different influence on both decisions. Selecting a close partner shows a marked ability to hedge against partner opportunism, but beyond a certain point, it encourages the opportunism it is designed to discourage. Contracting becomes effective only when a nonclose partner is selected and when the focal relationship is embedded in a network of close mutual contacts.

Title: The Role of Spokescharacters as Advertisement and Package Cues in Integrated Marketing Communications
Author-Name: Judith A. Garretson, 
Author-Name: Scot Burton
Abstract: Marketers often use verbal claims to highlight brand benefits in marketing communication campaigns. However, spokescharacters may also be incorporated into campaigns and are often featured both in advertisements and on product packages. The authors use three studies to examine various integrated marketing communications (IMC) strategic combinations, including the effects related to the use of spokescharacters versus verbal attributes; advertisement–package coordination; character relevancy; and the presence of new, favorable brand information that may compete for cognitive resources on packages. Based on conceptual rationales drawn from encoding specificity, network associations, and the elaboration likelihood model, the findings offer empirical evidence that pertains to the potential benefits of including spokescharacters in IMC campaigns. Specifically, the use of spokescharacters results in more favorable brand attitudes, even when brand attribute recall is affected adversely by deviations from the primary message conveyed in the IMC campaigns. The authors offer some implications of these and other findings for marketers attempting to affect consumer evaluations favorably with spokescharacters in IMC campaigns.

Title: Are the Drivers and Role of Online Trust the Same for All Web Sites and Consumers? A Large-Scale Exploratory Empirical Study
Author-Name: Yakov Bart, 
Author-Name: Venkatesh Shankar, 
Author-Name: Fareena Sultan, 
Author-Name: Glen L. Urban
Abstract: The authors develop a conceptual model that links Web site and consumer characteristics, online trust, and behavioral intent. They estimate this model on data from 6831 consumers across 25 sites from eight Web site categories, using structural equation analysis with a priori and post hoc segmentation. The results show that the influences of the determinants of online trust are different across site categories and consumers. Privacy and order fulfillment are the most influential determinants of trust for sites in which both information risk and involvement are high, such as travel sites. Navigation is strongest for information-intensive sites, such as sports, portal, and community sites. Brand strength is critical for high-involvement categories, such as automobile and financial services sites. Online trust partially mediates the relationships between Web site and consumer characteristics and behavioral intent, and this mediation is strongest (weakest) for sites oriented toward infrequently (frequently) purchased, high-involvement items, such as computers (financial services).

Title: Maximizing Profitability and Return on Investment: A Short Clarification on Reinartz, Thomas, and Kumar
Author-Name: Tim Ambler
Abstract: Reinartz, Thomas, and Kumar (2005) provide a valuable methodology for balancing resources between customer retention and acquisition. They also conclude that optimal profitability (net return) coincides with optimal return on investment. This article clarifies this perhaps surprising conclusion and shows that it arises from the authors' methodology rather than from the data. More conventional analysis of the same data indicates that maximum return on investment is reached with lower expenditure than maximum profitability.

Title: A Customer Relationship Management Roadmap: What Is Known, Potential Pitfalls, and Where to Go
Author-Name: William Boulding, 
Author-Name: Richard Staelin, 
Author-Name: Michael Ehret, 
Author-Name: Wesley J. Johnston
Abstract: The goal of this preface is to describe how the special section on customer relationship management (CRM) was developed. In May 2003, Richard Staelin, Executive Director of the Teradata Center for Customer Relationship Management at Duke University, proposed that Journal of Marketing (JM) publish a special section. The proposal included activities that were designed to promote interactions among marketing academics and practitioners; the goal was to stimulate dialogue and new research on CRM. I found the proposal attractive because CRM is a broad-based topic that interests many marketers. After extensive discussion, the American Marketing Association (AMA) and the Teradata Center formally agreed to cosponsor the special section. Subsequently, there was a conference on Relationship Marketing and Customer Relationship Management (cochaired by Michael Ehret, Wesley Johnston, Michael Kleinaltenkamp, and Lou Pelton) that took place at Freie Universität Berlin in the summer of 2003; a conference on Customer Management (cosponsored by the Marketing Science Institute and the Teradata Center) that was held at Duke University in March 2004; and two special sessions on CRM that were featured at the AMA Winter Educators' Conference held in San Antonio, Tex., in February 2005. The conferences provided many opportunities for dialogue, and the response from marketers who attended these events was enthusiastic. I also invited Richard Staelin and William Boulding (Executive Codirector of the Teradata Center) to work with me as consulting editors for the special section, and they agreed. A call for papers requested that authors submit their manuscripts to JM by May 2004. The consulting editors and I evaluated every submission with the assistance of an expert panel that included Leonard Berry, John Deighton, Michael Ehret, Christian Grönroos, Sunil Gupta, Wayne Hoyer, Wagner Kamakura, Wesley Johnston, Donald R. Lehmann, Charlotte Mason, Carl Mela, Scott Neslin, Roland Rust, Michel Wedel, and Valarie Zeithaml. All submissions underwent JM's standard double-blind review process, and members of JM's editorial review board served as reviewers. I would like to express my appreciation to everyone who participated in the development of the special section. The culmination of our work together is a set of nine articles and two essays that advance the science and practice of CRM. I hope that these articles stimulate new intellectual discoveries.—Ruth N.

Title: A Strategic Framework for Customer Relationship Management
Author-Name: Adrian Payne, 
Author-Name: Pennie Frow
Abstract: In this article, the authors develop a conceptual framework for customer relationship management (CRM) that helps broaden the understanding of CRM and its role in enhancing customer value and, as a result, shareholder value. The authors explore definitional aspects of CRM, and they identify three alternative perspectives of CRM. The authors emphasize the need for a cross-functional, process-oriented approach that positions CRM at a strategic level. They identify five key cross-functional CRM processes: a strategy development process, a value creation process, a multichannel integration process, an information management process, and a performance assessment process. They develop a new conceptual framework based on these processes and explore the role and function of each element in the framework. The synthesis of the diverse concepts within the literature on CRM and relationship marketing into a single, process-based framework should provide deeper insight into achieving success with CRM strategy and implementation.

Title: The Role of Relational Information Processes and Technology Use in Customer Relationship Management
Author-Name: Satish Jayachandran, 
Author-Name: Subhash Sharma, 
Author-Name: Peter Kaufman, 
Author-Name: Pushkala Raman
Abstract: Drawing on the relationship marketing and market information processing literature streams, the authors conceptualize and measure relational information processes, or organizational routines that are critical for customer relationship management (CRM). The authors examine the key drivers and outcome of relational information processes and the role of technology in implementing CRM using data collected from a diverse sample of firms. The results show that relational information processes play a vital role in enhancing an organization's customer relationship performance. By moderating the influence of relational information processes on customer relationship performance, technology used for CRM performs an important and supportive role. The study provides insights into why the use of CRM technology might not always deliver the expected customer relationship performance outcome.

Title: Strategic Firm Commitments and Rewards for Customer Relationship Management in Online Retailing
Author-Name: Raji Srinivasan, 
Author-Name: Christine Moorman
Abstract: Academic studies offer a generally positive portrait of the effect of customer relationship management (CRM) on firm performance, but practitioners question its value. The authors argue that a firm's strategic commitments may be an overlooked organizational factor that influences the rewards for a firm's investments in CRM. Using the context of online retailing, the authors consider the effects of two key strategic commitments of online retailers on the performance effect of CRM: their bricks-and-mortar experience and their online entry timing. They test the proposed model with a multimethod approach that uses manager ratings of firm CRM and strategic commitments and third-party customers' ratings of satisfaction from 106 online retailers. The findings indicate that firms with moderate bricks-and-mortar experience are better able to leverage CRM for superior customer satisfaction outcomes than firms with either low or high bricks-and-mortar experience. Likewise, firms with moderate online experience are better able to leverage CRM into superior customer satisfaction outcomes than firms with either low or high online experience. These findings help resolve disparate results about the value of CRM, and they establish the importance of examining CRM within the strategic context of the firm.

Abstract: In a study of telecommunications services, the authors examine the effects of customer satisfaction, affective commitment, and calculative commitment on retention. The study further examines the potential for situational and reactional trigger conditions to moderate the satisfaction–retention relationship. The results support consistent effects of customer satisfaction, calculative commitment, and prior churn on retention. Prior churn also moderates the satisfaction–retention relationship. The results have implications for both customer relationship managers and researchers who use satisfaction surveys to predict behavior.

Title: Reducing Adverse Selection Through Customer Relationship Management
Author-Name: Yong Cao, 
Author-Name: Thomas S. Gruca
Abstract: Adverse selection is an important problem for marketers. To reduce the chances of acquiring an unprofitable customer, companies may screen prospects who respond to a marketing offer. Prospects who respond are often not approved. At the same time, prospects who are likely to be approved are unlikely to respond to a given marketing offer. Using data from a firm's customer relationship management system, the authors show how to target prospects who are likely to respond and be approved. This approach increases the number of customers who are approved and reduces the number of applicants who may defect after being turned down. This method can be extended to new customer acquisition and more effective targeting of costly promotions to migrate customers to higher levels of lifetime value.

Title: Making Customer Relationship Management Work: The Measurement and Profitable Management of Customer Relationships
Author-Name: Lynette Ryals
Abstract: Customer relationship management (CRM) is perceived to be failing, and there is an urgent need for some practical ways to address this issue. The research presented in this article demonstrates that the implementation of CRM activities delivers greater profits. Using calculations of the lifetime value of customers in two longitudinal case studies, the research finds that customer management strategies change as more is discovered about the value of the customer. These changes lead to better firm performance. The contribution of this article is to show that CRM works and that a relatively straightforward analysis of the value of the customer can make a real difference.

Title: Do Satisfied Customers Buy More? Examining Moderating Influences in a Retailing Context
Author-Name: Kathleen Seiders, 
Author-Name: Glenn B. Voss, 
Author-Name: Dhruv Grewal, 
Author-Name: Andrea L. Godfrey
Abstract: In this research, the authors propose that the relationship between satisfaction and repurchase behavior is moderated by customer, relational, and marketplace characteristics. They further hypothesize that the moderating effects emerge if repurchase is measured as objective behavior but not if it is measured as repurchase intentions. To test for systematic differences in effects, the authors estimate identical models using both longitudinal repurchase measures and survey measures as the dependent variable. The results suggest that the relationship between customer satisfaction and repurchase behavior is contingent on the moderating effects of convenience, competitive intensity, customer involvement, and household income. As the authors predicted, the results are significantly different for self-reported repurchase intentions and objective repurchase behavior. The conceptual framework and empirical findings reinforce the importance of moderating influences and offer new insights that enhance the understanding of what drives repurchase behavior.

Title: Does Distance Still Matter? Geographic Proximity and New Product Development
Author-Name: Shankar Ganesan, 
Author-Name: Alan J. Malter, 
Author-Name: Aric Rindfleisch
Abstract: Many firms rely on external organizations to acquire knowledge that is useful for developing creative new products and reducing the time needed to bring these products to market. Cluster theory suggests that this knowledge is often obtained from organizations located in close geographic proximity. Specifically, proximity is assumed to foster heightened face-to-face communication, strengthened relational ties, increased knowledge acquisition, and enhanced new product outcomes. The authors identify the limitations of these assumptions and offer an enriched model of the influence of geographic proximity on new product development, which they test using both a cross-sectional survey of 155 firms in the U.S. optics industry and a longitudinal follow-up survey of 73 of these firms. They find that firms located in close proximity engage in increased face-to-face communication, but this communication has little effect on the acquisition of the types of knowledge that lead to enhanced new product outcomes. In contrast, they find that e-mail communication leads to both enhanced new product creativity and development speed. In addition, they find that relational ties moderate rather than mediate the path connecting geographic proximity and new product outcomes. These findings imply that the new product development outcomes typically ascribed to close geographic proximity may actually be attributed to strong relational ties.

Title: Resolving the Capability—Rigidity Paradox in New Product Innovation
Author-Name: Kwaku Atuahene-Gima
Abstract: Managers face an important strategic dilemma in product innovation: how to exploit existing product innovation competencies (competence exploitation) while avoiding their dysfunctional rigidity effects by renewing and replacing them with entirely new competencies (competence exploration). Although the resolution of what is termed the “capability–rigidity paradox” is considered a fundamental managerial task in enhancing product innovation outcomes and the firm's competitive advantage, it has received little research attention. The author argues and finds support that market orientation provides a key to this paradox. Specifically, customer and competitor orientations ensure simultaneous investments in exploiting existing product innovation competencies and exploring new ones. The author also finds that the effects of these orientations on competence exploitation and exploration are differentially moderated by interfunctional coordination and perceived market opportunity. Regarding outcomes, competence exploitation and exploration have opposing relationships with incremental and radical innovation performance. However, the relationship between competence exploration and radical innovation performance is positively moderated by interfunctional coordination. Overall, the results of this study suggest that market orientation can prevent a firm from becoming operationally efficient but strategically inefficient by simultaneously engendering competence exploitation and exploration, which are differentially related to incremental and radical product innovation outcomes.

Title: Reference Price Research: Review and Propositions

Abstract: A substantial body of research evidence has now accumulated in the reference price literature. One stream of research has identified the antecedents of reference price and has assessed their effects through experimentation. Others have calibrated a variety of reference price models on panel data and reported the effects on brand choice and other purchase decisions. In this article, the authors review the published literature on reference price in both the behavioral and modeling streams. They offer an integrative framework to review prior research on (1) the formation of reference price, (2) retrieval and use of reference price, and (3) influences of reference price on various purchase decisions and evaluations. In doing so, the authors examine the influences of consumers' prior purchase history and contextual moderators, such as specific purchase occasions, promotional environment of the store, and product category characteristics. They summarize the key findings, identify the unresolved issues, and offer an agenda for further research, which includes a set of testable propositions. They also identify the methodological challenges that face reference price research. In the concluding section, the authors discuss the managerial implications of reference price research.

Title: When Should a Retailer Create an Exciting Store Environment?
Author-Name: Velitchka D. Kaltcheva, 
Author-Name: Barton A. Weitz
Abstract: Addressing inconsistent results in the literature, the conceptual framework that the authors develop proposes that the consumer's motivational orientation moderates the effect of the arousal produced by a store environment on the pleasantness of the environment. Two experiments support the framework. When consumers have a recreational motivational orientation, high arousal has a positive effect on pleasantness, but when consumers have a task-oriented motivational orientation, high arousal decreases pleasantness. In addition, high arousal increases consumer intentions to visit and make purchases in the store for recreationally oriented consumers, but it has a negative impact on shopping behavior for task-oriented consumers. Pleasantness mediates the effect of arousal on shopping behavior.

Title: Value-Based Differentiation in Business Relationships: Gaining and Sustaining Key Supplier Status
Author-Name: Wolfgang Ulaga, 
Author-Name: Andreas Eggert
Abstract: Many business customers today consolidate their supply bases and implement preferred supplier programs. Consequently, vendors increasingly face the alternative of either gaining a key supplier status with their customers or being pushed into the role of a backup supplier. As product and price become less important differentiators, suppliers of routinely purchased products search for new ways to differentiate themselves in a buyer–seller relationship. This research investigates avenues for differentiation through value creation in business-to-business relationships. The results suggest that relationship benefits display a stronger potential for differentiation in key supplier relationships than cost considerations. The authors identify service support and personal interaction as core differentiators, followed by a supplier's know-how and its ability to improve a customer's time to market. Product quality and delivery performance, along with acquisition costs and operation costs, display a moderate potential to help a firm gain and maintain key supplier status. Finally, price shows the weakest potential for differentiation.

Title: Job Satisfaction, Job Performance, and Effort: A Reexamination Using Agency Theory
Author-Name: Markus Christen, 
Author-Name: Ganesh Iyer, 
Author-Name: David Soberman
Abstract: The objective of this article is to clarify ambiguities in the literature regarding the relationships among three key constructs of work relationships: effort, job performance, and job satisfaction. The relationship between job performance and job satisfaction is of central interest to research in organizational psychology. However, empirical research in that area finds that the link between these constructs is weak at best. A negative effect of effort on job satisfaction is consistent with agency theory, but there is limited empirical evidence to support this assumption. Moreover, some studies have found a positive effect of effort on job satisfaction. Using a model that incorporates the main constructs from agency theory and organizational psychology, the current study finds a negative, direct effect of effort and a positive, direct effect of job performance on job satisfaction. The authors show that conflicting findings in the literature are the result of inconsistency in both the measurement and the definition of constructs across studies that do not fully account for all the relationships between constructs. The current findings emphasize the need to distinguish clearly between factors that represent employees' inputs in a work relationship (i.e., effort) and those that represent their outputs (i.e., job performance). The article also demonstrates the importance of properly accounting or controlling for all key variables to eliminate biases that can arise in empirical research on work relationships.

Title: Market Pioneer and Early Follower Survival Risks: A Contingency Analysis of Really New Versus Incrementally New Product-Markets
Author-Name: Sungwook Min,

Author-Name: William T. Robinson
Abstract: Does the first entrant in a new market have a difficult time surviving or do first-mover advantages provide protection from outright failure? This empirical study of 264 new industrial product-markets yields insights into this controversial research topic. The key data analysis insights arise through a comparison of survival risks in markets that were started with a really new product and in those that were started with an incremental innovation. When a pioneer starts a new market with a really new product, it can be a major challenge just to survive. In contrast, in markets started by an incremental innovation, market pioneer survival risks are much lower. Notably, early followers have the same survival risk across both types of markets. Overall, these results indicate that in markets started by a really new product, the first to market is often the first to fail. In contrast, in markets started by an incremental innovation, it appears that first-mover advantages protect the pioneer from outright failure.

Title: Customer Satisfaction and Stock Prices: High Returns, Low Risk
Author-Name: Claes Fornell, 
Author-Name: Sunil Mithas, 
Author-Name: Forrest V. Morgeson III, 
Author-Name: M.S. Krishnan
Abstract: Do investments in customer satisfaction lead to excess returns? If so, are these returns associated with higher stock market risk? The empirical evidence presented in this article suggests that the answer to the first question is yes, but equally remarkable, the answer to the second question is no, suggesting that satisfied customers are economic assets with high returns/low risk. Although these results demonstrate stock market imperfections with respect to the time it takes for share prices to adjust, they are consistent with previous studies in marketing in that a firm's satisfied customers are likely to improve both the level and the stability of net cash flows. The implication, implausible as it may seem in other contexts, is high return/low risk. Specifically, the authors find that customer satisfaction, as measured by the American Customer Satisfaction Index (ACSI), is significantly related to market value of equity. Yet news about ACSI results does not move share prices. This apparent inconsistency is the catalyst for examining whether excess stock returns might be generated as a result. The authors present two stock portfolios: The first is a paper portfolio that is back tested, and the second is an actual case. At low systematic risk, both outperform the market by considerable margins. In other words, it is possible to beat the market consistently by investing in firms that do well on the ACSI.

Abstract: This article tests how well the information economics view of brand equity explains consumer brand choice in countries that represent different cultural dimensions. In this empirical analysis, the authors use survey and experimental data on orange juice and personal computers collected from respondents in Brazil, Germany, India, Japan, Spain, Turkey, and the United States. The results provide strong empirical evidence across countries for the role of brands as signals of product positions. In addition, the positive effect of brand credibility on choice is greater for consumers who rate high on either collectivism or uncertainty avoidance. Credible brands provide more value to collectivist consumers because such consumers perceive these brands as being of higher quality (i.e., reinforcing group identity). Credible brands provide more value to high-uncertainty-avoidance consumers because such brands have lower perceived risk and information costs.

Title: Emotional Branding and the Strategic Value of the Doppelgänger Brand Image
Author-Name: Craig J. Thompson, 
Author-Name: Aric Rindfleisch, 
Author-Name: Zeynep Arsel
Abstract: Emotional branding is widely heralded as a key to marketing success. However, little attention has been given to the risks posed by this strategy. This article argues that emotional-branding strategies are conducive to the emergence of a doppelgänger brand image, which is defined as a family of disparaging images and meanings about a brand that circulate throughout popular culture. This article's thesis is that a doppelgänger brand image can undermine the perceived authenticity of an emotional-branding story and, thus, the identity value that the brand provides to consumers. The authors discuss how the tenets of emotional branding paradoxically encourage the formation and propagation of doppelgänger brand imagery. This article develops the counterintuitive proposition that rather than merely being a threat to be managed, a doppelgänger brand image can actually benefit a brand by providing early warning signs that an emotional-branding story is beginning to lose its cultural resonance. This article demonstrates these ideas through an analysis of the doppelgänger brand image that is beginning to haunt a paragon of emotional branding—Starbucks. The authors conclude with a discussion of how marketing managers can proactively use the insights gained by analyzing a doppelgänger brand image.

Abstract: The Internet has enabled consumers to make more informed decisions more conveniently with apparently more efficient price-clearing mechanisms than was available before its advent. One such mechanism is the name-your-own-price auction. The authors study the extent to which decisions made in such an auction are rational in relation to an economic model. The results from two independent markets show that a large number of consumers do not exhibit rational decision making.

Title: Understanding Consumer Responses to Product Risk Information
Author-Name: Anthony D. Cox, 
Author-Name: Dena Cox, 
Author-Name: Gregory Zimet
Abstract: Two experiments examine how message framing moderates consumer responses to product risk information. The findings suggest that contrary to an influential theory, consumers exposed to loss-framed messages exhibit a general aversion to product risk involving both short-term adverse effects and more permanent harm. In contrast, consumers exposed to gain-framed messages differentiate among different types of product risk. They essentially ignore temporary product risks but give considerable decisional weight to risks of permanent harm. This article discusses the implications of these findings for those who design and regulate promotional messages that contain product risk disclosures.

Title: How Does Enforcement Deter Gray Market Incidence?

Abstract: Gray market activity has become increasingly prevalent. The prevailing wisdom in marketing is to use more severe enforcement to deter gray marketing. However, the certainty and speed of enforcement may also have a bearing on the incidence of violations. This article examines whether and how enforcement deters gray marketing. The results from a field survey of manufacturers and an experimental design suggest that, by itself, enforcement severity has no impact. Deterrence results only when the multiple facets of enforcement are used in combination.

Title: Strategic Marketing Planning for Radically New Products
Author-Name: Lee G. Cooper
Abstract: In this article, the author outlines an approach to marketing planning for radically new products, disruptive or discontinuous innovations that change the dimensionality of the consumer decision. The planning process begins with an extensive situation analysis. The factors identified in the situation analysis are woven into the economic webs surrounding the new product. The webs are mapped into Bayesian networks that can be updated as events unfold and used to simulate the impact that changes in assumptions underlying the web have on the prospects for the new product. The author illustrates this method using a historical case regarding the introduction of videotape recorders by Sony and JVC and a contemporary case of the introduction of electric vehicles. The author provides a complete, numerical example pertaining to a software development project in the Appendix.

Title: Strategic Foretelling: Communication-Based Antecedents of a Firm’s Propensity to Preannounce
Author-Name: Roger J. Calantone, 
Author-Name: Kim E. Schatzel
Abstract: The authors examine preannouncements as strategic marketing communications aimed at influencing the perceptions and attitudes of industry stakeholders. The growth of the Internet points to the expanded importance of preannouncements. With an investigation of 265 chief executive officers (CEOs) and presidents from manufacturers of new products, the authors examine the effects of three firm-specific factors (first-mover predisposition, firm information interactivity, and competitive equity building) and one environmental construct (industry dynamism) on a firm’s propensity to preannounce its future intended actions. The results indicate that competitive equity building, defined as a firm’s tendency to pursue a high-profile leadership position within its industry, is the main driver of a firm’s propensity to preannounce. Future directions for research include the development of a normative preannouncement framework and investigation of the role of preannouncements within the context of CEO marketing activities.

Title: An Examination of Organizational Factors Influencing New Product Success in Internal and Alliance-Based Processes
Author-Name: Eugene Sivadas, 
Author-Name: F. Robert Dwyer
Abstract: New products provide increased sales, profits, and competitive strength for most organizations. However, nearly 50% of the new products that are introduced each year fail. Organizations thus find themselves in a double bind. On the one hand they must innovate consistently to remain competitive, but on the other hand innovation is risky and expensive. Many organizations are forming business alliances to quicken the pace of and reduce risks associated with innovation. Yet by some estimates, 70% of these alliances fail. Many of the prescriptions for successful alliance management clash with recommendations for effective innovation management. The authors develop testable hypotheses by integrating the new products and alliance literature. A construct—cooperative competency—derived from related concepts of mutual adjustment, absorptive capacity, and relational capability is posited as the key factor affecting new product development success, regardless of whether it is an intra- or interfirm endeavor. The authors test the model with data from a sample survey in the semiconductor manufacturing context and replicate it in the health care sector. The antecedents of cooperative competency—formalized and clannish administration, mutual dependence, and institutional support—are revealed empirically and substantiated. The authors identify the importance and means of developing interfirm cooperation.

Title: Strategic Orientation and Firm Performance in an Artistic Environment
Author-Name: Glenn B. Voss, 
Author-Name: Zannie Giraud Voss
Abstract: Conventional marketing wisdom holds that a customer orientation provides a firm with a better understanding of its customers, which subsequently leads to enhanced customer satisfaction and firm performance. However, there are cautions that being too customer focused can lead to inertia, and anecdotal evidence suggests that it may be better to “ignore your customer” when developing new products. Building on the market orientation research stream, the authors examine the impact of three alternative strategic orientations—customer orientation, competitor orientation, and product orientation—on a variety of subjective and objective measures of performance in the nonprofit professional theater industry, which is marked by high rates of artistic innovation and largely unpredictable customer preferences. The results indicate that the association between strategic orientation and performance varies depending on the type of performance measure used. However, the most unambiguous result is that a customer orientation exhibits a negative association with subscriber ticket sales, total income, and net surplus/deficit.

Title: New Product Quality and Product Development Teams
Author-Name: Rajesh Sethi
Abstract: New product quality has been found to have a major influence on the market success and profitability of a new product. Firms are increasingly using cross-functional teams for product development in hopes of improving product quality, yet researchers know little about how such teams affect quality. The author proposes and tests a series of hypotheses regarding how new product quality is affected by team characteristics (functional diversity and information integration) and contextual influences (time pressure, product innovativeness from the firm’s perspective, customers’ influence on the product development process, and quality orientation in the firm). The findings reveal that quality is positively related to information integration in the team, customers’ influence on the product development process, and quality orientation in the firm. New product quality is negatively influenced by the innovativeness of the new product from the firm’s perspective. However, information integration mitigates the negative effect of innovativeness on quality. Quality orientation weakens the relationship between information integration and quality. Time pressure and functional diversity do not have any effect on product quality.

Title: Performance Productivity and Quality of Frontline Employees in Service Organizations
Author-Name: Jagdip Singh
Abstract: To understand mechanisms that govern the productivity and quality of frontline employees (FLEs), this study (1) provides a conceptual distinction between frontline productivity and quality, (2) proposes an extended role theory-based model for mapping the influence of key antecedents and consequences of FLE productivity and quality, and (3) examines the effects of coping resources—boss support and task control—in helping employees cope with the inherent productivity-quality tension in frontline jobs. Using data from 159 customer service and 147 bill collection representatives, the author examines proposed hypotheses through multiple-group path analysis. The results indicate support for the distinction between productivity and quality. Moreover, with increasing burnout levels, FLEs are found to maintain their productivity levels while their quality deteriorates directly. Relative to boss support, task control emerges as a more powerful resource in aiding FLEs in coping with role tension. Key implications for theory and practice regarding FLE management and effectiveness are discussed.

Title: Corridors of Influence in the Dissemination of Customer-Oriented Strategy to Customer Contact Service Employees
Author-Name: Michael D. Hartline, 
Author-Name: James G. Maxham III, 
Author-Name: Daryl O. McKee
Abstract: It is widely held that a customer-oriented firm is more likely to deliver exceptional service quality and create satisfied customers. However, little research has addressed the question of how the orientation can be disseminated among employees throughout the firm. This dissemination is especially important in service firms in which frontline, customer contact employees are responsible for translating a customer-oriented strategy into quality service. The authors propose a structural model that explains how service firms can disseminate their customer-oriented strategy by aligning the strategy with specific management- and employee-initiated control mechanisms (i.e., formalization, empowerment, behavior-based employee evaluation, and work group socialization) that lead to increased commitment and shared values on the part of customer contact employees. The findings indicate that there are three “corridors of influence” between customer-oriented strategy and shared employee values. The dominant corridor, which focuses on dual (management- and employee-initiated) control, emphasizes the importance of work group socialization and organizational commitment in the dissemination of customer-oriented strategy. A secondary corridor focuses on two management-initiated control mechanisms: formalization and behavior-based evaluation. The final corridor, which focuses on the empowerment of customer contact employees, has a more limited impact than originally hypothesized. The authors discuss implications for the implementation of customer-oriented strategy and the management of customer contact employees, along with several directions for further research.

Abstract: The authors examine three governance mechanisms according to how well they mitigate opportunism in marketing channels. Using the U.S. hotel industry as the research context, the authors investigate how opportunism is limited by (1) ownership, (2) investment in transaction-specific assets, and (3) norms of relational exchange. They also investigate how various combinations of these governance mechanisms affect opportunistic behavior in hotel channels. Overall, the results generally support emphasizing relational norms in managing opportunism in marketing channels. The results also indicate that opportunism can be exacerbated when ownership or investments in transaction-specific assets are accentuated as governance mechanisms.

Title: No Pain, No Gain: A Critical Review of the Literature on Signaling Unobservable Product Quality
Author-Name: Amna Kirmani, 
Author-Name: Akshay R. Rao
Abstract: Recent research in information economics has focused on signals as mechanisms to solve problems that arise under asymmetric information. A firm or individual credibly communicates the level of some unobservable element in a transaction by providing an observable signal. When applied to conveying product quality information, this issue is of particular interest to the discipline of marketing. In this article, the authors focus on the ways a firm may signal the unobservable quality of its products through several marketing-mix variables. The authors develop a typology that classifies signals and discuss the available empirical evidence on the signaling properties of several marketing variables. They consider managerial implications of signaling and outline an agenda for future empirical research.

Title: The Impact of Ad Repetition and Ad Content on Consumer Perceptions of Incongruent Extensions
Author-Name: Vicki R. Lane
Abstract: The author challenges the view that incongruent extensions are doomed to fail and demonstrates that brand extension ad content and repeated exposure to those advertisements influence consumer reactions to incongruent extensions. In a study of four highly regarded brands, participants who viewed brand extension advertisements five times evaluated incongruent extensions more positively, expressed higher usage intentions, indicated more favorable consistency judgments, and exhibited increased elaboration and more positive elaboration than did participants who viewed the advertisements only once. This relationship was attenuated for highly incongruent extensions, for which the advertisement evoked primarily peripheral brand associations instead of benefit brand associations. However, for moderately incongruent extensions, advertisements that evoked either peripheral or benefit associations were equally effective. Process measures indicate the importance of the extent and nature of elaborative processing.

Title: Slotting Allowances and Fees: Schools of Thought and the Views of Practicing Managers
Author-Name: Paul N. Bloom,

Author-Name: Joseph P. Cannon
Abstract: Slotting allowances and fees have attracted considerable attention and controversy since their introduction in the mid-1980s. Currently, two schools of thought dominate the debate on these fees. One considers them a tool for improving distribution efficiency, whereas the other proposes that the fees operate as a mechanism for enhancing market power and damaging competition. Managers and public policymakers are uncertain as to the effects of slotting fees and the appropriate strategy to adopt. The current study attempts to inform the debate surrounding slotting fees and provide guidance to managers and policymakers. The authors summarize the arguments of the two schools and investigate the views of managers toward them through a large-scale survey of manufacturer, wholesaler, and retailer grocery institutions. Though exploratory, the findings suggest that slotting fees shift the risk of new product introductions and help apportion the demand and supply of new products. The authors find that slotting fees are also associated with the exercise of retailer market power, are applied in a discriminatory fashion, and lead to higher retail prices. The authors encourage further research that examines slotting fees and their effects and indicate prospective directions.

Title: The Incumbent’s Curse? Incumbency, Size, and Radical Product Innovation
Author-Name: Rajesh K. Chandy, 
Author-Name: Gerard J. Tellis
Abstract: A common perception in the field of innovation is that large, incumbent firms rarely introduce radical product innovations. Such firms tend to solidify their market positions with relatively incremental innovations. They may even turn away entrepreneurs who come up with radical innovations, though they themselves had such entrepreneurial roots. As a result, radical innovations tend to come from small firms, the outsiders. This thesis, which we term the “incumbent’s curse,” is commonly accepted in academic and popular accounts of radical innovation. This topic is important, because radical product innovation is an engine of economic growth that has created entire industries and brought down giants while catapulting small firms to market leadership. Yet a review of the literature suggests that the evidence for the incumbent’s curse is based on anecdotes and scattered case studies of highly specialized innovations. It is not clear if it applies widely across several product categories. The authors reexamine the incumbent’s curse using a historical analysis of a relatively large number of radical innovations in the consumer durables and office products categories. In particular, the authors seek to answer the following questions: (1) How prevalent is this phenomenon? What percentage of radical innovations do incumbents versus nonincumbents introduce? What percentage of radical innovations do small firms versus large firms introduce? (2) Is the phenomenon a curse that invariably afflicts large incumbents in current industries? Is it driven by incumbency or size? and (3) How consistent is the phenomenon? Has the increasing size and complexity of firms over time accentuated it? Does it vary across national boundaries? Results from the study suggest that conventional wisdom about the incumbent’s curse may not always be valid.

Abstract: This article focuses on the sale of a product across channels that are entered sequentially. Using a two-channel model, the authors derive the optimal time to enter the second channel and then obtain a specific parametric solution for movie distributors regarding theater attendance and subsequent sales to video stores. Using data from 35 movies, the authors estimate exponential sales curves for both theater attendance and video rentals and demonstrate how knowledge of the sales parameters in the first channel (theaters) helps predict sales in the second channel (video rentals). Finally, from the movie distributor’s perspective, the authors calculate optimal release times based on the model and its estimated parameters. The results suggest that profits would increase if movies were released to video sooner than is the current practice.

Abstract: The authors conceptualize and empirically examine professional associations’ relationship-building efforts (core services performance, rewards for contributions, dissemination of organizational knowledge, member interdependence enhancement activities, and reliance on external membership requirements) that are theorized to enhance their membership’s commitment to the relationship as well as the membership’s relationship behaviors. Three components of commitment—affective, continuance, and normative—are theorized to mediate differentially the correlation between the associations’ relationship-building efforts and their members’ relationship behaviors (membership retention, exchange-based participation, and cooperatively based coproduction). Confirmatory factor analysis validates the commitment measures, and structural equations analysis indicates that normative and affective commitment partially mediate the effects of selected relationship-building efforts on coproduction and member participation. Core services performance was the only construct in the model found to affect member retention.

Author-Name: Mary Jo Bitner
Abstract: Self-service technologies (SSTs) are increasingly changing the way customers interact with firms to create service outcomes. Given that the emphasis in the academic literature has focused almost exclusively on the interpersonal dynamics of service encounters, there is much to be learned about customer interactions with technology-based self-service delivery options. In this research, the authors describe the results of a critical incident study based on more than 800 incidents involving SSTs solicited from customers through a Web-based survey. The authors categorize these incidents to discern the sources of satisfaction and dissatisfaction with SSTs. The authors present a discussion of the resulting critical incident categories and their relationship to customer attributions, complaining behavior, word of mouth, and repeat purchase intentions, which is followed by implications for managers and researchers.

Title: Understanding the Customer Base of Service Providers: An Examination of the Differences Between Switchers and Stayers
Author-Name: Jaishankar Ganesh,

Author-Name: Kristy E. Reynolds
Abstract: Creating and maintaining customer loyalty has become a strategic mandate in today’s service markets. Recent research suggests that customers differ in their value to a firm, and therefore customer retention and loyalty-building efforts should not necessarily be targeted to all customers of a firm. Given these sentiments, it is becoming increasingly necessary for firms to have a thorough understanding of their customer base. Yet current knowledge is limited in providing insights to firms regarding the differences within their customer base. This research comprises two studies in which the authors examine the differences among internal customer groups in a service industry. As theory suggests and as is empirically validated here, customers who have switched service providers because of dissatisfaction seem to differ significantly from other customer groups in their satisfaction and loyalty behaviors. The findings offer some interesting implications for both marketing theory and practice.

Title: Sales Call Anxiety: Exploring What It Means When Fear Rules a Sales Encounter
Author-Name: Willem Verbeke, 
Author-Name: Richard P. Bagozzi
Abstract: The goal of this study is to develop and test a conceptualization of sales call anxiety (SCA) on the basis of current insights from the cognitive approach to social anxiety. Sales call anxiety is an irrepressible fear of being negatively evaluated and rejected by a customer, and it is coupled with a desire to avoid undertaking specific functional actions in selling situations. The authors present and test a model of SCA in two selling situations known to have threatening consequences for salespeople: canvasing and closing. The authors find that SCA consists of four components: negative self-evaluations, negative evaluations from customers, awareness of physiological symptoms (e.g., a queasy stomach, shaky voice, blushing), and protective actions (e.g., avoiding eye contact, fiddling with the hands, shunning self-disclosures). The authors show that these dimensions are functions of negative affectivity and anxiety-provoking contextual cues and that they negatively influenced the performance of 189 mortgage salespeople.

Title: The Effects of Strategy Type on the Market Orientation-Performance Relationship

Abstract: Prior research has been equivocal on the role that competitive environment plays in moderating the relationship between market orientation and a firm’s business performance, even though such a moderating effect is conceptually quite plausible (Slater and Narver 1994). In this article, the authors empirically examine the role of business strategy type as an alternative, potential moderator of the market orientation-performance relationship. By using an improved version of Kohli and Jaworski’s market orientation scale (Jaworski and Kohli 1993; Kohli, Jaworski, and Kumar 1993), the authors find evidence that supports the moderating effects of business strategy type on the strength of the relationship between market orientation and business performance. The authors also offer implications and future research questions based on the findings.

Title: On the Profitability of Long-Life Customers in a Noncontractual Setting: An Empirical Investigation and Implications for Marketing
Author-Name: Werner J. Reinartz, 
Author-Name: V. Kumar
Abstract: Relationship marketing emphasizes the need for maintaining long-term customer relationships. It is beneficial, in general, to serve customers over a longer time, especially in a contractual relationship. However, it is not clear whether some of the findings observed in a contractual setting hold good in noncontractual scenarios: relationships between a seller and a buyer that are not governed by a contract or membership. The authors offer four different propositions in this study and subsequently test each one in a noncontractual context. The four propositions relate to whether (1) there exists a strong positive customer lifetime-profitability relationship, (2) profits increase over time, (3) the costs of serving long-life customers are less, and (4) long-life customers pay higher prices. The authors develop arguments both for and against each of the propositions. The data for this study, obtained from a large catalog retailer, cover a three-year window and are recorded on a daily basis. The empirical findings observed in this study challenge all the expectations derived from the literature. Long-life customers are not necessarily profitable customers. The authors develop plausible explanations for findings that go against the available evidence in the literature and identify three indicators through discriminant analysis that can help managers focus their efforts on more profitable customers. The authors draw several marketing implications and acknowledge the limitations of the study.

Abstract: Much of the recent literature on interfirm relationships has focused on strategies for controlling opportunism. Somewhat surprisingly, little attention has been paid in this literature to the opportunism construct itself. Specifically, prior research has failed to recognize the different types of behavior that are hidden behind the general opportunism label. As a consequence, the knowledge of strategies for managing opportunism remains incomplete. The authors review the original and emergent conceptualizations of opportunism and illustrate them using actual industry cases. The authors also develop a conceptual framework of governance strategies that can be used to manage different forms of opportunism.

Title: When Does Vertical Coordination Improve Industrial Purchasing Relationships?
Author-Name: Arnt Buvik, 
Author-Name: George John
Abstract: Vertically coordinated ties are purportedly effective responses to the uncertainties of fast-changing purchasing environments. Building on transaction costs arguments and related work in marketing, the authors analyze vertical coordination as a response to external uncertainty and show that its effectiveness is highly contingent on the magnitude of the safeguarding problem present. Indeed, its beneficial effects can be overwhelmed by the consequential increase in trading hazards. The authors use survey data from a sample of 161 industrial buyers to test the hypotheses. When specific investments are modest, greater vertical coordination diminishes transaction difficulties in adapting to high environmental uncertainty. Conversely, vertical coordination increases transaction difficulties when firms adapt to high environmental uncertainty and specific investments are substantial. The authors discuss the importance of these results for transaction cost theory and develop the results into a managerial decision framework for designing purchasing ties that balances safeguarding and adaptation.

Title: A Benefit Congruency Framework of Sales Promotion Effectiveness
Author-Name: Pierre Chandon, 
Author-Name: Brian Wansink, 
Author-Name: Gilles Laurent
Abstract: Are monetary savings the only explanation for consumer response to a sales promotion? If not, how do the different consumer benefits of a sales promotion influence its effectiveness? To address the first question, this research builds a framework of the multiple consumer benefits of a sales promotion. Through a series of measurement studies, the authors find that monetary and nonmonetary promotions provide consumers with different levels of three hedonic benefits (opportunities for value expression, entertainment, and exploration) and three utilitarian benefits (savings, higher product quality, and improved shopping convenience). To address the second question, the authors develop a benefit congruency framework, which argues that a sales promotion’s effectiveness is determined by the utilitarian or hedonic nature of the benefits it delivers and the congruence these benefits have with the promoted product. Among other results, two choice experiments show that, as predicted for high-equity brands, monetary promotions are more effective for utilitarian products than for hedonic products. The authors then discuss the implications of the multibenefit and the benefit congruency frameworks for understanding consumer responses to sales promotions, reexamining the value of everyday-low-price policies, and designing more effective sales promotions.

Title: The Commodification of the American West: Marketers’ Production of Cultural Meanings at the Trade Show
Author-Name: Lisa Peñaloza
Abstract: The author employs critical ethnographic methods to examine empirically marketers’ processes of producing cultural meanings at a western stock show and rodeo. Western cultural meanings and values of freedom, naturalism, competition, and family values are produced by marketers in attracting a nonranch audience; juxtaposing business, education, and entertainment; making ample references to historical tradition; and using business activity as the basis for claims of authenticity. Marketing implications center on tapping into rich sources of cultural meaning by (1) attending to the cultural dimensions of economic activity, (2) taking industry as the unit of analysis through an examination of representations of production in market discourses and practices, (3) expanding history from a research method to a source of market meaning, and (4) considering the marketplace as a lived tradition.

Title: Entry Barriers: A Dull-, One-, or Two-Edged Sword for Incumbents? Unraveling the Paradox from a Contingency Perspective
Author-Name: Jin K. Han, 
Author-Name: Namwoon Kim, 
Author-Name: Hong-Bumm Kim
Abstract: The long-held precept of equating entry barriers with sustainable incumbent advantage increasingly is met with skepticism as incidents of innovative late entrants leapfrogging over market incumbents become more pervasive across industries. Ostensibly, the reassessment of the traditional assumptions underlying entry barrier strategy has become imperative; to this end, the authors present a framework that investigates the contingent effects of incumbents’ barrier building on their own performance. Specifically, the authors examine five types of entry barriers (capital requirements, cost advantages, switching costs, distribution access, and proprietary assets) for the nature of their impact in the following presupposed yet unresolved roles: (1) as effectual versus ineffectual entry deterrents and (2) as enablers versus inhibitors of incumbents’ innovativeness. In addition, the authors take other variables into account (i.e., competitors’ innovativeness and incumbents’ market and technological orientation) to identify the contingencies of the framework. Using data from Korean consumer product industries, the authors empirically test and substantiate the variable (i.e., positive, negative, and neutral) impact of entry barriers on incumbents’ performance.

Title: Strategic Interdependence in Organizations: Deconglomeration and Marketing Strategy
Author-Name: P. Rajan Varadarajan, 
Author-Name: Satish Jayachandran, 
Author-Name: J. Chris White
Abstract: Although strategy exists at multiple levels in a firm (corporate, business, and functional), there is a dearth of research in marketing literature that focuses on the dependency among strategy at different levels. The authors address this issue by examining the relationship between deconglomeration and marketing strategy. Deconglomeration refers to the divestiture behavior of a conglomerate firm and the transformation of its business portfolio from one that is largely composed of several unrelated businesses to one composed of fewer and related businesses. Drawing on multiple theoretical perspectives, the authors propose a conceptual model delineating the environmental and organizational drivers of deconglomeration and its outcomes for marketing. The authors suggest that after deconglomeration, (1) a firm can be expected to be more competitor and customer oriented, (2) multimarket contact with competing firms and seller concentration will increase, (3) businesses retained by the firm will be more innovative and place greater emphasis on advertising compared with sales promotion, and (4) the firm’s culture may become more externally oriented. Furthermore, the locus of decision making for marketing strategy may shift more toward senior management levels. In summary, changes in a firm’s corporate strategy could lead to significant changes in the marketing strategy of its business units.

Title: Buyer-Supplier Relationships and Customer Firm Costs
Author-Name: Joseph P. Cannon, 
Author-Name: Christian Homburg
Abstract: Academic literature and business practice are directing increased attention to the importance of creating value in buyer-supplier relationships. One method for creating value is to reduce costs in commercial exchange. The authors develop a model that explains how supplier behaviors and the management of suppliers affect a customer firm’s direct product, acquisition, and operations costs. The model proposes that these costs mediate the relationship between buyer-supplier relationship behaviors and the customer firm’s intentions to expand future purchases from the supplier. The model is tested on data collected from almost 500 buying organizations in the United States and Germany. The results indicate that increased communication frequency, different forms of supplier accommodation, product quality, and the geographic closeness of the supplier’s facilities to the customer’s buying location lower customer firm costs. In addition, customer firms intend to increase purchases from suppliers that provide value by lowering each of these costs.

Title: Market Response to a Major Policy Change in the Marketing Mix: Learning from Procter & Gamble’s Value Pricing Strategy
Author-Name: Kusum L. Ailawadi, 
Author-Name: Donald R. Lehmann, 
Author-Name: Scott A. Neslin
Abstract: Much research has focused on how consumers and competitors respond to short-term changes in advertising and promotion. In contrast, the authors use Procter & Gamble’s (P&G’s) value pricing strategy as an opportunity to study consumer and competitor response to a major, sustained change in marketing-mix strategy. They compile data across 24 categories in which P&G has a significant market share, covering the period from 1990 to 1996, during which P&G instituted major cuts in deals and coupons and substantial increases in advertising. The authors estimate an econometric model to trace how consumers and competitors react to such changes. For the average brand, the authors find that deals and coupons increase market penetration and surprisingly have little impact on customer retention as measured by share-of-category requirements and category usage. For the average brand, advertising works primarily by increasing penetration, but its effect is weaker than that of promotion. The authors find that competitor response is related to how strongly the competitor’s market share is affected by the change in marketing mix and the competitor’s own response and to structural factors such as market share position and multimarket contact. The net impact of these consumer and competitor responses is a decrease in market share for the company that institutes sustained decreases in promotion coupled with increases in advertising.

Title: On the Optimality of Delegating Pricing Authority to the Sales Force
Author-Name: Kissan Joseph
Abstract: An important decision facing sales managers today is precisely how much pricing authority should be delegated to the sales force. Received theory suggests that the salesperson’s superior information about customers’ valuations will invariably make price delegation profitable for the firm. The empirical evidence, however, reveals that firms that grant full pricing authority generate lower profits than firms that limit pricing authority. Given this state of affairs, the author develops and analyzes a formal model that examines the optimality of delegating pricing authority to the sales force. The model preserves the notion of superior information assumed in the literature but considers as well a negative feature of much concern to practitioners, namely, the suboptimal substitution of selling effort by price discounting. The model reveals that providing the salesperson with full pricing authority is not always optimal. Specifically, in some environments, it is appropriate to limit pricing authority because this decision forces the salesperson to target high-valuation customers. In addition, the model predicts that the commission rate offered to the salesperson should be higher when pricing authority is limited. The author concludes by summarizing the context, calculus, and implications of the model with a view to assisting managers charged with the price-delegation decision.

Title: Pursuing the Value-Conscious Consumer: Store Brands Versus National Brand Promotions
Author-Name: Kusum L. Ailawadi, 
Author-Name: Scott A. Neslin, 
Author-Name: Karen Gedenk
Abstract: The objective of this article is to determine whether national brand promotions and store brands attract the same value-conscious consumers, which would aggravate channel conflict between manufacturers and retailers. The authors identify psychographic and demographic traits that potentially drive usage of store brands and national brand promotions. They then develop a framework and structural equation model to study the association of these traits with store brand and national brand promotion usage. The authors find that though demographics do not influence these behaviors directly, they have significant associations with psychographic characteristics and therefore are useful for market targeting. Most important, usage of store brands and usage of promotions, particularly out-of-store promotions, are associated with different psychographics. Store brand use correlates mainly with traits related to economic benefits and costs, whereas the use of out-of-store promotions is associated mainly with traits related to hedonic benefits and costs. These differences result in four well-defined and identifiable consumer segments: deal-focused consumers, store brand-focused consumers, deal and store brand users (use-all), and nonusers of both store brands and deals (use-none). Therefore, manufacturers and retailers have the opportunity to either avoid each other or compete head to head, depending on which segment they target.

Title: The Acquisition and Utilization of Information in New Product Alliances: A Strength-of-Ties Perspective
Author-Name: Aric Rindfleisch, 
Author-Name: Christine Moorman
Abstract: In this article, the authors examine the acquisition and utilization of information in new product alliances. Drawing from research in social network theory with a focus on the strength-of-ties literature, the authors suggest that horizontal alliances have lower levels of relational embeddedness and higher levels of knowledge redundancy than vertical alliances. The authors then suggest that though embeddedness enhances both the acquisition and utilization of information in alliances, redundancy diminishes information acquisition but enhances information utilization. The authors test these ideas using a sample of 106 U.S. firms that recently have participated in new product alliances. Although the results are broadly supportive of the predictions, they are also surprising because they question key underlying assumptions of the strength-of-ties literature. For example, closely tied individual actors are typically assumed to share both high levels of embeddedness and high levels of redundancy, but the present research finds that this assumption does not hold for organizational actors. The authors discuss the implications of these findings specifically for new product alliances and for research on tie strength among organizations in general.

Abstract: Marketing strategists who operate in turbulent markets face a competitive landscape marked by volatility and evolving market structures. As customer requirements change, an organization that stays in alignment with its markets will form new business units or alter the market charters of existing business units. In a longitudinal study, the authors traced the structural realignments that accompanied a Fortune-500 firm’s entry into the Internet market. As the charter moved from a freshly created unit to an established business unit, the authors found support for the prediction that the former organizational structure will continue to shape the identity, beliefs, and social ties of managers. The study highlights the structural, social, and cognitive factors that must be managed as corporate decision makers search for the best strategy-structure fit for an emerging market opportunity.

Abstract: This study examines the effect of reward structures on the performance of cross-functional product development teams. Results suggest that when it is easy to evaluate individual performances, position-based differential rewards lead to greater satisfaction. For long and complex projects, process-based rewards have a negative effect and outcome-based rewards have a positive effect on performance. For risky projects and highly competitive or relatively stable industries, a nonlinear and monotonically decreasing relationship exists between outcome-based rewards and product quality.

Title: Choice of Supplier in Embedded Markets: Relationship and Marketing Program Effects

Abstract: Recent research has documented how exchanges between buyers and sellers are frequently embedded in social relationships. An unresolved question, however, is the extent to which such relationships protect incumbent suppliers from new competitors and their marketing programs. The authors develop a conceptual framework of how relationship and marketing variables influence choice of supplier and test the framework empirically in the context of business-to-business services. The results show that interpersonal relationships between buyers and suppliers serve as a switching barrier but are considerably less important than both firm-level switching costs and marketing variables. Moreover, unlike switching costs, interpersonal relationships do not play the frequently mentioned role of a buffer against price and product competition. Finally, the authors show that buyers and suppliers hold systematically different views of the determinants of switching.

Title: Building Organizational Capabilities for Managing Economic Crisis: The Role of Market Orientation and Strategic Flexibility
Author-Name: Rajdeep Grewal, 
Author-Name: Patriya Tansuhaj
Abstract: Firms around the world often must manage and survive economic crises. Recent cases in Asia, Eastern Europe, and South America bear testimony to this point. As economic weak spots are integrated into the global economy, it is timely to develop an understanding of organizational capabilities that can help firms manage their way through such crises. The authors investigate the role of market orientation and strategic flexibility in helping Thai firms manage the recent Asian crisis. The results demonstrate the contingent nature of the influence of market orientation and strategic flexibility on firm performance after a crisis has occurred. As hypothesized, market orientation has an adverse effect on firm performance after a crisis. This effect is moderated by demand and technological uncertainty and is enhanced by competitive intensity. In contrast, strategic flexibility has a positive influence on firm performance after a crisis, which is enhanced by competitive intensity and moderated by demand and technological uncertainty. It seems that market orientation and strategic flexibility complement each other in their efficacy to help firms manage varying environmental conditions.

Title: The Chain of Effects from Brand Trust and Brand Affect to Brand Performance: The Role of Brand Loyalty

Abstract: The authors examine two aspects of brand loyalty, purchase loyalty and attitudinal loyalty, as linking variables in the chain of effects from brand trust and brand affect to brand performance (market share and relative price). The model includes product-level, category-related controls (hedonic value and utilitarian value) and brand-level controls (brand differentiation and share of voice). The authors compile an aggregate data set for 107 brands from three separate surveys of consumers and brand managers. The results indicate that when the product- and brand-level variables are controlled for, brand trust and brand affect combine to determine purchase loyalty and attitudinal loyalty. Purchase loyalty, in turn, leads to greater market share, and attitudinal loyalty leads to a higher relative price for the brand. The authors discuss the managerial implications of these results.

Abstract: Estimating current profitability at the individual customer level is important to distinguish the more profitable customers from the less profitable ones. This is also a first step in developing estimates of customers’ lifetime values. This exercise, however, takes on additional complexities when applied to an intermediary in a supply chain, such as a distributor, because the costs of servicing a retail customer include not only those incurred directly in servicing this customer but also those incurred by the distributor in dealing with its own vendors for goods supplied to this customer. The authors develop a general model and measurement methodology to relate customer profitability to customer characteristics in a supply chain. The authors show how heterogeneity in customer purchasing characteristics leads to important profit implications and illustrate the implementation of the methodology using data from a large distributor that supplies to grocery and other retail businesses.

Abstract: Business-to-business electronic markets have a profound influence on the manner in which organizational buyers and sellers interact. As a result, it is important to develop an understanding of the behaviors of firms that participate in these markets. The authors develop a typology for the nature of organizational participation to explain the behaviors of user firms in business-to-business electronic markets. The proposed model hypothesizes that the nature of participation depends on organizational motivation and ability. The authors conceptualize motivational factors in terms of efficiency and legitimacy motivations and theorize that ability results from the influence of organizational learning and information technology capabilities. They test the model using organizational-level survey data from jewelry traders that conduct business in an electronic market. The results indicate that both motivation and ability are important in determining the nature of participation; however, the level of influence of motivation and ability varies with the nature of participation.

Abstract: Through qualitative and empirical research, the authors find that the service quality construct conforms to the structure of a third-order factor model that ties service quality perceptions to distinct and actionable dimensions: outcome, interaction, and environmental quality. In turn, each has three subdimensions that define the basis of service quality perceptions. The authors further suggest that for each of these subdimensions to contribute to improved service quality perceptions, the quality received by consumers must be perceived to be reliable, responsive, and empathetic. The authors test and support this conceptualization across four service industries. They consider the research and managerial implications of the study and its limitations.

Title: Reducing Assortment: An Attribute-Based Approach
Author-Name: Peter Boatwright, 
Author-Name: Joseph C. Nunes
Abstract: Most supermarket categories are cluttered with items, or stockkeeping units (SKUs), that differ very little at the attribute level. Previous research has found that reductions (up to 54%) in the number of low-selling SKUs need not affect perceptions of variety and therefore sales, significantly. In this research, the authors analyze data from a natural experiment conducted by an online grocer, in which 94% of the categories experienced dramatic cuts in the number of SKUs offered, particularly low-selling SKUs. Sales were indeed affected dramatically, increasing an average of 11% across the 42 categories examined. Sales rose in more than two-thirds of these categories, nearly half of which experienced an increase of 10% or more; 75% of households increased their overall expenditures after the cut in SKUs. In turn, the authors examine how different types of SKU reductions—defined by how the cuts affect the available attributes or features of a category (e.g., the number of brands)—affected purchase behavior differently. The results indicate that consumers experienced divergent reactions to the reduction in sizes, but they uniformly welcomed the elimination of clutter brought on by the reduction in redundant items. In addition, of households that were loyal to a single brand, size, or brand–size combination that was eliminated, nearly half continued purchasing within the category. Also, contrary to previous research on SKU reductions, the authors find that category sales depend on the total number of SKUs offered. The authors extend the previous research by showing that (1) category sales depend on the availability of key product and category attributes and (2) two particularly important attributes to consumers in an assortment are brand and flavor.

Title: Successful and Unsuccessful Sales Calls: Measuring Salesperson Attributions and Behavioral Intentions
Author-Name: Andrea L. Dixon,

Author-Name: Maqbul Jamil
Abstract: Applying attribution theory to consumer behavior issues is quite common. In the managerial arena, previous research suggests that salespeople’s attribution processes affect their expectancies for success and future behavior. However, no published research has developed adequate measures that might be used to examine the full range of attributional responses for sales success or failure and the behaviors that are likely to follow such attributions. The goal of this research is to develop a complete set of attributional and behavioral scales for sales success and failure and validate such scales in a real-world context—among field sales representatives. Following Churchill’s (1979) recommended process, the authors develop a complete set of attributional and behavioral intention scales that is applicable to a field sales force setting. The authors then measure 228 financial services representatives’ performance attributions for a previous sales interaction; their intended behaviors for a future, similar selling situation; and their personal characteristics. The authors test the validities of the scales and examine the usefulness of applying the scales within a theoretically justified nomological network of relationships.

Abstract: Despite the enormous benefits of early-detection products, consumers are reluctant to use them. The authors explore this reluctance, testing alternative approaches to communicating the consequences of detection behaviors. The results suggest that anecdotal messages are more involving than statistical messages and that positive anecdotes (about gains from screening) are less persuasive than negative anecdotes (about the losses from failing to get screened); positive anecdotes appear to cause a “boomerang” effect. The authors discuss implications for promoting consumer risk-reduction behaviors.

Abstract: This article focuses on the impact of a new brand extension introduction on choice in a behavioral context using national household scanner data involving multiple brand extensions. Particularly, the authors investigate the reciprocal impact of trial of successful and unsuccessful brand extensions on parent brand choice. In addition, the authors examine the effects of experience with the parent brand on consumers’ trial and repeat of a brand extension using household scanner data on six brand extensions from a national panel. In the case of successful brand extensions, the results show positive reciprocal effects of extension trial on parent brand choice, particularly among prior non-users of the parent brand, and consequently on market share. The authors find evidence for potential negative reciprocal effects of unsuccessful extensions. In addition, the study shows that experience with the parent brand has a significant impact on extension trial, but not on extension repeat.

Title: The Impact of Category Management on Retailer Prices and Performance: Theory and Evidence
Author-Name: Suman Basuroy,

Author-Name: Rockney G. Walters
Abstract: Category management (CM) is a recent retail management initiative that aims at improving a retailer’s overall performance in a product category through more coordinated buying, merchandising, and pricing of the brands in the category than in the past. Despite tremendous retailer and manufacturer interest in the process of CM and its rapid adoption in the industry, much uncertainty exists about the consequences of CM for channel members. The present study focuses on how a shift to CM by a retailer affects its equilibrium prices, sales, and profitability in a competitive retail setting. On the basis of an analysis of a model of two competing national brand manufacturers that supply two competing common retailers, the authors find that one retailer’s adoption of CM increases its average unit price of the category and reduces its sales volume and revenues. However, this retailer can still enjoy an increase in its gross margin profits as competing manufacturers’ wholesale prices fall in the process. Also, the CM adopter’s profits are greater than those of a symmetric competing retailer that follows the traditional brand-centered management of a product category when the interbrand competition is high but interstore competition is low. Applying the intervention analysis methodology, the authors empirically test several of these analytical findings, employing a unique data set that contains information about a supermarket chain’s weekly average unit prices and sales of the laundry detergent category before and after this product category was moved to CM by the retailer. The propositions that adoption of CM will lead to higher retail prices and lower sales are upheld in this empirical study. The authors discuss the implications of these findings for practitioners and researchers, the limitations of the study, and directions for further research.

Title: Investments in Consumer Relationships: A Cross-Country and Cross-Industry Exploration
Author-Name: Kristof De Wulf, 
Author-Name: Gaby Odekerken-Schröder, 
Author-Name: Dawn Iacobucci
Abstract: This research, investigating retailer-consumer relationships, has three distinct intended contributions: (1) It shows that different relationship marketing tactics have a differential impact on consumer perceptions of a retailer’s relationship investment; (2) it demonstrates that perceived relationship investment affects relationship quality, ultimately leading to behavioral loyalty; and (3) it reveals that the effect of perceived relationship investment on relationship quality is contingent on a consumer’s product category involvement and proneness to engage in retail relationships. The authors empirically cross-validate the underlying conceptual model by studying six consumer samples in a three-country, transatlantic, comparative survey that investigates two industries.

Title: Dependence, Trust, and Relational Behavior on the Part of Foreign Subsidiary Marketing Operations: Implications for Managing Global Marketing Operations
Author-Name: Kelly Hewett, 
Author-Name: William O. Bearden
Abstract: The authors explore how a global firm’s ability to foster successful relationships between its foreign subsidiaries’ and headquarters’ marketing operations can enhance the performance of products across markets. The results show that cooperative behaviors are positively associated with product performance in the subsidiaries’ markets. National culture in the foreign markets is also found to moderate the effect of trust on relational behaviors. In addition, the subsidiaries’ acquiescence becomes increasingly important as the firm attempts to standardize marketing programs.

Title: Logistics Service Quality as a Segment-Customized Process

Abstract: Logistics excellence has become a powerful source of competitive differentiation within diverse marketing offerings of world-class firms. Although researchers have suggested that logistics competencies complement marketing efforts, empirical evidence is lacking on what logistics service quality means to customers and whether it has different meanings for separate customer segments. The authors present empirical support for nine related logistics service quality constructs; demonstrate their unidimensionality, validity, and reliability across four customer segments of a large logistics organization; and provide empirical support for a logistics service quality process. Although structural equation modeling offers support for the logistics service quality process across customer segments, the authors find that the relative parameter estimates differ for each segment, which suggests that firms ought to customize their logistics services by customer segments.

Title: Consumer Trust, Value, and Loyalty in Relational Exchanges
Author-Name: Deepak Sirdeshmukh, 
Author-Name: Jagdip Singh, 
Author-Name: Barry Sabol
Abstract: The authors develop a framework for understanding the behaviors and practices of service providers that build or deplete consumer trust and the mechanisms that convert consumer trust into value and loyalty in relational exchanges. The proposed framework (1) uses a multidimensional conceptualization for the trustworthiness construct; (2) incorporates two distinct facets of consumer trust, namely, frontline employees and management policies and practices; and (3) specifies value as a key mediator of the trust–loyalty relationship. The authors test the proposed model using data from two service contexts—retail clothing (N = 264) and nonbusiness airline travel (N = 113). The results support a tripartite view of trustworthiness evaluations along operational competence, operational benevolence, and problem-solving orientation dimensions. Moreover, the authors find evidence of contingent asymmetric relationships between trustworthiness dimensions and consumer trust. For frontline employees, benevolent behaviors demonstrate a dominant “negativity” effect (i.e., a unit negative performance has a stronger effect than a unit positive performance), whereas problem-solving orientation has a dominant “positivity” effect (i.e., a unit positive performance has a stronger effect than a unit negative performance). Value completely mediates the effect of frontline employee trust on loyalty in the retailing context and partially mediates the effect of management policies and practices trust on loyalty in the airlines context. The role of frontline employees is more critical in the retailing context, whereas management practices and policies play the dominant role in the airlines context. Overall, the proposed framework successfully models trust and loyalty mechanisms across the two industries examined in the study, while remaining sensitive to essential contextual differences.

Title: Building Brand Community
Author-Name: James H. McAlexander, 
Author-Name: John W. Schouten, 
Author-Name: Harold F. Koenig
Abstract: A brand community from a customer-experiential perspective is a fabric of relationships in which the customer is situated. Crucial relationships include those between the customer and the brand, between the customer and the firm, between the customer and the product in use, and among fellow customers. The authors delve ethnographically into a brand community and test key findings through quantitative methods. Conceptually, the study reveals insights that differ from prior research in four important ways: First, it expands the definition of a brand community to entities and relationships neglected by previous research. Second, it treats vital characteristics of brand communities, such as geotemporal concentrations and the richness of social context, as dynamic rather than static phenomena. Third, it demonstrates that marketers can strengthen brand communities by facilitating shared customer experiences in ways that alter those dynamic characteristics. Fourth, it yields a new and richer conceptualization of customer loyalty as integration in a brand community.

Title: Strategic Bundling of Products and Prices: A New Synthesis for Marketing
Author-Name: Stefan Stremersch, 
Author-Name: Gerard J. Tellis
Abstract: Bundling is pervasive in today’s markets. However, the bundling literature contains inconsistencies in the use of terms and ambiguity about basic principles underlying the phenomenon. The literature also lacks an encompassing classification of the various strategies, clear rules to evaluate the legality of each strategy, and a unifying framework to indicate when each is optimal. Based on a review of the marketing, economics, and law literature, this article develops a new synthesis of the field of bundling, which provides three important benefits. First, the article clearly and consistently defines bundling terms and identifies two key dimensions that enable a comprehensive classification of bundling strategies. Second, it formulates clear rules for evaluating the legality of each of these strategies. Third, it proposes a framework of 12 propositions that suggest which bundling strategy is optimal in various contexts. The synthesis provides managers with a framework with which to understand and choose bundling strategies. It also provides researchers with promising avenues for further research.

Title: The Effects of Ingredient Branding Strategies on Host Brand Extendibility
Author-Name: Kalpesh Kaushik Desai, 
Author-Name: Kevin Lane Keller
Abstract: A decision of increasing importance is how ingredient attributes that make up a product should be labeled or branded, if at all. The authors conduct a laboratory experiment to consider how ingredient branding affects consumer acceptance of a novel line extension (or one that has not been introduced before) as well as the ability of the brand to leverage that ingredient to introduce future category extensions. The authors study two particular types of novel line extensions or brand expansions: (1) slot-filler expansions, in which the level of one existing product attribute changes (e.g., a scent in Tide detergent that is new to the laundry detergent category) and (2) new attribute expansions, in which an entirely new attribute or characteristic is added to the product (e.g., cough relief liquid added to Life Savers candy). The authors examine two types of ingredient branding strategies by branding the target attribute ingredient for the brand expansion with either a new name as a self-branded ingredient (e.g., Tide with its own EverFresh scented bath soap) or an established, well-respected name as a cobranded ingredient (e.g., Tide with Irish Spring scented bath soap). The results indicate that with slot-filler expansions, a cobranded ingredient facilitates initial expansion acceptance, but a self-branded ingredient leads to more favorable subsequent category extension evaluations. With more dissimilar new attribute expansions, however, a cobranded ingredient leads to more favorable evaluations of both the initial expansion and the subsequent category extension. The authors offer interpretation, implications, and limitations of the findings, as well as directions for further research.

Title: Free Cash Flow, Agency Costs, and the Affordability Method of Advertising Budgeting
Author-Name: Kissan Joseph, 
Author-Name: Vernon J. Richardson
Abstract: The allocation of excess cash has long been recognized in the finance literature as an important aspect of the basic agency conflict between managers and owners. In the advertising budgeting context, marketing scholars report that firms possessing high levels of cash tend to spend more on advertising than what seems necessary or desirable. Indeed, this positive link between excess cash and advertising expenditures constitutes a part of what is commonly referred to as the affordability method of advertising budgeting. Surprisingly, there has been little research that attempts to view this association as a manifestation of agency costs. Therefore, in this article, the authors examine whether agency costs, as measured by managerial ownership, moderate the relationship between excess cash and advertising expenditures. On the basis of received theory, the authors conceptualize that agency costs will first decrease, then increase, and then decrease again with the level of managerial ownership. Accordingly, the authors hypothesize and find that the fraction of incremental earnings reinvested in advertising follows the same pattern in managerial ownership. These findings support the notion that the use of the affordability method is driven, in part, by agency costs. The authors conclude by discussing the theoretical and managerial implications of the findings.

Title: Riding the Saddle: How Cross-Market Communications Can Create a Major Slump in Sales
Author-Name: Jacob Goldenberg, 
Author-Name: Barak Libai, 
Author-Name: Eitan Muller
Abstract: Using data on a large number of innovative products in the consumer electronics industry, the authors find that between one-third and one-half of the sales cases involved the following pattern: an initial peak, then a trough of sufficient depth and duration to exclude random fluctuations, and eventually sales levels that exceeded the initial peak. This newly identified pattern, which the authors call a “saddle,” is explained by the dual-market phenomenon that differentiates between early market adopters and main market adopters as two separate markets. If these two segments—the early market and the main market—adopt at different rates, and if this difference is pronounced, then the overall sales to the two markets will exhibit a temporary decline at the intermediate stage. The authors employ both empirical analysis and cellular automata, an individual-level, complex system modeling technique for generating and analyzing data, to investigate the conditions under which a saddle occurs. The model highlights the importance of cross-market communication in determining the existence of a saddle. At low levels of this parameter, more than 50% of the cases of new product growth involved a saddle. This percentage gradually decreased as the parameter increased, and at values close to the within-market parameters, the proportion of saddle occurrences dropped below 5%.

Title: The Market Valuation of Internet Channel Additions

Abstract: The emergence of the Internet has pushed many established companies to explore this radically new distribution channel. Like all market discontinuities, the Internet creates opportunities as well as threats—it can be performance-enhancing as readily as it can be performance-destroying. Making use of event-study methodology, the authors assess the net impact of adding an Internet channel on a firm’s stock market return, a measure of the change in expected future cash flows. The authors find that, on average, Internet channel investments are positive net-present-value investments. The authors then identify firm, introduction strategy, and marketplace characteristics that influence the direction and magnitude of the stock market reaction. The results indicate that powerful firms with a few direct channels are expected to achieve greater gains in financial performance than are less powerful firms with a broader direct channel offering. In terms of order of entry, early followers have a competitive advantage over both innovators and later followers, even when time of entry is controlled for. The authors also find that Internet channel additions that are supported by more publicity are perceived as having a higher performance potential.

Abstract: Research on how store environment cues influence consumers’ store choice decision criteria, such as perceived merchandise value and shopping experience costs, is sparse. Especially absent is research on the simultaneous impact of multiple store environment cues. The authors propose a comprehensive store choice model that includes (1) three types of store environment cues (social, design, and ambient) as exogenous constructs, (2) various store choice criteria (including shopping experience costs that heretofore have not been included in store choice models) as mediating constructs, and (3) store patronage intentions as the endogenous construct. They then empirically examine the extent to which environmental cues influence consumers’ assessments of a store on various store choice criteria and how those assessments, in turn, influence patronage intentions. The results of two different studies provide support for the model. The authors conclude by discussing the results to develop an agenda for additional research and explore managerial implications.

Title: Passing the Torch: Intergenerational Influences as a Source of Brand Equity
Author-Name: Elizabeth S. Moore,

Author-Name: Richard J. Lutz
Abstract: In today’s competitive battleground, the concept of brand equity has proved to be an important source of strategic insights for marketers. However, one potentially valuable source of brand equity—the operation of intergenerational influences—has generally been overlooked in the marketing literature. This article reports the findings of two studies that show intergenerational impacts on brand equity to be persistent and powerful across an array of consumer packaged goods. However, as a strategic challenge, these effects seem to apply strongly for some brands but not for others—they are selective. In Study 1, the authors use parallel surveys of mother–daughter dyads to isolate and quantify intergenerational impacts, and the surveys reveal a differential range of effects at both the product category and the brand level. In Study 2, the authors use interpretivist methods to delve more deeply into these effects—the forms they take, the way they have developed, and factors that sustain or disrupt them. On the basis of these findings, the authors identify implications for managers and future research needs. Overall, intergenerational influences are a real marketplace phenomenon and a factor that merits much closer attention from marketing strategists who are interested in brand equity issues.

Abstract: Most firms struggle with the challenge of managing their key customer accounts. There is a significant gap between the importance of this organizational design problem in practice and the research attention paid to it. Sound academic research on key account management (KAM) is limited and fragmented. Drawing on research on KAM and team selling, the authors develop an integrative conceptualization of KAM and define key constructs in four areas: (1) activities, (2) actors, (3) resources, and (4) approach formalization. Adopting a configurational perspective to organizational research, the authors then use numerical taxonomy to empirically identify eight prototypical KAM approaches on the basis of a cross-industry, cross-national study. The results show significant performance differences among the approaches. Overall, the article builds a bridge between marketing organization research and relationship marketing research.

Title: Role Stress and Effectiveness in Horizontal Alliances
Author-Name: Arne Nygaard, 
Author-Name: Robert Dahlstrom
Abstract: Horizontal arrangements are increasingly deployed in organizational networks, yet research has rarely examined the effectiveness of these alliances. The coalition of disparate corporate cultures yields appreciable levels of role stress for people in boundary-spanning positions. Dedicated assets and communication modality are factors that influence the level of role ambiguity and conflict. The authors implicate these facets of role stress as antecedents to four forms of effectiveness drawn from the competing values framework. The authors present alternative perspectives that examine the relationship between stress and performance. The received view frames role stressors as linear, negative antecedents to organizational outcomes. The authors contrast this perspective with theories that espouse triphasic, parabolic, and interactive influences of stressors on organizational outcomes. Data gathered with 218 managers of dual-branded retail oil outlets indicate that the relevance of these alternative perspectives is mitigated by the form of effectiveness pursued by the organization. The results support a linear relationship between role conflict and bargaining efforts, yet they also offer evidence of nonlinear influences of role ambiguity on contributions to sales, customer satisfaction, and competence. The study concludes with a discussion of relevance of the findings to the management of horizontal alliances and to interorganizational theory.

Title: Managing Business-to-Business Customer Relationships Following Key Contact Employee Turnover in a Vendor Firm
Author-Name: Neeli Bendapudi, 
Author-Name: Robert P. Leone
Abstract: Customers form relationships with the employees who serve them as well as with the vendor firms these employees represent. In many cases, a customer’s relationship with an employee who is closest to them, a key contact employee, may be stronger than the customer’s relationship with the vendor firm. If the key contact employee is no longer available to serve that customer, the vendor firm’s relationship with the customer may become vulnerable. In this article, the authors present the results of two studies that examine what business-to-business customers value in their relationships with key contact employees, what customers’ concerns are when a favored key contact employee is no longer available to serve them, and what vendor firms can do to alleviate these concerns and to retain employee knowledge even if they cannot retain the employee in that position. The studies are based on a discovery-oriented approach and integrate input from business-to-business customers, key contact employees, and managers from a broad cross-section of companies to develop testable propositions. The authors discuss managerial and theoretical implications and directions for further research.

Abstract: The subject of service convenience is important in service economies, yet little is known about this topic. The consumer convenience literature—strong in certain respects, underdeveloped in other respects—gives insufficient attention to service convenience. The prevailing pattern is either to treat service convenience generally or to lump services and goods together into an overall convenience construct. The authors seek to stimulate a higher level of research activity and dialogue by proposing a more comprehensive and multidimensional conceptualization of service convenience and a model delineating its antecedents and consequences. The authors build their case by systematically examining the convenience literature, explicating the dimensions and types of service convenience, developing the overall model and related research propositions, and presenting directions for further research.

Title: Consumers’ Search and Use of Nutrition Information:The Challenge and Promise of the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act
Author-Name: Siva K. Balasubramanian,

Abstract: Four studies investigate the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act’s (NLEA’s) impact on how consumers use nutrition information. Field and laboratory studies compare, but do not detect any changes in, consumers’ search for nutrition information or their recall of this information in the pre- and post-NLEA periods. However, the search activities of a select group (highly motivated and less knowledgeable consumers) benefited more from the NLEA than did other groups. Additional results from the field and lab studies indicate that the NLEA changed attention to negative nutrition attributes (such as fat and sodium, of which less is better) more than it changed attention to positive attributes such as calcium and vitamins. Analyses of scanner databases confirm this trend (with the exception of calories). Focus group results also reflect these findings. The authors discuss implications for public policy, management, academic research, and consumer welfare.

Abstract: The recent literature suggests a potential tension between market orientation and entrepreneurial proclivity in achieving superior business performance. This is unsettling for marketers, because it could mean that being market oriented is detrimental to a firm that is also trying to be entrepreneurial and successful. To examine this unnerving potential, the authors investigate structural influences (both direct and indirect) of entrepreneurial proclivity and market orientation on business performance. The results indicate that entrepreneurial proclivity has not only a positive and direct relationship on market orientation but also an indirect and positive effect on market orientation through the reduction of departmentalization. The results also suggest that entrepreneurial proclivity’s performance influence is positive when mediated by market orientation but negative or nonsignificant when not mediated by market orientation. The authors also provide a discussion and future research implications.

Abstract: The authors examine 308 firms in the United States and four other Western countries to understand how different types of firms relate to their markets. Comparative analysis shows that though there is some support for consumer and goods firms being more transactional and business and service firms being more relational, there are many exceptions. The results also show that firms can be grouped into those whose marketing practices are predominantly transactional, predominantly relational, or a transactional/relational hybrid. Each group constitutes approximately one-third of the sample and includes all types of firms (consumer goods, consumer services, business-to-business goods, and business-to-business services). This suggests that marketing practices are pluralistic and managerial practice has not shifted from transactional to relational approaches per se.

Title: Technological Opportunism and Radical Technology Adoption: An Application to E-Business
Author-Name: Raji Srinivasan, 
Author-Name: Gary L. Lilien, 
Author-Name: Arvind Rangaswamy
Abstract: Using the resource-based view of the firm, the authors hypothesize that differences in adoption of radical technologies among firms can be attributed to a sense-and-respond capability of firms with respect to new technologies, which is termed technological opportunism. Using survey data from senior managers in business-to-business firms, the authors study the adoption of e-business, a radical technology with the potential to alter business models. The authors first establish the distinctiveness of technological opportunism from related constructs, such as organizational innovativeness, and show that it offers a significantly better explanation of technology adoption than existing constructs do. In a follow-up survey of senior managers, the authors investigate the antecedents of technological opportunism and find that organizations can develop technological opportunism by taking specific actions such as focusing on the future, by having top management advocate new technologies, and by becoming more of an adhocracy culture and less of a hierarchy culture. The proposed technological opportunism construct can inform theory development on the relative emphasis on internal (research and development) versus external (buying, licensing) development of technologies and the complementarities in technology orientation and market orientation in the firm. The results can be used by managers who seek to develop the technological opportunism capability of their firms and by those in technology vendor firms who seek to develop segmentation strategies based on the technological opportunism capabilities of their customer firms.

Title: When Does Trust Matter? Antecedents and Contingent Effects of Supervisee Trust on Performance in Selling New Products in China and the United States
Author-Name: Kwaku Atuahene-Gima, 
Author-Name: Haiyang Li
Abstract: There is a strong normative bias toward the inherent value of trust among both marketing researchers and practitioners. Yet there is little empirical evidence of a positive impact of trust on performance. Indeed, scholars suggest that the sources of trust may provide opportunities for its abuse. Following this line of thinking, the authors investigate the dual roles of sales controls and supervisor behaviors as antecedents of salespeople’s belief in the benevolence of the supervisor (i.e., supervisee trust). The authors then examine these antecedents as moderators of the relationship between supervisee trust and sales performance in the context of selling new products. Data on field salespeople from high-technology firms in China and the United States suggest that factors such as supervisor accessibility engender supervisee trust but do not necessarily enhance its impact on sales performance. In the Chinese sample, supervisee trust enhances sales performance when output control is adopted, when the supervisor has a higher level of achievement orientation style, and when the salesperson has higher role ambiguity. Furthermore, the results suggest that the supervisee trust-sales performance relationship is negative when supervisor accessibility is high. With the exception of achievement orientation and supervisor accessibility, these effects are negative or nonexistent in the U.S. sample. The authors discuss theoretical and practical implications of the study’s findings.

Title: The Role of the Institutional Environment in Marketing Channels
Author-Name: Rajdeep Grewal, 
Author-Name: Ravi Dharwadkar
Abstract: Set within the political economy framework, marketing channels literature predominantly has used an efficiency-based task environment perspective and largely overlooked a legitimacy-based institutional environment approach in studying channel attitudes, behaviors, processes, and structures. The purpose of this article is to highlight the importance of the institutional environment and develop a comprehensive conceptual framework that incorporates the institutional environment into current marketing channels research. The institutional environment perspective relies on the primacy of (1) regulatory institutions (e.g., laws), (2) normative institutions (e.g., professions), and (3) cognitive institutions (e.g., habitual actions) in influencing the legitimacy of channel members. Using institutional theory, the authors augment the current task environment approach by developing three institutional processes and their underlying mechanisms and elaborating on how these institutions might influence channel relationships. The article ends by laying out a research agenda and highlighting managerial implications.

Title: The Hidden Minefields in the Adoption of Sales Force Automation Technologies
Author-Name: Cheri Speier, 
Author-Name: Viswanath Venkatesh
Abstract: Sales force automation technologies are increasingly used to support customer relationship management strategies; however, commentary in the practitioner press suggests high failure rates. The authors use identity theory as a lens to better understand salesperson perceptions associated with technology rejection. They collected survey data from 454 salespeople across two firms that had implemented sales force automation tools. The results indicate that immediately after training, salespeople had positive perceptions of the technology. However, six months after implementation, the technology had been widely rejected, and salesperson absenteeism and voluntary turnover had significantly increased. There were also significant decreases in perceptions of organizational commitment, job satisfaction, person-organization fit, and person-job fit across both firms. Finally, salespeople with stronger professional commitment indicated more negative job-related perceptions as experience with the technology increased.

Title: Exploring the Phenomenon of Customers’ Desired Value Change in a Business-to-Business Context
Author-Name: Daniel J. Flint, 
Author-Name: Robert B. Woodruff, 
Author-Name: Sarah Fisher Gardial
Abstract: Increasingly, organizations are pushed to adopt customer value strategies in order to grow profits and ensure long-term survival. Yet little is known about the dynamic nature of how customers perceive value from suppliers. The authors present findings from a grounded theory study conducted in a business-to-business context that sheds light on the nature of customers’ desired value change and related contextual conditions. The authors discover that the phenomenon of customers’ desired value change typically occurs in an emotional context, as managers try to cope with feelings of tension. The phenomenon extends well past the change itself into strategies customers use to motivate suppliers to meet their changed needs. Customers’ value change provides a reason for customers to seek, maintain, or move away from relationships with suppliers.

Title: Market Orientation and Alternative Strategic Orientations: A Longitudinal Assessment of Performance Implications
Author-Name: Charles H. Noble, 
Author-Name: Rajiv K. Sinha, 
Author-Name: Ajith Kumar
Abstract: Although the merits of maintaining a market orientation have been extensively discussed in the literature, studies examining the empirical link between market orientation and performance have shown mixed results. The authors explore the relative performance effects of various dimensions of market orientation using a longitudinal approach based on letters to shareholders in corporate annual reports. Furthermore, the authors examine the relative effects of alternative strategic orientations that reflect different managerial priorities for the firm. The authors also extend previous work by considering the mediating effects of organizational learning and innovativeness on the orientation-performance relationship. The results show that firms possessing higher levels of competitor orientation, national brand focus, and selling orientation exhibit superior performance.

Title: The GMS: A Broad Conceptualization of Global Marketing Strategy and Its Effect on Firm Performance
Author-Name: Shaoming Zou, 
Author-Name: S. Tamer Cavusgil
Abstract: Despite the strong interest in global marketing, there is no consensus in the literature about what constitutes global marketing strategy and whether it affects a firm’s global market performance. The authors develop a broad conceptualization of global marketing strategy, the GMS, that integrates three major perspectives—namely, the standardization, configuration–coordination, and integration perspectives—of global marketing strategy. They also develop a conceptual model that links the GMS to a firm’s global market performance. On the basis of a survey of business units competing in global industries, the authors find support for the broad GMS perspective and the fundamental relationship between the GMS and firms’ global market performance. The authors also discuss theoretical and managerial implications of their findings.

Title: A Longitudinal Study of Complaining Customers’ Evaluations of Multiple Service Failures and Recovery Efforts
Author-Name: James G. Maxham III, 
Author-Name: Richard G. Netemeyer
Abstract: The authors report a repeated measures field study that captures complaining customers’ perceptions of their overall satisfaction with the firm, likelihood of word-of-mouth recommendations, and repurchase intent during a 20-month span that includes two service failures and recovery attempts. The findings suggest that though satisfactory recoveries can produce a “recovery paradox” after one failure, they do not trigger such paradoxical increases after two failures. Furthermore, “double deviations” can occur following two consecutive unsatisfactory recoveries or following an unsatisfactory recovery in response to a second failure. The findings indicate that customers reporting an unsatisfactory recovery followed by a satisfactory recovery reported significantly higher ratings at the second postrecovery period than did customers reporting the opposite recovery sequence. The outcome of the second recovery also demonstrated a significant influence on customer ratings (positively if the recovery was satisfactory, negatively if the recovery was unsatisfactory), regardless of whether the customer found the first recovery satisfactory or unsatisfactory. In addition, although the increased change in recovery expectations and failure severity ratings from the first failure to the second is more dramatic for customers who previously reported a satisfactory recovery, the increase in attributions of blame toward the firm is more pronounced for customers who previously reported an unsatisfactory recovery. Last, the results show that recovery efforts are attenuated when two similar failures occur and when two failures happen in close time proximity.

Title: Getting Return on Quality: Revenue Expansion, Cost Reduction, or Both?
Author-Name: Roland T. Rust, 
Author-Name: Christine Moorman, 
Author-Name: Peter R. Dickson
Abstract: Financial benefits from quality may be derived from revenue expansion, cost reduction, or both simultaneously. The literature on both market orientation and customer satisfaction provides considerable support for the effectiveness of the revenue expansion perspective, whereas the literature on both quality and operations provides equally impressive support for the effectiveness of the cost reduction perspective. There is, however, little evidence for the effectiveness of attempting both revenue expansion and cost reduction simultaneously, and some of what little empirical and theoretical literature is available suggests that emphasizing both simultaneously may not work. In a study of managers in firms seeking to obtain a financial return from quality improvements, the authors address the issue of which quality profitability emphasis (revenue expansion, cost reduction, or both) is most effective. The authors examine firm performance using managers’ reports of firm performance and longitudinal secondary data on firm profitability and stock returns. Although it is clear that no company can neglect either revenue expansion or cost reduction, the empirical results suggest that firms that adopt primarily a revenue expansion emphasis perform better than firms that try to emphasize cost reduction and better than firms that try to emphasize both revenue expansion and cost reduction simultaneously. The results have implications with respect to how both theory and practice view organizational efforts to achieve financial returns from quality improvements.

Title: Measuring the Price Knowledge Shoppers Bring to the Store
Author-Name: Marc Vanhuele, 
Author-Name: Xavier Drèze
Abstract: Reference price research suggests that consumers memorize and recall price information when selecting brands for frequently purchased products. Previous price-knowledge surveys, however, indicate that memory for prices is lower than expected. In this study, the authors show that these price-knowledge surveys provide imperfect estimates of price knowledge, because they focus only on recall and short-term memory. The authors propose, instead, to use a combination of price recall, price recognition, and deal recognition to measure the degree to which consumers use auditory verbal, visual Arabic, or analogue magnitude representations to memorize prices. The authors show how the combination of these three measures provides a much richer understanding of consumers’ knowledge of prices. The results suggest that the price knowledge involved in reference prices may often not be accessible to recall but shows up in price recognition and deal recognition. In addition, the authors identify consumer and product characteristics that explain the variations in price knowledge. They find, for example, that frequent promotions increase consumers’ ability to remember regular prices and that store switchers do not possess better price knowledge than other shoppers.

Title: Service Orientation of a Retailer’s Business Strategy: Dimensions, Antecedents, and Performance Outcomes
Author-Name: Christian Homburg, 
Author-Name: Wayne D. Hoyer, 
Author-Name: Martin Fassnacht
Abstract: Augmenting products with services is a major way retailers have of gaining differentiation in today’s competitive market. Despite its importance, this topic has received relatively little research attention. Unlike previous research, this study adopts a more comprehensive perspective on retail services by examining three important research gaps related to a service-oriented business strategy: First, the authors elaborate on the dimensions of a service-oriented business strategy and introduce a new measure of this strategy. Second, the authors examine the antecedents of a service-oriented business strategy. In practice, there appears to be considerable variability in terms of the extent to which retailers demonstrate a service orientation, but there is a major gap in the understanding of what factors influence this orientation. Third, the authors investigate the neglected link between a service-oriented business strategy and performance outcomes. To examine these three important areas, the authors conducted an empirical study of clothing and furniture retailers in both the United States and Germany. This study provides evidence for the proposed conceptualization of a service-oriented business strategy. The authors also find that the investigated antecedents account for some variance of a service-oriented business strategy, which in turn positively affects company performance in the market and thereby profitability. Furthermore, the authors discuss several important research issues as well as managerial implications and future research avenues.

Title: A Configuration Theory Assessment of Marketing Organization Fit with Business Strategy and Its Relationship with Marketing Performance
Author-Name: Douglas W. Vorhies, 
Author-Name: Neil A. Morgan
Abstract: Theory posits that organizing marketing activities in ways that fit the implementation requirements of a business’s strategy enhances performance. However, conceptual and methodological problems make it difficult to empirically assess this proposition in the holistic way that it is theoretically framed. Drawing on configuration theory approaches in management, the authors address these problems by assessing marketing organization fit with business strategy as the degree to which a business’s marketing organization differs from that of an empirically derived ideal profile that achieves superior performance by arranging marketing activities in a way that enables the implementation of a given strategy type. The authors suggest that marketing organization fit with strategic type is associated with marketing effectiveness in prospector, defender, and analyzer strategic types and with marketing efficiency in prospector and defender strategic types. The study demonstrates the utility of profile deviation approaches for strategic marketing theory development and testing.

Title: Psychological Implications of Customer Participation in Co-Production
Author-Name: Neeli Bendapudi, 
Author-Name: Robert P. Leone
Abstract: Customer participation in the production of goods and services appears to be growing. The marketing literature has largely focused on the economic implications of this trend and has not addressed customers’ potential psychological responses to participation. The authors draw on the social psychological literature on the self-serving bias and conduct two studies to examine the effects of participation on customer satisfaction. Study 1 shows that consistent with the self-serving bias, given an identical outcome, customer satisfaction with a firm differs depending on whether a customer participates in production. Study 2 shows that providing customers a choice in whether to participate mitigates the self-serving bias when the outcome is worse than expected. The authors present theoretical and practical implications and provide directions for further research.

Title: The Integrated Networks Model: Explaining Resource Allocations in Network Markets

Author-Name: Rajendra K. Srivastava
Abstract: The last decade has witnessed a shift from a focus on the value created by a single firm and product to an examination of the value created by networks of firms (or product ecosystems) in which assets are comingled with external entities. The authors examine these market-based assets in the context of network markets and propose an Integrated Networks model in which three types of networks—user, complements, and producer—add value or enhance the attractiveness of the associated focal product. The authors empirically test the proposed model by surveying information technology professionals on their resource allocation decisions regarding the Unix and Windows NT operating systems. The findings suggest that the value added by these three networks is significantly and positively associated with resources allocated by business customers to competing products. The results also show that the three networks mediate the relationship between stand-alone product performance and resource allocation.

Title: Reciprocal Spillover Effects: A Strategic Benefit of Brand Extensions
Author-Name: Subramanian Balachander, 
Author-Name: Sanjoy Ghose
Abstract: A commonly advanced rationale for the proliferation of brand extensions is companies’ motivation to leverage the equity in established brands, thereby developing profitable products relatively easily. A more interesting strategic argument for brand extensions that has been advanced is that extensions would favorably affect the image of the parent brand and thereby influence its choice. In this research, the authors investigate the existence of such reciprocal spillover effects emanating from the advertising of a brand extension. The authors use scanner panel data and study spillover effects of advertising on brand choice. They develop implications for brand and product line management.

Title: Firms Reap What They Sow: The Effects of Shared Values and Perceived Organizational Justice on Customers’ Evaluations of Complaint Handling
Author-Name: James G. Maxham III, 
Author-Name: Richard G. Netemeyer
Abstract: Employing elements of organizational theory and service recovery research, the authors examine how employees’ perceptions of shared values and organizational justice can stimulate customer-directed extra-role behaviors when handling complaints. They also investigate how these extra-role behaviors affect customers’ perceptions of justice, satisfaction, word of mouth, and purchase intent. The authors capture and match employee and customer perceptions regarding the relevant constructs following a complaint and recovery experience. The results indicate that employees’ perceptions of shared values and organizational justice affect customer-directed extra-role behaviors. Furthermore, the authors find that extra-role behaviors have significant effects on customers’ perceptions of justice and that these behaviors mediate the effects of shared values and organizational justice on customer justice perceptions. Their study reveals that customer ratings of justice affect the customer outcomes of satisfaction with recovery, overall firm satisfaction, purchase intent, and word of mouth. Finally, the authors show that customers’ perceptions of justice mediate the effects that extra-role behaviors have on customer outcomes.

Title: Trading Off Between Value Creation and Value Appropriation: The Financial Implications of Shifts in Strategic Emphasis
Author-Name: Natalie Mizik, 
Author-Name: Robert Jacobson
Abstract: Firms allocate their limited resources between two fundamental processes of creating value (i.e., innovating, producing, and delivering products to the market) and appropriating value (i.e., extracting profits in the marketplace). Although both value creation and value appropriation are required for achieving sustained competitive advantage, a firm has significant latitude in deciding the extent to which it emphasizes one over the other. What effect does strategic emphasis (i.e., emphasis on value creation versus value appropriation) have on firm’s financial performance? The authors address this issue by examining the effect that shifts in strategic emphasis have on stock return. They find that the stock market reacts favorably when a firm increases its emphasis on value appropriation relative to value creation. This effect, however, is moderated by firm and industry characteristics, in particular, financial performance, the past level of strategic emphasis of the firm, and the technological environment in which the firm operates. These results do not negate the importance of value creation capabilities, but rather highlight the importance of isolating mechanisms that enable the firm to appropriate some of the value it has created.

Abstract: Antismoking advertising is increasingly used, but its message content is controversial. In an initial study in which adolescents coded 194 advertisements, the authors identified seven common message themes. Using protection motivation theory, the authors develop hypotheses regarding the message theme effects on cognitions and intentions and test them in an experiment involving 1667 adolescents. Three of the seven message themes increased adolescents’ nonsmoking intentions compared with a control; all did so by enhancing adolescents’ perceptions that smoking poses severe social disapproval risks. Other message themes increased health risk severity perceptions but were undermined by low perceived vulnerability.

Title: Corporate Environmentalism: Antecedents and Influence of Industry Type
Author-Name: Subhabrata Bobby Banerjee,

Abstract: How does a business firm manage its relationship with the natural environment? What are the factors that influence the choice of such strategies? Does industry type matter? The authors introduce and operationalize the concept of corporate environmentalism in an effort to answer these questions. Using stakeholder theory, the authors identify four important antecedents to corporate environmentalism, namely, public concern, regulatory forces, competitive advantage, and top management commitment. The authors then use a political-economic framework to develop testable hypotheses. To test the hypotheses, the authors perform multigroup path analysis on data gathered from more than 240 firms. They find that corporate environmentalism is related to all hypothesized antecedents and that industry type moderates several of those relationships. In the high environmental impact sector, public concern has the greatest impact on corporate environmentalism, followed by regulatory forces. In the moderate environmental impact sector, competitive advantage has the greatest impact on corporate environmentalism, followed by regulatory forces. There are strong direct and mediating influences from top management commitment, which is the antecedent with the greatest impact on both industry groups. The influences of regulatory forces, public concern, and competitive advantage are all significantly mediated by top management commitment and moderated by industry type. The empirical findings and the ensuing discussion will be of interest to managers and public policy officials.

Title: The Structural Influence of Marketing Journals: A Citation Analysis of the Discipline and Its Subareas Over Time
Author-Name: Hans Baumgartner, 
Author-Name: Rik Pieters
Abstract: The authors investigate the overall and subarea influence of a comprehensive set of marketing and marketing-related journals at three points in time during a 30-year period using a citation-based measure of structural influence. The results show that a few journals wield a disproportionate amount of influence in the marketing journal network as a whole and that influential journals tend to derive their influence from many different journals. Different journals are most influential in different subareas of marketing; general business and managerially oriented journals have lost influence, whereas more specialized marketing journals have gained in influence over time. The Journal of Marketing emerges as the most influential marketing journal in the final period (1996-97) and as the journal with the broadest span of influence across all subareas. Yet the Journal of Marketing is notably influential among applied marketing journals, which themselves are of lesser influence. The index of structural influence is significantly correlated with other objective and subjective measures of influence but least so with the impact factors reported in the Social Sciences Citation Index. Overall, the findings demonstrate the rapid maturation of the marketing discipline and the changing role of key journals in the process.

Abstract: The authors report the results of three experiments that address the effects of health claims and nutrition information placed on restaurant menus and packaged food labels. The results indicate that when favorable nutrition information or health claims are presented, consumers have more favorable attitudes toward the product, nutrition attitudes, and purchase intentions, and they perceive risks of heart disease and stroke to be lower. The nutritional context in which a restaurant menu item is presented moderates the effects of both nutrition information and a health claim on consumer evaluations, which suggests that alternative (i.e., nontarget) menu items serve as a frame of reference against which the target menu item is evaluated.

Title: To Have and To Hold: The Influence of Haptic Information on Product Judgments
Author-Name: Joann Peck, 
Author-Name: Terry L. Childers
Abstract: Haptic information, or information attained through touch by the hands, is important for the evaluation of products that vary in terms of material properties related to texture, hardness, temperature, and weight. The authors develop and propose a conceptual framework to illustrate that salience of haptic information differs significantly across products, consumers, and situations. The authors use two experiments to assess how these factors interact to impair or enhance the acquisition and use of haptic information. Barriers to touch, such as a retail display case, can inhibit the use of haptic information and consequently decrease confidence in product evaluations and increase the frustration level of consumers who are more motivated to touch products. In addition, written descriptions and visual depictions of products can partially enhance acquisition of certain types of touch information. The authors synthesize the results of these studies and discuss implications for the effect of haptic information for Internet and other nonstore retailing as well as for traditional retailers.

Title: Innovations in Product Functionality: When and Why Are Explicit Comparisons Effective?
Author-Name: Paschalina (Lilia) Ziamou, 
Author-Name: S. Ratneshwar
Abstract: The authors investigate the effects of explicit comparisons in differentiating innovations that offer new functionalities to the consumer. Although marketing communications commonly employ explicit comparisons in launching new product functionalities, the authors suggest that such comparisons are not always helpful. The authors show that an explicit comparison of a new functionality with an existing functionality is effective only when the new functionality is offered in a device or physical product that is atypical of the existing functionality. However, when the new functionality is offered in a product that is typical of the existing functionality, explicit comparisons tend to backfire because they merely facilitate the assimilation of the new functionality to the prior functionality. The results of three studies provide significant support for the predictions, and a fourth study demonstrates how the backfire effect might be avoided. The authors discuss implications for communication tactics, new product marketing, and consumer behavior theory.

Title: Consumer-Company Identification: A Framework for Understanding Consumers’ Relationships with Companies
Author-Name: C.B. Bhattacharya, 
Author-Name: Sankar Sen
Abstract: In this article, the authors try to determine why and under what conditions consumers enter into strong, committed, and meaningful relationships with certain companies, becoming champions of these companies and their products. Drawing on theories of social identity and organizational identification, the authors propose that strong consumer-company relationships often result from consumers’ identification with those companies, which helps them satisfy one or more important self-definitional needs. The authors elaborate on the nature of consumer-company identification, including the company identity, and articulate a consumer-level conceptual framework that offers propositions regarding the key determinants and consequences of such identification in the marketplace.

Title: The Identity Salience Model of Relationship Marketing Success: The Case of Nonprofit Marketing
Author-Name: Dennis B. Arnett, 
Author-Name: Steve D. German, 
Author-Name: Shelby D. Hunt
Abstract: Researchers suggest that developing long-term relationships with key stakeholders is an important strategy in today’s intensely competitive business environment. Many organizations have embraced this concept, which is referred to as relationship marketing. Much of the research on relationship marketing success has examined relationships that (1) are primarily economic in nature, (2) involve business-to-business marketing, and (3) involve forprofit firms. However, the authors argue that relationship marketing is a viable strategy in such contexts as those involving high levels of social exchange, business-to-consumer marketing, and nonprofit marketing. In these contexts, relationship marketing success may require different relationship characteristics from those identified in previous research. The authors develop “the identity salience model of relationship marketing success,” which they posit is useful for explaining relationship marketing success in exchange relationships that (1) involve individuals and (2) are based primarily on social exchange. The authors further develop and test the model in the context of nonprofit higher education marketing. The results provide support for the model.

Title: What Will the Future Bring? Dominance, Technology Expectations, and Radical Innovation
Author-Name: Rajesh K. Chandy, 
Author-Name: Jaideep C. Prabhu, 
Author-Name: Kersi D. Antia
Abstract: Are dominant firms laggards or leaders at innovation? The answers to this question are conflicting and controversial. In an attempt to resolve conflicting answers to this question, the authors argue that dominance is a multifaceted construct in which individual facets result in differing (and countervailing) propensities to innovate. To identify the overall effects of dominance, it is necessary to consider the effects of these facets taken together. The authors also study a hitherto ignored yet important driver of innovation, technology expectations, and show that managers have widely divergent expectations of the same new technology. Furthermore, even when their expectations are the same, managers of dominant firms display investment behavior at odds with their counterparts at nondominant firms. The authors use a triangulation of research methods and combine insights from lab studies with those from field interviews, archival data, and a survey of bricks-and-mortar banks’ responses to Internet banking.

Title: Price-Based Global Market Segmentation for Services
Author-Name: Ruth N. Bolton, 
Author-Name: Matthew B. Myers
Abstract: In business-to-business marketing, managers are often tasked with developing effective global pricing strategies for customers characterized by different cultures and different utilities for product attributes. The challenges of formulating international pricing schedules are especially evident in global markets for service offerings, where intensive customer contact, extensive customization requirements, and reliance on extrinsic cues for service quality make pricing particularly problematic. The purpose of this article is to develop and test a model of the antecedents of business customers’ price elasticities of demand for services in an international setting. The article begins with a synthesis of the services, pricing, and global marketing literature streams and then identifies factors that account for differences in business customers’ price elasticities for service offerings across customers in Asia Pacific, Europe, and North America. The findings indicate that price elasticities depend on service quality, service type, and level of service support and that horizontal segments do exist, which provides support for pricing strategies transcending national borders. The article concludes with a discussion of the managerial implications of these results for effective segmentation of global markets for services.

Author-Name: John F. Sherry Jr.
Abstract: Retro brands are relaunched historical brands with updated features. The authors conduct a “netnographic” analysis of two prominent retro brands, the Volkswagen New Beetle and Star Wars: Episode I—The Phantom Menace, that reveals the importance of Allegory (brand story), Aura (brand essence), Arcadia (idealized community), and Antinomy (brand paradox). Retro brand meanings are predicated on a utopian communal element and an enlivening paradoxical essence. Retro brand management involves an uneasy, cocreative, and occasionally clamorous alliance between producers and consumers.

Title: Grocery Price Setting and Quantity Surcharges

Abstract: Quantity surcharges occur when the unit price of a brand’s larger package is higher than the unit price of the same brand’s smaller package. The authors examine how price-setting practices in the grocery industry help explain the existence of quantity surcharges. Two studies support the authors’ contention that common pricing practices aimed at establishing a favorable store-price image can result in quantity surcharges. First, an experiment shows that consumer demand and the importance price setters place on establishing a low store-price image have an interactive effect on price-setting behavior. Second, an examination of retail sales volume, price, and cost data suggests that such price-setting reactions can result in quantity surcharges when certain asymmetries in demand exist across package sizes. The authors also discuss managerial and public policy implications along with areas for further study.

Author-Name: Eric R. Spangenberg,

Author-Name: Bianca Grohmann, 
Author-Name: Ronn J. Smith
Abstract: Marketers often promote socially beneficial actions or discourage antisocial behaviors to the benefit of their firms, target markets, and society as a whole. One means by which marketers accomplish such influence is a technique referred to as the “self-prophecy effect,” or the behavioral influence of a person making a self-prediction. Researchers have yet to establish the efficacy of self-prophecy in influencing large target markets. In addition, the theoretical mechanism underlying the effect remains in question. The authors report two field studies that demonstrate successful application of self-prophecy through mass-communicated prediction requests. Furthermore, in three laboratory experiments, the authors provide theoretical support for a dissonance-based explanation for self-prophecy, and they discuss practical implications for marketers interested in influencing socially normative behavior.

Title: Market Situation Interpretation and Response:The Role of Cognitive Style, Organizational Culture, and Information Use
Author-Name: J. Chris White,

Author-Name: Peter A. Dacin
Abstract: Improving marketing decision making requires a better understanding of the factors that influence how managers interpret and respond to a market situation. Building on extant literature, the authors develop a model that delineates antecedents of and responses to the interpretation of a market situation. Using case-scenario methodology, the authors test the model in the context of a marketing decision (annual advertising and promotion budget recommendation) with data collected from a nationwide sample of hospital marketing executives. The results of the partial least squares analysis show that (1) cognitive style, organizational culture, and information use affect the extent to which managers perceive a given market situation as one in which they can control the outcomes of their decision; (2) the more managers perceive a situation as controllable, the more they appraise that situation as an opportunity; and (3) the more managers appraise a situation as an opportunity, the greater is the magnitude of their response.

Title: Promoting Relationship Learning
Author-Name: Fred Selnes, 
Author-Name: James Sallis
Abstract: The authors develop a theory of how management can develop and promote the learning capabilities of targeted customer-supplier relationships. The theory suggests that a supplier and a customer can improve their joint learning activities by facilitating information exchange, developing common learning arenas, and updating their behavior accordingly. The authors suggest that learning within a customer-supplier relationship cannot be mandated by either organization, but rather learning depends on both parties’ willingness to cooperate in joint learning activities. Management can promote relationship learning by cultivating a collaborative culture, formulating specific objectives for joint learning activities, and developing relational trust. However, as relational trust develops, the effectiveness of learning is reduced as a result of “hidden costs” of trust. The authors use data from 315 dyads to test the theory empirically, and they find that the learning capability of a relationship has a strong, positive effect on performance. Their results also provide insight into how to address the hidden costs of trust.

Title: An Exploratory Study of the Introduction of Online Reverse Auctions
Author-Name: Sandy D. Jap
Abstract: Buyers are increasingly turning to online reverse auctions in their negotiations with suppliers. How do these price competition mechanisms affect buyer-supplier relationships? The author considers this question in the context of a quasi experiment involving six online reverse auctions conducted in the supply base of a major industrial buyer. The results indicate that these auctions increase both new and current suppliers’ beliefs that buyers act opportunistically, particularly in open-bid auctions. Current suppliers are generally more willing than new suppliers to make dedicated investments toward the buyer. Paradoxically, in sealed-bid auctions, both current and new suppliers increase their willingness to make dedicated investments toward the buyer. Although these auctions can yield cost savings, the savings are category specific and are not systematically related to an open- or sealed-bid format. The author also discusses implications for the use of online reverse auctions in industrial sourcing activities.

Abstract: The authors propose that the revenue premium a brand generates compared with that of a private label product is a simple, objective, and managerially useful product-market measure of brand equity. The authors provide the conceptual basis for the measure, compute it for brands in several packaged goods categories, and test its validity. The empirical analysis shows that the measure is reliable and reflects real changes in brand health over time. It correlates well with other equity measures, and the measure’s association with a brand’s advertising and promotion activity, price sensitivity, and perceived category risk is consistent with theory.

Title: How Critical Are Critical Reviews? The Box Office Effects of Film Critics, Star Power, and Budgets
Author-Name: Suman Basuroy, 
Author-Name: Subimal Chatterjee, 
Author-Name: S. Abraham Ravid
Abstract: The authors investigate how critics affect the box office performance of films and how the effects may be moderated by stars and budgets. The authors examine the process through which critics affect box office revenue, that is, whether they influence the decision of the film going public (their role as influencers), merely predict the decision (their role as predictors), or do both. They find that both positive and negative reviews are correlated with weekly box office revenue over an eight-week period, suggesting that critics play a dual role: They can influence and predict box office revenue. However, the authors find the impact of negative reviews (but not positive reviews) to diminish over time, a pattern that is more consistent with critics’ role as influencers. The authors then compare the positive impact of good reviews with the negative impact of bad reviews to find that film reviews evidence a negativity bias; that is, negative reviews hurt performance more than positive reviews help performance, but only during the first week of a film’s run. Finally, the authors examine two key moderators of critical reviews, stars and budgets, and find that popular stars and big budgets enhance box office revenue for films that receive more negative critical reviews than positive critical reviews but do little for films that receive more positive reviews than negative reviews. Taken together, the findings not only replicate and extend prior research on critical reviews and box office performance but also offer insight into how film studios can strategically manage the review process to enhance box office revenue.

Title: Plural Governance in Industrial Purchasing
Author-Name: Jan B. Heide
Abstract: This article examines the phenomenon of plural governance, a firm’s simultaneous use of market contracting and vertical integration for the same basic transaction. The author studies two particular aspects of plural governance, namely the conditions that motivate firms to deploy plural governance and the manner in which one governance form influences the other when the two coexist in a joint structure. Drawing on agency theory and information economics, the author develops a set of research hypotheses and tests them empirically in the context of industrial purchasing decisions. The results suggest that the plural governance phenomenon can be understood from the perspective of solving information asymmetry problems between buyers and suppliers. The author discusses the implications of a “make and buy” approach to extant theory of interfirm governance, relationship management, and marketing strategy in business-to-business settings.

Title: Understanding the Effect of Customer Relationship Management Efforts on Customer Retention and Customer Share Development
Author-Name: Peter C. Verhoef
Abstract: Scholars have questioned the effectiveness of several customer relationship management strategies. The author investigates the differential effects of customer relationship perceptions and relationship marketing instruments on customer retention and customer share development over time. Customer relationship perceptions are considered evaluations of relationship strength and a supplier’s offerings, and customer share development is the change in customer share between two periods. The results show that affective commitment and loyalty programs that provide economic incentives positively affect both customer retention and customer share development, whereas direct mailings influence customer share development. However, the effect of these variables is rather small. The results also indicate that firms can use the same strategies to affect both customer retention and customer share development.

Title: Antecedents and Consequences of Merit Pay Fairness for Industrial Salespeople
Author-Name: Sridhar N. Ramaswami, 
Author-Name: Jagdip Singh
Abstract: How do salespeople make judgments of merit pay fairness? By what mechanisms do fairness judgments influence the performance and commitment of salespeople? Using equity and social exchange theories, the authors examine these questions for industrial salespeople who work in a Fortune 500 firm and provide four key findings. First, of the three dimensions of fairness judgments, they find the interactional fairness dimension to be relatively more important than procedural or distributive fairness in influencing job outcomes of salespeople. Second, supervisory behaviors have significant influence in shaping salespeople’s fairness judgments, particularly judgments of distributive and interactional fairness. Third, the results underscore the contrasting mediating role of trust in supervisor and job satisfaction. Although trust in the supervisor is important in reducing salespeople’s opportunistic behaviors, the authors find job satisfaction to be important in enhancing their loyalty to the organization. Fourth, salespeople’s job performance is influenced directly by extrinsic factors such as fairness of current rewards and potential for rewards. In addition, the authors outline implications for theory and practice.

Abstract: The marketing literature affirms the value of a customer orientation to organizational performance, but it is relatively silent on the implementation of this orientation. This research reports the results of a paired-comparison ethnographic study of the dynamics of implementing a customer orientation in a major public school district. Changes at a progressing site are compared with those at a struggling site. The study provides answers to the question of how an organization adopts a customer orientation by refining understanding of the roles of leadership, interfunctional coordination, and the collection and dissemination of customer-focused data in the transformation process.

Title: Sources and Financial Consequences of Radical Innovation: Insights from Pharmaceuticals
Author-Name: Alina B. Sorescu, 
Author-Name: Rajesh K. Chandy, 
Author-Name: Jaideep C. Prabhu
Abstract: Radical innovations are engines of economic growth and the focus of much academic and practitioner interest, yet some fundamental questions remain unanswered. The authors use theoretical arguments on the risk associated with radical innovations, and the resources needed for them, to answer the following questions on the sources and financial consequences of radical innovation: (1) Who introduces a greater number of radical innovations: dominant or nondominant firms? (2) How great are the financial rewards to radical innovations, and how do these rewards vary across dominant and nondominant firms? (3) Is it only a firm’s resources in the aggregate or also its focus and leverage of resources that make its innovations more financially valuable? and (4) Which are more valuable: innovations that incorporate a breakthrough technology or innovations that provide a substantial increase in customer benefits? The authors pool information from a disparate set of sources in the pharmaceutical industry to study these questions. Results indicate that a large majority of radical innovations come from a minority of firms. The financial rewards of innovation vary dramatically across firms and are tied closely to firms’ resource base. Firms that provide higher per-product levels of marketing and technology support obtain much greater financial rewards from their radical innovations than do other firms. Firms that have greater depth and breadth in their product portfolio also gain more from their radical innovations.

Title: Evolving to a New Dominant Logic for Marketing
Author-Name: Stephen L. Vargo, 
Author-Name: Robert F. Lusch
Abstract: Marketing inherited a model of exchange from economics, which had a dominant logic based on the exchange of “goods,” which usually are manufactured output. The dominant logic focused on tangible resources, embedded value, and transactions. Over the past several decades, new perspectives have emerged that have a revised logic focused on intangible resources, the cocreation of value, and relationships. The authors believe that the new perspectives are converging to form a new dominant logic for marketing, one in which service provision rather than goods is fundamental to economic exchange. The authors explore this evolving logic and the corresponding shift in perspective for marketing scholars, marketing practitioners, and marketing educators.

Title: Return on Marketing: Using Customer Equity to Focus Marketing Strategy
Author-Name: Roland T. Rust, 
Author-Name: Katherine N. Lemon, 
Author-Name: Valarie A. Zeithaml
Abstract: The authors present a unified strategic framework that enables competing marketing strategy options to be traded off on the basis of projected financial return, which is operationalized as the change in a firm’s customer equity relative to the incremental expenditure necessary to produce the change. The change in the firm’s customer equity is the change in its current and future customers’ lifetime values, summed across all customers in the industry. Each customer’s lifetime value results from the frequency of category purchases, average quantity of purchase, and brand-switching patterns combined with the firm’s contribution margin. The brand-switching matrix can be estimated from either longitudinal panel data or cross-sectional survey data, using a logit choice model. Firms can analyze drivers that have the greatest impact, compare the drivers’ performance with that of competitors’ drivers, and project return on investment from improvements in the drivers. To demonstrate how the approach can be implemented in a specific corporate setting and to show the methods used to test and validate the model, the authors illustrate a detailed application of the approach by using data from the airline industry. Their framework enables what-if evaluation of marketing return on investment, which can include such criteria as return on quality, return on advertising, return on loyalty programs, and even return on corporate citizenship, given a particular shift in customer perceptions. This enables the firm to focus marketing efforts on strategic initiatives that generate the greatest return.

Abstract: Implementation of the marketing concept in service firms is accomplished through individual service employees and their interactions with customers. Although prior research has established a link between service-worker customer orientation and performance outcomes, little research has addressed other potentially important outcomes of customer orientation. Drawing from the literature on person–situation interaction and fit theory, the authors develop and test a model that explains how service-worker customer orientation affects several important job responses, including perceived job fit, job satisfaction, commitment to the firm, and organizational citizenship behaviors. Across three field studies in two distinct services industries, the results indicate that the positive influence of customer orientation on certain job responses is stronger for service workers who spend more time in direct contact with customers than for workers who spend less time with customers. The authors discuss the implications of the results for services marketing managers and researchers.

Abstract: The authors develop and test a model of the key determinants of margins that retailers earn on national brands and store brands. They particularly focus on the impact of store-brand share on percentage margin, dollar margin per unit, and total dollar margin of the retailer. The authors find not only that percentage retail margins on store brands are higher than on national brands but also that high store-brand share enables retailers to earn higher percentage margins on national brands. However, the dollar margin per unit may be smaller for store brands because of their lower retail price. Furthermore, heavy store-brand users contribute much less to the total dollar profit of the retailer than do light store-brand users. The authors conclude that it is important for retailers to retain a balance between store brands and national brands to attract and retain the most profitable customers.

Thus, their observations are likely to resonate with a broad cross-section of the business community. With the goal of stimulating discussion and debate, I invited some distinguished scholars to write brief commentaries on different aspects of V&L’s article. I was delighted to receive a thoughtful and diverse set of comments. The ideas expressed in the article and the commentaries will undoubtedly provoke a variety of reactions from readers of Journal of Marketing.

Abstract: Network externalities are playing an increasingly important role in the economy, and they have significant implications for firms’ marketing strategies. The authors study the effects of network externalities in conjunction with other product and firm characteristics on the survival of pioneers. They apply an accelerated failure time model to data on 45 office products and consumer durables. The authors find evidence that network externalities have a negative main effect on the survival duration of pioneers. However, for more radical products and for technologically intense products, increases in network externalities are associated with increased survival duration. The larger the pioneer, the more network externalities increase its survival duration, whereas incumbent pioneers experience a decrease in survival duration compared with nonincumbents. The findings of this article contribute to theory in marketing strategy and have important implications for firms that are developing market entry strategies for products with network externalities.

Title: Beyond Adoption: Development and Application of a Use-Diffusion Model
Author-Name: Chuan-Fong Shih, 
Author-Name: Alladi Venkatesh
Abstract: The study tests a use-diffusion model in the context of home technology use. The authors combine two constructs, variety and rate of use, to yield four user segments. The results show that user segments vary on the basis of social context and technological makeup of the household as well as personal factors and external influences. Furthermore, user segments differ with regard to users’ satisfaction with technology and interest in acquiring future technologies.

Title: Relationship Governance in a Supply Chain Network
Author-Name: Kenneth H. Wathne, 
Author-Name: Jan B. Heide
Abstract: The authors examine how a firm’s strategy in a (downstream) customer relationship is contingent on how a related relationship outside of the focal dyad is organized. Drawing on emerging perspectives on interfirm governance and networks, the authors propose that the ability to show flexibility toward a (downstream) customer under uncertain market conditions depends on the governance mechanisms that have been deployed in an (upstream) supplier relationship. The governance mechanisms take the form of (1) supplier qualification programs and (2) incentive structures based on hostages. The authors develop a set of contingency predictions and test them empirically in the context of vertical supply chain networks in the apparel industry. The tests show good support for the hypotheses. The authors discuss the implications of the findings for marketing theory and practice.

Title: Antecedents of Export Venture Performance: A Theoretical Model and Empirical Assessment
Author-Name: Neil A. Morgan, 
Author-Name: Anna Kaleka, 
Author-Name: Constantine S. Katsikeas
Abstract: Both the size and the rapid growth of global exporting have focused the attention of marketing researchers on the factors associated with firms’ export performance. However, knowledge of this increasingly important domain of marketing activity remains limited. To address this knowledge gap, the authors draw on the strategy and marketing literature to develop an integrative theory of the antecedents of export venture performance. The interplay among available resources and capabilities, competitive strategy decisions, and competitive intensity determines export venture positional advantages and performance outcomes in the theoretical model. The authors empirically assess predicted relationships using survey data from 287 export ventures. Results broadly support the theoretical model, indicating that resources and capabilities affect export venture competitive strategy choices and the positional advantages achieved in the export market, which in turn affect export venture performance outcomes. In contrast to structure–conduct–performance theory predictions, the data indicate that the competitive intensity of the export marketplace does not have a direct effect on export venture positional advantages or performance. However, competitive intensity moderates the relationship between export venture competitive strategy choices and the positional advantages realized.

Title: Customer Portfolio Management: Toward a Dynamic Theory of Exchange Relationships
Author-Name: Michael D. Johnson, 
Author-Name: Fred Selnes
Abstract: Management of an entire portfolio of customers who are at different relationship stages requires a dynamic theory of exchange relationships that captures the trade-offs between scale economies and lifetime customer value. This article contributes to the understanding of relationship management by developing a typology of exchange relationship mechanisms and a model of relationship dynamics and by simulating the model to provide guidelines for customer portfolio management. An important insight from the research is that a key to the creation of value through closer relationships lies in bringing weaker relationships into a portfolio in the first place. Another insight is that firms that position themselves toward offerings with low economies of scale, such as personal services, must build closer relationships to create value.

Title: When Is a Preannounced New Product Likely to Be Delayed?
Author-Name: Yuhong Wu,

Abstract: Consider that a firm announces a deadline for a new product introduction. Conditional on such a preannouncement, how must an external observer evaluate whether the product will be delayed beyond that deadline? Using data collected from managers in the computer hardware, software, and telecommunications industries, the authors present an analysis that demonstrates that delays in new product introductions beyond preannounced deadlines can be jointly explained by factors related to (1) the firm’s motivations to delay the product, (2) the presence of constraints that prevent delay (or the availability of opportunities to delay the product), and (3) the firm’s abilities pertaining to product development.

Title: Market Orientation, Creativity, and New Product Performance in High-Technology Firms
Author-Name: Subin Im, 
Author-Name: John P. Workman Jr.
Abstract: The ability to generate and market creative ideas in new products (NPs) and related marketing programs (MPs) in response to changing market needs is key to the success of a firm. This research examines the mediating role of NP and MP creativity between market orientation and NP success. The authors investigate (1) whether market orientation facilitates or inhibits creativity, (2) whether creativity influences NP performance, and (3) how to define and measure creativity in the NP development and launch contexts. They use a two-stage sampling frame to collect 312 sets of responses from managers and NP team leaders and thereby address the potential for common method bias in measures of creativity and NP performance. The findings indicate that NP and MP creativity mediates the relationship between market orientation and NP success. The authors also show that the meaningfulness dimension, rather than the novelty dimension, of creativity is of greater importance in explaining the link between market orientation and NP success. The empirical results provide significant theoretical and managerial implications for NP strategy.

Abstract: In this article, the authors examine antecedents and consequences of the service climate in boundary-spanning self-managing teams (SMTs) that deliver financial services. Using data from members of 61 SMTs and their customers, the authors show a differential impact of the SMT service climate on various marketing performance measures. Furthermore, they obtain support for independent group-level effects of intrateam support and team member flexibility on employee perceptions of the SMT service climate. Both effects are persistent over time and demonstrate that collective perceptions in the SMT have incremental value in the explanation of the service climate.

Title: Attention Capture and Transfer in Advertising: Brand, Pictorial, and Text-Size Effects
Author-Name: Rik Pieters, 
Author-Name: Michel Wedel
Abstract: The three key ad elements (brand, pictorial, and text) each have unique superiority effects on attention to advertisements, which are on par with many commonly held ideas in marketing practice. This is the main conclusion of an analysis of 1363 print advertisements tested with infrared eye-tracking methodology on more than 3600 consumers. The pictorial is superior in capturing attention, independent of its size. The text element best captures attention in direct proportion to its surface size. The brand element most effectively transfers attention to the other elements. Only increments in the text element’s surface size produce a net gain in attention to the advertisement as a whole. The authors discuss how their findings can be used to render more effective decisions in advertising.

Title: The Roles of Channel-Category Associations and Geodemographics in Channel Patronage
Author-Name: J. Jeffrey Inman, 
Author-Name: Venkatesh Shankar, 
Author-Name: Rosellina Ferraro
Abstract: Consumers purchase goods from various channels or retail formats, such as grocery stores, drugstores, mass merchandisers, club stores, and convenience stores. To identify the most appropriate channels and to allocate the distribution of products among channels efficiently, managers need a better understanding of consumer behavior with respect to these channels. The authors examine the moderating role of channel-category associations in consumer channel patronage by extending the literature on brand associations to the context of channels, and they estimate a model that links channel-category associations with consumer geodemographics and channel share of volume. The authors first identify the product categories associated with particular channels through a correspondence analysis of a field-intercept survey. They then use the channel-category associations and geodemographic factors to estimate their direct and interactive effects on channel share of volume. The channel-category associations have significant main effects and interaction effects with channel type and geodemographic factors on channel share of volume, and they account for the majority of the explained variance (72%) in channel share of volume. Overall, the findings provide several conceptual and managerial insights into consumer channel perceptions and patronage behavior.

Abstract: By “listening in” to ongoing dialogues between customers and Web-based virtual advisers (e.g., Kelley Blue Book’s Auto Choice Advisor), the authors identify new product opportunities based on new combinations of customer needs. The data are available at little incremental cost and provide the scale necessary for complex products (e.g., 148 trucks and 129 customer needs in the authors’ application). The authors describe and evaluate the methodologies with formal analysis, Monte Carlo simulation (calibrated on real data), and a “proof-of-concept” application in the pickup-truck category (more than 1000 Web-based respondents). The application identified opportunities for new truck platforms worth approximately $2.4 billion–$3.2 billion and $1 billion–$2 billion, respectively.

Title: Actualizing Innovation Effort: The Impact of Market Knowledge Diffusion in a Dynamic System of Competition
Author-Name: Detelina Marinova
Abstract: This study focuses on the dynamic process that governs the impact of market knowledge diffusion on innovation effort and its subsequent effect on firm performance. First, the author proposes that three aspects of market knowledge (knowledge level, knowledge change, and extent of shared knowledge about customers and competitors) influence innovation effort. In so doing, she explicitly models the dynamic process of competition, including heterogeneity in interdependence of innovation across competitors, firm-specific inertial tendency in innovation, and feedback effects reflected in satisfaction with past performance. Second, within a partial adjustment model of performance, the author studies the role of shared market knowledge and firm size in the translation of innovation effort into firm performance over time. She tests the conceptual framework with longitudinal quasi field experiments based on a Markstrat simulation exercise, including a main experiment and three validation studies. The results reveal a dynamic system in which some aspects of market knowledge diffusion propel innovation, whereas satisfaction with past performance hinders innovation effort. Furthermore, the results show that innovation effort, by itself, does not affect firm performance. In the context of the study, total shared market knowledge helps smaller firms actualize better returns from their innovation effort than larger firms.

Author-Name: Ann Christiansen
Abstract: Telephone interviews were conducted with more than 900 adolescents aged 12 to 18 as part of a multimillion dollar, statewide, antitobacco advertising campaign. The interviews addressed two primary questions: (1) Do counteradvertising campaign attitudes directly affect antismoking beliefs and intent in a manner similar to those of conventional advertisements? and (2) Can advertising campaign attitudes have a stronger effect on beliefs and intent for adolescents with prior smoking behavior and for adolescents exposed to social influence (i.e., friends, siblings, or adult smoker in the home)? The authors’ findings show that advertising campaign attitudes, prior trial behavior, and social influence all directly affect antismoking beliefs and that advertising campaign attitudes interact with prior trial behavior to strengthen antismoking beliefs. The results indicate that attitudes related to the campaign, prior trial behavior, and social influence directly influence intent, and advertising campaign attitudes interact with social influence and prior trial behavior to attenuate adolescent intent to smoke. In addition, the effect of advertising campaign attitudes in attenuating social influence and prior trial behavior effects on adolescent intent to smoke persists even when the authors account for strongly held beliefs about smoking. The authors discuss implications for countermarketing communications and the design and understanding of future antismoking campaigns.

Title: Consumer Response to Retailers’ Use of Partially Comparative Pricing
Author-Name: Michael J. Barone, 
Author-Name: Kenneth C. Manning, 
Author-Name: Paul W. Miniard
Abstract: Consumers sometimes encounter a combination of comparative and noncomparative prices in the marketplace. For example, a grocer may employ signage that provides favorable price comparisons with those of a competitor for a portion of its products, a practice that the authors refer to as “partially comparative pricing.” The authors examine the effects of partially comparative pricing on consumer response and find that it has both desirable and undesirable effects. On the one hand, such pricing enhances consumers’ beliefs about the relative prices of comparatively priced products and about the retailer’s relative prices in general. On the other hand, such pricing also reduces consumers’ relative price beliefs about noncomparatively priced products and their intentions to purchase such products. The authors further show that the adverse influence of partially comparative pricing stems from consumers’ suspicions about why price comparisons exist for some, but not all, products. They also document how these effects depend on store patronage. They discuss implications of their research and provide suggestions for future empirical efforts.

Title: Geographic Patterns in Customer Service and Satisfaction: An Empirical Investigation
Author-Name: Vikas Mittal,

Abstract: When firms’ customers are located in geographically dispersed areas, it can be difficult to manage service quality because its relative importance is likely to vary spatially. This article shows how addressing such spatial aspects of satisfaction data can improve management’s ability to implement programs aimed at enhancing service quality. Specifically, managers can identify areas of high service responsiveness, that is, areas in which overall satisfaction is low but customers are highly responsive to improvements in service quality. The authors estimate the spatial patterns using geographically weighted regression, a technique that accounts for spatial dependence in the variables. They apply this methodology to a large national sample of automobile customers served by a network of dealerships across the United States. The authors also investigate the extent to which factors related to the physical and psychological landscape explain the importance that people in different regions place on dealership service and vehicle quality.

Title: Building and Sustaining Buyer–Seller Relationships in Mature Industrial Markets

Author-Name: V. Kasturi Rangan
Abstract: Empirical research in relationship management has tended to take a snapshot of a relationship at a given time and attempt to project its trajectory, despite agreement among researchers that a longitudinal perspective focused on process models advances the implications for practice. The authors use a field investigative approach to study, over time, the evolution of three industrial buyer–seller relationships in mature industrial markets. The relationships are characterized by various degrees of initial asymmetry and have evolved in dramatically different ways over time. Their findings suggest that weaker firms can structure and thrive in long-term relationships with powerful partners because initial asymmetries are subsequently redressed through the development of high levels of interpersonal trust across the dyad, which in turn leads to increased levels of interorganizational commitment.

Abstract: This research provides and empirically tests a conceptualization of health care services in which customer compliance outside of the service organization is necessary for successful health outcomes. Using data from service providers and customers in a weight-loss clinic, the authors examine the provider’s role in gaining customer compliance. They find that provider expertise and attitudinal homophily play a role in bringing about customer role clarity, ability, and motivation. This study demonstrates that compliance leads to goal attainment, which results in satisfaction. More important, compliance also leads to satisfaction directly; consumers who comply with program requirements have greater satisfaction with the program.

Title: Why We Boycott: Consumer Motivations for Boycott Participation
Author-Name: Jill Gabrielle Klein, 
Author-Name: N. Craig Smith, 
Author-Name: Andrew John
Abstract: Although boycotts are increasingly relevant for management decision making, there has been little research of an individual consumer’s motivation to boycott. Drawing on the helping behavior and boycott literature, the authors take a cost–benefit approach to the decision to boycott and present a conceptualization of motivations for boycott participation. The authors tested their framework during an actual boycott of a multinational firm that was prompted by factory closings. Consumers who viewed the closures as egregious were more likely to boycott the firm, though only a minority did so. Four factors are found to predict boycott participation: the desire to make a difference, the scope for self-enhancement, counterarguments that inhibit boycotting, and the cost to the boycotter of constrained consumption. Furthermore, self-enhancement and constrained consumption are significant moderators of the relationship between the perceived egregiousness of the firm’s actions and boycott participation. The authors also explore the role of perceptions of others’ participation and discuss implications for marketers, nongovernmental organizations, policymakers, and researchers.

Author-Name: V. Kumar
Abstract: The authors evaluate the usefulness of customer lifetime value (CLV) as a metric for customer selection and marketing resource allocation by developing a dynamic framework that enables managers to maintain or improve customer relationships proactively through marketing contacts across various channels and to maximize CLV simultaneously. The authors show that marketing contacts across various channels influence CLV nonlinearly. Customers who are selected on the basis of their lifetime value provide higher profits in future periods than do customers selected on the basis of several other customer-based metrics. The analyses suggest that there is potential for improved profits when managers design resource allocation rules that maximize CLV. Managers can use the authors’ framework to allocate marketing resources efficiently across customers and channels of communication.

Title: How Is Manifest Branding Strategy Related to the Intangible Value of a Corporation?
Author-Name: Vithala R. Rao,

Author-Name: Denise Dahlhoff
Abstract: Firms exhibit or “manifest” three types of branding strategies: corporate branding, house of brands, or mixed branding. These strategies differ in their essential structure and in their potential costs and benefits to the firm. Prior research has failed to understand how these branding strategies are related to the intangible value of the firm. The authors investigate this relationship using five-year data for a sample of 113 U.S. firms. They find that corporate branding strategy is associated with higher values of Tobin’s q, and mixed branding strategy is associated with lower values of Tobin’s q, after controlling for the effects of several important and relevant factors. The relationships of the control variables are consistent with prior expectations. In addition, most of the firms would have been able to improve their Tobin’s q had they adopted a branding strategy different from the one their brand portfolios revealed. The authors also discuss implications and future research directions.

Author-Name: Dominique M. Hanssens
Abstract: Year after year, managers strive to improve financial performance and firm value through marketing actions such as new product introductions and promotional incentives. This study investigates the short- and long-term impact of such marketing actions on financial metrics, including top-line, bottom-line, and stock market performance. The authors apply multivariate time-series models to the automobile industry, in which both new product introductions and promotional incentives are considered important performance drivers. Notably, whereas both marketing actions increase top-line firm performance, their long-term effects strongly differ for the bottom line. First, new product introductions increase long-term financial performance and firm value, but promotions do not. Second, investor reaction to new product introduction grows over time, indicating that useful information unfolds in the first two months after product launch. Third, product entry in a new market yields the highest top-line, bottom-line, and stock market benefits. Managers may use these results to justify new product efforts and to weigh short- and long-term consequences of promotional incentives.

Title: Strategic Responses to New Technologies and Their Impact on Firm Performance
Author-Name: Ruby P. Lee, 
Author-Name: Rajdeep Grewal
Abstract: Modern corporations must adopt and assimilate new technologies to build and sustain competitive advantage. The authors develop a theoretical framework to understand the relationships among (1) strategic responses to new technologies, (2) organizational resources, and (3) firm performance. Specifically, they theorize that a strategic response can be categorized according to the dimensions of magnitude, domain, and speed, and they conceptualize organizational resources as tangible and intangible. The authors operationalize this framework for the adoption of the Internet by traditional store-based retailers, for which they posit strategic responses as the speed of (1) adopting the Internet as a communications channel, (2) adopting the Internet as a sales channel, and (3) forming e-alliances. In addition, they use resource slack to represent organizational resources. Results from nine years (1992–2000) of data on 106 firms establish the influence of strategic responses on firm performance (i.e., market valuation of the firm, operationalized as Tobin’s q). Specifically, the results show that both the adoption of the Internet as a communications channel and e-alliance formation positively influence firm performance. The positive effect of communications channel adoption on firm performance is enhanced further by the use of slack resources. Post hoc analysis reveals that the adoption of the Internet as a sales channel seems to matter only to firms that have preexisting catalog operations.

Title: The Effect of Corporate Social Responsibility on Customer Donations to Corporate-Supported Nonprofits
Author-Name: Donald R. Lichtenstein, 
Author-Name: Minette E. Drumwright, 
Author-Name: Bridgette M. Braig
Abstract: Both theory and recent research evidence suggest that a corporation’s socially responsible behavior can positively affect consumers’ attitudes toward the corporation. The effect occurs both directly and indirectly through the behavior’s effect on customer–corporation identification. The authors report the results of four studies designed to replicate and extend these findings. Using a field survey design, Study 1 provides evidence that perceived corporate social responsibility affects not only customer purchase behavior through customer–corporate identification but also customer donations to corporate-supported nonprofit organizations. Using experimental designs, Studies 2 and 3 replicate and extend the Study 1 findings by providing additional evidence for the mediating role of customer–corporate identification on the relationship between corporate social responsibility and customer donations. However, the combined results of Studies 2 and 3 also show that because of a “perceived opportunity to do good” by supporting a company that is changing its ways, consumers are more likely to donate to a corporate-supported nonprofit when the corporation has a weaker historical record of socially responsible behavior. Finally, Study 4 tests the relationship between the nonprofit domain and the domain of the corporation’s socially responsible behavior as a boundary condition for this effect.

Abstract: In this article, the authors develop a theoretical framework that specifies how customer satisfaction affects future customer behavior and, in turn, the level, timing, and risk of future cash flows. Empirically, they find a positive association between customer satisfaction and shareholder value. They also find significant variation in the association across industries and firms.

Title: Antecedents and Outcomes of Marketing Strategy Comprehensiveness
Author-Name: Kwaku Atuahene-Gima, 
Author-Name: Janet Y. Murray
Abstract: Comprehensiveness has long been recognized as a key feature of marketing strategy decision making. However, few studies have examined its antecedents and the conditions under which it influences performance. This study attempts to contribute to a better understanding of marketing strategy by investigating project-level antecedents and outcomes of marketing strategy comprehensiveness (MSC). Drawing on contingency and institutional theories perspectives, the authors develop and test the effects of output and process rewards, task conflict, and project members’ intra- and extraindustry relationships on MSC. They find that whereas process reward and extraindustry relationships are positively related to MSC, task conflict (when combined with conflict avoidance) hinders its development. Furthermore, the results indicate that MSC has a more positive effect on performance when implementation speed is higher. Finally, the authors discover that technology and market uncertainties differentially moderate the relationship between MSC and performance; the former has a positive effect, and the latter has a negative effect. The authors also discuss the theoretical and practical implications of their findings.

Title: Customer Knowledge Development: Antecedents and Impact on New Product Performance
Author-Name: Ashwin W. Joshi, 
Author-Name: Sanjay Sharma
Abstract: By enhancing the fit between new product features and customer preferences, the customer knowledge development process fosters new product success. Despite this significant benefit, there is considerable variance in the extent to which firms engage in this process in their new product development projects. This is because not all firms can meet the resource, strategic flexibility, and motivational requirements of the process. In this research, the authors develop a nomological network wherein they identify (1) the organizational actions that enable effective implementation of the customer knowledge development process, (2) the characteristics of new product development projects that moderate the effects of these actions, and (3) the outcomes that are generated by the process. The results from a survey of 165 marketing managers who had recently participated in new product development projects provide substantial support for the nomological network. The authors explore the theoretical and managerial implications that arise from their results and provide future research directions.

Title: Metrics for Making Marketing Matter
Author-Name: Donald R. Lehmann
Abstract: In January 2002, Donald R. Lehmann, Executive Director of the Marketing Science Institute, submitted a proposal for a JM Special Section, “Linking Marketing to Financial Performance and Firm Value.” The proposal included activities to promote interactions among marketing academics and practitioners, designed to advance research on this topic. I was excited about the opportunity to stimulate and publish new research, and after extensive discussions, the American Marketing Association and the Marketing Science Institute formally agreed to cosponsor the Special Section. Authors submitted their manuscripts through a paper competition as well as directly through JM. Donald R. Lehmann, the Consulting Editor, and a panel of distinguished scholars reviewed every submission. The panel included Tim Ambler, Gregory S. Carpenter, Robert Jacobson, V. Kumar, Roland T. Rust, and Rajendra K. Srivastava. All submissions underwent JM’s standard double-blind review process under my editorship, and members of JM’s Editorial Review Board served as reviewers. I am pleased to have this opportunity to acknowledge the important contributions of these many individuals: both authors and reviewers. As the subsequent essay suggests, three years’ hard work has produced a thought-provoking collection of articles. I hope they will generate further intellectual inquiry and debate about the link between marketing and financial performance in the business community.

Author-Name: Roland T. Rust, 
Author-Name: Tim Ambler,

Author-Name: V. Kumar, 
Author-Name: Rajendra K. Srivastava
Abstract: For too long, marketers have not been held accountable for showing how marketing expenditures add to shareholder value. As time has gone by, this lack of accountability has undermined marketers’ credibility, threatened the standing of the marketing function within the firm, and even threatened marketing’s existence as a distinct capability within the firm. This article proposes a broad framework for assessing marketing productivity, cataloging what is already known, and suggesting areas for further research. The authors conclude that it is possible to show how marketing expenditures add to shareholder value. The effective dissemination of new methods of assessing marketing productivity to the business community will be a major step toward raising marketing’s vitality in the firm and, more important, toward raising the performance of the firm itself. The authors also suggest many areas in which further research is essential to making methods of evaluating marketing productivity increasingly valid, reliable, and practical.

Author-Name: Gustavo E. De Mello
Abstract: This conceptual article uses an appraisal theory perspective to define the construct of hope and describe its relevance to consumer behavior, marketing, and public policy in the domains of product evaluation and choice. Using the appraisal dimensions of hope, the authors identify a set of marketing tactics that are designed to stimulate hope. They posit that hope plays a moderating role in the relationship between well-known antecedent variables (e.g., involvement, expectations) on the one hand and evaluative judgments (e.g., attitudes, satisfaction) and consumer choices on the other hand. The authors advance specific propositions that describe the effects. Furthermore, they argue that the effects have implications for marketing and public policy. The article concludes with a call for additional research relevant to the study of hope.

Abstract: Do acquisitions increase, decrease, or have no effect on innovation? The empirical research on this question suggests that acquisitions may hurt innovation; that is, they may be a “poison pill” for innovation. The authors present an alternative view. For firms that first engage in internal knowledge development, the knowledge-based view the authors present suggests that acquisitions can help innovation; that is, they can be a tonic for innovation. Analysis of cross-sectional, time-series data on a sample of pharmaceutical firms during 1988–97 provides evidence to support the thesis.

Title: Negativity in the Evaluation of Political Candidates

Abstract: Prior research has demonstrated a clear negativity effect (greater weighting of candidate weaknesses compared with strengths) in the evaluation of U.S. presidential candidates in each of the past six elections analyzed. The authors adopt a motivational view and question the robustness of this finding. They reanalyze past National Election Studies data along with new data and conclude that the negativity effect is not universal across voters; it is a robust effect only for voters who dislike the candidate. They argue that previous findings are due to aggregation of data across voters who vary in their motivations.

Title: Decision Making and Coping of Functionally Illiterate Consumers and Some Implications for Marketing Management
Author-Name: Madhubalan Viswanathan, 
Author-Name: José Antonio Rosa, 
Author-Name: James Edwin Harris
Abstract: A study of the decision making and coping of functionally illiterate consumers reveals cognitive predilections, decision heuristics and trade-offs, and coping behaviors that distinguish them from literate consumers. English-as-a-second-language and poor, literate consumers are used as comparison groups. The strong predilection for concrete reasoning and overreliance on pictographic information of functionally illiterate consumers suggest that companies should reconsider how they highlight the added benefits of new products or the differentiating aspects of existing product offerings across channels such as advertising, in-store displays, and positioning. Concrete reasoning also has strong implications for the execution and presentation of price promotions through coupons and in-store discounts, because many consumers are unable to process the information and thus avoid discounted products. Finally, the elaborate coping mechanisms identified and the loyalty that functionally illiterate consumers display toward companies that are sensitive to their literacy and numeracy deficiencies reveal a potential for loyalty programs aimed at this population that do not involve price discounts.

Title: Determinants of Customers’ Responses to Customized Offers: Conceptual Framework and Research Propositions
Author-Name: Itamar Simonson
Abstract: Marketers have been challenged by proponents of individual (one-to-one) marketing to shift from focusing on market segments to making individually customized offers. Building on current knowledge regarding the construction of customers’ preferences, the author examines the basic assumptions underlying individual marketing and presents a process model of customers’ responses to customized offers. The model addresses (1) preference development, (2) evaluation of customized offers, (3) likelihood of purchasing the customized offers, and (4) maintenance of relationships with one-to-one marketers. The analysis leads to specific propositions regarding determinants of customers’ responses to customized offers. The author discusses future research directions and managerial implications.

Title: Benchmarking Marketing Capabilities for Sustainable Competitive Advantage

Abstract: Market-based organizational learning has been identified as an important source of sustainable competitive advantage. One particular learning mechanism, benchmarking, is a widely used management tool that has been recognized as appropriate for identifying and enhancing valuable marketing capabilities. However, despite widespread admonitions to managers, the benchmarking of marketing capabilities as a route to sustainable competitive advantage has received scant empirical attention. The authors empirically examine the potential business performance benefits available from benchmarking the marketing capabilities of top-performing firms. The results suggest that benchmarking has the potential to become a key learning mechanism for identifying, building, and enhancing marketing capabilities to deliver sustainable competitive advantage.

Title: A Marketing Perspective on Mergers and Acquisitions: How Marketing Integration Affects Postmerger Performance
Author-Name: Christian Homburg, 
Author-Name: Matthias Bucerius
Abstract: Previous research on mergers and acquisitions (M&A) has neglected marketing issues by and large. In this article, the authors examine the effects of postmerger integration in marketing (extent and speed of marketing integration) on M&A performance, as mediated by integration outcomes (magnitude of cost savings and market-related performance). Results from a survey of 232 horizontal M&A show that market-related performance after the merger or acquisition has a much stronger impact on financial performance than does cost savings. In addition, the authors find that the extent of integration is beneficial in terms of cost savings but detrimental in terms of market-related performance. Finally, they identify variables that moderate the relationships being considered.

Title: Do Intentions Really Predict Behavior? Self-Generated Validity Effects in Survey Research
Author-Name: Pierre Chandon, 
Author-Name: Vicki G. Morwitz, 
Author-Name: Werner J. Reinartz
Abstract: Studies of the relationship between purchase intentions and purchase behavior have ignored the possibility that the very act of measurement may inflate the association between intentions and behavior, a phenomenon called “self-generated validity.” In this research, the authors develop a latent model of the reactive effects of measurement that is applicable to intentions, attitude, or satisfaction data, and they show that this model can be estimated with a two-stage procedure. In the first stage, the authors use data from surveyed consumers to predict the presurvey latent purchase intentions of both surveyed and nonsurveyed consumers. In the second stage, they compare the strength of the association between the presurvey latent intentions and the postsurvey behavior across both groups. The authors find large and reliable self-generated validity effects across three diverse large-scale field studies. On average, the correlation between latent intentions and purchase behavior is 58% greater among surveyed consumers than it is among similar nonsurveyed consumers. One study also shows that the reactive effect of the measurement of purchase intentions is entirely mediated by self-generated validity and not by social norms, intention modification, or other measurement effects that are independent of presurvey latent intentions.

Abstract: In this article, the authors examine consumers' behavior with respect to expiration dates for grocery store perishable products. A better understanding of such behavior can both guide efforts to educate consumers about the risks associated with perishables that are approaching their expiration dates and help managers implement effective promotional strategies for these products throughout the course of their shelf lives. Both of these approaches can help reduce waste due to spoilage.

Title: Conflicts in the Work–Family Interface: Links to Job Stress, Customer Service Employee Performance, and Customer Purchase Intent
Author-Name: Richard G. Netemeyer,

Abstract: Because customer service employees often represent the sole contact a customer has with a firm, it is important to examine job-related factors that affect customer service employee performance and customer evaluations. In two diverse customer settings, the authors capture matched responses from service employees, supervisors, and customers. The authors use the data to examine the potential chain of effects from customer service employee work–family conflict and family–work conflict, to job stress and job performance, to customer purchase intent (CPI). The results show direct (and indirect) effects of work–family conflict and family–work conflict on service employee customer-directed extra-role performance (CDERP). The results also show direct effects of job stress on service employee in-role performance (IRP) and CDERP and on CPI. Furthermore, the findings show that job stress has a more pronounced effect on IRP than on CDERP and that CDERP has a greater effect on CPI than does IRP. The authors conclude with a discussion

Title: Product Development Resources and the Scope of the Firm
Author-Name: Birger Wernerfelt
Abstract: This article examines the relationship between a firm's strength in product development and its optimal scope. Firms with product development strength have two options: They can leverage it in horizontally related markets, and they can reach into the supply chain to take full advantage of it. The question is how this should be done. One possibility is for the firm to expand its scope, and another is to manage the linkage through contracts. On the basis of the adjustment cost theory of the firm, the author argues that the former solution is more appropriate when product development is fast-paced. This study tests the argument in a sample of several thousand firms and reports four tests. For both types of expansion, the author examines the incidence and the productivity of increased scope. The author uses several measures and finds results that are consistent with the theory.

Abstract: The authors conduct a meta-analysis that aggregates empirical findings from the market orientation literature. First, the study provides a quantitative summary of the bivariate findings regarding the antecedents and the consequences of market orientation. Second, the authors use multivariate analyses of aggregate study effects to identify significant antecedents of market orientation and the process variables that mediate the relationship between market orientation and performance. In addition, using regression analysis, the authors find that the market orientation–performance relationship is stronger in samples of manufacturing firms, in low power-distance and uncertainty-avoidance cultures, and in studies that use subjective measures of performance. The authors also find that the market orientation–performance correlation is stronger for both cost-based and revenue-based performance measures in manufacturing firms than in service firms. On the basis of the findings, the authors conclude with a discussion of the implications for practice and further research.

Title: The Effects of Strategic Orientations on Technology- and Market-Based Breakthrough Innovations
Author-Name: Kevin Zheng Zhou, 
Author-Name: Chi Kin (Bennett) Yim, 
Author-Name: David K. Tse
Abstract: Does market orientation impede breakthrough innovation? To date, researchers have presented opposing arguments with respect to this important issue. To address this controversy, the authors conceptualize and empirically test a model that links different types of strategic orientations and market forces, through organizational learning, to breakthrough innovations and firm performance. The results show that a market orientation facilitates innovations that use advanced technology and offer greater benefits to mainstream customers (i.e., technology-based innovations) but inhibits innovations that target emerging market segments (i.e., market-based innovations). A technology orientation is beneficial to technology-based innovations but has no impact on market-based innovations, and an entrepreneurial orientation facilitates both types of breakthroughs. Different market forces (demand uncertainty, technology turbulence, and competitive intensity) exert significant influence on technology- and market-based innovations, and these two types of innovations affect firm performance differently. The results have significant implications for firm strategies to facilitate product innovations and achieve competitive advantages.

Author-Name: Matthew L. Meuter, 
Author-Name: Mary Jo Bitner, 
Author-Name: Amy L. Ostrom, 
Author-Name: Stephen W. Brown
Abstract: Electronic commerce is an increasingly popular business model with a wide range of tools available to firms. An application that is becoming more common is the use of self-service technologies (SSTs), such as telephone banking, automated hotel checkout, and online investment trading, whereby customers produce services for themselves without assistance from firm employees. Widespread introduction of SSTs is apparent across industries, yet relatively little is known about why customers decide to try SSTs and why some SSTs are more widely accepted than others. In this research, the authors explore key factors that influence the initial SST trial decision, specifically focusing on actual behavior in situations in which the consumer has a choice among delivery modes. The authors show that the consumer readiness variables of role clarity, motivation, and ability are key mediators between established adoption constructs (innovation characteristics and individual differences) and the likelihood of trial.

Abstract: Two experimental studies (a lab experiment and a study involving a real usage experience over time) reveal the existence of a strong, positive impact of customer satisfaction on willingness to pay, and they provide support for a nonlinear, functional structure based on disappointment theory (i.e., an inverse S-shaped form). In addition, the second study examines dynamic aspects of the relationship and provides evidence for the stronger impact of cumulative satisfaction rather than of transaction-specific satisfaction on willingness to pay.

Abstract: In a large empirical study, the authors find that older consumers, who constitute an important market segment, repurchase a brand more frequently when they buy a new car. Older consumers consider fewer brands, fewer dealers, and fewer models, and they choose long-established brands more often. To interpret the results, the authors rely on four age-related theoretical perspectives: biological aging, cognitive decline, socioemotional selectivity, and change aversion.

Abstract: In this article, the authors strengthen the chain of effects that link customer satisfaction to shareholder value by establishing the link between satisfaction and two characteristics of future cash flows that determine the value of the firm to shareholders: growth and stability. Using longitudinal American Customer Satisfaction Index and COMPUSTAT data and hierarchical Bayesian estimation, the authors find that satisfaction creates shareholder value by increasing future cash flow growth and reducing its variability. They test the stability of findings across several firm and industry characteristics, and they assess the robustness of the results using multimeasure and multimethod estimation.

Using longitudinal American Customer Satisfaction Index and COMPUSTAT data and hierarchical Bayesian estimation, the authors find that satisfaction creates shareholder value by increasing future cash flow growth and reducing its variability. They test the stability of findings across several firm and industry characteristics, and they assess the robustness of the results using multimeasure and multimethod estimation.

Title: Understanding Firms' Customer Satisfaction Information Usage
Author-Name: Neil A. Morgan,

Author-Name: Vikas Mittal
Abstract: Despite theoretical and empirical research linking a firm's business performance to the satisfaction of its customers, knowledge of how firms collect and use customer satisfaction information is limited. The authors investigate firms' customer satisfaction information usage (CSIU) by drawing on in-depth interviews, a focus group of managers, and the existing literature. They identify key characteristics of the major processes involved in firms' CSIU and compare the CSIU practices revealed in their fieldwork with widely held normative theory prescriptions. They also identify variations in CSIU among the firms in the fieldwork and uncover factors that may help explain the observed differences.

Title: Technological Evolution and Radical Innovation
Author-Name: Ashish Sood, 
Author-Name: Gerard J. Tellis
Abstract: Technological change is perhaps the most powerful engine of growth in markets today. To harness this source of growth, firms need answers to key questions about the dynamics of technological change: (1) How do new technologies evolve? (2) How do rival technologies compete? and (3) How do firms deal with technological evolution? Currently, the literature suggests that a new technology seems to evolve along an S-shaped path, which starts below that of an old technology, intersects it once, and ends above the old technology. This belief is based on scattered empirical evidence and some circular definitions. Using new definitions and data on 14 technologies from four markets, the authors examine the shape and competitive dynamics of technological evolution. The results contradict the prediction of a single S-curve. Instead, technological evolution seems to follow a step function, with sharp improvements in performance following long periods of no improvement. Moreover, paths of rival technologies may cross more than once or not at all.

Author-Name: Andreas Herrmann
Abstract: The authors develop and estimate a conceptual model of how different aspects of customers' relationships with the brand community influence their intentions and behaviors. The authors describe how identification with the brand community leads to positive consequences, such as greater community engagement, and negative consequences, such as normative community pressure and (ultimately) reactance. They examine the moderating effects of customers' brand knowledge and the brand community's size and test their hypotheses by estimating a structural equation model with survey data from a sample of European car club members.

Abstract: This study investigates the effect of corporate brand dominance—that is, the visibility of a company's corporate brand in product communications—on the relationship between corporate associations and product evaluations. The results show that corporate brand dominance determines the degree to which associations with the company's corporate ability and corporate social responsibility influence product attitudes, as well as the nature of the moderating effects of fit and involvement.

Author-Name: G. Tomas M. Hult
Abstract: Adopting a contingency perspective, the authors present and test a fit-as-moderation model that posits that overall firm performance is influenced by how well the marketing organization's structural characteristics (i.e., formalization, centralization, and specialization) and strategic behavioral emphases (i.e., customer, competitor, innovation, and cost control) complement alternative business strategies (i.e., prospector, analyzer, low-cost defender, and differentiated defender). Responses from 228 senior marketing managers provide support for the model and demonstrate that each strategy type requires different combinations of marketing organization structures and strategic behaviors for success.

Title: Decomposing Influence Strategies: Argument Structure and Dependence as Determinants of the Effectiveness of Influence Strategies in Gaining Channel Member Compliance
Author-Name: Janice M. Payan, 
Author-Name: Richard G. McFarland
Abstract: Although there is considerable research examining the effects of influence strategies on relational outcomes, research has been silent on the effectiveness of influence strategies in achieving the primary objective: channel member compliance. The authors develop a theoretical model that predicts that noncoercive influence strategies (Rationality, Recommendations, Information Exchange, and Requests) with an argument structure that contains more thorough content result in relatively greater levels of compliance. The model further predicts that coercive influence strategies (Promises and Threats) result in compliance only when target dependence levels are high. The authors develop a new influence strategy, Rationality, which represents a noncoercive strategy with a full argument structure. In general, empirical findings support the theoretical model. However, in contrast to expectations, the use of Recommendations had a negative effect on compliance. Post hoc analysis revealed a significant interaction between trust and Recommendations on compliance, thus providing an explanation for this unexpected result. When trust is low, Recommendation strategies are counterproductive. The authors discuss implications of the findings and directions for further research.

Title: Do Suppliers Benefit from Collaborative Relationships with Large Retailers? An Empirical Investigation of Efficient Consumer Response Adoption
Author-Name: Daniel Corsten, 
Author-Name: Nirmalya Kumar
Abstract: Collaborative manufacturer–retailer relationships based on efficient consumer response (ECR) have become ubiquitous over the past decade. Yet academic studies of ECR adoption and its impact on marketing relationships are relatively scarce. Inspired by the relational view of competitive advantage, the authors empirically investigate whether the extent to which suppliers of a major retailer adopt ECR has a beneficial impact on their outcomes. The results demonstrate that whereas ECR adoption has a positive impact on supplier economic performance and capability development, it also generates greater perceptions of negative inequity on the part of the supplier. However, retailer capabilities and supplier trust moderate some of these main effects. The overall results are robust with respect to differences in supplier size as well as between branded and private-label suppliers.

Title: How Organizational Complaint Handling Drives Customer Loyalty: An Analysis of the Mechanistic and the Organic Approach
Author-Name: Christian Homburg, 
Author-Name: Andreas Fürst
Abstract: This article addresses how an organization's complaint management affects customer justice evaluations and, in turn, customer satisfaction and loyalty. In delineating an organization's complaint management, the authors draw a distinction between two fundamental approaches, the mechanistic approach (based on establishing guidelines) and the organic approach (based on creating a favorable internal environment). The empirical analysis is based on a dyadic data set that contains managerial assessments of companies' complaint management and complaining customers' assessments with respect to perceived justice, satisfaction, and loyalty. Findings indicate that though both the mechanistic and the organic approach significantly influence complaining customers' assessments, the mechanistic approach has a stronger total impact. Moreover, the study provides evidence of a primarily complementary relationship between the two approaches. Another key facet of the study is related to the moderating influences of the type of business (business-to-business versus business-to-consumer) and type of industry (service versus manufacturing). The results show that the beneficial effects of the mechanistic approach are stronger in business-to-consumer settings than in business-to-business ones and for service firms than for manufacturing firms.

Title: The Emergence of Dominant Designs
Author-Name: Raji Srinivasan
Author-Name: Gary L. Lilien
Author-Name: Arvind Rangaswamt
Abstract: In many product categories, technological evolution results in the emergence of a single product design that achieves market dominance. In this article, the authors examine two questions: Will a dominant design emerge in a new product category? and If it does, how long will it be before a dominant design emerges? Thus, the authors simultaneously model the probability of emergence of a dominant design and the time of that emergence, conditional on its emergence. The model incorporates the effects of several product-market characteristics on the probability and time of dominant design emergence, including appropriability of the rents associated with the product, network effects, size of the product's value net, the standards-setting process, radicalness of innovation, and research-and-development intensity. The authors use data for 63 office products and consumer durables to estimate a split-population hazard model for the probability and time of emergence of the dominant design. They find that a dominant design is more likely to emerge with weak appropriability, weak network effects, low product radicalness, and high research-and-development intensity. Dominant designs that emerge are likely to emerge sooner in product categories in which there is weak appropriability, there are a large number of firms in the value net, the standards are set by a de facto process, and there is low product radicalness The proposed model can be used to predict both the probability and the time of the emergence of a dominant design in a new product category.

Title: Stuck in the Past: Why Managers Persist with New Product Failures
Author-Name: Eyal Biyalogorsky
Author-Name: William Boulding
Author-Name: Richard Staelin
Abstract: In this research, the authors examine the phenomenon of escalation bias in the context of managing new product introductions. In particular, they identify three general paths—Decision Involvement Inertia, Decision Involvement Distortion, and Belief Inertia Distortion—that can lead managers to escalate their commitments. The authors test the relative strength of these paths in driving observed escalation behavior. The results show that involvement with the initial decision, a key construct in numerous explanations for escalation behavior (e.g., agency theory, self-justification), is not a necessary condition to induce commitment to a losing course of action (i.e., escalation bias). Rather, the authors find that the driving force behind escalation behavior is improper use of initial positive beliefs in the face of negative new information. This insight has implications for the groundwork necessary for organizations to design systems, policies, and procedures to help them avoid the trap of escalation bias that is often associated with major strategic decisions.

Abstract: The drivers of customer loyalty intentions are dynamic. What remains unclear is how these intentions evolve through the introduction and growth phases of a life cycle. Using a longitudinal study of cellular phone customers, the authors demonstrate that loyalty intentions are a function of perceived value early in the life cycle. Over time, more affective attitudes toward the brand and the relationship with the company come to mediate the effects of value on intentions. The results suggest that from the introduction to the growth stage of a life cycle, managers must adapt from improving value per se to measuring and managing relationships and brands directly.

Abstract: The research presented in this article addresses the issue of the significance and relative importance of the determinants of extension success by simultaneously investigating ten success factors. The empirical analysis considers the direct relationships between success factors and extension success, the structural relationships among investigated factors, and moderating effects. The authors find that fit between the parent brand and an extension product is the most important driver of brand extension success, followed by marketing support, parent-brand conviction, retailer acceptance, and parent-brand experience. The authors also find several important structural relationships among the investigated success factors (e.g., marketing support → fit → retailer acceptance → extension success). Finally, the interaction terms of fit with the quality of the parent brand and with parent-brand conviction are statistically significant, albeit of relatively low importance.

Title: Crossover Dreams: Consumer Responses to Ethnic-Oriented Products

Abstract: The authors develop and evaluate a framework for investigating and understanding ethnic product crossover, that is, when a product intended for one ethnic minority group gains significant penetration among consumers outside the referent ethnic group. In three studies, the authors investigate how a product's characteristics, the promotion and distribution decisions made for the product, and consumers' propensity for diversity influence the product's likelihood of crossing over from the intended ethnic target market to mainstream white consumers. Product characteristics interact with both other marketing decisions and consumers' diversity-seeking tendencies to influence whether consumers will be interested in ethnic products and the social context in which they are willing to consume them. The authors discuss the implications of the findings for theory and practice and provide directions for further research that include consideration of the product's ethnic embeddedness, the context in which the product will be consumed, and consumers' diversity-seeking tendencies.

Title: Brand Dilution: When Do New Brands Hurt Existing Brands?
Author-Name: Chris Pullig

Author-Name: Richard G. Netemeyer
Abstract: Potential for trademark dilution occurs when a new brand introduces itself with an identical or substantially similar mark to that of an existing brand. Currently, there is neither a clear standard for legal proof of dilution nor widely accepted measures for managerial use. Using a shared-brand-network model, the authors use three different but conceptually related measurement methodologies (response latency, aided recall, and simulated choice) across five experiments to examine “blurring” dilution effects. The results suggest that when junior brands operate in similar categories and position on similar attributes, there is no immediate threat of blurring dilution. However, if the junior brand chooses to position on dissimilar attributes in a similar category, dilution of attribute associations is likely. When the junior brand operates in dissimilar categories, there is a threat of blurring dilution for both category and attribute associations. The final two studies demonstrate that dilution of junior brands (i.e., operating in dissimilar categories positioned on dissimilar attributes) can suppress consideration and choice probabilities for the senior brand and that this effect may extend over a period of time.

Abstract: Extant marketing literature tends to view cross-functional relationships as primarily cooperative or competitive in nature, but not both. In contrast, this research focuses on cross-functional “coopetition” (i.e., the joint occurrence of cooperation and competition across functional areas within a firm). Using responses from midlevel managers and top executives, the authors find that cross-functional coopetition enhances a firm's customer and financial performance. The authors further show that this influence is mediated by market learning, indicating that performance returns to cross-functional coopetition occurs through an underlying learning mechanism.

Abstract: Consumers' reactions to rectangles have implications for package and product design. In two lab studies and an analysis of field data, the authors find that the ratio of the sides of a rectangular product or package can influence purchase intentions and preferences and is related to marketplace demand. In more exploratory inquiries, the authors also find that the impact of this ratio on consumers depends on the relative seriousness of the context in which the product is used. Furthermore, ratio can also affect product perceptions, and consumers appear to prefer a range of contiguous ratios for different contexts rather than a particular ratio.

Title: Human Brands: Investigating Antecedents to Consumers' Strong Attachments to Celebrities
Author-Name: Matthew Thomson
Abstract: This article explores recent advances in self-determination research to address why consumers develop strong attachments to “human brands,” a term that refers to any well-known persona who is the subject of marketing communications efforts. Study 1 uses a survey that is analyzed with structural equation modeling. Study 2 is qualitative and offers corroborating evidence for the proposed theoretical model. Study 3 extends the model with a more naturalistic sample and tests several alternative hypotheses using hierarchical regression. The results suggest that when a human brand enhances a person's feelings of autonomy and relatedness and does not suppress feelings of competence, the person is likely to become more strongly attached to it. This article documents that strong attachments are predictive of satisfied, trusting, and committed relationships and proposes that attachment strength may be a parsimonious proxy for consumer–brand relationship strength. The results imply that benefits would accrue to organizations such as entertainment firms and political parties that establish direct and routine interaction between human brands and consumers, that human brands to which consumers are attached offer significant potential as endorsers, and that organizations should address how to make the human brands they manage more authentic.

Title: Dual Distribution and Intangible Firm Value: Franchising in Restaurant Chains
Author-Name: Raji Srinivasan
Abstract: Dual distribution systems in which firms use vertical integration and market governance simultaneously are widely used across diverse marketing contexts (e.g., restaurants, retailing, industrial selling). A prominent example of dual distribution includes business format franchising, in which firms (i.e., the franchisors) license the operation of some of their units to franchisees while owning and operating some units themselves. Despite the widespread prevalence of dual distribution, there are few insights into its performance implications. In this article, the author examines the relationship between a firm's dual distribution strategy and its intangible value. Franchising in restaurant chains serves as the empirical context for the study. It is proposed that a firm's dual distribution strategy affects its intangible value both independently and jointly with a set of firm characteristics. The author considers the firm's age, scope of vertical integration, advertising, financial leverage, and financial liquidity as firm characteristics that influence the relationship between dual distribution strategy and intangible value. The author measures the firm's dual distribution strategy by the proportion of its franchised units to its total units and intangible value by its Tobin's q. The author estimates the proposed model using panel data on 55 publicly listed U.S. restaurant chains for the period 1992-2002. Unobserved firm heterogeneity is accommodated using latent class regression analysis. The results support a four-segment model. Dual distribution increases intangible value for some firms but decreases intangible value for others, both independently and in conjunction with other firm characteristics.

Abstract: The authors examine how country characteristics systematically moderate the effects of individual-level drivers of the perceived value that consumers derive from visiting a brand manufacturer's Web site. They test hypotheses on data collected from 8886 consumers from 23 countries on three continents, involving 30 Web sites of the world's largest consumer packaged goods companies. They find that the effect of privacy/security protection on perceived value is stronger for people from countries with a weak rule of law, whereas people from countries that are high on national identity give more weight to whether there is cultural congruity between the site and themselves. People who live in more individualistic countries give more weight to pleasure, to privacy/security protection, and to customization in their perceived value judgments than people from collectivistic countries. The authors discuss implications for Web site design strategies.

Abstract: Despite the strong recognition that customer satisfaction should be viewed from a dynamic perspective, little is known about how the satisfaction judgment develops over time. Therefore, this study provides a dynamic analysis of the simultaneous influence of cognition and affect in the satisfaction formation process. The results of an experimental study based on a real consumption experience indicate that the impact of cognition on the satisfaction evaluation increases and the influence of affect decreases over time. Moreover, these effects are attenuated with inconsistent performance experiences. Finally, the study shows that the variance in customer satisfaction jointly explained by cognition and affect increases as experience accumulates.

Title: Scents and Sensibility:When Do (In)Congruent Ambient Scents Influence Product Evaluations?
Author-Name: Anick Bosmans
Abstract: This research examines when and how ambient scents (i.e., scents that are present in the environment and do not emanate from a specific product) affect product evaluations. Consistent with theory in environmental psychology, the author predicts that such ambient scents can elicit emotional responses that can influence subsequent judgments, but only when specific conditions are met. Three factors are hypothesized to moderate the effects of pleasant ambient scents on evaluations: (1) the congruence of the scent with the product, (2) the salience of the scent, and (3) consumers' motivation to correct for extraneous influences. The findings of three experiments suggest that as long as ambient scents are congruent with the product, they continue to affect consumers' evaluations, even when their influence becomes salient or when consumers are sufficiently motivated to correct for extraneous influences. In addition, as long as the scent is not completely incongruent with the product, noncongruent scents are corrected for only when their influence becomes salient or when consumers are sufficiently motivated. These findings indicate that the impact of pleasant ambient scents on product evaluations may be stronger than that of other affective environmental cues.

Title: From Fear to Loathing? How Emotion Influences the Evaluation and Early Use of Innovations
Author-Name: Stacy L. Wood
Author-Name: C. Page. Moreau
Abstract: Innovation adoption is rarely a short process for consumers; accordingly, recent research has explored adoption as a dynamic process that is characterized by changing patterns, or diffusion, of consumer use of the innovation. This research suggests that adoption is rarely a neutral process and that consumers can experience strong emotions in the initial use of innovations. However, given such emotions, two opposing arguments can be made as to whether the inclusion of emotional responses increases the predictive power of traditional models of diffusion. On the one hand, experienced emotion may simply be a function of gained benefits and, as such, may already be captured in extant models through cognitive assessments of net benefits. On the other hand, and as data from two empirical and longitudinal studies demonstrate, the learning process is potentially emotion generating (independent of net benefits), and this emotion colors product evaluations. The emotional influence is sizable and, importantly, not a straightforward case of “easier is better.” In this work, the authors present the E3 (expectation → emotion → evaluation) model, which describes how managers can better predict and influence the successful diffusion of complex technological products.

Title: Valuing the Real Option of Abandoning Unprofitable Customers When Calculating Customer Lifetime Value
Author-Name: Michael Haenlein
Author-Name: Andreas M. Kaplan
Author-Name: Detlef Schoder
Abstract: In recent years, several authors have developed models that focus on the allocation of scarce marketing resources based on customer lifetime value (CLV). These approaches use CLV to develop a rank order of customers and recommend devoting more resources to customers with higher ranks. However, it has been discussed in the literature that a simple net present value analysis may not reflect the value of the flexibility to make such decisions. Therefore, some authors recommend the use of a real-options analysis in certain situations. Building on this stream of research and using the case of the option to abandon unprofitable customers, this article proposes an approach that combines real-options analysis and CLV; this approach explicitly values the seller's flexibility to abandon unprofitable customers. Using a combination of examples, empirical analysis, and Monte Carlo simulations, the authors provide evidence that the divergence between CLV that includes and CLV that excludes option value can be substantial and may not be the same for all customers. Therefore, the authors conclude that a distribution of customers based on CLV can change when option value is included. Thus, using CLV as a basis for marketing decisions but not including the value of the option to make such decisions a priori when calculating CLV can lead to an overall biased result.

Title: Are All Smiles Created Equal? How Emotional Contagion and Emotional Labor Affect Service Relationships

Author-Name: Dwayne D. Gremler
Abstract: In this study, the authors examine the effects of two facets of employee emotions on customers' assessments of service encounters. Drawing on emotional contagion and emotional labor theories, they investigate the influence of the extent of service employees' display of positive emotions and the authenticity of their emotional labor display on customers' emotional states and, subsequently, on customers' assessments of the service interaction and their relationship with the service provider. To test the study hypotheses, 223 consumers participated in a simulated service encounter in which actors played the roles of service employees. In a 2 × 2 factorial design, the employees varied both the extent of their smiling behavior and their emotional labor display by engaging in surface or deep acting. The results show that the authenticity of employees' emotional labor display directly affects customers' emotional states. However, contrary to expectations, the extent of employee smiling does not influence customer emotions, providing no support for the existence of primitive emotional contagion in service interactions. Furthermore, employee emotions exert an influence on customer outcomes that are of interest to marketers.

Title: Word of Mouth for Movies: Its Dynamics and Impact on Box Office Revenue
Author-Name: Yong Liu
Abstract: This article uses actual word-of-mouth (WOM) information to examine the dynamic patterns of WOM and how it helps explain box office revenue. The WOM data were collected from the Yahoo Movies Web site. The results show that WOM activities are the most active during a movie's prerelease and opening week and that movie audiences tend to hold relatively high expectations before release but become more critical in the opening week. More important, WOM information offers significant explanatory power for both aggregate and weekly box office revenue, especially in the early weeks after a movie opens. However, most of this explanatory power comes from the volume of WOM and not from its valence, as measured by the percentages of positive and negative messages.

Title: Friends, Businesspeople, and Relationship Roles: A Conceptual Framework and a Research Agenda
Author-Name: Jan B. Heide
Author-Name: Kenneth H. Wathne
Abstract: This article develops a conceptual framework of roles in marketing relationships. Drawing on emerging theory from economic sociology and March's (1994) notion of decision “logics,” the authors discuss two prototypical relationship roles, namely (1) a “friend,” who uses a “logic of appropriateness” and follows established rules, and (2) a “businessperson,” whose decisions are guided by utility-maximizing considerations under a “logic of consequences.” Next, they use extant theories of interfirm governance to suggest that firms' relationship strategies can be used both to create different relationship roles in the first place and to activate them over time. The authors posit that activation can have several different outcomes, including reinforcement of an existing dominant role or actual switching to a new one. Theoretically, the conceptual framework allows for integration of different perspectives on interfirm relationships, some of which have provided seemingly inconsistent accounts of firm behavior. From a managerial perspective, the framework identifies specific matches between particular relationship roles on the one hand and firms' governance strategies on the other hand. In general, the framework suggests that an in-depth understanding of roles is a prerequisite for the deployment of relationship management initiatives toward resellers, customers, and suppliers.

Title: Corporate Social Responsibility, Customer Satisfaction, and Market Value
Author-Name: Xueming Luo
Author-Name: C.B. Bhattacharya
Abstract: Although prior research has addressed the influence of corporate social responsibility (CSR) on perceived customer responses, it is not clear whether CSR affects market value of the firm. This study develops and tests a conceptual framework, which predicts that (1) customer satisfaction partially mediates the relationship between CSR and firm market value (i.e., Tobin's q and stock return), (2) corporate abilities (innovativeness capability and product quality) moderate the financial returns to CSR, and (3) these moderated relationships are mediated by customer satisfaction. Based on a large-scale secondary data set, the results show support for this framework. Notably, the authors find that in firms with low innovativeness capability, CSR actually reduces customer satisfaction levels and, through the lowered satisfaction, harms market value. The uncovered mediated and asymmetrically moderated results offer important implications for marketing theory and practice.

Title: Influence Tactics for Effective Adaptive Selling
Author-Name: Richard G. McFarland
Author-Name: Goutam N. Challagalla
Author-Name: Tasadduq A. Shervani
Abstract: The adaptive selling literature identifies effective salespeople as those who match their influence tactics to suit the characteristics of buyers. However, prior research is largely silent on the specific influence tactics that salespeople use and the effectiveness of these tactics across different types of buyers. The authors propose a theoretical model that uses Kelman's (1961) underlying influence processes of internalization, compliance, and identification to identify the seller influence tactics that salespeople use and to assess which of these tactics will resonate with three types of buyers: task-oriented buyers, interaction-oriented buyers, and self-oriented buyers. The authors test their model with data from 193 bidirectionally matched buyer–seller dyads. The results strongly support the theoretical model and suggest that buyers are more complex than originally presumed. However, salespeople seem to recognize this complexity and use the combination of influence tactics prescribed by theory for persuading these types of buyers.

Title: How Biased Household Inventory Estimates Distort Shopping and Storage Decisions
Author-Name: Pierre Chandon
Author-Name: Brian Wansink
Abstract: The authors develop a model of how consumers estimate the level of product inventory in their households. Two laboratory experiments and two field studies involving 29 product categories show that (1) consumers anchor their estimates on their average inventory and fail to adjust sufficiently; (2) adjustments follow an inelastic psychophysical power function, leading to overestimations of low levels of inventory and underestimations of high levels; and (3) adjustments are more elastic and, thus, more accurate when inventory is salient. Contrary to the assumptions of practitioners and academic modelers, these inventory estimates, not actual inventory levels, drive subsequent purchase incidence. Simulation results further show that biased estimates increase overstocking and spoilage among stockout-averse consumers but increase stockouts and unmet demand among overstocking-averse consumers. By predicting the magnitude, not just the direction, of estimation biases, the model and the results offer new insights into accelerating the consumption of healthy foods and improving the targeting of stockpiling-inducing sales promotions.

Title: Factors Influencing the Effectiveness of Relationship Marketing: A Meta-Analysis

Author-Name: Kenneth R. Evans
Abstract: Relationship marketing (RM) has emerged as one of the dominant mantras in business strategy circles, though RM investigations often yield mixed results. To help managers and researchers improve the effectiveness of their efforts, the authors synthesize RM empirical research in a meta-analytic framework. Although the fundamental premise that RM positively affects performance is well supported, many of the authors' findings have significant implications for research and practice. Relationship investment has a large, direct effect on seller objective performance, which implies that additional meditated pathways may explain the impact of RM on performance. Objective performance is influenced most by relationship quality (a composite measure of relationship strength) and least by commitment. The results also suggest that RM is more effective when relationships are more critical to customers (e.g., service offerings, channel exchanges, business markets) and when relationships are built with an individual person rather than a selling firm (which partially explains the mixed effects between RM and performance reported in previous studies).

Title: Achieving Marketing Objectives Through Social Sponsorships
Author-Name: Carolyn J. Simmons
Author-Name: Karen L. Becker-Olsen
Abstract: The corporate social responsibility literature has focused on creating broad associations, such as simply being “socially responsible,” and on the simple transfer of positive affect from sponsored causes to sponsoring firms. Both views fail to recognize the power of social initiatives as a means for differentiating among socially responsible firms and, in particular, for reinforcing the brand's positioning. The authors adopt a more traditional branding perspective and show that the fit between a firm's specific associations and a sponsored cause can reinforce or blur the firm's positioning, influence liking for the sponsorship, and bolster or undermine the firm's equity. They also show that communications decisions can mitigate the negative effects of low fit. Finally, they show that sponsorship effects can persist for as long as a year despite day-to-day exposure to other brand communications.

Title: The Unhealthy = Tasty Intuition and Its Effects on Taste Inferences, Enjoyment, and Choice of Food Products
Author-Name: Rajagopal Raghunathan
Author-Name: Rebecca Walker Naylor
Author-Name: Wayne D. Hoyer
Abstract: Across four experiments, the authors find that when information pertaining to the assessment of the healthiness of food items is provided, the less healthy the item is portrayed to be, (1) the better is its inferred taste, (2) the more it is enjoyed during actual consumption, and (3) the greater is the preference for it in choice tasks when a hedonic goal is more (versus less) salient. The authors obtain these effects both among consumers who report that they believe that healthiness and tastiness are negatively correlated and, to a lesser degree, among those who do not report such a belief. The authors also provide evidence that the association between the concepts of “unhealthy” and “tasty” operates at an implicit level. The authors discuss possibilities for controlling the effect of the unhealthy = tasty intuition (and its potential for causing negative health consequences), including controlling the volume of unhealthy but tasty food eaten, changing unhealthy foods to make them less unhealthy but still tasty, and providing consumers with better information about what constitutes “healthy.”

Title: Broadening the Scope of Reference Price Advertising Research: A Field Study of Consumer Shopping Involvement
Author-Name: Daniel J. Howard
Author-Name: Roger A. Kerin
Abstract: The current understanding of reference pricing requires broadening to reflect contemporary advertising practices and shopping behavior. A content analysis of 13,594 newspaper retail advertisements reveals that it is uncommon for reference pricing to be used alone in advertisements: 87.2% of the advertisements featuring reference pricing also include limited-time availability (i.e., “Three days only!”) or sale announcements in the headline or copy. Using dual-process theories of persuasion as a conceptual framework, the authors conduct three field experiments that compare the conditions under which the use of limited-time availability and sale announcements in advertisements that feature reference prices affects consumer price perceptions and store shopping intentions. The findings yield three insights for reference price advertising. First, reference pricing results in favorable price perceptions and store shopping intentions only when consumers are shopping for a product. Second, when consumers are shopping for a product, reference pricing paired with limited-time availability results in more favorable price perceptions and store shopping intentions than the use of either technique alone. Third, the use of sale announcements and limited-time availability in reference price advertisements has a favorable effect on price perceptions and store shopping intentions when consumers are not shopping for a product.

Abstract: An impediment to Web-based retail sales is the impersonal nature of Web-based shopping. A solution to this problem is to use an avatar to deliver product information. An avatar is a graphic representation that can be animated by means of computer technology. Study 1 shows that using an avatar sales agent leads to more satisfaction with the retailer, a more positive attitude toward the product, and a greater purchase intention. Study 2 shows that an attractive avatar is a more effective sales agent at moderate levels of product involvement, but an expert avatar is a more effective sales agent at high levels of product involvement.

Title: Creating a Market Orientation: A Longitudinal, Multifirm, Grounded Analysis of Cultural Transformation
Author-Name: Gary F. Gebhardt

Author-Name: John F. Sherry Jr.
Abstract: Market orientation is a foundation of marketing and is increasingly important in other fields, such as strategic management. Research in marketing has identified the characteristics of market-oriented organizations. However, how organizations change to become more market oriented has received less attention. In this article, the authors conduct an in-depth, longitudinal, multifirm investigation of firms that have successfully created a market orientation. Grounded by this in-depth understanding, they develop a theoretical model to explain how firms create a market orientation. The model identifies four path-dependent stages of change. In contrast to current conceptualizations, the authors find that creating a market orientation requires dramatic changes to an organization's culture and the creation of organizationally shared market understandings. The findings offer new insights into how organizations develop a greater market orientation, organizational change, and the nature of market orientation, including the role of intraorganizational power and organizational learning in creating and sustaining a market orientation.

Title: It Just Feels Good: Customers' Affective Response to Touch and Its Influence on Persuasion
Author-Name: Joann Peck
Author-Name: Jennifer Wiggins
Abstract: Prior research has assumed that touch has a persuasive effect only if it provides attribute or structural information about a product. Under this view, the role of touch as a persuasive tool is limited. The main purpose of this research is to investigate the persuasive influence of touch as an affective tool in the absence of useful product-related information. The authors find that for people who are motivated to touch because it is fun or interesting, a communication that incorporates touch leads to increased affective response and increased persuasion, particularly when the touch provides neutral or positive sensory feedback. People who are not motivated to touch for fun will also be persuaded by a communication that incorporates touch when they are able to make sense of how the touch is related to the message. The authors explore the effectiveness of different types of touch in generating an affective response, and they replicate the effects on attitudes and behavior in a real-world setting. This research suggests that the marketing implications of touch are more substantial than previously believed. The authors present research implications for direct marketing, product packaging, point-of-purchase displays, and print advertising.

Abstract: Practitioners and scholars have questioned marketing communication's credibility because it has not been linked to firm shareholder value. Using secondary longitudinal data, the authors show that the impact of marketing communication productivity (MCP) on shareholder value is positive and nonlinear. In particular, the influence of MCP on the forward-looking performances of Tobin's q and stock return is curvilinear with an inverted U shape. The authors also investigate the moderating role of research-and-development investment and competitive intensity. The findings have implications for marketing managers regarding how to model and benchmark MCP and the dangers of blindly improving the productivity of advertising and sales promotion expenditures.

Title: Upgrades and New Purchases
Author-Name: Erica Mina Okada
Abstract: In many industries, firms introduce successive generations of new and enhanced product models to remain competitive. Product enhancements target first-time purchasers and consumers who already own an existing product and are considering upgrading to a new and enhanced product. Upgrade decisions differ from new purchase decisions because they are hindered by the psychological costs associated with the purchase price spent on the existing product. This research examines how the enhanced product can be positioned relative to the existing product to mitigate the psychological costs and facilitate upgrade purchases. A series of studies demonstrate that consumers with existing products are more likely to upgrade when the enhanced product is generally dissimilar to the existing product. Upgraders have stronger preferences than first-time purchasers for enhanced products with new features rather than for improvements on existing features, and they prefer enhancements that focus on a few key features rather than a general enhancement of all features.

Title: How Business Cycles Contribute to Private-Label Success: Evidence from the United States and Europe
Author-Name: Lien Lamey

Author-Name: Marnik G. Dekimpe
Author-Name: Jan-Benedict E.M. Steenkamp
Abstract: The growth of private labels over the past decades has been attributed to various factors. This article formally addresses the link between private-label success and economic expansions and contractions using recently developed time-series/econometric techniques. The findings confirm conventional wisdom that a country's private-label share increases when the economy is suffering and shrinks when the economy is flourishing. However, asymmetries are found in the extent to and speed with which private-label share changes in cyclical up- versus downturns. Consumers switch more extensively to store brands during bad economic times than they switch back to national brands in a subsequent recovery. In addition, the switch to private-label brands is faster than the opposite movement to national brands after the recession ends. Finally, not only are consumers more prone to buy private labels during economic downturns, but some keep buying them when bad economic times are long over as well, leaving permanent “scars” on national brands' performance level. The authors argue that national-brand manufacturers can mitigate the effect of an economic downturn on their shares by intensifying their marketing-support activities in recessions. Such a proactive strategy is not often observed. On the contrary, available evidence suggests that many manufacturers exacerbate their predicament by cutting back on their marketing expenses when the economy turns sour. Most retailers invest more strongly in their private-label program when the economy deteriorates, making it even more difficult for national brands to catch up with the share lost during contractions.

Title: Consumer Racism and Its Effects on Domestic Cross-Ethnic Product Purchase: An Empirical Test in the United States, Canada, and France
Author-Name: Jean-François Ouellet
Abstract: This study provides empirical evidence of the effects of consumer racism on domestic cross-ethnic product purchase in three countries. The model predicts that consumer racism will affect ethnic majorities' judgments of and willingness to buy products from each country's dominant ethnic minority. After a consumer racism measurement instrument is developed and validated, experiments and survey results show that varying levels of consumer racism affect consumer judgments of and willingness to buy domestic products that are perceived as being made by ethnic minorities in the three countries in which the tests took place. Moreover, the results indicate that minority-owned business performance is significantly and negatively affected in areas in which consumer racism is more prevalent. Moderators of consumer racism effects are the perceived level of interaction between consumers and the minority-owned company, a certain product-ethnicity image, and consumers' perceived importance of the outcome associated with consuming minority-owned companies' products and/or services.

Title: Getting Marketers to Invest in Firm-Specific Capital
Author-Name: David A. Griffith
Author-Name: Robert F. Lusch
Abstract: Firms gain competitive advantage by employing marketing professionals that have developed firm-specific capital. This study argues that marketers' perceptions of the governance structure employed by the firm to protect marketer capital influence marketers' job outcomes of organizational commitment, organizational trust, job satisfaction, and intention to turnover, which in turn influence the accumulation of capital more specific to the firm. The results demonstrate (1) that a protective governance structure in which marketers are able to obtain greater rewards internally than externally on more specific or less easily transferable capital does not enhance positive job outcomes and (2) that it is through the governance structures' influence on job outcomes, not through the governance structure itself, that marketing professionals are motivated to invest in the accumulation of capital specific to the firm. These results provide insights for senior marketing managers charged with developing a governance mechanism to both retain current marketing talent and develop a more effective marketing group.

Title: The Impact of Online Reverse Auction Design on Buyer–Supplier Relationships
Author-Name: Sandy D. Jap
Abstract: As the use of online reverse auctions in industrial-sourcing activities grows, buyers and suppliers are increasingly concerned about these auctions' effects on their interorganizational performance (i.e., suspicions of opportunism, overall satisfaction, and future expectations). This research examines how the buyer's auction design (i.e., the number of bidders, the economic stakes, and price visibility) and the price dynamics over the course of the auction affect its relationship with suppliers. Analysis of 25 quasi experiments involving 125 suppliers and $385 million in procurement contracts suggests that the larger the number of bidders, the larger the economic stakes, and the less visible the price in an auction, the more positive is the impact on the interorganizational relationship. Large price drops (higher savings) over the course of the event have a detrimental effect on the buyer–supplier relationship. For auctions in which the lowest bidder wins, there is a decrease in opportunism suspicions as the economic stakes of the auction increase, and there is an increase in opportunism suspicions in auctions with greater price visibility. Implications for the management of industrial procurement activities are considered.

Title: Making Sales Technology Effective
Author-Name: Gary K. Hunter
Author-Name: William D. Perreault Jr.
Abstract: Firms invest billions of dollars in sales technologies (STs; e.g., customer relationship management, sales automation tools) to improve sales force effectiveness and efficiency. However, the results expected from ST investments are often not achieved. This article proposes relationship-forging tasks that are critical to the link between ST use and key aspects of salesperson performance (i.e., a salesperson's relationship-building performance with customers and administrative performance). The authors evaluate relationship-forging tasks in the context of a model that considers the antecedents and consequences of three different uses of ST: accessing, analyzing, and communicating information. In general, the results of a field study, which is analyzed using block-recursive structural equation modeling, support the relationship-forging theory and show that relationship-forging tasks predict 57% of the variance in a salesperson's relationship-building performance with customers. The findings also support hypotheses that using ST either to analyze or to communicate information has mediated positive effects on a salesperson's relationship-building performance with customers. However, a salesperson's use of ST to analyze information has negative influences on administrative performance, creating an unexpected trade-off for sales and marketing managers.

Title: Visual Representation: Implications for Decision Making
Author-Name: Nicholas H. Lurie

Abstract: A large number of visualization tools have been created to help decision makers understand increasingly rich databases of product, customer, sales force, and other types of marketing information. This article presents a framework for thinking about how visual representations are likely to affect the decision processes or tasks that marketing managers and consumers commonly face, particularly those that involve the analysis or synthesis of substantial amounts of data. From this framework, the authors derive a set of testable propositions that serve as an agenda for further research. Although visual representations are likely to improve marketing manager efficiency, offer new insights, and increase customer satisfaction and loyalty, they may also bias decisions by focusing attention on a limited set of alternatives, increasing the salience and evaluability of less diagnostic information, and encouraging inaccurate comparisons. Given this, marketing managers are advised to subject insights from visual representations to more formal analysis.

Title: Moral Identity and Judgments of Charitable Behaviors

Abstract: In several studies, the authors examine the potential to leverage a consumer's moral identity to enhance brand and company identification and promote goodwill through community relations. Studies 1a and 1b show that even when opportunity costs are equivalent (subjectively or economically), consumers who also have a highly self-important moral identity perceive the act of giving time versus money as more moral and self-expressive. The authors extend these findings to self-reported preferences and establish boundary conditions in two additional studies. Consumers with higher organizational status prefer to give money versus time, but this preference is weaker for those with a highly self-important moral identity (Study 2), and the preference for giving time versus money is more likely to emerge when the moral self is primed and the time given has a moral purpose (Study 3).

Title: The Influence of Incidental Affect on Consumers' Food Intake

Abstract: Although incidental affect has been shown to influence both attitude and purchase behavior, it has not been extended to actual consumption. This research investigates whether specific affective states influence food consumption and whether this influence is moderated by factors such as information and the nature of the product (hedonic versus less hedonic). The authors show that an integrative mood management and mood evaluation framework accounts for this relationship more effectively than a self-regulation explanation. A preliminary test and two lab studies show that people eat larger amounts of hedonic foods (buttered popcorn and M&M's) when they are in a sad state than when they are in a happy state and that this effect is attenuated when nutritional information is present. In contrast, they tend to eat larger amounts of a less hedonic product (raisins) when they are in a happy state than when they are in a sad state. The authors discuss implications for responsible marketers, health professionals, and health conscious consumers in the context of campaigns and individual efforts.

Responding to this call, the authors examine the impact of a firm's advertising and its research and development (R&D) on the systematic risk of its stock, a key metric for publicly listed firms. They hypothesize that a firm's advertising and R&D expenditures create intangible assets that insulate it from stock market changes, lowering its systematic risk. They test the hypotheses using a panel data on 644 publicly listed firms between 1979 and 2001, consisting of five-year moving windows. They scale the firm's advertising and R&D expenditures by its sales. After controlling for factors that accounting and finance researchers have shown to be associated with systematic risk, the authors find that advertising/sales and R&D/sales lower a firm's systematic risk. The article's findings extend prior research that has focused primarily on the effect of marketing initiatives on performance metrics without consideration of systematic risk. For practice, the ability of advertising and R&D to reduce systematic risk highlights the multifaceted implications of advertising and research programs. The article's findings may surprise senior management, some of whom are skeptical of the financial accountability of advertising programs.

Title: When to Give Up Control of Outsourced New Product Development
Author-Name: Stephen J. Carson
Abstract: The author investigates the impact of client control on supplier task performance in the burgeoning area of outsourced new product development. In relationships in which the outsourced task requires a high degree of creativity on the part of the supplier, ex ante contractual control is shown to increase supplier performance. In contrast, ex post client control is shown to reduce supplier performance, though certain highly skilled clients can overcome this effect. Behaviorally, clients exercise less control both ex ante and ex post in relationships in which the outsourced task requires a high degree of creativity on the part of the supplier. Managerially, the results suggest that clients should use more ex ante control to govern highly creative tasks. In general, clients should use less ex post control over such tasks, though highly skilled clients can actually benefit from using greater control.

Abstract: Customer loyalty is an important strategic objective for all managers. Research has investigated the relationship between customer satisfaction and loyalty in various contexts. However, these predominantly cross-sectional studies have focused on customer retention as the primary measure of loyalty. There has been little investigation into the impact on share of wallet. Using data from the Canadian banking industry, this research aims to (1) provide the first longitudinal examination of the impact of changes in customer satisfaction on changes in share of wallet and (2) determine the moderating effects of customer age, income, education, expertise, and length of relationship. Data from 4319 households using 12,249 observations over a five-year period indicate a positive relationship between changes in satisfaction and share of wallet. In particular, the initial satisfaction level and the conditional percentile of change in satisfaction significantly correspond to changes in share of wallet. Two variables, income and length of the relationship, negatively moderate this relationship. Other demographic and situational characteristics have no impact.

Title: A Penny for Your Thoughts: Referral Reward Programs and Referral Likelihood
Author-Name: Gangseog Ryu
Author-Name: Lawrence Feick
Abstract: Because referral reward programs reward existing customers and build the customer base, firms use them to encourage customers to make recommendations to others. The authors report on four experiments in which they find that rewards increase referral likelihood. More specifically, they find that rewards are particularly effective in increasing referral to weak ties and for weaker brands. It is also important who receives the reward. Overall, for weak ties and weaker brands, giving a reward to the provider of the recommendation is important. For strong ties and stronger brands, providing at least some of the reward to the receiver of the referral seems to be more effective. The authors discuss the implications of the results for the design of reward programs.

Title: Market Knowledge Dimensions and Cross-Functional Collaboration: Examining the Different Routes to Product Innovation Performance
Author-Name: Luigi M. De Luca
Author-Name: Kwaku Atuahene-Gima
Abstract: There is consensus in the marketing literature that market knowledge and cross-functional collaboration are two fundamental resources for successful product innovation. However, few studies examine the dimensions or characteristics of market knowledge and how and why these resources influence product innovation performance. Drawing on contingency theory and the knowledge-based view of the firm, the authors argue that knowledge integration mechanisms may account for the effects of market knowledge dimensions (i.e., breadth, depth, tacitness, and specificity) and cross-functional collaboration on product innovation performance. They find that market knowledge specificity and cross-functional collaboration affect product innovation performance through knowledge integration mechanisms. In contrast, whereas the effect of market knowledge depth is partially mediated, market knowledge breadth has a direct, unmediated effect on product innovation performance. A test of an alternative moderating perspective shows that the effects of market knowledge depth and cross-functional collaboration on product innovation are negatively moderated by knowledge integration mechanisms. By showing the differential effects of market knowledge dimensions on product innovation performance, the authors provide a more refined understanding of the interplay among market knowledge, its integration, and the firm's performance in product innovation. The authors also conclude that by overlooking the role of knowledge integration mechanisms, previous research may have provided an overly optimistic view of the value of cross-functional collaboration in product innovation.

Title: A Theory of Intraperson Games
Author-Name: Min Ding
Abstract: A wide variety of theories across disciplines posit the existence of multiple inner preferences (selves, drives, or agents) within each person, whose conflicts must be resolved for a person to reach a decision. Despite their strong validity, these theories have not been incorporated into mainstream management science literature because of their qualitative nature. In this article, the author proposes a theory of intraperson games (TIG) to fill this important gap. Building on social welfare literature and standard (multiperson) game theory, the TIG defines two types of intraperson players, and each has a unique strategy set. The first type, the efficiency agent, attempts to maximize the total utility for the entire set of selves that reside in a person's mind. The second type, the equity agent, strives to balance the utilities that each of these selves receives. The TIG states that an individual decision is the outcome of the strategic interaction between the efficiency agent and the equity agent. Thus, standard consumer utility theory is a special case of the TIG if the role of the equity agent is ignored. A mathematical apparatus is provided for the TIG and is defined in a way similar to standard (multiperson) game theory. As a general quantitative theory, the TIG can be applied to many different contexts across disciplines, including, but not limited to, management science. The author demonstrates one such application for variety-seeking behavior and shows that stochastic variety seeking is a mixed-strategy equilibrium in an intraperson game. Key theoretical insights from this applied model are subsequently validated in an empirical study.

Title: Multichannel Shopping: Causes and Consequences
Author-Name: Rajkumar Venkatesan

Author-Name: Nalini Ravishanker
Abstract: The authors explore the drivers of multichannel shopping and the impact of multichannel shopping on customer profitability. Through a longitudinal analysis, the authors provide evidence that multichannel shopping is associated with higher customer profitability. Using the social exchange theory, they develop hypotheses regarding the impact of several customer–firm interaction characteristics on customer channel adoption duration. They propose a shared-frailty hazard model for testing the proposed hypotheses. They use the customer database of an apparel manufacturer that sells through three distinct channels for the empirical analysis and find that frequency-related interaction characteristics have the greatest influence on second-channel adoption duration. In contrast, proportion of returns, a purchase-related interaction characteristic, has the greatest influence on third-channel adoption duration. Variation across customers in purchase-related attributes has a greater impact on the duration to adopt the second channel than the duration to adopt the third channel. In contrast, variation across customers in the channel-related attributes has a greater impact on the third-channel adoption duration than on the second-channel adoption duration. The customer–firm interaction characteristics identified in this study and the proposed model framework allow for forward-looking allocation of multichannel marketing resources.

Title: The Influence of Corporate Messages on the Product Portfolio
Author-Name: Gabriel J. Biehal
Author-Name: Daniel A. Sheinin
Abstract: The authors examine factors that change the influence of corporate messages for forming judgments about products in the company's portfolio (i.e., transfer). Corporate messages transferred more than a product message onto other products in the company's portfolio. However, a product message had more influence than corporate messages for that product. Moreover, a corporate ability (quality) message transferred more to the portfolio than did a corporate social responsibility message. Finally, a competitive product message that preceded a company product message and was positioned similarly to a company product lessened corporate message diagnosticity, reducing transfer. However, this occurred only for a product in the same category but not for a product in a different one. The authors discuss the implications of these findings for corporate brand and product brand managers and suggest directions for further research.

Title: Neglected Outcomes of Customer Satisfaction
Author-Name: Xueming Luo
Author-Name: Christian Homburg
Abstract: Although there is significant evidence that customer satisfaction is an important driver of firm profitability, extant literature has largely neglected two intermediate outcomes of customer satisfaction, namely, a firm's advertising and promotion efficiency and its human capital performance. On the basis of longitudinal analyses of large-scale secondary data from multiple sources, the authors find that customer satisfaction boosts the efficiency of future advertising and promotion investments. This finding can be explained by the possibility that customer satisfaction generates free word-of-mouth advertising and saves subsequent marketing costs. In addition, customer satisfaction has a positive influence on a company's excellence in human capital (employee talent and manager superiority). This finding is highly novel, indicating that human resources managers should have a strong interest in customer satisfaction as well. Finally, the authors investigate the moderating influence of market concentration on both relationships. The uncovered results have important implications for marketers in their dialogue with financial executives and human resources managers.

Title: Learning and Exit Behavior of New Entrant Discount Airlines from City-Pair Markets
Author-Name: Ashutosh Dixit
Author-Name: Pradeep K. Chintagunta
Abstract: In this research, the authors investigate firms' exit behaviors. On the basis of extant literature in economics, strategy, and marketing, the authors identify market- and firm-specific factors that influence exit behavior. They account for firms' uncertainty about a market's true attractiveness after entry on the probability of exiting a market. To evaluate exit decisions, they propose a Bayesian belief-updating model of learning embedded in a logit model that incorporates market- and firm-specific factors. The estimated evolution of beliefs over time enables the authors to determine whether firms use market information to update their prior beliefs about market attractiveness. The authors empirically investigate the market exits of new entrant discount airlines from city-pair markets. The results suggest that a combination of several market and firm factors influences exit behavior. Airlines' prior beliefs about market attractiveness are not necessarily consistent with the market's intrinsic attractiveness, and firms learn about the true market attractiveness over time. The authors also provide model comparisons with extant approaches to studying market exit and find that the proposed approach provides a better fit and predictive ability.

Title: Marketing Communication Drivers of Adoption Timing of a New E-Service Among Existing Customers
Author-Name: Remco Prins
Author-Name: Peter C. Verhoef
Abstract: This study investigates the effects of direct marketing communications and mass marketing communications on the adoption timing of a new e-service among existing customers. The mass marketing communications pertain to both specific new service advertising and brand advertising from both the focal supplier and the competitors. Using a split-hazard approach, the authors determine the effects of the considered marketing communications on adoption timing, accounting for a significant part of the customer base that never adopts the new e-service. They analyze individual adoption behavior with a sample of 6000 customers of a Dutch telecommunications operator over 25 months. The empirical results show that service advertising shortens the time to adoption, even when it is initiated by competitors. Furthermore, an exploratory analysis of the interaction effects between relationship characteristics and marketing efforts suggests that certain mass marketing efforts have a greater effect on loyal customers.

Title: Profiting from Partial Allowance of Ticket Resale
Author-Name: Xianjun Geng
Author-Name: Ruhai Wu
Author-Name: Andrew B. Whinston
Abstract: For a seller that markets event tickets both in advance and on spot, a concern is that ticket resale may hurt its profitability. The conventional wisdom is for the seller to consider completely banning resale if possible. This article considers an alternative strategy in which resale is only partially restricted; specifically, resale is banned on spot but still allowed in advance. Using a two-period model in which buyers have discreet valuations, the authors show that it is possible for partial resale to outperform no resale (and also unrestricted resale at the other extreme) in terms of seller profitability when the following conditions hold: when the seller has limited capacity, when the number of high-valuation buyers is small enough, and when the number of early arrivers is not too large. An implication of this research is that when consumers conduct advance and spot resale in different channels, such as advance resale online and spot resale offline, the seller may be better off adopting different resale policies for different channels.

Title: The Entry Strategy of Retail Firms into Transition Economies
Author-Name: Katrijn Gielens
Author-Name: Marnik G. Dekimpe
Abstract: International entries into transition economies occur infrequently and involve considerable uncertainty. This raises the question whether managers, who have limited own experience, take their competitors' prior decisions into account when deciding on their own entry timing and size and whether there is value in doing so. To address these questions, the authors estimate a sequential hazard/Poisson regression model on the top 75 European grocery retailers' decisions to enter the Eastern European market. Indeed, firms pay close attention to prevailing practices in their industry. Prior entries first serve as legitimation but eventually become a deterring factor. Moreover, rather than just imitating the most popular or modal decision when determining the own entry timing and size, managers pay closer attention to the actions of their home competitors, react to prior entries of same-format competitors differently from those of different-format competitors, and adjust the observed industry practice for the specificity of their own resources. The authors show that managers are justified in taking the combined industry wisdom into account; deviations from prevailing industry practice, in terms of both timing and size, hurt the efficiency of their operations in subsequent years. Thus, attempts to develop own, distinct entry rules tend to be dysfunctional. Moreover, corrective actions are easier to implement along the size than along the time dimension; the detrimental effects of entering at a different time from the industry norm persist and even become amplified over time, whereas the negative impact of size deviations is temporary.

Title: Uphill or Downhill? Locating the Firm on a Profit Function
Author-Name: Murali K. Mantrala
Author-Name: Prasad A. Naik
Author-Name: Shrihari Sridhar
Author-Name: Esther Thorson
Abstract: When deciding about changes in levels of multiple marketing investments aimed at improving profits, managers need to know whether they are on the uphill side or the downhill side of the profit function with respect to each investment variable. Spending errors made by an uphill-located firm that believes that it is a downhill-located firm can have serious consequences. This article offers an econometric “diagnostic tool” to infer a company's current location on a multivariable profit function and to determine the changes in investments that will take the company to the neighborhood of the maximum profit. The authors apply the proposed approach to daily newspaper industry data and investigate the optimality of companies' allocation behaviors with respect to three marketing efforts: investments in quality, distribution, and advertising space sales effort. A novel feature of this problem setting is that it involves a “dual-revenue” market with possibly interrelated demands for subscriptions and advertising space. The authors derive normative rules for marketing investments in four dual-revenue market types. The empirical analysis finds that daily newspapers' dual revenues are positively interrelated and that a majority of these companies are located near the optimal level of spending for quality, a surprising finding considering that previous studies have characterized marketing managers as overspenders. Indeed, when these companies are suboptimal, they are much more likely to be underspending (i.e., they are located on the uphill side of the profit function) than overspending. In addition, the research furnishes estimates of sales elasticities with respect to quality, personal selling, and distribution investments, which are sparsely available in the extant literature.

Title: Using Childhood Memories to Gain Insight into Brand Meaning

Author-Name: George M. Zinkhan
Abstract: In this article, the authors introduce the concept that people's earliest and defining product memories can be used as a projective tool to help managers more fully understand consumers' relationships to their products. The authors use a study on three generations of automobile consumers to illustrate how these memories symbolize the consumer–brand relationship and how they can be used to gain insights into brand meaning. The findings indicate that people's earliest and defining experiences have an important influence on current and future preferences in predictable ways across the consumer life cycle. These memory experiences are symbolic to the consumer and represent a new lens for viewing brand meaning, which complements the toolbox of extant research methods. The authors provide details about this technique for managers who are searching for methods that recognize that consumers coproduce brand meanings.

Title: Monitoring the Dynamics of Brand Equity Using Store-Level Data

Abstract: Management of brand equity has come to be viewed as critical to a brand's optimal long-term performance. The authors evaluate the usefulness of brand equity estimates obtained from store-level data for monitoring the health of a brand. They use a random coefficients logit demand model calibrated on store-level scanner data to track brand equity estimates over time in two consumer packaged goods categories that experienced several new product introductions during the period of the empirical investigation. Using these tracked measures, the authors also study the impact of marketing actions, such as advertising, sales promotions, and product innovations, on brand equity. They find that the brand equity estimates effectively capture the high equity of strongly positioned popular brands and brands that command a significant price premium in niche markets. Using an example, the authors illustrate how these brand equity estimates can be used to monitor changes in brand equity, which measures such as market share may fail to capture. The substantive results indicate that advertising has a positive effect on brand equity in both the product categories, whereas the effect of sales promotions is not significant in either category. Furthermore, the results reveal that new product innovations have a positive impact on brand equity and can explain a significant proportion of its variation. Overall, the analysis shows that a brand manager can track brand equity using store-level data, gain insights into the drivers of the brand's equity, and manage these drivers to achieve brand equity targets.

Title: Marketing Performance Measurement Ability and Firm Performance
Author-Name: Don O'Sullivan
Author-Name: Andrew V. Abela
Abstract: Marketing practitioners are under increasing pressure to demonstrate their contribution to firm performance. It has been widely argued that an inability to account for marketing's contribution has undermined its standing within the firm. To respond to this pressure, marketers are investing in the development of performance measurement abilities, but to date, there have been no empirical studies of whether the ability to measure marketing performance has any actual effect on either firm performance or marketing's stature. In this study of senior marketing managers in high-technology firms, the authors examine the effect of ability to measure marketing performance on firm performance, using both primary data collected from senior marketers and secondary data on firm profitability and stock returns. They also explore the effect of ability to measure marketing on marketing's stature within the firm, which is operationalized as chief executive officer satisfaction with marketing. The empirical results indicate that the ability to measure marketing performance has a significant impact on firm performance, profitability, stock returns, and marketing's stature within the firm.

Title: Size and Share of Customer Wallet
Author-Name: Rex Yuxing Du

Author-Name: Carl F. Mela
Abstract: Many companies collect substantial information about their interactions with their customers. Yet information about their customers' transactions with competing firms is often sparse or nonexistent. As a result, firms are often compelled to manage customer relationships from an inward view of their customers. However, the empirical analysis in this study indicates that (1) the volume of customers' transactions within a firm has little correlation with the volume of their transactions with the firm's competitors and (2) a small percentage of customers account for a large portion of all the external transactions, suggesting the considerable potential to increase sales if these customers can be correctly identified and incentivized to switch. Thus, the authors argue for a more outward view in customer relationship management and develop a list augmentation–based approach to augment firms' internal records with insights into their customers' relationships with competing firms, including the size of each customer's wallet and the firm's share of it.

Title: Rethinking Customer Solutions: From Product Bundles to Relational Processes

Author-Name: Ajay K. Kohli
Author-Name: Sundar G. Bharadwaj
Abstract: This study draws on depth interviews with 49 managers in customer firms and 55 managers in supplier firms and on discussions with 21 managers in two focus groups to propose a new way of thinking about customer solutions. Extant literature and suppliers interviewed for this study view a solution as a customized and integrated combination of goods and services for meeting a customer's business needs. In contrast, customers view a solution as a set of customer–supplier relational processes comprising (1) customer requirements definition, (2) customization and integration of goods and/or services and (3) their deployment, and (4) postdeployment customer support, all of which are aimed at meeting customers' business needs. The relational process view can help suppliers deliver more effective solutions at profitable prices. In addition, field research suggests that the effectiveness of a solution depends not only on supplier variables but also on several customer variables. Supplier variables include contingent hierarchy, documentation emphasis, incentive externality, customer interactor stability, and process articulation. Customer variables include adaptiveness to supplier offerings and political and operational counseling that a customer provides to a supplier. Several of these variables underscore the importance of suppliers developing social capital with customers. The authors discuss implications for solution suppliers and identify areas for further research.

Title: Compound Relationships Between Firms
Author-Name: William T. RossJr.
Author-Name: Diana C. Robertson
Abstract: In this article, the authors introduce the idea of a compound relationship; that is, for many pairs of firms, the overall relationship between the two firms is composed of multiple simple relationships: supplier to customer, and vice versa; competitor to competitor; and partners. This multiplicity of relationships can lead to both opportunities and challenges for each of the two firms in the dyad. The authors define the nature of compound relationships and delineate why it is important for the firm to treat them as such rather than focusing only on the simple relationships. They distinguish compound relationships from social networks and simple dyadic relationships and relate the construct to exchange theory, “coopetition,” and the interorganizational relationship literature in marketing. They then use the political economy framework to develop a set of conceptual propositions that apply to many aspects of compound relationships. They end with some speculations regarding the appropriate management of compound relationships and propose opportunities for further research.

Title: The Thought Worlds of Marketing and Sales: Which Differences Make a Difference?
Author-Name: Christian Homburg
Author-Name: Ove Jensen
Abstract: The literature is divided on whether differences between the thought worlds of marketing and sales are deleterious or beneficial. This article empirically investigates various facets of thought-world differences and their effects on various outcomes. It confirms that, in general, differences hamper the cooperation between marketing and sales, which leads to a lower market performance of the business unit. However, some facets of thought-world differences enhance the market performance of the business unit through a direct effect that outweighs the negative effect mediated by the quality of cooperation between marketing and sales. Market performance is enhanced if one side plays the customers' advocate while the other plays the products' advocate. Market performance is also enhanced if one side plays the advocate of short-term considerations while the other plays the advocate of long-term considerations. In contrast, differences between marketing and sales in regard to product knowledge and interpersonal skills are deleterious to market performance. Thus, the kind of difference makes a difference.

Abstract: Avatars are lifelike characters created by technology. Research suggests that avatars can increase the persuasiveness of online sales channels. The authors investigate how the social cues inherent in avatars influence consumers' affect and shopping value. In Study 1, social cues induce perceptions of Web site socialness, leading to increased pleasure and arousal, both of which positively influence flow, hedonic and utilitarian value, and patronage intentions. Study 2 finds that social cue–induced arousal leads to increased pleasure only for consumers who are involved with the product category. Moreover, the influence of arousal on hedonic value is stronger for women, flow does not lead to pleasure for older consumers, and utilitarian value is less important for this group than for their younger counterparts. The findings suggest that there is a competitive advantage for online retailers that use social cues that provide consumers with enhanced perceptions of human connection and the formation of emotional bonds.

Title: Cents or Percent? The Effects of Promotion Framing on Price Expectations and Choice
Author-Name: Devon DelVecchio
Author-Name: H. Shanker Krishnan
Author-Name: Daniel C. Smith
Abstract: Previous research has shown that the monetary value of a promotion (promotion depth) affects choice during the promotion period. However, as promotion depth increases, consumers might lower their expectations of future price, which in turn may threaten future choice when prices return to normal levels. This research examines how promotion frame (percentage off versus cents off) moderates the effect of promotion depth on postpromotion price expectations and choice. The findings indicate that compared with cents-off promotions, high-depth percentage-off promotions lead to higher postpromotion price expectations. Likewise, postpromotion choice is higher when high-depth promotions are framed in percentage-off than cents-off terms. The authors examine the process underlying the effect of promotion frame on price expectations and find that frame affects (1) consumers' perceptions of the promoted price and (2) the weight they place on the promoted price.

Title: The Quest for Citations: Drivers of Article Impact
Author-Name: Stefan Stremersch
Author-Name: Isabel Verniers
Author-Name: Peter C. Verhoef
Abstract: Why do some articles become building blocks for future scholars, whereas others remain unnoticed? The authors aim to answer this question by contrasting, synthesizing, and simultaneously testing three scientometric perspectives—universalism, social constructivism, and presentation—on the influence of article and author characteristics on article citations. They study all articles published in a sample of five major journals in marketing from 1990 to 2002 that are central to the discipline. They count the number of citations each of these articles has received and regress this count on an extensive set of characteristics of the article (i.e., article quality, article domain, title length, the use of attention grabbers, and expositional clarity) and the author (i.e., author visibility and author personal promotion). They find that the number of citations an article in the marketing discipline receives depends more on “what is said” (quality and domain) and “who says it” (author visibility and personal promotion) than on “how it is said” (title length, the use of attention grabbers, and expositional clarity). The insights gleaned from this analysis contribute to the marketing literature and are relevant to scientific stakeholders, such as the management of scientific journals and individual academic scholars, as they strive to maximize citations. They are also relevant to marketing practitioners; they inform practitioners on characteristics of the academic journals in marketing and their relevance to decisions they face. Conversely, the insights also raise challenges regarding how to make journals accessible and relevant to marketing practitioners: (1) Authors visible to academics are not necessarily visible to practitioners; (2) the readability of an article may hurt academic credibility and impact, but it may be instrumental in influencing practitioners; and (3) it remains questionable whether articles that academics assess to be of high quality are also managerially relevant.

Title: Responsiveness to Customers and Competitors:The Role of Affective and Cognitive Organizational Systems
Author-Name: Christian Homburg
Author-Name: Marko Grozdanovic
Author-Name: Martin Klarmann
Abstract: Quick responses to environmental changes have become a vital success factor for today's companies. This study aims to identify the differential mechanisms that drive responsiveness to customers and responsiveness to competitors. In particular, the authors propose a conceptual framework that distinguishes between a cognitive and an affective organizational system as two important antecedents of organizational responsiveness. The results from a large-scale, cross-industry study show that the affective organizational system is more important in driving responsiveness to customers and that the cognitive organizational system is more important in driving responsiveness to competitors. Moreover, the relative importance of the cognitive system as a driver of responsiveness is greater in firms with a low market share and in markets with low entry barriers for new competitors.

Title: A Cultural Models Approach to Service Recovery
Author-Name: Torsten Ringberg
Author-Name: Gaby Odekerken-Schröder
Author-Name: Glenn L. Christensen
Abstract: Service recovery research remains conflicted in its understanding of consumers' recovery expectations and of why similar goods or service failures may lead to different recovery expectations. The authors argue that this conflict results from the assumption that consumer recovery expectations are monolithic and largely homogeneous, driven mainly by behavioral, relational, or contextual stimuli. Instead, recovery scenarios involving high-involvement (i.e., self-relevant) goods and service failures may activate closely held, identity-related cultural models that, though ultimately applied to regain balance (a foundational schema), differ according to their sociocultural heritage and create a range of unique consumer recovery preferences. The authors empirically identify three embodied cultural models—relational, oppositional, and utilitarian—that consumers apply to goods or service failures. Furthermore, the authors discuss implications for service recovery research and services marketing practice and introduce adaptive service recovery diagnostics that enable providers to identify and respond to consumers' varying recovery preferences.

Abstract: Managers have widely embraced and adopted the Net Promoter metric, which noted loyalty consultant Frederick Reichheld advocates as the single most reliable indicator of firm growth compared with other loyalty metrics, such as customer satisfaction and retention. Recently, however, there has been considerable debate about whether this metric is truly superior. This article (1) employs longitudinal data from 21 firms and 15,500-plus interviews from the Norwegian Customer Satisfaction Barometer to replicate the analyses used in Net Promoter research and (2) compares Reichheld and colleagues' findings with the American Customer Satisfaction Index. Using industries Reichheld cites as exemplars of Net Promoter, the research fails to replicate his assertions regarding the “clear superiority” of Net Promoter compared with other measures in those industries.

Title: Indirect Network Effects in New Product Growth
Author-Name: Stefan Stremersch

Author-Name: Jeroen L.G. Binken
Abstract: Indirect network effects are of prime interest to marketers because they affect the growth and takeoff of software availability for and hardware sales of a new product. Although prior work on indirect network effects in the economics and marketing literature is valuable, there are two main shortcomings. First, empirical analysis of indirect network effects is rare. Second, in contrast to the importance prior literature credits to the “chicken-and-egg” paradox in these markets, the temporal pattern (i.e., Which leads to which?) of indirect network effects remains unstudied. Based on empirical evidence of nine markets, this study shows that (1) indirect network effects, as commonly operationalized by prior literature, are weaker than expected from prior literature and (2) in most markets examined, hardware sales “lead” software availability, whereas the reverse almost never happens, contrary to existing beliefs. These findings are supported by multiple methods, such as takeoff and time-series analyses, and fit with the histories of the markets studied herein. For academia, the study identifies a need for new and more relevant conceptualizations of indirect network effects. For public policy, it questions the need for intervention in network markets. For management practice, it downplays the importance of the availability of a large library of software for hardware technology to be successful.

Title: Consumer Negative Voice and Firm-Idiosyncratic Stock Returns
Author-Name: Xueming Luo
Abstract: Prior research has largely focused on the positive side of customer experience, such as satisfaction. In contrast, this study investigates the negative side of customer experience and tests the harmful impact of consumer negative voice on firms' stock returns. Based on a longitudinal real-world data set that matches consumer negative voice (complaint records) in the airline industry with firm stock prices, this article finds that higher levels of current consumer negative voice harm firms' future idiosyncratic stock returns. In addition, this harmful impact is robust (albeit different across airline companies) after latent heterogeneity and traditional finance fundamentals are considered. These findings enable marketers and corporate financers to be more confident with customer equity theory and customer relationship management. In addition, armed with “hard” data (record-based, longitudinal), this research helps relieve criticisms against prior studies that are based on “soft” data (survey-based, cross-sectional). To financial analysts, this research suggests that, all else being equal, they should rate downward the stocks of firms that are shadowed by harmful consumer negative voice. In today's high-tech environment with blogs and online forums, the damage caused by negative voice may be nontrivial and should not be ignored. Overall, this research demonstrates to managers that investments in reducing consumer negative voice could indeed make financial sense in terms of promoting firm-idiosyncratic stock returns.

Title: Online Infomediaries and Price Discrimination: Evidence from the Automotive Retailing Sector
Author-Name: Siva Viswanathan
Author-Name: Jason Kuruzovich
Author-Name: Sanjay Gosain
Author-Name: Ritu Agarwal
Abstract: This article focuses on a novel mechanism for market segmentation and price discrimination based on consumers' use of online infomediaries. Using the automotive retailing context as the setting for the study, the authors address the following question: Can online infomediaries serve as a viable mechanism for market segmentation and price discrimination? They draw on a unique and extensive data set of consumers who report on the information they found when using online buying services (OBS) as part of their new vehicle purchase process. The analysis of the data set shows that consumers who obtain price information pay lower prices (for the same product), whereas consumers who obtain product information pay higher prices. Although this points to the existence of distinct consumer segments, this knowledge is of limited value without a viable mechanism that enables firms to identify and target these customer segments specifically. On the basis of consumer usage patterns of OBS, the authors uncover distinct OBS clusters and empirically demonstrate that the use of these different clusters is associated with predicted differences in consumer outcomes. They also show that the differential use of OBS clusters is systematically related to underlying consumer characteristics. They discuss the relevance of the findings for automobile dealers and manufacturers and for other industries in which online infomediaries have established a significant presence.

Title: Consumer File Sharing of Motion Pictures
Author-Name: Thorsten Hennig-Thurau
Author-Name: Victor Henning
Author-Name: Henrik Sattler
Abstract: Illegal consumer file sharing of motion pictures is considered a major threat to the movie industry. Whereas industry advocates and some scholars postulate a cannibalistic effect on commercial forms of movie consumption, other researchers deny this effect, though sound evidence is lacking on both sides. Drawing on extant research and utility theory, the authors present hypotheses on the consequences and determinants of consumer file sharing and test them with data from a controlled longitudinal panel study of German consumers. The data contain information on the consumers' intentions toward and actual behavior in relation to the consumption of 25 new motion pictures, allowing the authors to study more than 10,000 individual file-sharing opportunities. The authors test the effect of file sharing on commercial movie consumption using a series of ReLogit regression analyses and apply partial least squares structural equation modeling to identify the determinants of consumer file sharing. They find evidence of substantial cannibalization of theater visits, DVD rentals, and DVD purchases responsible for annual revenue losses of $300 million in Germany. Five categories of file-sharing behavior drive file sharing and have a significant impact on how consumers obtain and watch illegal movie copies.

Title: The Power of Stars: Do Star Actors Drive the Success of Movies?
Author-Name: Anita Elberse
Abstract: Is the involvement of stars critical to the success of motion pictures? Film studios, which regularly pay multimillion-dollar fees to stars, seem to be driven by that belief. This article sheds light on the returns on this investment using an event study that considers the impact of more than 1200 casting announcements on trading behavior in a simulated and real stock market setting. The author finds evidence that the involvement of stars affects movies' expected theatrical revenues and provides insight into the magnitude of this effect. For example, the estimates suggest that, on average, stars are worth approximately $3 million in theatrical revenues. In a cross-sectional analysis grounded in the literature on group dynamics, the author also examines the determinants of the magnitude of stars' impact on expected revenues. Among other things, the author shows that the stronger a cast already is, the greater is the impact of a newly recruited star with a track record of box office successes or with a strong artistic reputation. Finally, in an extension to the study, the author does not find that the involvement of stars in movies increases the valuation of film companies that release the movies, thus providing insufficient grounds to conclude that stars add more value than they capture. The author discusses implications for managers in the motion picture industry.

Title: Friendship Versus Business in Marketing Relationships
Author-Name: Kent Grayson
Abstract: Although combining friendship and business in the same relationship can be beneficial, it can also create conflict. A source of this conflict is incompatible relational expectations. True friends are expected to be unmotivated by benefits that can be used beyond the relationship (e.g., money, status), whereas business partners are, by definition, at least partly motivated by these more “instrumental” concerns. Using a role theory framework and data collected from a survey of 685 direct-selling agents, this article reports evidence that a conflict between friendship and instrumentality can undermine some of the business outcomes that friendship might otherwise foster. It also suggests that this conflict is more severe for friendships that become business relationships than for business relationships that become friendships. Study conclusions do not suggest that friendship is entirely “bad” for business and, instead, propose that friendship's influence can be both positive and negative.

Title: Optimal Design of Consumer Contests
Author-Name: De Liu

Author-Name: Andrew B. Whinston
Abstract: A consumer contest is a sales promotion technique that requires participants to apply certain skills as they compete for prizes or awards. This article is the first to employ a game-theoretical approach to investigate consumer contest design issues, including prize structure, segmentation, and handicapping. First, the authors find that both skill distribution and the number of contestants play an important role in determining the optimal prize structure in consumer contests. Specifically, if the skill distribution has the increasing hazard-rate property, it is optimal for a marketer to use a winner-take-all design. In large contests, for the winner-take-all approach to be optimal, it suffices to have the increasing hazard-rate property only at the high end of the skill distribution. Second, increasing contest size is beneficial to the marketer. Third, a less dispersive skill distribution leads to higher consumption by consumers at all skill levels and thus is beneficial to the marketer. The marketer may achieve less dispersive skill distributions by (1) segmenting or screening contestants according to their skill levels and (2) adopting a performance evaluation scheme that handicaps high-skilled contestants.

Title: Strategic Change Implementation and Performance Loss in the Front Lines

Abstract: Adopting a frontline employee (FLE) perspective, this study models a performance loss process during an organization's strategic change implementation. The process is activated by changes in unit management's emphases on cost containment and revenue-generating strategies and is governed by FLE detachment. The authors also examine an intervention mechanism for mitigating performance loss by including the influence of FLE participation in change decisions. The model is tested with data from five service organizations that employ 843 FLEs. The results indicate that (1) FLE detachment is effective in separating out the negative and positive effects of change, (2) FLE change perceptions are sensitive to the focus of strategic change (cost containment versus revenue enhancement strategies), and (3) FLE participation significantly enhances the positive effects of change and mitigates performance loss.

Title: A Comparative Longitudinal Analysis of Theoretical Perspectives of Interorganizational Relationship Performance
Author-Name: Robert W. Palmatier
Author-Name: Rajiv P. Dant
Author-Name: Dhruv Grewal
Abstract: Four theoretical perspectives currently dominate attempts to understand the drivers of successful interorganizational relationship performance: (1) commitment–trust, (2) dependence, (3) transaction cost economics, and (4) relational norms. Each perspective specifies a different set and distinct causal ordering of focal constructs as the most critical for understanding performance. Using four years of longitudinal data (N = 396), the authors compare the relative efficacy of these four perspectives for driving exchange performance and provide empirical insights into the causal ordering among key interorganizational constructs. The results demonstrate the parallel and equally important roles of commitment–trust and relationship-specific investments as immediate precursors to and key drivers of exchange performance. Building on the insights gleaned from tests of the four frameworks, the authors parsimoniously integrate these perspectives within a single model of interfirm relationship performance consistent with a resource-based view of an exchange. Managers may be able to increase performance by shifting resources from “relationship building” to specific investments targeted toward increasing the efficacy or effectiveness of the relationship itself to improve the relationship's ability to create value. Moderation analysis indicates that managers may find it productive to allocate more relationship marketing efforts and investments to exchanges in markets with higher levels of uncertainty.

Title: The Long-Term Impact of Loyalty Programs on Consumer Purchase Behavior and Loyalty
Author-Name: Yuping Liu
Abstract: Despite the prevalent use of loyalty programs, there is limited evidence on the long-term effects of such programs, and their effectiveness is not well established. The current research examines the long-term impact of a loyalty program on consumers' usage levels and their exclusive loyalty to the firm. Using longitudinal data from a convenience store franchise, the study shows that consumers who were heavy buyers at the beginning of a loyalty program were most likely to claim their qualified rewards, but the program did not prompt them to change their purchase behavior. In contrast, consumers whose initial patronage levels were low or moderate gradually purchased more and became more loyal to the firm. For light buyers, the loyalty program broadened their relationship with the firm into other business areas. The findings suggest a need to consider consumer idiosyncrasies when studying loyalty programs and illustrate consumers' cocreation of value in the marketing process.

Title: The Performance Implications of Designing Multiple Channels to Fit with Strategy and Environment
Author-Name: Sertan Kabadayi

Author-Name: Gloria P. Thomas
Abstract: Applying a configuration-theoretic approach to study multiple channels, the authors hypothesize that multiple-channel systems make their greatest contributions to firm performance when their structures are properly aligned with their firms' business-level strategies and with environmental conditions. A conceptual model incorporating these variables is supported in an empirical study of responses from executives at 291 electronic component manufacturers. The results confirm the existence of two theoretically ideal configurations. As hypothesized, channels in these ideal configurations make greater contributions to their firms' performance than do channels in alternative configurations. Moreover, a profile deviation analysis shows that a channel system's contribution to its firm's performance is greatest when that channel system's structural profile is closest to the profiles of top-contributing channel systems operating under similar strategic and environmental conditions. The authors present specific guidelines to help managers design distribution systems for different combinations of environment (e.g., with high and low dynamism, munificence, and diversity) and strategy (cost leadership and differentiation).

Title: Behavioral Consequences of Overbooking Service Capacity
Author-Name: Florian v. Wangenheim
Author-Name: Tomás Bayón
Abstract: As a consequence of implementing revenue management systems, many service firms (e.g., airlines, hotels, car rentals) systematically overbook capacity, thus striving to maximize the revenue at one particular point in time (i.e., one flight, one night, and one day). The academic literature has not addressed how customers behaviorally respond to overbooking experiences, such as downgrading, denied service, or upgrading. In this article, the authors use the econometric technique of conditional difference-in-differences analysis to study the effect of such incidences on customer usage patterns in an airline context. They find that customers who experience negative consequences of revenue management significantly reduce the amount of their transactions with the airline, whereas upgraded customers exhibit only weak positive responses. The effects of the negative events are stronger for high-value customer groups, whereas significant effects of positive events can be found only for a low-value customer group. The results suggest the need for a stronger focus on customer reactions to revenue management practices. On a more general level, the study contributes to a more interdisciplinary view of service management by demonstrating the need for a closer interaction between management functions (e.g., marketing and operations) in developing and managing concepts of companywide importance.

Title: Quasi-Darwinian Selection in Marketing Relationships
Author-Name: Nermin Eyuboglu
Author-Name: Andreas Buja
Abstract: This article introduces quasi-Darwinian selection as a new explanatory paradigm for marketing relationships. In this paradigm, established relationships are viewed as survivors of a selection process whose parameters are the conduct of the partners, dependencies between the partners, and external adversities in the markets. Selection has the effect of culling certain combinations of these parameters, such as attempts at unilateral control when the partner is not dependent. The effect of selection is to carve out patterns that appear as associations between parameters, for example, between unilateral control and dependence. Traditionally, such associations have been interpreted as causal effects of one parameter on the other. This study shows that quasi-Darwinian selection may sometimes be the more correct explanation of an observed association. The guiding principle can be summarized by the motto “selection creates association.” As an explanatory paradigm, selection may rival causation. The quasi-Darwinian framework applies to any type of marketing relationships in the business-to-business and business-to-consumer markets. Examples include all relationships in the supply chain, relationships between service providers and customers, and relationships between sales representatives and customers. The article develops the quasi-Darwinian framework in generality, but it emphasizes applications to business-to-business relationships. When associations between relationship parameters are carved out by selection, they can be interpreted as adaptations, and their descriptive meaning has normative implications; if partners in a relationship pattern their conduct according to these associations, on average, they may enhance the longevity of their relationship.

Author-Name: Mark B. Houston
Abstract: Movies and other media goods are traditionally distributed across distinct sequential channels (e.g., theaters, home video, video on demand). The optimality of the currently employed timing and order of channel openings has become a matter of contentious debate among both industry experts and marketing scholars. In this article, the authors present a model of revenue generation across four sequential distribution channels, combining choice-based conjoint data with other information. Drawing on stratified random samples for three major markets—namely, the United States, Japan, and Germany—and a total of 1770 consumers, the empirical results suggest that the studios that produce motion pictures can increase their revenues by up to 16.2% through sequential distribution chain timing and order changes when applying a common distribution model for all movies in a country and that revenue-optimizing structures differ strongly among countries. Under the conditions of the study, the authors find that the simultaneous release of movies in theaters and on rental home video generates maximum revenues for movie studios in the United States but has devastating effects on other players, such as theater chains. The authors discuss different scenarios and their implications for movie studios and other industry players, and barriers for the implementation of the revenue-maximizing distribution models are critically reflected.

Title: Managing the Future: CEO Attention and Innovation Outcomes

Abstract: The current literature presents a mixed view of top managers, often characterizing them as an impediment to innovation, irrelevant for innovation, or, at best, having an indirect effect on innovation. In contrast, the authors use an attentional perspective to argue that chief executive officers (CEOs) have a positive, direct, and long-term impact on how firms detect, develop, and deploy new technologies over time. The authors test their arguments on longitudinal data from the U.S. retail banking industry. They show that CEO attention is a critical driver of innovation even (1) when the target of attention is not innovation per se but simply future events and external events in a generic sense; (2) when the innovation outcomes occur far in the future (sometimes several years in the future); (3) when the innovation outcomes are conceptually, empirically, and temporally distinct; and (4) in an empirical context (i.e., banking) that is not traditionally viewed as “high tech” and, thus, innovation centric.

Title: Preventing Digital Music Piracy: The Carrot or the Stick?
Author-Name: Rajiv K. Sinha
Author-Name: Naomi Mandel
Abstract: The goal of this article is to ascertain the factors that govern consumers' willingness to pirate a digital product, such as a digital music track. The authors assess the tendency to pirate with both indirect measures (e.g., willingness to pay for the legal alternative) and direct measures (e.g., piracy preference). Whether measured indirectly or directly, the tendency to pirate depends, to different extents, on three key factors: positive incentives (e.g., improved functionality of the legal Web site), negative incentives (e.g., perceived risk of piracy), and consumer characteristics. Based on three studies, the results suggest that negative incentives are a strong deterrent for certain consumers but can actually increase piracy tendencies for others. Conversely, positive incentives, such as improved functionality, can significantly reduce the tendency to pirate among all the consumer segments studied. The authors conclude by discussing prescriptive recommendations for the recording industry.

Title: Stage-Gate Controls, Learning Failure, and Adverse Effect on Novel New Products
Author-Name: Rajesh Sethi
Author-Name: Zafar Iqbal
Abstract: This article argues that Stage-Gate controls have the potential of restricting learning in a new product development project and thus hurting the performance of novel new products. Specifically, the authors examine whether control on new product development exercised through rigorous gate review criteria increases project inflexibility, which in turn leads to increased failure to learn. They also focus on whether the effect of project inflexibility is worsened when there is turbulence in the firm's technological and market environment. Furthermore, the authors study whether failure to learn can have an adverse effect on new product performance when the product is novel. Finally, they examine whether a certain relaxation in gate evaluation (gate conditionality) that has been suggested recently mitigates the adverse effect of rigorously enforced controls. The results, which are based on a survey of 120 projects that used the Stage-Gate process for new product development, show that repeated application of strictly enforced and objective evaluation criteria for improved control makes projects more inflexible. Gate conditionality does not mitigate the adverse effect of gate review criteria. Project inflexibility leads to learning failure, and this effect is worsened when the technological environment of the firm is turbulent. In turn, learning failure adversely affects the market performance of novel new products.

Title: Marketing Initiatives, Expected Cash Flows, and Shareholders'Wealth
Author-Name: Ramesh K.S. Rao
Author-Name: Neeraj Bharadwaj
Abstract: It is widely accepted that marketing initiatives help firms acquire and retain customers. However, the link between the cash flows generated by customers' purchases and shareholders' wealth is not fully understood, and the literature is increasingly advocating the need for greater “marketing accountability.” In this interdisciplinary research, the authors adapt the theory of firm valuation from finance and show that a marketing action can affect the shareholders' wealth by (1) determining the firm's net present value (the “stock price effect”) and (2) potentially reducing the firm's cash needs (the “released working capital effect”). In demonstrating these results, the authors advance marketing theory by answering calls made in the literature to link marketing actions to the investors' cash flows, the firm's working capital needs, and the owners' wealth.The approach also shows that by reducing the firm's cash needs, marketing can increase the firm's productivity (operating efficiency). This imputes a critically important role for marketing. By increasing productivity, marketing can increase the firm's competitive posture and, thus, its long-term viability.

Title: Interaction Orientation and Firm Performance
Author-Name: Girish Ramani
Author-Name: V. Kumar
Abstract: Marketing managers are being required to demonstrate the profitability of their marketing actions down to the level of their individual customers and on an ongoing basis. At the same time, customers expect firms to increasingly customize their products and services to meet their demands. Firms still need to produce superior products, sell smarter, and understand the markets as a whole, but the ability of firms to orient themselves to interact successfully with their individual customers will differentiate them in the future. Advances in technology have resulted in increasing opportunities for interactions between firms and customers, between customers, and between firms. An interaction orientation reflects a firm's ability to interact with its individual customers and to take advantage of information obtained from them through successive interactions to achieve profitable customer relationships. First, the authors identify the components of interaction orientation: (1) customer concept, (2) interaction response capacity, (3) customer empowerment, and (4) customer value management. Second, they relate interaction orientation to both customer-level and aggregate-level performance measures. Third, they identify the antecedents of interaction orientation. Fourth, they examine the moderating effects of customer-initiated contacts and competitive intensity on the interaction orientation–performance linkage. The results are based on a survey of top marketing managers. The commonly held view that customer-based relational performance is related to customer-based profit performance is not supported. However, both customer-based relational performance and customer-based profit performance affect aggregate business-level performance positively. Interaction orientation is a phenomenon observed in both business-to-business and business-to-consumer firms. The extent of customer-initiated contacts moderates the interaction orientation–performance relationship.

Title: Expanding Business-to-Business Customer Relationships: Modeling the Customer's Upgrade Decision
Author-Name: Ruth N. Bolton
Author-Name: Katherine N. Lemon
Author-Name: Peter C. Verhoef
Abstract: This article develops a model of a business customer's decision to upgrade service contracts conditional on the decision to renew the contract. It proposes that the firm's upgrade decision is influenced by (1) decision-maker perceptions of the relationship with the supplier, (2) contract-level experiences, and (3) interactions between firm- and contract-level variables. The authors model the firm's decision as a binary logit model with random parameters for the contract-level variables and fixed parameters for the firm-level variables. They estimate the model with data describing more than 2000 service contracts and find that decision-maker satisfaction, service quality, and price have a significant effect on the decision to upgrade; price and satisfaction also moderate the effect of service quality on the decision. Simulations indicate that modest improvements in service quality for a focal contract can have a relatively large, positive effect on the likelihood that the firm will upgrade. The results suggest that suppliers need to manage their firm relationships at both the individual contract level and the overall firm level. In addition, the results suggest specific windows of opportunity for suppliers when firms may be more likely to upgrade to higher-level service contracts.

Title: Chief Marketing Officers: A Study of Their Presence in Firms'Top Management Teams
Author-Name: Pravin Nath
Author-Name: Vijay Mahajan
Abstract: Not all firms choose to have a chief marketing officer (CMO) in their top management teams (TMTs). This research investigates factors associated with this choice and whether CMO presence/absence in the face of these factors affects firm performance. Findings based on a multi-industry sample of 167 firms over a five-year period (2000–2004) show that innovation, differentiation, branding strategy, diversification, TMT functional experience in marketing, and the chief executive officer being an outsider are associated with the likelihood of CMO presence in the TMT. Furthermore, the authors find that CMO presence in the TMT has neither a positive nor a negative impact on firm performance. The authors discuss the implications of these findings for theory and practice.

Title: Understanding Service Retention Within and Across Cohorts Using Limited Information
Author-Name: David A. Schweidel
Author-Name: Peter S. Fader
Author-Name: Eric T. Bradlow
Abstract: Service churn and retention rates remain central as constructs in marketing activities, such as valuation of service subscribers and resource allocation. Although extant approaches have been proposed to relate service churn to external factors, such as reported satisfaction, marketing-mix activities, and so on, managers often face situations in which the only information available is the duration for which subscribers have had service. In such cases, can they forecast service churn and understand the contributing factors, which may allow for subsequent intervention? The authors propose a framework to examine factors that may underlie service retention in a contractual setting. Specifically, they use a model of retention that accounts for (1) duration dependence, (2) promotional effects, (3) subscriber heterogeneity, (4) cross-cohort effects, and (5) calendar-time effects (e.g., seasonality).Then, they apply the framework to subscription databases of seven services offered by a telecommunications provider, mirroring the format commonly used to forecast future service churn (and to make managerial decisions). Across all seven services, the inclusion of promotional effects always improves the forecast accuracy of retention behavior, whereas including cross-cohort effects does not significantly improve it. In five of the services, customer heterogeneity, calendar-time effects, and duration dependence also contribute to improved forecasts. The authors use these results to understand how the expected value of a subscription differs across model specifications. They find considerable variation across model specifications, indicating that model misspecification can affect resource allocation decisions and other marketing efforts that are important to a firm.

Title: When Old Is Gold:The Role of Business Longevity in Risky Situations
Author-Name: Preyas S. Desai

Author-Name: B.P.S. Murthi
Abstract: The authors examine how a service firm's longevity may affect consumers' perceptions of risk in conducting business with the firm. Depending on the nature of information available to consumers, a firm's longevity can act in one of two ways to reduce the consumers' perceived risk: (1) Longevity may act as an extrinsic cue of the firm's quality, or (2) availability of a longer track record of an older firm may allow consumers to make more precise prediction of the firm's future quality. The authors develop a set of hypotheses that relate these two effects to consumers' preferences and test them in a series of four experiments. They find that a firm's age can act as an extrinsic cue of the firm's quality. When consumers also have information about firms' intrinsic attributes, the effect of a firm's age as an extrinsic cue is diminished under conditions of high involvement. The experiments also show that consumers prefer firms with longer track records, especially when firms' performance/quality levels are subject to more variability. However, when consumers have high aspiration levels, they prefer firms with shorter track records, even though the consumers perceive these firms as riskier choices.

Title: Customer Equity: An Integral Part of Financial Reporting
Author-Name: Thorsten Wiesel

Abstract: Recent initiatives demand information that supplements and complements a firm's financial statements to bridge the gap between financial statement capabilities and financial reporting objectives. Such information assists investors' decision making by explaining the main trends and factors that underlie the development, performance, and position of the firm's business. Firms that aim to increase the value of their customer base should report forward-looking customer metrics because such reports align customer management with corporate goals and investors' perspectives. The authors propose a means to report customer equity that enables investors—the “consumers” of financial reports—to monitor firms' performance with respect to their customer assets. Furthermore, they develop a specific model for Netflix and apply it to quarterly data from September 2001 to September 2006.

Title: Innovation's Effect on Firm Value and Risk: Insights from Consumer Packaged Goods
Author-Name: Alina B. Sorescu
Author-Name: Jelena Spanjol
Abstract: What is the relationship between innovation and firm value? Does the type of innovation make a difference? To answer these questions, the authors examine how breakthrough and incremental innovations affect three different facets of firm performance: normal profits, economic rents, and total firm risk.They argue that each of these metrics is of independent interest to shareholders and managers and that examining one without the others results in an incomplete picture of the true financial value of innovation. Using data on more than 20,000 new products from consumer packaged goods industries, the authors find that breakthrough innovation is associated with increases in both normal profits and economic rents and that, on average, each breakthrough innovation in the sample is associated with an increase in firm value of $4.2 million. Breakthrough innovation is also associated with increases in the risk of the innovating firm, but this higher risk is offset by above-normal stock returns. In contrast, incremental innovation is associated with increases in normal profits only and has no impact on economic rents or firm risk.

Title: Configurations of Marketing and Sales: A Taxonomy

Abstract: Little is known about the interface between separate marketing units and sales units. This article develops a multidimensional model of the marketing and sales interface. The model integrates a broad range of conceptual domains, including information sharing, structural linkages, power, orientations, and knowledge of marketing and sales. The authors empirically explore the conceptual model through a cross-industry study of 337 European Union–based companies. They identify five empirical archetypes of the marketing and sales interface. The taxonomy shows that the role and characteristics of marketing and sales vary a great deal. This finding challenges existing stereotypes about marketing and sales. Finally, the article explores organizational outcomes of the five configurations. The findings suggest that the most successful configurations are characterized by strong structural linkages between marketing and sales and a high extent of market knowledge in marketing.

Title: Demand-Based Pricing Versus Past-Price Dependence: A Cost–Benefit Analysis
Author-Name: Shuba Srinivasan
Author-Name: Koen Pauwels
Author-Name: Vincent Nijs
Abstract: The authors develop a conceptual framework of the factors that motivate a retailer's decision to rely on demand conditions and past prices in setting current and future prices. Specifically, they examine the circumstances under which retailers choose demand-based pricing versus past-price dependence for different brands and categories. Given scarce resources and costs of price adjustments, demand-based pricing is more likely when the customer-driven and firm-driven costs of adjusting pricing patterns are low or when the benefits of such adjustments are high. First, the customer-driven benefits of demand-based pricing are expected to be greater in categories with higher penetration and for brands with higher market share and higher demand sensitivity to price. Second, the firm-driven benefits are greater for categories with higher private-label share. Finally, the customer-driven costs are greater for expensive categories, whereas the firm-driven costs are greater for categories with many stockkeeping units. The empirical findings support the conceptual framework, implying that customer-driven and firm-driven benefits are the main stimulants in the retailer's choice of demand-based pricing. In contrast, customer-driven and firm-driven costs significantly hinder retailer implementation of demand-based pricing. These insights enable retailers to identify problem areas and opportunities to improve the allocation of scarce pricing resources. The results also contribute to the ongoing debate in economics and marketing on the rationality of observed past-price dependence. Whereas previous research points to the negative impact on gross margins of this practice, the authors find that retailers weigh the costs and benefits of demand-based pricing rather than adhere to past-pricing patterns.

Title: Do Frontline Mechanisms Matter? Impact of Quality and Productivity Orientations on Unit Revenue, Efficiency, and Customer Satisfaction
Author-Name: Detelina Marinova
Author-Name: Jun Ye
Author-Name: Jagdip Singh
Abstract: This study identifies a frontline mechanism comprising autonomy, cohesion, and feedback that helps explain when and why the simultaneous pursuit of quality and productivity orientations has positive or negative effects on unit revenue, efficiency, and customer satisfaction. An empirical test of the proposed framework using data from 423 employees in 30 strategic business units and longitudinal unit-level performance data indicates that frontline autonomy mediates the positive impact of productivity and quality orientations on unit revenue and customer satisfaction and their negative impact on unit efficiency. Feedback amplifies the influence of frontline autonomy by simultaneously enhancing its positive effect on satisfaction and its negative effect on efficiency. In contrast, unit cohesion strengthens the positive effect of frontline autonomy on revenue and customer satisfaction without augmenting its negative effect on unit efficiency. The results urge managers to shift their focus toward unit-level mechanisms to find clues for managing strategic dilemmas that stem from multiple goal pursuit in face-to-face service settings.

Title: Convergent Products: What Functionalities Add More Value to the Base?
Author-Name: Tripat Gill
Abstract: Convergence in the electronics sector has enabled the addition of disparate new functionalities to existing base products (e.g., adding mobile television to a cell phone or Internet access to a personal digital assistant). This research investigates the role of two factors—(1) the goal congruence between the added functionality and the base and (2) the nature of the base product (utilitarian versus hedonic)—on the evaluation of such convergent products (CPs). The author proposes that the evaluation of CPs with a utilitarian versus hedonic base is subject to an asymmetric additivity effect. Specifically, whereas CPs with a utilitarian base gain more from adding an incongruent, hedonic functionality than a congruent, utilitarian one, CPs with a hedonic base gain less from an incongruent, utilitarian addition than a congruent, hedonic one. This asymmetry is because hedonic additions enhance the pleasure of using a utilitarian base, whereas utilitarian additions may dilute the existing hedonic image of a hedonic base.The moderating role of prior ownership of the base of a CP is also explored. The author proposes that the effects of goal congruence are stronger for owners than for nonowners, but only for CPs with a hedonic base, not for those with a utilitarian base. The author verifies the proposed effects in an experimental study conducted with a large-scale, representative sample of the target market population. Further research on other (moderating) factors affecting the evaluation of CPs is also suggested.

Title: Supply Chain Contagion
Author-Name: Richard G. McFarland
Author-Name: James M. Bloodgood
Author-Name: Janice M. Payan
Abstract: Drawing on research from the interfirm relationship, marketing channels, operations management, and network theory literature and on the basis of qualitative depth interviews, the authors identify a new phenomenon they call “supply chain contagion.” Supply chain contagion is the propagation of interfirm behaviors from one dyadic relationship to an adjacent dyadic relationship within the supply chain. Contagion can occur inadvertently and with or without the knowledge of the affected parties. Using institutional theory, the authors develop a conceptual model that predicts the conditions under which contagion is likely to occur. Although contagion may take the form of any number of interfirm behaviors, operationally, the authors focus on whether the downstream influence strategies that manufacturers use with their dealers are imitated by these same dealers with end customers. They conduct conclusive research using a sample of 151 vertically linked manufacturer–dealer–customer supply chain triads and explain a large variance (R2 = .30) in the use of downstream influence strategies in terms of supply chain contagion. Given extensive prior empirical support for alternative antecedents to influence strategy usage, the explanatory power of supply chain contagion is impressive and suggests that how intermediaries treat end customers is explained, to a large degree, as the intermediaries simply imitating how their suppliers treated them. In addition to the identification of a new theoretical concept, the study provides empirical support for the effects of both macro- and microinstitutional factors on interfirm behavior. Specific factors that are positively related to the level of manifest contagion are environmental uncertainty and the perceived similarity and frequency of contact between boundary personnel; dependence asymmetry has a negative effect on manifest contagion. Managers and boundary-spanning personnel who are aware of supply chain contagion effects should be better able to influence strategically the behavior of channel partners and may be better inoculated against their own unintended imitation of other organizations within their supply chain.

Title: Trust at Different Organizational Levels

Author-Name: Ning Li
Abstract: The authors explore the effects of trust at three distinct organizational levels in a marketing collaboration: interorganizational trust between collaborating firms, each firm's agency trust in its own representatives assigned to a collaborative entity (coentity), and intraentity trust among the representatives assigned to the coentity. Dyadic survey and longitudinal objective performance data from 114 international joint ventures indicate that trust at each level has unique effects but similarly influences the collaborating firms' resource investments or the coentity's use of those resources. Interorganizational and agency trust motivate resource investments in the coentity, particularly in the context of a differentiation strategy, whereas intraentity trust promotes coordination within the coentity, and interorganizational trust and a differentiation strategy magnify that effect. Intraentity trust can also undermine coentity responsiveness to environmental change, especially when joined by interorganizational trust between collaborating firms and formalized decision making within the coentity. These findings demonstrate that managing and building trust at multiple levels is critical to the success of interorganizational marketing collaborations.

Title: Determinants of Perceived Web Site Interactivity
Author-Name: Ji Hee Song
Author-Name: George M. Zinkhan
Abstract: Interactivity is a key feature of Web sites. This article identifies the determinants that enhance user perceptions of interactivity in a communication scenario in which consumers send instant messages to an e-store. Two conceptualizations of interactivity—telepresence theory and interactivity theory—predict that different antecedents (e.g., the number of clicks, response time, message type) are important. The results of Experiment 1 indicate that message type (i.e., how personal a particular message is) is the strongest predictor of interactivity perceptions. Furthermore, the findings suggest that the effects of message type on perceived interactivity and Web site effectiveness are greater when consumers are complaining than when they are inquiring about services. The results of Experiment 2 show that as the level of message personalization increases, interactivity perceptions and site effectiveness are enhanced (linear relationship). The authors discuss the implications of the findings for theory and practice and provide directions for measuring and manipulating interactivity in further research.

Title: Drivers of Success for Market Entry into China and India

Abstract: China and India are the fastest-growing major markets in the world and the most popular markets for foreign entrants. However, no study has examined the success or failure of these entries. Using a new definition of success and a uniquely compiled archival database, the authors analyze whether and why firms that entered China and India succeeded or failed. The most important findings are rather counterintuitive: Smaller firms are more successful than larger firms, and firms entering more open emerging markets have less success. Other findings are that success is greater with earlier entry, greater control of entry mode, and shorter cultural and economic distances between the home and the host countries. Importantly, with or without control for these drivers, firms have less success in India than in China. The authors discuss the reasons for and implications of these findings.

Abstract: Marketers cultivate brand relatedness in their brand portfolios to increase marketing efficiency through positive spillover of brand equity. However, creating linkages between brands may also make them vulnerable to negative spillover. This research investigates the structure of relatedness in a brand portfolio to understand the nature of spillover effects. The results of two experiments show that the magnitude of spillover between brands is a function of not only the strength of brand associations but also their directionality. The results also show that the directional strength of association is influenced by the number and salience of associations linked to each brand. The authors draw implications for a theoretical understanding of spillover effects in marketing, as well as for the management of brand portfolios.

Title: Segmented Switchers and Retailer Pricing Strategies
Author-Name: Cenk Koçaş, 
Author-Name: Jonathan D. Bohlmann
Abstract: Empirical studies reveal a surprisingly wide variety of pricing strategies among retailers, even among Internet sellers of undifferentiated homogeneous goods, such as books and music CDs. Several empirical findings remain puzzling; for example, within the same market, some small retailers decide to discount deeply, whereas others forgo the price-sensitive switchers and price high. The authors present theoretical and empirical analyses that address these varied pricing strategies. A model of three asymmetric firms shows that under multiple switcher segments, in which different switchers compare prices at different retailers, firm-specific loyalty is not sufficient to explain the variety of pricing strategies. The authors demonstrate that a retailer's strategy to discount deeply or frequently is driven by the ratio of the size of switcher segments for which the retailer competes to its loyal segment size. The relative switcher-to-loyal ratios among retailers explain situations in which a small retailer finds it optimal to price high, despite having few loyals, or to discount and go for the switchers. The results of two empirical studies confirm the model's predictions for varied pricing strategies in the context of Internet booksellers. The analyses also present several implications. A small retailer can sometimes benefit from strategically limiting its access to switchers to soften price competition. A midsized retailer can benefit from targeting its switcher acquisition activities toward its larger rival, given the shallower discounts involved. When most switchers widely compare prices, a large retailer should offer few shallow discounts because other firms will more aggressively discount. The importance of switcher segmentation suggests that managers should carefully measure switching behavior in devising pricing strategies.

Title: Moving from Free to Fee: How Online Firms Market to Change Their Business Model Successfully
Author-Name: Koen Pauwels, 
Author-Name: Allen Weiss
Abstract: Moving from free to “free and fee” for any product or service represents a challenge to managers, especially when consumers have plenty of free alternatives. For one online content provider, this article examines (1) the sources of long-term revenue loss (through attracting fewer free subscribers) and (2) how the firm's marketing actions affect its revenue gains (through attracting paid subscribers). The authors quantify revenue loss from several sources, including the direct effects of charging for part of the online content and the reduced effectiveness of search-engine referrals and e-mails. The analysis suggests several managerial implications. Managers should focus their price promotions on stimulating new monthly subscriptions, rather than the current promotional focus on stimulating new yearly contracts. In contrast, e-mail and search-engine referrals appear to be effective at generating yearly subscriptions. Meanwhile, free-to-fee conversion e-mail blasts are a double-edged sword; they increase subscription revenue at the expense of advertising revenue. Finally, further analysis shows that the move was preceded by the buildup of momentum in new free subscriptions, which appears to be beneficial for the move's success. The decomposition and comparison of the sources of revenue loss versus gains reveals several trade-offs facing companies moving from free to free and fee.

Title: The Curse of Competitiveness: How Advice from Experienced Colleagues and Training Can Hurt Marketing Profitability
Author-Name: Ajay Kalra, 
Author-Name: David A. Soberman
Abstract: The literature suggests that mangers are overly competitive and overemphasize competitors' payoffs in making decisions. The authors demonstrate how two seemingly innocuous but common decision inputs that mid- and entry-level managers use–(1) advice from colleagues and (2) training–could propagate this bias. The authors conduct an experiment in which one generation of participants plays a noncooperative game and then passes on advice on how to play the same game to the second generation. The authors find that the second generation is more likely to accept decisions that negatively impact the competitor's profits, even when those decisions result in lower payoffs. The results suggest that the advice of the first generation causes the second generation to be more sensitive to relative performance. In a second experiment, the authors show that training films that create negative feelings toward competitors can have adverse effects on managers' decisions. The training increases the willingness of managers to sacrifice own profits to reduce competitor profitability. These findings have important implications for managers in competitive markets. This research suggests that standard training materials that emphasize beating competitors should be carefully assessed for their unintentional but potentially damaging effects. In particular, training designed to evoke affective responses toward competitors must be used judiciously. Firms that give junior managers more autonomy and responsibility should also be cognizant that the advice these managers get and the information they share may propagate a competitive bias. To mitigate this problem, an option is to devote resources to better understand the content and nature of advice that managers share with one another.

The primary insights this research provides are as follows: (1) Products that meet or exceed customers' utilitarian needs and fulfill prevention goals enhance customer satisfaction (e.g., a car with antilock brakes and vehicle stability assist), and (2) products that meet or exceed customers' hedonic wants and fulfill promotion goals enhance customer delight (e.g., a car with panoramic sunroof and six-speaker audio system). Furthermore, the research finds that the primary antecedent feelings of satisfaction are the prevention emotions of confidence and security provided by utilitarian benefits, whereas the primary antecedent feelings of delight are the promotion emotions of cheerfulness and excitement provided by hedonic benefits. Finally, the results show that delighting customers improves customer loyalty, as measured by word of mouth and repurchase intentions, more than merely satisfying them. The authors discuss the theoretical contribution and strategic insights the research provides for product designers and marketers.

Title: Holistic Package Design and Consumer Brand Impressions
Author-Name: Ulrich R. Orth, 
Author-Name: Keven Malkewitz
Abstract: This article develops empirically based guidelines to assist managers in selecting or modifying package designs for achieving desired consumer responses. Seven studies identify the key types of package designs, including the factors that differentiate those package designs, and determine how these holistic designs are related to consumer brand impressions. The selection of package designs can be simplified with the use of five holistic types: massive, contrasting, natural, delicate, and nondescript designs. Sincere brands should have natural package designs, exciting brands should have contrasting designs, competent brands should have delicate designs, sophisticated brands should have natural or delicate designs, and rugged brands should have contrasting or massive designs. The authors discuss the potential trade-offs among the impressions created by holistic design types and illustrate their findings with numerous real packages.

Title: Instant Customer Base Analysis: Managerial Heuristics Often “Get It Right”
Author-Name: Markus Wübben, 
Author-Name: Florian v. Wangenheim
Abstract: Recently, academics have shown interest and enthusiasm in the development and implementation of stochastic customer base analysis models, such as the Pareto/NBD model and the BG/NBD model. Using the information these models provide, customer managers should be able to (1) distinguish active customers from inactive customers, (2) generate transaction forecasts for individual customers and determine future best customers, and (3) predict the purchase volume of the entire customer base. However, there is also a growing frustration among academics insofar as these models have not found their way into wide managerial application. To present arguments in favor of or against the use of these models in practice, the authors compare the quality of these models when applied to managerial decision making with the simple heuristics that firms typically use. The authors find that the simple heuristics perform at least as well as the stochastic models with regard to all managerially relevant areas, except for predictions regarding future purchases at the overall customer base level. The authors conclude that in their current state, stochastic customer base analysis models should be implemented in managerial practice with much care. Furthermore, they identify areas for improvement to make these models managerially more useful.

Title: Competitive Response to Radical Product Innovations

Author-Name: Rajesh Chandy
Abstract: Radical product innovations are often agents of creative destruction. They threaten to destroy existing market positions, and yet they often yield vast new market opportunities. This article examines how competitors respond to the introduction of radical product innovations. The authors argue that competitive response to radical product innovations is inherently different from response to the incremental innovations that are typically studied in existing research. They introduce the dual concepts of market expansion and entry thresholds to develop new hypotheses about competitive response. Some of these hypotheses contradict prior literature. Using objective data from the U.S. pharmaceutical industry between 1997 and 2001, they estimate a shared-frailty hazard model to explain the competitive response to radical product innovations. The results show that the likelihood of competitive response is substantially higher when the introducing firm is large or market dependent. Moreover, the response is highest when the innovation is introduced in a small market by a large firm. These results contradict those from much prior research on competitive response to product innovation.

Title: The Relative Impact of Marketing, Research-and-Development, and Operations Capabilities on Firm Performance
Author-Name: Alexander Krasnikov, 
Author-Name: Satish Jayachandran
Abstract: The impact of the marketing function on firm performance has been the focus of much recent research in marketing. Thus, the effect of marketing capability on firm performance, compared with that of other capabilities, such as research and development and operations, is an issue of importance to managers. To examine this issue and generate empirical generalizations, the authors conduct a meta-analysis of the firm capability–performance relationship using a mixed-effects model. The results show that, in general, marketing capability has a stronger impact on firm performance than research-and-development and operations capabilities. The results provide guidelines for managers and generate directions for further research.

Title: The Long-Term Stock Market Valuation of Customer Satisfaction
Author-Name: Lerzan Aksoy,

Author-Name: Atakan Yalçın
Abstract: Firm valuation has been an important domain of interest for finance. However, most financial models do not include customer-related metrics in this process. Studies in marketing have found that one particular customer metric, customer satisfaction, improves the ability to predict future cash flows, long-term financial measures, stock performance, and shareholder value. However, most of these studies predominantly employ models that are not directly used in finance practice. This article extends existing literature by examining the impact of customer satisfaction on firm valuation by employing multiples and risk-adjusted abnormal return models borrowed directly from the practice of finance. Data include 3600 firm-quarter observations from the American Customer Satisfaction Index, COMPUSTAT, and Center for Research in Securities Prices databases from 1996 to 2006. The results indicate that a portfolio of stocks consisting of firms with high levels and positive changes in customer satisfaction will outperform the other three possible portfolio combinations (low levels and negative changes, low levels and positive changes, and high levels and negative changes in customer satisfaction) along with Standard & Poor's 500. Initially, the stock market undervalues positive satisfaction information, but the market adjusts in the long run.

Title: When Does Guanxi Matter? Issues of Capitalization and Its Dark Sides
Author-Name: Flora F. Gu, 
Author-Name: Kineta Hung, 
Author-Name: David K. Tse
Abstract: Guanxi refers to the durable social connections and networks a firm uses to exchange favors for organizational purposes. This study examines how and when guanxi operates as a governance mechanism that influences firm marketing competence and performance in the transitional economy of China. Drawing on social capital theory, the authors propose an integrative framework that unbundles the benefits and risks of guanxi and delineates the organizational processes to internalize guanxi as a corporate core competence. The authors surveyed senior executives in 282 firms in China's consumer products industries. The findings confirm guanxi's direct effects on market performance and its indirect effects mediated through channel capability and responsive capability. The authors also confirm that technological turbulence and competition intensity can be effective structure-loosening forces, thus reducing the governance effects of guanxi. The findings suggest that firms can improve market access and growth through guanxi networks, but managers need to capitalize on them from the personal to the corporate level. In addition, managers should be aware of guanxi's dark sides, which include reciprocal obligations and collective blindness. This study shows that personal networks are popular universally, but in China, they have unique, distinct ways of operation.

Title: Critical Incidents and the Impact of Satisfaction on Customer Share
Author-Name: Jenny van Doorn, 
Author-Name: Peter C. Verhoef
Abstract: In business markets, the long-term nature of relationships may prompt parties to conduct “business as usual,” but negative critical incidents (CIs) can cause a destabilization of these long-term relationships. The authors develop a comprehensive dynamic model of customer loyalty to account for the impact of negative CIs on both the nature and the magnitude of the relationships between satisfaction and customer share. The results indicate that CIs trigger a stronger updating of the customer relationship, which moves customers from a business-as-usual mind-set to a reconsideration of the relationship. Furthermore, nonlinearities in the relationships are much more pronounced in the presence of CIs. Depending on the relationship quality, CIs have different consequences for customer relationships, and if relationship quality is high, a negative CI can even have a positive impact on customer share.

Title: Satisfaction, Complaint, and the Stock Value Gap
Author-Name: Xueming Luo, 
Author-Name: Christian Homburg
Abstract: This article introduces the concept of a stock value gap—the shortfall of a firm's actual market value from its optimal market value, as measured by a best-performing benchmark. Using a large-scale, real-world database, the authors test the effects of both customer satisfaction and customer complaint on the stock value gap of firms. The results show that customer complaint has a stronger effect than customer satisfaction on the value gap. Furthermore, there is some support for the moderating influences of working capital and firm specialization. The results provide actionable guidelines to build a more complete customer equity dashboard and encourage managers to provide a supportive organizational environment to create shareholder value.

Abstract: Using two samples of salespeople, the authors investigate how a combination of general mental ability (GMA) and specific skills and capabilities (social competence and thinking styles) enables salespeople to reach their sales goals. The study finds evidence for an interaction between GMA and social competence. When combined with high social competence, high GMA leads to the highest sales performance; when combined with low social competence, high GMA leads to the lowest sales performance. In addition, the authors find interaction effects between GMA and a judicial thinking style. Salespeople with a high GMA have the most potential for attaining high levels of sales performance when combined with specific skills; when salespeople with a high GMA lack these skills, they may become the firm's worst performers.

Title: The Fruits of Legitimacy:Why Some New Ventures Gain More from Innovation Than Others
Author-Name: Raghunath Singh Rao, 
Author-Name: Rajesh K. Chandy, 
Author-Name: Jaideep C. Prabhu
Abstract: This article examines rewards to product introduction by new ventures. The authors argue that the new ventures that gain the most from innovation are those that adopt strategies that give them legitimacy in the eyes of stakeholders. New ventures can gain legitimacy by creating associations with established entities; such associations can be internal or external to the firm. The authors test these ideas by examining the stock market gains of all products introduced between 1982 and 2002 by all public firms in the U.S. biotechnology industry. The results show that new ventures that acquire legitimacy externally by forming alliances with established firms gain more from their new products than new ventures that do not form such alliances. Among new ventures that do not form alliances, those that acquire legitimacy internally by creating a history of product launches or by hiring reputed executives or scientists gain more from their new products than those that do not. In relative terms, it pays more to have introduced a new drug before than to have a reputed executive on the firm's board; in turn, adding a reputed executive pays more than adding a reputed scientist to the firm's board. Finally, although new ventures can gain from either external or internal legitimacy, pursuit of external legitimacy by firms that already have internal legitimacy leads to lower rewards to innovation.

Title: Interfirm Relational Drivers of Customer Value
Author-Name: Robert W. Palmatier
Abstract: This article integrates social network and exchange theory to develop a model of customer value based on three relational drivers: relationship quality (the caliber of relational ties), contact density (the number of relational ties), and contact authority (the decision-making capability of relational contacts). The results suggest that the value generated from interfirm relationships derives not only from the quality of customer ties (e.g., trust, commitment, norms), as is typically modeled, but also from the number and decision-making capability of interfirm contacts and the interactions among relational drivers. Moderator analysis of customer characteristics suggests that increasing contact density benefits sellers that have customers with high employee turnover rates, whereas building relationships with key decisions makers generates the highest returns among customers that are more difficult to access. The conceptual model of the impact of interfirm relational drivers on customer value receives support from dyadic data across 446 business-to-business exchanges.

Title: Customer Participation and the Trade-Off Between New Product Innovativeness and Speed to Market
Author-Name: Eric (Er) Fang
Abstract: To address the trade-off between new product innovativeness and speed to market caused by customer participation activities, the author differentiates two dimensions of customer participation—customer participation as an information resource (CPI) and customer participation as a codeveloper (CPC)—and explores the moderating effects of downstream customer network connectivity and new product development process interdependence and complexity. Matched data collected from 143 customer–component manufacturer dyads indicate that CPI has a negative influence on innovativeness when downstream customer network connectivity is high but a positive effect when it is low. In contrast, CPI has a positive effect on speed to market when downstream customer network connectivity is high and no significant effect when it is low. In addition, CPC undermines new product speed to market when process interdependence is high. In contrast, CPC can improve new product speed to market but hurt new product innovativeness when process interdependence is low. The results of this article provide specific managerial guidelines as to how to manage customer participation to improve new product innovativeness and speed to market.

Title: Effect of Service Transition Strategies on Firm Value
Author-Name: Eric (Er) Fang,

Author-Name: Jan-Benedict E.M. Steenkamp
Abstract: The authors investigate the effectiveness of service transition strategies for generating shareholder value by evaluating secondary data pertaining to 477 publicly traded manufacturing firms during 1990–2005. The impact of a firm's transition to services on firm value (as measured by Tobin's q) remains relatively flat or slightly negative until the firm reaches a critical mass of service sales (20%–30%), after which point they have an increasingly positive effect. Furthermore, the effect of service sales on firm value depends on both firm and industry factors. Service transition strategies are more effective at enhancing value when the service offerings are related more to the firm's core business and when firms have more available resources (i.e., resource slack). The impact of adding services to core products on firm value amplifies as industry turbulence increases but diminishes when the firm's core products are in high-growth industries.

Title: Customer Prioritization: Does It Pay Off, and How Should It Be Implemented?
Author-Name: Christian Homburg, 
Author-Name: Mathias Droll, 
Author-Name: Dirk Totzek
Abstract: It seems to be common sense that to increase profits, firms should prioritize customers (i.e., focus their efforts on the most important customers). However, such a strategy might have substantial negative effects on firms' relationships with customers treated at a low priority level. Prior research does not indicate satisfactorily whether and how customer prioritization pays off. Moreover, although customer prioritization may be strongly present in firms' marketing strategies, firms frequently fail to implement such a strategy. Therefore, it is also important to investigate empirically by which means firms can facilitate implementation. The authors address both issues and conduct a cross-industry study with 310 firms from business-to-consumer and business-to-business contexts together with two independent validation samples. The results show that customer prioritization ultimately leads to higher average customer profitability and a higher return on sales because it (1) affects relationships with top-tier customers positively but does not affect relationships with bottom-tier customers and (2) reduces marketing and sales costs. Furthermore, the ability to assess customer profitability, the quality of customer information, selective organizational alignment, selective senior-level involvement, and selective elaboration of planning and control all positively moderate the link between a firm's prioritization strategy and actual customer prioritization.

Title: How Customer Portfolio Affects New Product Development in Technology-Based Entrepreneurial Firms
Author-Name: Helena Yli-Renko, 
Author-Name: Ramkumar Janakiraman
Abstract: This article focuses on how the customer portfolios of technology-based entrepreneurial firms affect new product development. Drawing on knowledge-based, resource dependence, and relational theories, the authors argue that the impact of a firm's customers on new product development depends on the size and relational embeddedness of the customer portfolio and the extent to which the firm is dependent on one or a few dominant customers for a majority of its revenues. The authors test the research model using longitudinal data on young firms operating in business-to-business markets in six technology-based industries. The results indicate that customer portfolio size has an inverse U-shaped relationship to the number of new products developed and that the more relationally embedded the customer set, the more new products the firm develops. Dependence stemming from revenue concentration has a negative impact on new product output. Furthermore, the authors find that relational embeddedness can compensate for too small of a customer portfolio and can help offset the negative effects of a highly concentrated portfolio. These results make important theoretical and empirical contributions to the new product development literature, helping uncover some of the antecedents of innovative productivity particularly relevant for young, technology-based firms. The results also contribute to the broader discourse on how customers affect new product development.

Title: Reasons for Market Evolution and Budgeting Implications
Author-Name: Fang Wang, 
Author-Name: Xiao-Ping (Steven) Zhang
Abstract: Identifying market evolution is a necessary step in persistence analysis of marketing input–output relationships. Using the advertising–sales relationship to represent general marketing input–output dynamics, the authors theoretically distinguish two types of market evolution: (1) intrinsic evolution, in which sales evolve independent of advertising and temporary advertising can generate persistent effects, and (2) induced evolution, in which sales evolution is supported by sustained advertising budgets in an intrinsic-stationary market and there are no real persistent effects of temporary advertising. The proposed intrinsic market evolution test can identify intrinsic-evolving and intrinsic-stationary markets. The authors analyze five major budgeting implications and provide methods to quantify temporary and sustained budgeting. In general, in an intrinsic-evolving market, budgeting can be short-term focused, whereas in an intrinsic-stationary market, the focus should be on sustained budgeting. Percentage budgeting at a sufficient level can create induced evolution. Contrary to conventional wisdom, temporary, intensive advertising campaigns are often not necessary. Empirical illustrations demonstrate the two types of evolutions and the relationships between budgeting methods and sales performance.

Title: Does Academic Research Help or Hurt MBA Programs?
Author-Name: Debanjan Mitra, 
Author-Name: Peter N. Golder
Abstract: Since the 1960s, scientific academic research has played a prominent role in most leading business schools. Recently, however, critics have argued that emphasizing research is misguided and may only serve the faculty's interests at the expense of students and the firms that employ them. This study attempts to inform this debate by investigating the short- and long-term effects of academic research in 57 business schools over 18 years on academics', recruiters', and applicants' perceptions as well as on the schools' education performance with current students. The authors find that academic research has positive long-term effects on the perceptions of these three constituents and on education performance, as well as short-term effects on academics' perceptions. Moreover, effect sizes are large and meaningful. A persistent increase of three single-author articles per year is associated with an improvement in a school's ranking among academics by one place, a decline in its acceptance rate of 1%, and an increase in graduates' average annual starting salary of more than $750. The authors discuss the implications of these findings and present related opportunities for further research.

Title: Performance Implications of Adopting a Customer-Focused Sales Campaign
Author-Name: V. Kumar, 
Author-Name: Rajkumar Venkatesan, 
Author-Name: Werner Reinartz
Abstract: Through field experiments conducted in two business-to-business firms, the authors evaluate the financial and relational consequences of adopting a customer focus in sales campaigns. In both the experiments, salespeople adopting the customer-focused sales campaign coordinated their sales calls with the objective of selling all the products that a customer was predicted to purchase only at the time the customer was expected to purchase. The authors compare this strategy with the current practice in the organization in which salespeople for each product category independently contacted the customers who were expected to purchase in that category without any guidance on the expected timing of customer purchase. The experiments show that adopting a customer-focused sales campaign can significantly increase firm profits and return on investment. The total incremental profits obtained from implementing the customer-focused sales campaign was more than $1 million. High-revenue customers were the source of improvements in the efficiency of marketing contacts, whereas low-revenue customers were the source of improvements in the effectiveness of the marketing contacts. A customer-focused sales campaign also improved the relationship quality between the customer and the firm. This research provides empirical evidence for theoretical expectations of the benefits provided by a customer-focused sales campaign. Organizations can use the field experiments illustrated in this study as a template for implementing the first step in migrating to a customer-centric organization.

Title: Advertising to Bilinguals: Does the Language of Advertising Influence the Nature of Thoughts?
Author-Name: Jaime Noriega, 
Author-Name: Edward Blair
Abstract: When targeting bilingual consumers, advertisers have a choice to advertise in a bilingual's native language or in the country's dominant language. Within the Hispanic community in the United States, for example, Kellogg has a choice to advertise Frosted Flakes in English or in Spanish. But which is the better choice and why? This research considers whether the choice of language in advertising to bilinguals influences the types of thoughts they have in response to an advertisement. In other words, for a bilingual, can the exact same selling message cue different associations depending on the language in which it is presented? The underlying issue is whether advertisers can use language of execution as a strategic variable with which to generate certain types of associations that may facilitate persuasion. The authors consider this issue from a social cognition perspective. They hypothesize that a native-language advertisement is more likely to elicit self-referent thoughts about family, friends, home, or homeland, which in turn may lead to more positive attitude measures and behavioral intentions. Furthermore, the authors show that these effects are moderated by the consumption context presented in the advertisement.

Title: Flow Signals: How Patterns over Time Affect the Acceptance of Start-Up Firms
Author-Name: Jade S. DeKinder, 
Author-Name: Ajay K. Kohli
Abstract: This study introduces the concept of flow signals—patterns of a firm's attributes over time—and contrasts them with point signals discussed in the literature to date. Three properties of flow signals are delineated: displacement, propensity, and reversals. The authors illustrate these properties using a start-up's research-and-development (R&D) spending and voluntary disclosure flows. The authors argue that the flow signal properties affect prospective customers' perceptions of a start-up's current and future product quality, thus influencing their purchase likelihood and, ultimately, the start-up's growth in sales. The findings, obtained from panel data comprised of U.S. venture-backed firms that went public in 2001–2005, suggest that sales growth is positively affected by displacement and propensity of both R&D spending and voluntary disclosures and negatively affected by R&D spending reversals. Furthermore, these effects are stronger for the relatively younger start-ups.

Title: When Marketing Strategy First Meets Wall Street: Marketing Spendings and Firms' Initial Public Offerings
Author-Name: Xueming Luo
Abstract: This article examines the role of marketing in the context of initial public offerings (IPOs), a neglected issue in the extant literature. The results from a large-scale, cross-industry study indicate that firms' pre-IPO marketing spendings help reduce IPO underpricing and boost IPO trading in the stock market. The econometric models also suggest that these effects are heterogeneous; that is, they are more salient for firms with higher cost reduction efficiency and in markets with a smaller number of historical IPOs.With regard to theory, this research ushers in a greenfield of IPOs, helping build more powerful theories of market-based assets and customer equity.With regard to practice, it builds the case for not cutting marketing before an IPO. Prudent investors may be better able to pick “star” IPOs if they can track pre-IPO marketing spendings and model firm cost reduction efficiency simultaneously. Overall, this article offers fresh implications for the marketing–finance interface, uncovering brand-new IPO-based reasons that marketing can help create shareholder value.

Consequently, consumers' spending in a particular industry can be better understood in relation to their expenditures in others. Although marketers may believe that they are operating in distinct and unrelated industries, it is important to understand how consumers, with a given budget, make trade-offs between meeting different consumption needs. For example, how much would escalating gas prices affect consumer spending on food and apparel? Which industries would gain most in terms of extra consumer spending as a result of a tax rebate? Answers to these questions are also important from a public policy standpoint because they provide insights into how consumer welfare would be affected as consumers reallocate their consumption budget in response to environmental changes. This study proposes a structural demand model to approximate the household budget allocation decision, in which consumers are assumed to allocate a given budget across a full spectrum of consumption categories to maximize an underlying utility function. The authors illustrate the model using Consumer Expenditure Survey data from the United States, covering 31 consumption categories over 22 years. The calibrated model makes it possible to draw direct inferences about the trade-offs individual households make when they face budget constraints and how their relative preferences for different consumption categories vary across life stages and income levels. The study also demonstrates how the proposed model can be used in policy simulations to quantify the potential impacts on consumption patterns due to shifts in prices or discretionary income.

Title: Cross-Functional Integration and New Product Success: An Empirical Investigation of the Findings
Author-Name: Lisa C. Troy, 
Author-Name: Tanawat Hirunyawipada, 
Author-Name: Audhesh K. Paswan
Abstract: Although cross-functional integration is often considered an important element in a successful new product development program, a great deal of variance exists in extant literature regarding how integration is defined and implemented and how relevant studies are conducted. The authors attempt to bring clarity to a diverse set of 25 studies that investigate cross-functional integration by empirically analyzing 146 correlations between integration and aspects of new product success. The authors examine the impact of 12 potential moderators that affect the integration–success link using meta-analysis techniques. The findings indicate that though cross-functional integration may indeed have a direct impact on success, the combination of integration with other variables may be of greater importance. Furthermore, because most of the nine variables that significantly affect the integration–success relationship are either managerially controlled or industry specific, the findings imply that firms should design cross-functional structures to maximize their effectiveness. Other variables that affect the integration–success relationship reflect researchers' methodological decisions, suggesting that care should be taken when designing and interpreting the results of such studies. The authors discuss the implications of these findings and directions for further research.

Title: Private-Label Use and Store Loyalty
Author-Name: Kusum L. Ailawadi, 
Author-Name: Koen Pauwels, 
Author-Name: Jan-Benedict E.M. Steenkamp
Abstract: The authors develop an econometric model of the relationship between a household's private-label (PL) share and its behavioral store loyalty. The model includes major drivers of these two behaviors and controls for simultaneity and nonlinearity in the relationship between them. The model is estimated with a unique data set that combines complete purchase records of a panel of Dutch households with demographic and psychographic data. The authors estimate the model for two retail chains in the Netherlands—the leading service chain with a well-differentiated high-share PL and the leading value chain with a lower-share PL. They find that PL share significantly affects all three measures of behavioral loyalty in the study: share of wallet, share of items purchased, and share of shopping trips. In addition, behavioral loyalty has a significant effect on PL share. For the service chain, the authors find that both effects are in the form of an inverted U. For the value chain, the effects are positive and nonlinear, but they do not exhibit nonmonotonicity, because PL share has not yet reached high enough levels. The managerial implications of this research are important. Retailers can reap the benefits of a virtuous cycle; greater PL share increases share of wallet, and greater share of wallet increases PL share. However, this virtuous cycle operates only to a point because heavy PL buyers tend to be loyal to price savings and PLs in general, not to the PL of any particular chain.

Title: Competitive Density and the Customer Acquisition–Retention Trade-Off
Author-Name: Glenn B. Voss, 
Author-Name: Zannie Giraud Voss
Abstract: The authors build on conceptual and analytic evidence to argue that firms can increase performance by shifting emphasis away from customer retention strategies toward customer acquisition strategies as competitive density (i.e., the number of competitors) increases and the marketplace becomes more dynamic. Empirical research using four data sources for a single artistic industry produces strong support for the moderation hypotheses. When competitive density is low, a customer retention strategy emphasizing close relationships with customers and adaptive learning enhances performance. When competitive density is high, a customer acquisition strategy emphasizing innovation and competitor learning enhances performance. Four key takeaways emerge. As competitive density increases, (1) the financial impact of choosing the right mix of resources and capabilities increases; (2) close customer relationships become liabilities, providing no revenue benefits and exerting a negative effect on net income; (3) close relationships with suppliers increase revenues but also expenses, so that net income decreases; and (4) adaptive learning lowers revenue and, even more so, expenses, so that net income increases. The authors discuss the implications of these findings and identify combinations of resources and capabilities that achieve different performance objectives.

Title: Breaking Through Fast-Forwarding: Brand Information and Visual Attention
Author-Name: S. Adam Brasel, 
Author-Name: James Gips
Abstract: This research explores how fast-forwarding through commercials alters the visual attention of viewers and how marketers can tailor advertisements to retain effectiveness as digital video recorder usage rises. Building on prior work in visual marketing and perceptual psychology, the authors conduct two eye-tracker studies that show how fast-forwarding viewers pay more attention during commercials, but their attention is heavily limited to the center of the screen. Fast-forwarded advertisements containing brand information at screen center still create brand memory even with a 95% reduction in frames and complete loss of audio, whereas advertisements with brand information located elsewhere are of virtually no value. A third study shows that fast-forwarded commercials containing extensive central brand information can positively affect brand attitude, behavioral intent, and even actual choice behavior. These findings show that marketers can counteract the negative effects of digital video recorders by ensuring that their advertisements are heavily branded and that the branding is centrally located.

Title: Financial Value of Brands in Mergers and Acquisitions: Is Value in the Eye of the Beholder?
Author-Name: S. Cem Bahadir, 
Author-Name: Sundar G. Bharadwaj, 
Author-Name: Rajendra K. Srivastava
Abstract: In mergers and acquisitions (M&As), brands account for significant but heterogeneous proportions of overall transaction value. The marketing literature focuses on the drivers of financial value of brands when there is no change in the ownership of brands. However, in M&As, the value of brands also depends on how their new owners leverage them. This study identifies both the target and the acquirer firm characteristics that affect the value of a target firm's brands in M&As. The study uses audited measures of acquired brand value from Securities and Exchange Commission filings (made available as a result of recent statutory reporting requirements) along with data collected from diverse secondary sources. The empirical test of the model is based on 133 M&A transactions in which acquirers attribute value to target firms' brands. The results indicate that acquirer and target marketing capabilities and brand portfolio diversity have positive effects on a target firm's brand value. The positive impact of acquirer brand portfolio diversity and target marketing capability is lower when the M&A is synergistic than when it is nonsynergistic. The findings are robust to various model specifications, measures, endogeneity, and sample selection.

Title: Brand Communities and New Product Adoption:The Influence and Limits of Oppositional Loyalty
Author-Name: Scott A. Thompson, 
Author-Name: Rajiv K. Sinha
Abstract: Brand communities have been cited for their potential not only to enhance the loyalty of members but also to engender a sense of oppositional loyalty toward competing brands. However, the impact of brand community membership on actual new product adoption behavior has yet to be explored. This study examines the effects of brand community participation and membership duration on the adoption of new products from opposing brands as well as from the preferred brand. Longitudinal data were collected on the participation behavior, membership duration, and adoption behavior of 7506 members spanning four brand communities and two product categories. Using a hazard modeling approach, the authors find that higher levels of participation and longer-term membership in a brand community not only increase the likelihood of adopting a new product from the preferred brand but also decrease the likelihood of adopting new products from opposing brands. However, such oppositional loyalty is contingent on whether a competitor's new product is the first to market. Furthermore, in the case of overlapping memberships, higher levels of participation in a brand community may actually increase the likelihood of adopting products from rival brands. This finding is both surprising and disconcerting because marketing managers usually do not know which other memberships their brand community members possess. The authors discuss how managers can enhance the impact of their brand community on the adoption of the company's new products while limiting the impact of opposing brand communities.

Title: Damage from Corrective Advertising: Causes and Cures
Author-Name: Peter R. Darke, 
Author-Name: Laurence Ashworth, 
Author-Name: Robin J.B. Ritchie
Abstract: Corrective advertising can be problematic because it undermines responses both to other products advertised by the corrected firm and to products advertised by second-party advertisers. However, a positive reputation insulates second-party firms from these carryover effects, provided that this reputation is based on an endorsement from an independent regulator. Furthermore, firm responses that include an explanation for the misleading claim prove to be effective in avoiding the negative side effects of correction. These findings add to the correction literature by (1) showing that this form of regulation can have much broader side effects than demonstrated previously, (2) identifying distrust as the mechanism by which these effects occur, and (3) suggesting strategies to protect firms from the negative side effects of correction. The findings also support the defensive consumer distrust model and help define the scope of this model.

Title: Customer Equity Drivers and Future Sales
Author-Name: Verena Vogel, 
Author-Name: Heiner Evanschitzky, 
Author-Name: B. Ramaseshan
Abstract: Research on linking operational marketing inputs to customer attitudes and customer behavior has been gaining significance concomitant with the growing recognition that customers are market-based assets. In response to this, researchers and practitioners have proposed several conceptual models. Despite recent advances in research, the results are still inconclusive as to the relationship between customer attitude and future sales. A reason for this could be due to the paucity of studies combining survey-based data with behavioral data to understand better the drivers of customer behavior. With that in mind, the authors investigate the effects of customer perceptions of key marketing actions on customer attitudes and actual customer behavior as reflected by future sales. The authors propose that customer perceptions of value, brand, and relationship—“customer equity drivers”—affect loyalty intentions and future sales. The results of the study, which is based on a sample of 5694 customers of a large European do-it-yourself retailer, suggest that customer equity drivers can significantly predict future sales, even after the authors control for the current sales level.

Title: Inertial Disruption:The Impact of a New Competitive Entrant on Online Consumer Search
Author-Name: Wendy W. Moe, 
Author-Name: Sha Yang
Abstract: The objective of this article is to examine the impact of a new competitive entry on online consumer search behavior. The authors use store visitation as a measure of online search and decompose a shopper's tendency to search a given Web site into a baseline search preference for that site and an inertial effect of visiting that site.They find that inertia is an important driver in search behavior and is easily disrupted by a new competitive entry. This is a new and significant finding that contributes to the competitive entry literature. The authors develop a Bayesian model of search that separates the role of baseline search preference and inertia on store visitation and captures the effect of a new competitive entry. They apply this model to Internet clickstream data for the online bookstore market, in which they focus on the entry of Borders.com in 1998.

Title: What Does It Take to Get Promoted in Marketing Academia? Understanding Exceptional Publication Productivity in the Leading Marketing Journals
Author-Name: Steven H. Seggie, 
Author-Name: David A. Griffith
Abstract: Institutional competition to retain and recruit marketing scholars capable of publishing in the leading marketing journals has intensified. Although increased emphasis has been placed on publication productivity in the leading marketing journals, little is known about questions such as (1) What level of publication productivity in the leading marketing journals does it take to get promoted in marketing academia? (2) What level of publication productivity in the leading marketing journals warrants exception? and (3) What drives research productivity in the leading marketing journals? The authors draw on the economic concept of imperfect substitution to address these questions using two data sets: (1) a census of publication activity in the leading marketing journals of 337 scholars in the top 70 institutions who were promoted between 1992 and 2006 and (2) an examination of 2672 scholars who published 3492 articles in the four leading marketing journals over the 1982–2006 period. The results indicate that the average number of publications by successful candidates for promotion to associate professor from PhD conferral at the top 10 institutions was .57 articles in the leading marketing journals per year, compared with .47 in the top 11–20 institutions, .47 in the top 21–40 institutions, and .26 in the top 41–70 institutions. The authors also present findings related to promotion to full professor both from PhD conferral and from promotion to associate professor, as well as scholars identified as warranting exceptional publication productivity. The findings provide substantive implications for marketing academics, for those involved with the recruitment and retention of marketing academics, and for the field of marketing thought in general.

Title: Continuous Supplier Performance Improvement: Effects of Collaborative Communication and Control
Author-Name: Ashwin W. Joshi
Abstract: Manufacturing firms seek continuous supplier performance improvement because this outcome makes them more competitive in downstream markets. Although manufacturing firms use a range of tools to effect continuous supplier performance improvement, the author focuses on two that are especially important—collaborative communication and control—and poses the following research questions: (1) How does collaborative communication foster continuous supplier performance improvement? and (2) What are the combined effects of collaborative communication and control? The results from a survey of 153 manufacturer–supplier dyads show that collaborative communication fosters continuous supplier performance improvement by enhancing supplier knowledge (of manufacturer needs) and by building supplier affective commitment (toward the manufacturer). With respect to the combined effects of communication and control, the results show that capability control enhances the positive effects of both supplier knowledge and supplier affective commitment on continuous supplier performance improvement, whereas process control undermines the effect of supplier knowledge on the outcome. This pattern of results suggests that manufacturing firms should emphasize capability control and deemphasize process control to foster continuous supplier performance improvement.

Title: Product Innovations, Advertising, and Stock Returns
Author-Name: Shuba Srinivasan, 
Author-Name: Koen Pauwels, 
Author-Name: Jorge Silva-Risso, 
Author-Name: Dominique M. Hanssens
Abstract: Under increased scrutiny from top management and shareholders, marketing managers feel the need to measure and communicate the impact of their actions on shareholder returns. In particular, how do customer value creation (through product innovation) and customer value communication (through marketing investments) affect stock returns? This article examines, conceptually and empirically, how product innovations and marketing investments for such product innovations lift stock returns by improving the outlook on future cash flows. The authors address these questions with a large-scale econometric analysis of product innovation and associated marketing mix in the automobile industry. They find that adding such marketing actions to the established finance benchmark model greatly improves the explained variance in stock returns. In particular, investors react favorably to companies that launch pioneering innovations, that have higher perceived quality, that are backed by substantial advertising support, and that are in large and growing categories. Finally, the authors quantify and compare the stock return benefits of several managerial control variables. The results highlight the stock market benefits of pioneering innovations. Compared with minor updates, pioneering innovations have an impact on stock returns that is seven times greater, and their advertising support is nine times more effective as well. Perceived quality of the new car introduction improves the firm's stock returns, but customer liking does not have a statistically significant effect. Promotional incentives have a negative effect on stock returns, indicating that price promotions may be interpreted as a signal of demand weakness. Managers can combine these return estimates with internal data on project costs to help decide the appropriate mix of product innovation and marketing investment.

Author-Name: Jaideep C. Prabhu, 
Author-Name: Rajesh K. Chandy
Abstract: Radical innovation is an important driver of the growth, success, and wealth of firms and nations. Because of its importance, authors across various disciplines have proposed many theories about the drivers of such innovation, including government policy and labor, capital, and culture at the national level. The authors contrast these theories with one based on the corporate culture of the firm. They test their theory using survey and archival data from 759 firms across 17 major economies of the world. The results suggest the following: First, among the factors studied, corporate culture is the strongest driver of radical innovation across nations; culture consists of three attitudes and three practices. Second, the commercialization of radical innovations translates into a firm's financial performance; it is a stronger predictor of financial performance than other popular measures, such as patents. The authors discuss the implications of these findings for research and practice.

Title: Pay What You Want: A New Participative Pricing Mechanism
Author-Name: Ju-Young Kim,

Abstract: Pay what you want (PWYW) is a new participative pricing mechanism in which consumers have maximum control over the price they pay. Previous research has suggested that participative pricing increases consumers' intent to purchase. However, sellers using PWYW face the risk that consumers will exploit their control and pay nothing at all or a price below the seller's costs. In three field studies, the authors find that prices paid are significantly greater than zero. They analyze factors that influence prices paid and show that PWYW can even lead to an increase in seller revenues.

Title: Brand Portfolio Strategy and Firm Performance
Author-Name: Neil A. Morgan,

Abstract: Most large firms operating in consumer markets own and market more than one brand (i.e., they have a brand portfolio). Although firms make corporate-level strategic decisions regarding their brand portfolio, little is known about whether and how a firm's brand portfolio strategy is linked to its business performance. Using data from the American Customer Satisfaction Index and other secondary sources, the authors examine the impact of the scope, competition, and positioning characteristics of brand portfolios on the marketing and financial performance of 72 large publicly traded firms operating in consumer markets over ten years (from 1994 to 2003). Controlling for several industry and firm characteristics, the authors analyze the relationship between five specific brand portfolio characteristics (number of brands owned, number of segments in which they are marketed, degree to which the brands in the firm's portfolio compete with one another, and consumer perceptions of the quality and price of the brands in the firm's portfolio) and firms' marketing effectiveness (consumer loyalty and market share), marketing efficiency (ratio of advertising spending to sales and ratio of selling, general, and administrative expenses to sales), and financial performance (Tobin's q, cash flow, and cash flow variability). They find that each of these five brand portfolio characteristics explains significant variance in five or more of the seven aspects of firms' marketing and financial performance examined.

Title: Internet Auction Features as Quality Signals

Abstract: Internet auction companies have developed innovative tools that enable sellers to reveal more information about their credibility and product quality to avoid the “lemons” problem. On the basis of signaling and auction theories, the authors propose a typology of Internet auction quality and credibility indicators, adopt and modify Park and Bradlow's (2005) model, and use eBay as an example to examine empirically how different types of indicators help alleviate uncertainty. This empirical evidence demonstrates how Internet auction features affect consumer participation and bidding decisions, what modifies the credibility of quality indicators, and how different buyers react to indicators. The signaling-based hypotheses provide coherent explanations of consumers' bidding behavior. As the first empirical study to evaluate the signaling role of comprehensive Internet auction institutional features in mitigating the adverse selection problem, this research provides evidence to clarify the economic foundation behind innovative Internet auction designs.

Title: Competing Loyalty Programs: Impact of Market Saturation, Market Share, and Category Expandability
Author-Name: Yuping Liu, 
Author-Name: Rong Yang
Abstract: Loyalty programs have become an important component of firms' relationship management strategies. There are now some industries in which numerous rival loyalty programs are offered, inducing intense competition among these programs. However, existing research on loyalty programs has often studied such programs in a noncompetitive setting and has often focused on a single program in isolation. Addressing this gap, this research examines the effect of a firm's competitive positioning and market saturation on the performance of the firm's loyalty program. Based on the analysis of firm- and individual-level data from the airline industry, the results indicate that larger firms tend to benefit more from their loyalty program offerings than smaller firms. Moreover, when the product category demand is rigid, the impact of an individual loyalty program decreases as the marketplace becomes more saturated with competing programs. However, when the product category is highly expandable, the saturation effect disappears. Under such situations, loyalty programs can help an industry gain competitive advantage over substitute offerings outside the industry, and multiple programs can effectively coexist even under a high level of market saturation.

Abstract: The authors explore the role of hubs (people with an exceptionally large number of social ties) in diffusion and adoption. Using data on a large network with multiple adoptions, they identify two types of hubs—innovative and follower hubs. Contrary to recent arguments, hubs tend to adopt earlier in the diffusion process, even though they are not necessarily innovative. Although innovative hubs have a greater impact on the speed of the adoption process, follower hubs have a greater impact on market size (total number of adoptions). Importantly, a small sample of hubs offers accurate success versus failure predictions early in the diffusion process.

Title: Demarketing, Minorities, and National Attachment
Author-Name: Amir Grinstein, 
Author-Name: Udi Nisan
Abstract: This study addresses two important global trends: protection of public goods, specifically the environment, and the emergence of multiethnic societies with influential minority groups. The study tests the effect of a government proenvironmental demarketing campaign on the deconsumption behavior of minority groups and the majority population. It suggests that minority consumers use consumption or deconsumption to manifest their social identity, beliefs, and goals as minorities in relation to the majority and that their motivation to respond positively to a government's demarketing campaign is shaped by their national attachment levels. The study was conducted in Jerusalem, Israel, and involved a large data set (N = 66,272) containing household-level data on actual behavior of consumers. The studied groups involved the majority of non-ultra-Orthodox Jews and three minority groups: Israeli Arabs, ultra-Orthodox Jews, and Jewish Russian immigrants. The findings show that in a proenvironmental context, government demarketing is more effective on the majority group than on any of the three minority groups. In addition, minority groups with lower national attachment levels respond more negatively to the demarketing effort. However, higher education levels lead to a more positive response across the majority and minority groups. A central implication of the findings is related to the benefits derived from demarketing for different consumer groups (majorities versus minorities based on religion, ethnicity, and immigration status). The findings also provide a benchmark for demarketing efforts in an environmental context. Finally, they suggest that policy makers and marketers should consider using demarketing more to complement regulatory and economic tools.

Title: The Role of Leaders in Internal Marketing

Author-Name: Rolf van Dick
Abstract: There is little empirical research on internal marketing despite its intuitive appeal and anecdotal accounts of its benefits. Adopting a social identity theory perspective, the authors propose that internal marketing is fundamentally a process in which leaders instill into followers a sense of oneness with the organization, formally known as “organizational identification” (OI). The authors test the OI-transfer research model in two multinational studies using multilevel and multisource data. Hierarchical linear modeling analyses show that the OI-transfer process takes place in the relationships between business unit managers and salespeople and between regional directors and business unit managers. Furthermore, both leader–follower dyadic tenure and charismatic leadership moderate this cascading effect. Leaders with a mismatch between their charisma and OI ultimately impair followers' OI. In turn, customer-contact employees' OI strongly predicts their sales performance. Finally, both employees' and sales managers' OI are positively related to their business units' financial performance. The study provides empirical evidence for the role of leaders, especially middle managers, in building member identification that lays the foundation for internal marketing.

Author-Name: Peter C. Verhoef, 
Author-Name: Peter S.H. Leeflang
Abstract: Increasing debate centers on the decreasing influence of the marketing department within firms. This study investigates such influence and assesses its determinants and consequences. The results show that the accountability and innovativeness of the marketing department represent the two major drivers of its influence. However, the results do not indicate that the customer-connecting role of the marketing department increases its influence, though this role is important for shaping the firm's market orientation. A marketing department's influence is related positively to market orientation, which in turn is related positively to firm performance. This study also suggests a dual relationship between the marketing department's influence and market orientation. A key implication of this study is that marketers should become more accountable and innovative to gain more influence.

Abstract: This article reports on a marketing initiative at a pharmaceutical company to redesign its distribution network. Distribution affects a firm's cost and customer satisfaction and drives profitability. Using a nonlinear mixed-integer programming model, the authors develop a distribution network with a dual emphasis on minimizing the total distribution costs and improving the customer service levels. Specifically, they address the following issues: They (1) determine the optimal number of regional distribution centers the firm should operate with, (2) identify where in the United States the firm should locate these distribution centers, (3) allocate each retailer/customer distribution center to an appropriate regional distribution center, and (4) determine the total transportation costs and service level for each case. Finally, they conduct a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact of changes in problem parameters on the optimality of the proposed model. This marketing initiative at the studied firm reduced the total distribution costs by $1.99 million (6%) per year, while increasing the customer on-time delivery from 61.41% to 86.2%, an improvement of 40.4%.

Title: Social Identity and the Service–Profit Chain
Author-Name: Christian Homburg, 
Author-Name: Jan Wieseke, 
Author-Name: Wayne D. Hoyer
Abstract: The conventional service–profit chain (SPC) proposes that a firm's financial performance can be improved through a path that connects employee satisfaction, customer orientation, customer satisfaction, and customer loyalty. In this article, a complementary SPC that is built on both a conventional path and a social identity–based path is introduced. The latter SPC path centrally builds on customer– and employee–company identification as a core construct. Using a large-scale triadic data set that includes data from employees, customers, and firms, the authors find strong support for the extended SPC, which accounts for important customer (loyalty and willingness to pay) and firm (financial performance) outcomes. In addition, the effects of company identification exist incrementally beyond the effects of the conventional SPC path.

Title: Searching for Experience on the Web: An Empirical Examination of Consumer Behavior for Search and Experience Goods
Author-Name: Peng Huang, 
Author-Name: Nicholas H. Lurie, 
Author-Name: Sabyasachi Mitra
Abstract: By lowering the costs of gathering and sharing information and offering new ways to learn about products before purchase, the Internet reduces traditional distinctions between search and experience goods. At the same time, differences in the type of information sought for search and experience goods can precipitate differences in the process through which consumers gather information and make decisions online. A preliminary experiment shows that though there are significant differences in consumers' perceived ability to evaluate product quality before purchase between search and experience goods in traditional retail environments, these differences are blurred in online environments. An analysis of the online behavior of a representative sample of U.S. consumers shows that consumers spend similar amounts of time online gathering information for both search and experience goods, but there are important differences in the browsing and purchase behavior of consumers for these two types of goods. In particular, experience goods involve greater depth (time per page) and lower breadth (total number of pages) of search than search goods. In addition, free riding (purchasing from a retailer other than the primary source of product information) is less frequent for experience than for search goods. Finally, the presence of product reviews from other consumers and multimedia that enable consumers to interact with products before purchase has a greater effect on consumer search and purchase behavior for experience than for search goods.

Title: Proactive Postsales Service: When and Why Does It Pay Off?
Author-Name: Goutam Challagalla, 
Author-Name: R. Venkatesh, 
Author-Name: Ajay K. Kohli
Abstract: Proactive postsales service (PPS) refers to a supplier taking the initiative to contact a customer to provide service after a sale is complete. It is argued that PPS leads to faster delivery of service to a broader cross-section of customers than customer-initiated postsales service, or reactive postsales service. The authors argue that mental frames of customers and suppliers engaged in PPS are more positive and open than mental frames of those engaged in customer-initiated service. On the basis of nine focus groups with 94 managers in both business-to-business and business-to-consumer settings, the authors propose three main dimensions of PPS: (1) proactive prevention, (2) proactive education, and (3) proactive feedback seeking. They argue that PPS leads not only to favorable customer-level outcomes (e.g., customer satisfaction) but also to favorable supplier-level outcomes (e.g., greater innovativeness, new product success rate). The authors propose that the value of PPS varies depending on the product's life-cycle stage, its transaction extensiveness, and network externality. In addition, the value of PPS varies depending on a customer's usage intensity, openness to experience, and market mavenism. Some key challenges with PPS pertain to implementation issues, such as privacy intrusion, expectation escalation, user identification, and contact routinization. If neglected, these can result in PPS leading to negative rather than positive outcomes. The authors develop guidelines for addressing these challenges and implementing PPS effectively in both business-to-business and business-to-consumer contexts.

Title: The Effect of Superstar Software on Hardware Sales in System Markets
Author-Name: Jeroen L.G. Binken, 
Author-Name: Stefan Stremersch
Abstract: Systems are composed of complementary products (e.g., video game systems are composed of the video game console and video games). Prior literature on indirect network effects has argued that in system markets, sales of the primary product (often referred to as “hardware”) largely depend on the availability of complementary products (often referred to as “software”). Mathematical and empirical analyses have almost exclusively operationalized software availability as software quantity. However, though not substantiated with empirical evidence, case illustrations show that certain high-quality, “superstar” software titles (e.g., Super Mario 64) may have disproportionately large effects on hardware unit sales (e.g., Nintendo N64 console sales). In the context of the U.S. home video game console market, the authors show that the introduction of a superstar increases video game console sales by an average of 14% (167,000 units) over a period of five months. One in every five buyers of a superstar software title also purchases the hardware required to use the software. Software type does not consistently alter this effect. The findings imply that scholars who study the relationship between software availability and hardware sales need to account for superstar returns and their decaying effect over time, beyond a mere software quantity effect. Hardware firms should maintain a steady flow of superstar introductions because the positive effect of a superstar lasts only five months and, if need be, make side payments to software firms because superstars dramatically increase hardware sales. Hardware firms' exclusivity over superstars does not provide an extra boost to their own sales, but it takes away an opportunity for competing systems to increase their sales.

Author-Name: Robert Wiltbank
Abstract: How do people approach marketing in the face of uncertainty, when the product, the market, and the traditional details involved in market research are unknowable ex ante? The authors use protocol analysis to evaluate how 27 expert entrepreneurs approach such a problem compared with 37 managers with little entrepreneurial expertise (all 64 participants are asked to think aloud as they make marketing decisions in exactly the same unpredictable situation). The hypotheses are drawn from literature in cognitive science on (1) expertise in general and (2) entrepreneurial expertise in particular. The results show significant differences in heuristics used by the two groups. While those without entrepreneurial expertise rely primarily on predictive techniques, expert entrepreneurs tend to invert these. In particular, they use an effectual or nonpredictive logic to tackle uncertain market elements and to coconstruct novel markets with committed stakeholders.

Abstract: This article describes an investigation of the American Girl brand that provides a more complete and holistic understanding of sociocultural branding. Recent research on emotional branding, together with prior work on brands' symbolic nature and their role as relationship partners, represents a significant shift in the way marketers think about brands and brand management. However, a full understanding of powerful and emotionally resonant brands has been elusive, in part because sociocultural branding knowledge has accumulated in a piecemeal way and lacks coherence and integrity. In addition, powerful brands are extraordinarily complex and multifaceted, but in general they have been studied from a single perspective in a single setting. On the basis of a qualitative exploration of the American Girl brand that is both deep and broad, the authors posit that an emotionally powerful brand is best understood as the product of a complex system, or gestalt, whose component parts are in continuous interplay and together constitute a whole greater than their sum. Studying American Girl from the perspectives of various stakeholder groups in many of the venues in which the brand is manifest, the authors attempt to close the sociocultural branding research loop and identify implications for brand management.

Title: The Role of Within-Brand and Cross-Brand Communications in Competitive Growth
Author-Name: Barak Libai, 
Author-Name: Eitan Muller, 
Author-Name: Renana Peres
Abstract: Consumer-generated communication processes have drawn increasing attention of marketers and researchers. However, an underresearched issue is that interpersonal communications are not always brand specific. Thus, a person can adopt a brand either as a result of communication with adopters of that brand (within-brand influence) or as a result of an interaction with adopters of competing brands (cross-brand influence). This study shows that the interplay between within- and cross-brand influence can have a substantial effect on the growth of markets under competition. The authors develop a model that explicitly represents these two influences and focus on the case of two otherwise identical competing brands with different entry times. As a result of within-brand influence, current customers create an interaction-based advantage for the first entrant, which grows with time. Thus, we illustrate how customers should be viewed as market assets who yield increasing returns during the diffusion process. Conversely, cross-brand influence enables a market follower to enjoy a shorter takeoff time. Given the combination of both, the authors predict the “dual pattern,” characterized by a fast takeoff for a follower, followed by a widening gap in favor of the first entrant, all else being equal.They show that such a pattern dominated the market growth of the cellular industry in Western Europe. They explain the reasons behind this dual pattern, rule out straightforward alternative explanations, and discuss the managerial implications.

Title: Are Product Returns a Necessary Evil? Antecedents and Consequences
Author-Name: J. Andrew Petersen, 
Author-Name: V. Kumar
Abstract: The firm–customer exchange process consists of three key parts: (1) firm-initiated marketing communications, (2) customer buying behavior, and (3) customer product return behavior.To date, the literature in marketing has largely focused on how marketing communications affect customer buying behavior and, to some extent, how past buying behavior affects a firm's decisions to initiate future marketing communications. However, the literature on product returns is sparse, especially in relation to analyzing individual customer product return behavior. Although the magnitude of the value of product returns is known to be high ($100 billion per year), how it affects customer buying behavior is not known because of a lack of data availability and understanding of the role of product returns in the firm–customer exchange process. Given that product returns are considered a hassle for a firm's supply chain management and a drain on overall profitability, it is important to study product return behavior. Thus, the authors empirically demonstrate the role of product returns in the exchange process by determining the exchange process factors that help explain product return behavior and the consequences of product returns on future customer and firm behavior. In addition, the authors demonstrate that product returns are inevitable but by no means evil.

Abstract: Brand experience is conceptualized as sensations, feelings, cognitions, and behavioral responses evoked by brand-related stimuli that are part of a brand's design and identity, packaging, communications, and environments. The authors distinguish several experience dimensions and construct a brand experience scale that includes four dimensions: sensory, affective, intellectual, and behavioral. In six studies, the authors show that the scale is reliable, valid, and distinct from other brand measures, including brand evaluations, brand involvement, brand attachment, customer delight, and brand personality. Moreover, brand experience affects consumer satisfaction and loyalty directly and indirectly through brand personality associations.

Title: Does Customer Demotion Jeopardize Loyalty?
Author-Name: Tillmann Wagner, 
Author-Name: Thorsten Hennig-Thurau, 
Author-Name: Thomas Rudolph
Abstract: Hierarchical loyalty programs award elevated customer status (e.g., “elite membership”) to consumers who meet a predefined spending level. However, if a customer subsequently falls short of the required spending level, firms commonly revoke that status. The authors investigate the impact of such customer demotion on loyalty intentions toward the firm. Building on prospect theory and emotions theory, the authors hypothesize that changes in customer status have an asymmetric negative effect, such that the negative impact of customer demotion is stronger than the positive impact of status increases. An experimental scenario study provides evidence that loyalty intentions are indeed lower for demoted customers than for those who have never been awarded a preferred status, meaning that hierarchical loyalty programs can drive otherwise loyal customers away from a firm. A field study using proprietary sales data from a different industry context demonstrates the robustness of the negative impact of customer demotion. The authors test the extent to which design variables of hierarchical loyalty programs may attenuate the negative consequences of status demotions with a second experimental scenario study and present an analytical model that links status demotion to customer equity to aid managerial decision making.

Title: The Impact of Counterfeiting on Genuine-Item Consumers' Brand Relationships
Author-Name: Suraj Commuri
Abstract: An often-overlooked constituent in the debate on counterfeiting is the consumer of the genuine article—a brand manager's primary constituent. These consumers are drawn to premium brands in part because of the exclusivity and connotation of prestige associated with them. These characteristics are also the reason such brands are attractive targets of counterfeiting. When premium brands are counterfeited, which in turn gives a variety of consumers access to them, how do consumers of the genuine items react to the erosion of exclusivity and prestige? An investigation involving premium brands in Thailand and India reveals that consumers of genuine items adopt one of three strategies when faced with the prospect of their favorite brands being counterfeited: flight (abandoning the brand), reclamation (elaborating the pioneering patronage of a brand), and abranding (disguising all brand cues). The author examines these strategies in detail, revealing how the potential loss of exclusivity and prestige can either drive genuine-item consumers away from the brand or impel them to make strong claims to their patronage.

Author-Name: Venkatesh Shankar
Abstract: Amid growing competition, retailers are increasingly interested in more effective aisle and display management strategies. These strategies involve placements of product categories in aisles and displays within each store to facilitate greater sales affinity (demand attraction) between categories to improve the store's share of customer wallet. The authors investigate the effects of aisle and display placements on the sales affinities between categories. They develop a spatial model of brand sales that allows for asymmetric store-specific affinity effects between two or more categories, while controlling for the effects of traditional merchandising and marketing-mix variables, such as price, feature, and display. They estimate the model on aggregate store-level data for regular cola and regular potato chip categories for a major retail chain, using hierarchical Bayesian methods. They show the usefulness and extension potential of the model through simulation of aisle placements for a third category. The results show that aisle and display placements have significant and sizable asymmetric effects on cross-category sales affinities comparable to those influenced by marketing-mix variables. Retail managers can use this detailed store-level model and subsequent insights to develop customized aisle and display management for their individual stores.

Title: Self-Benefit Versus Other-Benefit Marketing Appeals: Their Effectiveness in Generating Charitable Support
Author-Name: Katherine White, 
Author-Name: John Peloza
Abstract: Despite the growing need, nonprofit organization marketers have not yet fully delineated the most effective ways to position charitable appeals. Across five experiments, the authors test the prediction that other-benefit (self-benefit) appeals generate more favorable donation support than self-benefit (other-benefit) appeals in situations that heighten (versus minimize) public self-image concerns. Public accountability, a manipulation of public self-awareness, and individual differences in public self-consciousness all moderate the effect of appeal type on donor support. In particular, self-benefit appeals are more effective when consumers' responses are private in nature; in contrast, other-benefit appeals are more effective when consumers are publicly accountable for their responses. This effect is moderated by norm salience and is related to a desire to manage impressions by behaving in a manner consistent with normative expectations. The results have important managerial implications, suggesting that rather than simply relying on one type of marketing appeal across situations, marketers should tailor their marketing message to the situation or differentially activate public self-image concerns to match the appeal type.

Abstract: Keyword advertising, or “sponsored links” that appear alongside online search results or other online content, has grown into a multibillion-dollar market. Providers of keyword advertising, such as Google and Yahoo, profit by auctioning keywords to advertisers. An issue of increasing importance for advertising providers is the “share structure” problem—that is, of the total available resources for each keyword (in terms of exposure), how large a share should be set aside for the highest bidder, for the second-highest bidder, and so on. The authors study this problem under a general specification and characterize the optimal share structures that maximize advertising providers' revenues. They also derive results on how the optimal share structure should change with advertisers' price elasticity of demand for exposure, their valuation distribution, total resources, and minimum bids. The authors draw implications for keyword auctions and other applications.

Abstract: Distributor sharing of strategic information with suppliers is an important but underresearched issue within the marketing discipline. The authors develop and test a conceptual framework based on exchange theory that focuses on the degree to which distributors share external and internal strategic information with associated suppliers. Relying on survey data collected from 479 distributors across three industries, the authors find that distributors share strategic information with suppliers according to factors that affect the perceived benefits, costs, and risks of such behavior. The sharing of internal strategic information has distinct determinants compared with those of external strategic information. The interrelationships between environmental uncertainty and the sharing of internal strategic information, including both main and interactive effects, are especially notable.

Title: Marketing of the Life Sciences: A New Framework and Research Agenda for a Nascent Field
Author-Name: Stefan Stremersch, 
Author-Name: Walter Van Dyck
Abstract: Although marketing scholars often seek to contribute new knowledge that is applicable across industries, some industries have unique characteristics that require industry-specific knowledge development. The authors argue that this requirement applies to the life sciences industry, defined as companies in pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, and therapeutic medical devices. Marketers in the life sciences industry face novel and unique challenges along eight decision areas in therapy creation, therapy launch, and therapy promotion. In therapy creation, they face therapy pipeline optimization, innovation alliance formation, and therapy positioning decisions. In therapy launch, they face global market entry timing and key opinion leader selection decisions. Therapy promotion mostly revolves around sales force management, communication management, and stimulating patient compliance. The authors qualify these decision areas according to their practical importance and academic potential. The article derives preliminary generalizations and propositions from prior research and practice and steers further research in specific directions. The authors believe that marketing of the life sciences offers a fertile area for further research because, among other things, its potential impact transcends any problems typically investigated by marketing scholars.

Title: The Worth of Product Placement in Successful Films: An Event Study Analysis
Author-Name: Michael A. Wiles, 
Author-Name: Anna Danielova
Abstract: As a result of the diminishing effectiveness of broadcast advertising, firms are increasingly turning to product placements in films and television to promote their products. A growing stream of product placement research has conducted surveys of consumer and practitioner views on the practice and experiments to gauge product placement's impact on brand awareness, attitudes, and purchase intent. However, there is no evidence of whether firms' investments in film product placements are worthwhile. The event study of 126 product placements in successful films during 2002 reveals a mean cumulative abnormal return of .89% during the film's opening, indicating that product placement in a successful film is associated with positive movements in firm stock prices. Cross-sectional analysis of the returns offers new insight into how product, film, and execution factors influence the placement's worth. The authors find that placement abnormal returns are enhanced by tie-in advertising and brand equity but are inhibited by audience absorption, critical acclaim, and violent film content. Placement modality, character associations, and blatancy also significantly affect the placement's value.

Author-Name: Torsten Bornemann
Abstract: Although the identification of customer needs constitutes a cornerstone of the marketing concept, the accuracy of frontline employees' perceptions of customer needs has never been examined in a systematic manner. Following research in social cognition, this article introduces the concept of “customer need knowledge” (CNK), which describes the extent to which a frontline employee can accurately identify a given customer's hierarchy of needs. The results of two large-scale, multilevel investigations involving data from three different levels (customers, employees, and managers) demonstrate the importance of CNK for the provision of customer satisfaction and customer value. In particular, CNK fully mediates the influence of employees' customer orientation and cognitive empathy on these customer outcomes. Moreover, whereas the length of the relationship between an employee and a particular customer enhances CNK, a large age discrepancy in relation to the customer decreases employees' level of CNK.

Abstract: Prevailing wisdom assumes that female consumers are more loyal than male consumers. The authors report conditions under which the reverse is found, depending on the object of customer loyalty. For example, whereas female consumers tend to be more loyal than male consumers to individuals, such as individual service providers, this difference is reversed when the object of loyalty is a group of people. The authors find a similar crossover interaction effect for loyalty to individual employees versus loyalty to companies. This effect is mediated by self-construal in terms of relational versus collective interdependence. The authors discuss the managerial and theoretical implications of these gender differences.

Abstract: In today's marketplace, many of the newer-generation convergence products (e.g., camera phones, all-in-one personal digital assistants) offer consumers product performance that rivals dedicated versions. With the increased availability of options, consumers now face another dilemma in their purchase consideration: Which product form should they choose—converged, dedicated, or both? This study investigates the choice patterns for product forms along the technology trajectories. In a series of four studies, the authors find that at low levels of technological performance, consumers overwhelmingly select convergence products over the dedicated options, whereas the choice pattern is reversed at high levels of technological performance. Furthermore, the authors demonstrate that a preannouncement of future technology can affect consumer preferences for product forms. Finally, they address the managerial implications and suggest directions for further research.

Abstract: Most theories of relationship marketing emphasize the role of trust and commitment in affecting performance outcomes; however, a recent meta-analysis indicates that other mediating mechanisms are at work. Data from two studies—a laboratory experiment and a dyadic longitudinal field survey—demonstrate that gratitude also mediates the influence of a seller's relationship marketing investments on performance outcomes. Specifically, relationship marketing investments generate short-term feelings of gratitude that drive long-lasting performance benefits based on gratitude-related reciprocal behaviors. The authors identify a set of managerially relevant factors and test their power to alter customer perceptions of relationship marketing investments to increase customer gratitude, which can make relationship marketing programs more effective. Overall, the research empirically demonstrates that gratitude plays an important role in understanding how relationship marketing investments increase purchase intentions, sales growth, and share of wallet.

Title: Testing the Value of Customization: When Do Customers Really Prefer Products Tailored to Their Preferences?
Author-Name: Nikolaus Franke, 
Author-Name: Peter Keinz, 
Author-Name: Christoph J. Steger
Abstract: Recently, researchers have paid increasing attention to the marketing strategy of customization. A key assumption is that customized products create higher benefits for customers than standard products because they deliver a closer preference fit. The prerequisite for this effect is the ability to obtain precise information on what customers actually want. But are customers able to specify their preferences that precisely? Several theoretical arguments raise doubts about this, implicitly challenging the value of customization. The authors conduct two studies in which they find that products customized on the basis of expressed preferences bring about significantly higher benefits for customers in terms of willingness to pay, purchase intention, and attitude toward the product than standard products. The benefit gain is higher if customers have (1) better insight into their own preferences, (2) a better ability to express their preferences, and (3) greater product involvement. This suggests that customization has the potential to be a powerful marketing strategy if these conditions are met. In the opposite case, firms willing to serve heterogeneous customer preferences need to adapt their customization systems in such a way that they explicitly address the customers' inability to provide valid preference information.

Title: Brand-Specific Leadership: Turning Employees into Brand Champions
Author-Name: Felicitas M. Morhart, 
Author-Name: Walter Herzog, 
Author-Name: Torsten Tomczak
Abstract: This article reports two studies on how managers can elicit brand-building behavior from frontline employees. Study 1 examines the mechanisms by which brand-specific transactional and transformational leadership influence employees' brand-building behavior. The results from a survey of 269 customer-contact employees show that brand-specific transactional leaders influence followers through a process of compliance, leading to an increase in turnover intentions and a decrease in in-role and extra-role brand-building behaviors. In contrast, brand-specific transformational leaders influence followers through a process of internalization, leading to a decrease in turnover intentions and an increase in in-role and extra-role brand-building behaviors. In turn, both processes are mediated by employees' perceptions of autonomy, competence, and relatedness with regard to their work roles as brand representatives. Moreover, the results show that brand-specific transactional leadership moderates the influence of brand-specific transformational leadership in a nonlinear, inverse U-shaped way, so that a medium level of transactional leadership maximizes the positive effects of transformational leadership. Study 2 addresses whether managers can learn brand-specific transformational leadership. A field experiment shows that brand-specific transformational leadership can indeed be learned through management training.

Title: The Interplay Among Category Characteristics, Customer Characteristics, and Customer Activities on In-Store Decision Making
Author-Name: J. Jeffrey Inman, 
Author-Name: Russell S. Winer, 
Author-Name: Rosellina Ferraro
Abstract: The authors explore product category and customer characteristics that affect consumers' likelihood of engaging in unplanned purchases. In addition, they examine consumer activities that can exacerbate or limit these effects. The authors employ a hierarchical modeling approach to test their hypotheses using a data set of in-store intercept interviews conducted with 2300 consumers across 28 stores. The results show that category characteristics, such as purchase frequency and displays, and customer characteristics, such as household size and gender, affect in-store decision making. Moreover, although the analysis reveals that the baseline probability of an unplanned purchase is 46%, the contextual factors can drive this probability as high as 93%. The results support the predictions that list use, more frequent trips, limiting the aisles visited, limiting time spent in the store, and paying by cash are effective strategies for decreasing the likelihood of making unplanned purchases.

Title: How Brand Community Practices Create Value
Author-Name: Hope Jensen Schau, 
Author-Name: Albert M. Muñiz, Jr., 
Author-Name: Eric J. Arnould
Abstract: Using social practice theory, this article reveals the process of collective value creation within brand communities. Moving beyond a single case study, the authors examine previously published research in conjunction with data collected in nine brand communities comprising a variety of product categories, and they identify a common set of value-creating practices. Practices have an “anatomy” consisting of (1) general procedural understandings and rules (explicit, discursive knowledge); (2) skills, abilities, and culturally appropriate consumption projects (tacit, embedded knowledge or how-to); and (3) emotional commitments expressed through actions and representations. The authors find that there are 12 common practices across brand communities, organized by four thematic aggregates, through which consumers realize value beyond that which the firm creates or anticipates. They also find that practices have a physiology, interact with one another, function like apprenticeships, endow participants with cultural capital, produce a repertoire for insider sharing, generate consumption opportunities, evince brand community vitality, and create value. Theoretical and managerial implications are offered with specific suggestions for building and nurturing brand community and enhancing collaborative value creation between and among consumers and firms.

Title: Marketing Alliances, Firm Networks, and Firm Value Creation
Author-Name: Vanitha Swaminathan, 
Author-Name: Christine Moorman
Abstract: Prior research has found that the announcement of marketing alliances tends to produce no effect on firm value creation in a high-tech context. This article reexamines this issue and investigates whether the characteristics of a firm's network of alliances affect the firm value created from the announcement of a new marketing alliance. The authors investigate whether network centrality, network density, network efficiency, network reputation, and marketing alliance capability influence firm value creation. They examine this question using an event study of 230 announcements for marketing alliances in the software industry. The results indicate that, in general, marketing alliance announcements create value (i.e., abnormal stock returns) for the firm in the announcement period event window. Furthermore, network efficiency and network density have the strongest positive impact when they are moderate; network reputation and network centrality have no effect. These results point to the greater role of relational network characteristics than size-/status-based benefits. Finally, marketing alliance capability, which reflects a firm's ability to manage a network of previous marketing alliances, has a positive impact on value creation.

Title: Managing Dynamics in a Customer Portfolio
Author-Name: Christian Homburg, 
Author-Name: Viviana V. Steiner, 
Author-Name: Dirk Totzek
Abstract: Although highly relevant for marketing practice, few studies provide conceptual and empirical insights into customer portfolio management. Furthermore, most approaches to analyzing customer portfolios are static. This article discusses three neglected key issues relevant for a dynamic customer portfolio analysis: (1) Does a static versus a dynamic valuation lead to a different prioritization of customer segments in a portfolio? (2) How does offensive or defensive management of segment dynamics affect portfolio value? and (3) Do reliable predictors for dynamics of a customer's position in the portfolio exist? As a tool for customer portfolio analysis, the authors develop a segment-based customer-lifetime-value model. They capture customer dynamics by analyzing how customers switch between segments of different values across time. The authors apply their tool with longitudinal data from four firms with up to 300,000 customers. The results from the empirical analysis and a simulation study provide answers to the three key issues raised. First, compared with a dynamic analysis, a static approach overestimates the value of some customer segments but underestimates others. Second, a defensive versus offensive management of value dynamics is relatively more appropriate for middle-tier segments, whereas the opposite holds true for bottom-tier segments. Third, general customer characteristics and aggregated transaction characteristics indicate future segment dynamics, whereas specific product usage data differentiate customers according to current value.

Title: Effects of Word-of-Mouth Versus Traditional Marketing: Findings from an Internet Social Networking Site
Author-Name: Michael Trusov, 
Author-Name: Randolph E. Bucklin, 
Author-Name: Koen Pauwels
Abstract: The authors study the effect of word-of-mouth (WOM) marketing on member growth at an Internet social networking site and compare it with traditional marketing vehicles. Because social network sites record the electronic invitations from existing members, outbound WOM can be precisely tracked. Along with traditional marketing, WOM can then be linked to the number of new members subsequently joining the site (sign-ups). Because of the endogeneity among WOM, new sign-ups, and traditional marketing activity, the authors employ a vector autoregressive (VAR) modeling approach. Estimates from the VAR model show that WOM referrals have substantially longer carryover effects than traditional marketing actions and produce substantially higher response elasticities. Based on revenue from advertising impressions served to a new member, the monetary value of a WOM referral can be calculated; this yields an upper-bound estimate for the financial incentives the firm might offer to stimulate WOM.

Title: Does In-Store Marketing Work? Effects of the Number and Position of Shelf Facings on Brand Attention and Evaluation at the Point of Purchase
Author-Name: Pierre Chandon, 
Author-Name: J. Wesley Hutchinson, 
Author-Name: Eric T. Bradlow, 
Author-Name: Scott H. Young
Abstract: Recent trends in marketing have demonstrated an increased focus on in-store expenditures with the hope of “grabbing consumers” at the point of purchase, but does this make sense? To help answer this question, the authors examine the interplay between in-store and out-of-store factors on consumer attention to and evaluation of brands displayed on supermarket shelves. Using an eye-tracking experiment, they find that the number of facings has a strong impact on evaluation that is entirely mediated by its effect on visual attention and works particularly well for frequent users of the brand, for low-market-share brands, and for young and highly educated consumers who are willing to trade off brand and price. They also find that gaining in-store attention is not always sufficient to drive sales. For example, top- and middle-shelf positions gain more attention than low-shelf positions; however, only top-shelf positions carry through to brand evaluation. The results underscore the importance of combining eye-tracking and purchase data to obtain a full picture of the effects of in-store and out-of-store marketing at the point of purchase.

Title: The Robustness of the Effects of Consumers' Participation in Market Research:The Case of Service Quality Evaluations
Author-Name: Chezy Ofir,

Author-Name: Song-Oh Yoon
Abstract: The authors propose that participation in market research can determine consumers' experiences with and evaluations of marketing services/products. Building on and extending a prior finding that expectation to evaluate a service (or product) leads to more negative evaluations, this research investigates the robustness, process, and consequences of asking consumers to form evaluations of services/products. The results of several field studies (conducted in Israel, Korea, and the United States) show that (1) the effect of expecting to evaluate on the service provider's performance evaluation is enduring and lasts beyond the immediate aftermath of the service encounter; (2) the effect of study participation on the perception of marketers reflects true perceptual change rather than “made-up” perceptions—it requires supporting evidence and is eliminated if cognitive load interferes in the production of that evidence; and (3) the robust bias produced by expecting to evaluate cannot be eliminated by causing participants to consider the task effect on their evaluations or the impact of their feedback on the evaluated marketers. The authors discuss the broader implications of this research for understanding the impact of participation in market research on consumers' experiences and inputs.

Title: Expanding the Role of Marketing: From Customer Equity to Market Capitalization
Author-Name: V. Kumar, 
Author-Name: Denish Shah
Abstract: Can a marketer drive the stock price of the firm? Yes, it should be possible. Toward this endeavor, the authors develop a framework to link customer equity (CE) (as determined by the customer lifetime value metric) to market capitalization (MC) (as determined by the stock price of the firm). The authors test the framework in an empirical field experiment with two Fortune 1000 firms in the business-to-business and business-to-consumer contexts, respectively. The findings show that (1) a CE-based framework can reliably predict the MC of the firm and (2) marketing strategies directed at increasing the CE not only increase the stock price of the firm but also beat market expectations. Furthermore, the results indicate that the relationship between CE and MC is moderated by risk factors in the form of volatility and vulnerability of cash flows from customers. By accounting for these factors, the authors improve the association between CE and MC. The findings broaden the scope and role of marketing while reinforcing the importance of the marketer to any organization.

Title: Valuing Branded Businesses
Author-Name: Natalie Mizik,

Abstract: The authors develop and validate a conditional multiplier approach for valuing branded businesses. The approach enhances traditional multiplier-based valuation by explicitly incorporating brand characteristics into the model. The authors present theoretical arguments why, develop a model to demonstrate how, and provide an empirical illustration to show that brand assets are not fully reflected in contemporaneous margins, and therefore valuation accuracy can be improved by incorporating information about the properties of the firm's brand asset directly into a valuation framework. The authors find that brand metrics have statistically significant associations with valuation multipliers and add incremental explanatory power to accounting variables in explaining valuation multipliers. Out-of-sample analysis shows a 16% improvement in the mean absolute error for predictions that take into account brand metrics compared with predictions based on accounting variables alone.

Title: Evaluating the Financial Impact of Branding Using Trademarks: A Framework and Empirical Evidence
Author-Name: Alexander Krasnikov, 
Author-Name: Saurabh Mishra, 
Author-Name: David Orozco
Abstract: Firms spend considerable efforts to build brand awareness and associations among consumers. Yet there is a limited understanding of the financial returns of such investments. In this article, the authors present a framework that uses trademarks as measures of firms' branding efforts. They classify trademarks into two categories—brand-identification trademarks and brand-association trademarks—and propose that they are indicators of firm efforts to build brand awareness and associations among consumers, respectively. The authors then evaluate the chain of effects linking such assets with metrics of firms' financial value. A longitudinal analysis of data collected from secondary sources reveals that the stock (i.e., total number) of brand-association trademarks available to firms in time period t increases their cash flow, Tobin's q, return on assets, and stock returns and reduces their cash-flow variability in period t + 1. Furthermore, the authors observe that the stock of brand-identification trademarks owned by firms in period t – 1 influences the effects of brand-association trademarks on cash flow, Tobin's q, and stock returns. Together, these findings provide useful insights into the financial value of branding.

Title: Conceptualizing and Measuring the Monetary Value of Brand Extensions: The Case of Motion Pictures
Author-Name: Thorsten Hennig-Thurau, 
Author-Name: Mark B. Houston, 
Author-Name: Torsten Heitjans
Abstract: Brand extension value is the part of brand value that derives from a brand owner's right to introduce new products related to the brand. The authors draw on a theoretical conceptualization of brand extension success and present an approach to measure the monetary value of brand extension rights in the context of motion pictures (i.e., movie sequel rights) and to calculate the effect of variations of key extension product attributes, such as the continued participation of stars, on this value. Their measure incorporates both the forward spillover effect and the reciprocal spillover effect and accounts for differences between brand extensions and new original products in revenues and risk, thereby offering marketing scholars a novel approach for evaluating the riskiness of investment alternatives. With respect to the forward spillover effect of a parent brand on the extension product, the authors apply regression analysis to data from all 101 initial movie sequels released in North American theaters between 1998 and 2006 and to a matched subsample of original movies and calculate the risk-adjusted monetary brand extension value by comparing success predictions for both sequels and matched original movies. Regarding the reciprocal spillover effect by which the extension product affects the success of the parent brand, the authors use longitudinal data of parent-brand DVD sales to monetize the risk-adjusted impact of the brand extension on the parent. The usefulness of their approach is illustrated by calculating the monetary brand extension value for an actual movie title.

Title: When Customer Love Turns into Lasting Hate:The Effects of Relationship Strength and Time on Customer Revenge and Avoidance
Author-Name: Yany Grégoire,

Author-Name: Renaud Legoux
Abstract: This article explores the effects of time and relationship strength on the evolution of customer revenge and avoidance in online public complaining contexts. First, the authors examine whether online complainers hold a grudge—in terms of revenge and avoidance desires—over time. They find that time affects the two desires differently: Although revenge decreases over time, avoidance increases over time, indicating that customers indeed hold a grudge. Second, the authors examine the moderation effect of a strong relationship on how customers hold this grudge. They find that firms' best customers have the longest unfavorable reactions (i.e., a longitudinal love-becomes-hate effect). Specifically, over time, the revenge of strong-relationship customers decreases more slowly and their avoidance increases more rapidly than that of weak-relationship customers. Third, the authors explore a solution to attenuate this damaging effect—namely, the firm offering an apology and compensation after the online complaint. Overall, they find that strong-relationship customers are more amenable to any level of recovery attempt. The authors test the first two issues with a longitudinal survey and the third issue with a follow-up experiment.

Title: Customer Satisfaction and Stock Returns Risk
Author-Name: Kapil R. Tuli, 
Author-Name: Sundar G. Bharadwaj
Abstract: Over the past decade, several studies have argued that customer satisfaction has high relevance for financial markets because it has a significant impact on stock returns. However, little attention has been given to understanding the impact of customer satisfaction on the risk of stock returns. The finance literature suggests that investors that judge performance only in terms of returns place more resources than warranted in risky opportunities, forgo profitable opportunities, and apply misguided performance evaluations. Accordingly, this study develops, tests, and finds empirical support for the hypotheses that positive changes (i.e., improvement) in customer satisfaction result in negative changes (i.e., reduction) in overall and downside systematic and idiosyncratic risk. Using a panel data sample of publicly traded U.S. firms and satisfaction data from the American Customer Satisfaction Index, the study demonstrates that investments in customer satisfaction insulate a firm's stock returns from market movements (overall and downside systematic risk) and lower the volatility of its stock returns (overall and downside idiosyncratic risk). The results are robust to alternative measures of risk, model specifications, and concerns related to sample composition criteria raised in some recent studies. Therefore, the results indicate that customer satisfaction is a metric that provides valuable information to financial markets. The robust impact of customer satisfaction on stock returns risk indicates that it would be useful for firms to disclose their customer satisfaction scores in their annual report to shareholders.

Title: The Debate over Doing Good: Corporate Social Performance, Strategic Marketing Levers, and Firm-Idiosyncratic Risk
Author-Name: Xueming Luo, 
Author-Name: C.B. Bhattacharya
Abstract: Marketers and investors face a heated, provocative debate over whether excelling in social responsibility initiatives hurts or benefits firms financially. This study develops a theoretical framework that predicts (1) the impact of corporate social performance (CSP) on firm-idiosyncratic risk and (2) the role of two strategic marketing levers, advertising and research and development (R&D), in explaining the variability of this impact among different firms. The results show that higher CSP lowers undesirable firm-idiosyncratic risk. Notably, although the salutary impact of CSP is greater in firms with higher (versus lower) advertising, a simultaneous pursuit for CSP, advertising, and R&D is harmful with increased firm-idiosyncratic risk. For theory, the authors advance the literature on the marketing–finance interface by drawing attention to the risk-reduction potential of CSP and by shedding new light on some critical but neglected roles of strategic marketing levers. They also extend CSP research by moving away from the long-fought battle for a universal CSP impact and toward a finer-grained understanding of when some firms derive more risk-reduction benefits from CSP. For practice, the results indicate that the “goodwill refund” of CSP is not unconditional. They also empower marketers to communicate more effectively with investors (i.e., doing good to better manage the risk surrounding firm stock prices).

Title: Does a Firm's Product-Recall Strategy Affect Its Financial Value? An Examination of Strategic Alternatives During Product-Harm Crises
Author-Name: Yubo Chen, 
Author-Name: Shankar Ganesan, 
Author-Name: Yong Liu
Abstract: Product-harm crises often result in product recalls, which can have a significant impact on a firm's reputation, sales, and financial value. In managing the recall process, some firms adopt a proactive strategy in responding to consumer complaints, while others are more passive. In this study, the authors examine the impact of these strategic alternatives on firm value using Consumer Product Safety Commission recalls during a 12-year period from 1996 to 2007. Using the event study method, the authors show that regardless of firm and product characteristics, proactive strategies have a more negative effect on firm value than more passive strategies. An explanation for this surprising result is that the stock market interprets proactive strategies as a signal of substantial financial losses to the firm. When a firm proactively manages a product recall, the stock market infers that the consequence of the product-harm crisis is sufficiently severe that the firm had no choice but to act swiftly to reduce potential financial losses. Therefore, firms dealing with product recalls must be sensitive to how investors might interpret a proactive strategy and be aware of its potential drawbacks.

Title: Regulatory Exposure of Deceptive Marketing and Its Impact on Firm Value
Author-Name: Martha Myslinski Tipton, 
Author-Name: Sundar G. Bharadwaj, 
Author-Name: Diana C. Robertson
Abstract: Research linking marketing to financial performance has predominantly focused on how marketing assets and actions add value. The authors argue that it is equally important to understand how marketing decisions can reduce firm value. Prior research has indicated that negative events vary greatly in their indirect costs to the firm. On the basis of established theory and in-depth interviews with practitioners, the authors identify a set of factors that can explain the heterogeneity in the magnitude of indirect costs associated with negative marketing-related events. Specifically, they address how the regulatory exposure of deceptive marketing, which carries no direct cost to the firm, affects shareholder value. Using an event study, the analysis shows that incidents of exposed deceptive marketing are associated with significant, negative abnormal returns amounting to a drop of 1%, which translates into a wealth loss of $86 million for the median-sized firm in the sample. In explaining the variation in magnitude of the impact between events, the authors find that, in general, event characteristics are more significant than firm and brand characteristics. When deception is highly egregious or directed at vulnerable populations, firm value is more negatively affected than when the potential to mislead and harm is not readily verifiable. Furthermore, when the cited product has substantial brand market share, the levels of egregiousness and target audience explain substantially more of the variation in event impact than when brand market share is low. The results are robust to alternative stock-portfolio-based measures of abnormal returns, model specification, heteroskedasticity, and examination of risk. The authors' framework and analysis have implications for Wall Street executives, Main Street managers, academic researchers, and public policy makers.

Abstract: This article relies on advertising and persuasive communications theories to uncover persistent variations in investor response to television stock recommendations targeting naive investors. The authors use an event study methodology to determine the size of the next-day abnormal market reaction to recommendations on Mad Money with Jim Cramer. Although viewers are actively looking for recommendations, the results show that any individual recommendation is still subject to many of the same communication challenges as traditional advertisements. A regression analysis finds that traditional advertising variables, such as message length, recency–primacy effects, information clutter, and source credibility, influence the size of the market reaction to a “buy” recommendation. The authors discuss implications for marketers, managers of public companies, and those interested in public policy aspects related to televised stock recommendations.

Title: Does Advertising Spending Influence Media Coverage of the Advertiser?
Author-Name: Diego Rinallo, 
Author-Name: Suman Basuroy
Abstract: Recent studies have shown that consumers' product choices are significantly influenced by media coverage and recommendations in various media outlets. Unlike advertising, consumers perceive these sources as neutral and more credible because they usually presume that editorial content and product coverage in newspapers and magazines are independent and free from advertisers' influence. In this article, the authors show how advertising activities of firms may influence media coverage to the firms' advantage. They analyze a recent (2002–2003) large data set comprising 291 fashion companies based in Italy and their advertising and product coverage data published in newspapers and magazines of 123 publishers from Italy, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Controlling for firm heterogeneity, endogeneity, and the simultaneity of advertising and coverage, the authors find that, overall, (1) there is evidence of a strong positive influence of advertising on coverage, (2) publishers that depend more on a specific industry for their advertising revenues are prone to a higher degree of influence from their corporate advertisers than others, (3) peer pressures from competing publishers affect coverage decisions, (4) larger and more innovative companies are at an advantage for obtaining coverage for their products, and (5) the effects of corporate advertising influence exist in both Europe and the United States. These findings raise concerns about the independence of editorial content and coverage of magazines.

Title: Consumer-Based Brand Equity and Firm Risk
Author-Name: Lopo L. Rego, 
Author-Name: Matthew T. Billett, 
Author-Name: Neil A. Morgan
Abstract: Investors and managers evaluate potential investments in terms of risk and return. Research has focused on linking marketing activities and resource deployments with returns but has largely neglected marketing's role in determining risk. Yet the theoretical literature asserts that investments in market-based assets, such as brands, should lead to reductions in firm risk. Adopting risk measures that are well established in the finance literature, the authors use credit ratings to capture debt-holder risk and the standard deviation of stock returns to measure equity-holder risk, which they then decompose into systematic and unsystematic equity risk. The authors examine the impact of consumer-based brand equity (CBBE) on firm risk using data covering 252 firms from EquiTrend, COMPUSTAT, and the Center for Research in Security Prices over the 2000–2006 period. They find that a firm's CBBE is associated with firm risk and explains variance in the risk measures beyond that explained by existing finance models (i.e., it has “risk relevance”). They also find that CBBE has a stronger role in predicting firm-specific unsystematic risk than systematic risk but that it also has a particularly strong role in protecting equity holders from downside systematic risk. The results have clear economic significance and suggest that managers should make brand management part of the firm's risk management strategy and protect or even increase CBBE investments during periods of economic uncertainty.

Title: The Impact of Customer Relationship Management Implementation on Cost and Profit Efficiencies: Evidence from the U.S. Commercial Banking Industry
Author-Name: Alexander Krasnikov, 
Author-Name: Satish Jayachandran, 
Author-Name: V. Kumar
Abstract: The impact of customer relationship management (CRM) implementation on firm performance is an issue of considerable debate. This study examines the impact of CRM implementation on two metrics of firm performance—operational (cost) efficiency and the ability of firms to generate profits (profit efficiency)—using a large sample of U.S. commercial banks. The authors use stochastic frontier analysis to estimate cost and profit efficiencies and employ hierarchical linear modeling to assess the effect of CRM implementation on cost and profit efficiencies. They find that CRM implementation is associated with a decline in cost efficiency but an increase in profit efficiency. A firm-level factor, CRM commitment, reduces the negative effect of CRM implementation on cost efficiency. The authors also find that two adoption-related factors, time of adoption and time since adoption, influence the relationship between CRM implementation and cost and profit efficiencies. Early adopters benefit less from CRM implementation than late adopters. However, time since adoption improves the performance of firms that implement CRM. By demonstrating the different ways CRM implementation influences cost and profit measures, the study provides valuable insights to CRM researchers and managers.

Title: Corporate Hypocrisy: Overcoming the Threat of Inconsistent Corporate Social Responsibility Perceptions
Author-Name: Tillmann Wagner, 
Author-Name: Richard J. Lutz, 
Author-Name: Barton A. Weitz
Abstract: Reports of firms' behaviors with regard to corporate social responsibility (CSR) are often contrary to their stated standards of social responsibility. This research examines the effects of communication strategies a firm can use to mitigate the impact of these inconsistencies on consumer perceptions of corporate hypocrisy and subsequent beliefs about the firm's social responsibility and attitudes toward the firm. Study 1 indicates that a proactive communication strategy (when the firm's CSR statements precede conflicting observed behavior) leads to higher levels of perceived hypocrisy than a reactive strategy (when the firm's CSR statements follow observed behavior). The inconsistent information in both scenarios increases perceptions of hypocrisy, such that CSR statements can actually be counterproductive. Study 1 also reveals how perceived hypocrisy damages consumers' attitudes toward firms by negatively affecting CSR beliefs and provides evidence for the mediating role of hypocrisy during information processing. Study 2 finds that varying CSR policy statement abstractness acts to reduce the hidden risk of proactive communication strategies and can improve the effectiveness of a reactive strategy. Study 3 reveals that an inoculation communication strategy reduces perceived hypocrisy and minimizes its negative consequences, regardless of whether the CSR strategy is proactive or reactive.

Title: Determinants of Pay Levels and Structures in Sales Organizations
Author-Name: Dominique Rouziès, 
Author-Name: Anne T. Coughlan, 
Author-Name: Erin Anderson, 
Author-Name: Dawn Iacobucci
Abstract: Two key issues in business-to-business (B2B) sales force management are (1) how much a given sales job should be compensated (pay level) and (2) how much of the compensation should be fixed versus variable (pay structure). The authors examine the paychecks drawn by people in more than 14,000 selling jobs and more than 4000 sales management jobs in five B2B industry sectors in five European countries. They show that pay levels and structures reflect an apparent balancing of two conflicting pressures: the economic imperative (to reward better performers by heightening pay dispersion) and the compensation differential compression resulting from high tax regimes. In particular, B2B firms appear to use variable pay as a way to lessen the salary differential compression impact of high tax regimes on salesperson motivation. Furthermore, similar to chief executive officers, sales managers can have an important multiplier effect that justifies paying them at increasing rates as job challenge rises.

Title: The Decline of Conceptual Articles and Implications for Knowledge Development
Author-Name: Manjit S. Yadav
Abstract: This article presents a framework for understanding and revitalizing the important role of conceptual articles in the development of knowledge in the marketing discipline. An analysis of 30 years (1978–2007) of publishing data from major marketing journals indicates that conceptual articles are declining, despite repeated calls for more emphasis on this form of scholarship. The sharpest decline has occurred in Journal of Marketing (JM), with much of the shift occurring over the past decade. Many substantive areas remain largely unexplored in conceptual articles. Over this 30-year period, conceptual articles published in JM have disproportionately more citations relative to their numbers, attesting to the importance of their role in knowledge development. Addressing the decline of conceptual articles and restoring their synergistic balance with other forms of scholarship will require concerted efforts on several interrelated fronts: the current generation of scholars; doctoral programs and students; journals, reviewers, and review process; and promotion, tenure, and incentive systems.

Title: Dynamic Effects Among Movie Ratings, Movie Revenues, and Viewer Satisfaction
Author-Name: Sangkil Moon, 
Author-Name: Paul K. Bergey, 
Author-Name: Dawn Iacobucci
Abstract: This research investigates how movie ratings from professional critics, amateur communities, and viewers themselves influence key movie performance measures (i.e., movie revenues and new movie ratings). Using movie-level data, the authors find that high early movie revenues enhance subsequent movie ratings. They also find that high advertising spending on movies supported by high ratings maximizes the movie's revenues. Furthermore, they empirically show that sequel movies tend to reap more revenues but receive lower ratings than originals. Using individual viewer–level data, this research highlights how viewers' own viewing and rating histories and movie communities' collective opinions explain viewer satisfaction. The authors find that various aspects of these ratings explain viewers' new movie ratings as a measure of viewer satisfaction, after controlling for movie characteristics. Furthermore, they find that viewers' movie experiences can cause them to become more critical in ratings over time. Finally, they find a U-shaped relationship between viewers' genre preferences and genre-specific movie ratings for heavy viewers.

Title: The Direct and Indirect Effects of Advertising Spending on Firm Value
Author-Name: Amit Joshi, 
Author-Name: Dominique M. Hanssens
Abstract: Marketing decision makers are increasingly aware of the importance of shareholder value maximization, which calls for an evaluation of the long-term effects of their actions on product-market response and investor response. However, the marketing literature to date has focused on the sales or profit response of marketing actions, and the goals of marketing have traditionally been formulated from a customer perspective. Recently, there have been a few studies of the long-term investor response to marketing actions. The current research investigates one important aspect of this impact, the long-term relationship between advertising spending and market capitalization. The authors hypothesize that advertising can have a direct effect on valuation (i.e., an effect beyond its indirect effect through sales revenue and profit response). The empirical results across two industries provide support for the hypothesis that advertising spending has a positive, long-term impact on own firms' market capitalization and may have a negative impact on the valuation of a competitor of comparable size. The authors quantify the magnitude of this investor response effect for and discuss its implications for further research.

Title: Is That Deal Worth My Time? The Interactive Effect of Relative and Referent Thinking on Willingness to Seek a Bargain
Author-Name: Ritesh Saini, 
Author-Name: Raghunath Singh Rao, 
Author-Name: Ashwani Monga
Abstract: Prior research on relative thinking has suggested that the willingness to seek a bargain depends not only on the absolute value of the bargain but also on the price of the product. For example, a discount of $10 seems more appealing on a product whose regular price is $20 than a product whose regular price is $60. By invoking the interactive role of consumers' reference prices, the authors delineate the specific conditions under which the same $10 discount can seem less appealing when the price is $20 than when it is $60. They present a formal model that simultaneously incorporates the effects of relative and referent thinking and yields novel predictions, which are supported in four laboratory experiments. Their results reveal that deviation from the reference price determines when relative thinking holds and when it gets reversed. Specifically, the relative-thinking effect holds when the actual price is the same as expected, it reverses when the actual price deviates from the expected price, but it emerges again when deviation from the expected price becomes extreme. The authors conclude with the theoretical and managerial implications of their findings for marketing activities, such as the allocation of sales promotion budgets.

Title: Ending a Price Promotion: Retracting It in One Step or Phasing It Out Gradually
Author-Name: Michael Tsiros, 
Author-Name: David M. Hardesty
Abstract: Using the literature on both pricing and regret, the authors develop a conceptual model of purchase likelihood and propose a pricing tactic that appears to have marketplace potential. Sellers currently using a hi–lo pricing tactic discount a product for a limited time and then raise the price back to its original level in one step. Here, the authors investigate whether sellers should return prices to their prepromotion levels all at once or in steps. They propose that sellers should consider an alternative tactic, labeled “steadily decreasing discounting” (SDD). This alternative tactic requires that the seller offer one or more additional discounts that are less than the prior discount before returning the product to its original price. Study 1 is a laboratory experiment that tests the proposed underlying mechanisms (future price expectations and anticipated inaction regret) influencing likelihood to buy. In Study 2, an additional laboratory experiment is undertaken to provide further empirical support in favor of the SDD tactic, to address alternative explanations for the findings, and to demonstrate that there are no negative perceptions associated with using SDD. Study 3 is a field experiment that assesses the effectiveness of SDD, and Study 4 examines scanner panel data to evaluate its generalizability.

Title: The Psychological Effects of Empowerment Strategies on Consumers' Product Demand
Author-Name: Christoph Fuchs, 
Author-Name: Emanuela Prandelli, 
Author-Name: Martin Schreier
Abstract: Companies have recently begun to use the Internet to integrate their customers more actively into various phases of the new product development process. One such strategy involves empowering customers to cooperate in selecting the product concepts to be marketed by the firm. In such scenarios, it is no longer the company but rather its customers who decide democratically which products should be produced. This article discusses the first set of empirical studies that highlight the important psychological consequences of this power shift. The results indicate that customers who are empowered to select the products to be marketed show stronger demand for the underlying products even though they are of identical quality in objective terms (and their subjective product evaluations are similar). This seemingly irrational finding can be observed because consumers develop a stronger feeling of psychological ownership of the products selected. The studies also identify two boundary conditions for this “empowerment–product demand” effect: It diminishes (1) if the outcome of the joint decision-making process does not reflect consumers' preferences and (2) if consumers do not believe that they have the relevant competence to make sound decisions.

Title: The Malleable Brand: The Role of Implicit Theories in Evaluating Brand Extensions
Author-Name: Eric A. Yorkston, 
Author-Name: Joseph C. Nunes, 
Author-Name: Shashi Matta
Abstract: This research documents how implicit theories regarding personality traits (whether they are deemed to be fixed or malleable) affect consumer inferences about the malleability of a brand's personality traits and, thus, its ability to extend into new categories. Study 1 documents that consumers who believe that traits are malleable (incremental theorists) are more accepting of brand extensions than consumers who believe that traits are fixed (entity theorists). These results hold whether implicit theories are measured or manipulated. Study 2 reveals how implicit theories affect consumers' perceptions regarding the flexibility of a brand's personality traits and not its physical traits. Study 3 demonstrates that consumers primed with different implicit theory orientations respond differently to varying degrees of change within a single trait. This study tests the limits of the effect and demonstrates the impact of using primes embedded within standard marketing communication.

Title: Salesperson Influence on Product Development: Insights from a Study of Small Manufacturing Organizations
Author-Name: Ashwin W. Joshi, 
Abstract: This research addresses three questions: (1) How do salespeople get their desired product modifications implemented within organizations? (2) What effect does salesperson trustworthiness have on the means they adopt to get product modifications implemented? and (3) What are the performance outcomes of the modified products? The results from a survey of 149 product managers in small manufacturing organizations suggest that two influence strategies—rationality and exchange—have a positive impact and that two influence strategies—coalition building and upward appeal—have an inverse impact on product modification implementation. The results also show that salesperson trustworthiness enhances the positive effects of rationality and exchange while mitigating the inverse effects of coalition building and upward appeal. Finally, the results show that product modification implementation has a positive effect on the product's performance in the marketplace. Collectively, the results suggest that salespeople should adopt the rationality and exchange strategies to get their desired product modifications implemented while also developing a reputation for trustworthiness and that it pays for organizations to listen to their salespeople.

Title: Megamarketing: The Creation of Markets as a Social Process
Author-Name: Ashlee Humphreys
Abstract: Drawing from institutional theory in sociology, this article theorizes the process of “megamarketing”—defined by Kotler (1986) as the use of strategic efforts by a firm or firms to gain the cooperation of multiple stakeholders—to understand how new industries are created and sustained in a complex social and political context. The author uses an analysis of the casino gambling industry to demonstrate the role of normative and regulatory structures in facilitating the adoption and eventual acceptance of an industry through the social process of legitimation. In a quantitative and qualitative content analysis of 7211 newspaper articles from 1980 to 2007, the author finds that frames such as crime, business, and regulation change over time and that these frames are used by multiple stakeholders to structure normative conceptions about the practice of casino gambling. These findings contribute to a theoretical understanding of market creation and development over time and provide marketing managers with the conceptual tools for megamarketing in any industry.

Title: Contract Specificity and Its Performance Implications
Author-Name: Erik A. Mooi, 
Author-Name: Mrinal Ghosh
Abstract: Governance theories, such as transaction cost economics, argue that systematic deviations from an attribute–governance alignment should influence performance. This article investigates the performance implications of contract specificity for the procurement of information technology products. The authors argue that parties choose a level of contract specificity that economizes on both the ex ante contracting costs and the ex post transaction costs and that deviations between the observed and the predicted levels of contract specificity are an important determinant of these transaction costs. The authors test the hypotheses using a comprehensive archival data set of information technology transactions and employ a two-step estimation procedure. First, they estimate the “predicted” level of contract specificity, which accounts for key transactional attributes. Second, they study the consequences of deviating from this predicted level of contractual specificity. The results provide the first explicit demonstration of the trade-off between ex ante contracting costs and ex post transaction problems and suggest that parties need to economize jointly on these costs when choosing the governance form.

Title: Does Exclusivity Always Pay Off? Exclusive Price Promotions and Consumer Response
Author-Name: Michael J. Barone, 
Author-Name: Tirthankar Roy
Abstract: Although customized price promotions are increasingly common in the marketplace, relatively little is known about how deal recipients evaluate them. The authors investigate the role of a promotional characteristic that has received little attention in the literature by examining whether consumers' responsiveness to a targeted discount is influenced by their perceptions of the deal's exclusivity (i.e., the degree to which the offer is available only to them or to other consumers as well). The results demonstrate that exclusive promotions may be viewed more, equally, or less favorably than inclusive offers, depending on several factors used in decisions about the delivery of targeted offers (e.g., customer demographics, transactional histories). Specifically, the authors find that exclusive deals are favored over inclusive offers (Study 1), a preference that is pronounced for consumers adopting independent self-construals (Study 2) and for male consumers with a history of purchasing from the marketer providing the offer (Study 3). These exclusivity effects are mediated by the ability of the promotional offer to allow consumers to engage in self-enhancement (Study 3).

Abstract: This article examines how product and consumer characteristics moderate the influence of online consumer reviews on product sales using data from the video game industry. The findings indicate that online reviews are more influential for less popular games and games whose players have greater Internet experience. The article shows differential impact of consumer reviews across products in the same product category and suggests that firms' online marketing strategies should be contingent on product and consumer characteristics. The authors discuss the implications of these results in light of the increased share of niche products in recent years.

Abstract: This study represents the first empirical examination of the “Rule of Three,” a theory at odds with several popular notions regarding industry structure and business performance, including the positive linear market share–performance relationship. In general, the findings from more than 160 industries support the Rule of Three and provide five main insights: First, there appears to be a prevalent competitive structure for mature industries in which three “generalist” firms control the market. Second, industries that conform to this structure tend to perform better than industries with a fewer or greater number of generalists. Third, both “specialists” and generalists outperform firms that are “stuck in the middle.” Fourth, the performance benefits of market leadership appear to diminish with excessive market share. Fifth, the Rule of Three industry structure and its influence over firm profitability do not appear to be priced appropriately by financial markets. The authors discuss the implications for multiple stakeholders.

Title: Don't Think Twice, It's All Right: Music Piracy and Pricing in a DRM-Free Environment
Author-Name: Rajiv K. Sinha, 
Author-Name: Fernando S. Machado, 
Author-Name: Collin Sellman
Abstract: The music industry has widely viewed digital rights management (DRM) as an effective strategy for reducing digital piracy. Digital rights management systems aim to prevent unauthorized copying and to reduce the overall rate of piracy. Therefore, the recent move toward offering DRM-free music by some major online music sellers appears paradoxical. In this article, the authors propose a model that conceptualizes and estimates the concept of hardcore piracy in an attempt to resolve this apparent paradox. Based on two large empirical studies and a validation exercise with a large sample of more 2000 college students, the model results indicate that the music industry can benefit from removing DRM because such a strategy has the potential to convert some pirates into paying consumers. In addition, a DRM-free environment enhances both consumer and producer welfare by increasing the demand for legitimate products as well as consumers' willingness to pay for these products. The authors find that producers could benefit by lowering prices from currently observed levels. The article concludes with a discussion of the practical implications of the findings for managers within the music industry.

Title: Customer Reactions to Service Separation
Author-Name: Hean Tat Keh, 
Author-Name: Jun Pang
Abstract: Recent research suggests that inseparability is not a universal distinguishing characteristic of services and that the consumption of many services is or can be separated from their production. This research defines service separation as customers' absence from service production, which denotes the spatial separation between service production and consumption. In a series of qualitative and quantitative studies across different services, the authors examine customer reactions to service separation. The results indicate that service separation increases customers' perceptions of not only access convenience and benefit convenience but also performance risk and psychological risk. Furthermore, these effects differ across services. Specifically, relative to experience services, for credence services, the effects of separation on service convenience are mitigated, and the effects on perceived risk are magnified. Subsequently, the convenience and risk perceptions induced by service separation can influence customers' purchase decisions and postexperience evaluations. Customers prefer separation for experience services and when they have an established relationship with the service provider. Finally, the authors discuss the theoretical contributions and managerial implications and offer directions for further research.

Author-Name: Sarah J.S. Wilner
Abstract: Word-of-mouth (WOM) marketing—firms' intentional influencing of consumer-to-consumer communications—is an increasingly important technique. Reviewing and synthesizing extant WOM theory, this article shows how marketers employing social media marketing methods face a situation of networked coproduction of narratives. It then presents a study of a marketing campaign in which mobile phones were seeded with prominent bloggers. Eighty-three blogs were followed for six months. The findings indicate that this network of communications offers four social media communication strategies—evaluation, embracing, endorsement, and explanation. Each is influenced by character narrative, communications forum, communal norms, and the nature of the marketing promotion. This new narrative model shows that communal WOM does not simply increase or amplify marketing messages; rather, marketing messages and meanings are systematically altered in the process of embedding them. The theory has definite, pragmatic implications for how marketers should plan, target, and leverage WOM and how scholars should understand WOM in a networked world.

Abstract: Although almost one in three U.S. households shops on a budget, it remains unclear whether and how shoppers track their in-store spending to stay within those budgets. A field study and two laboratory studies offer four key generalizations about budget shoppers in grocery stores: (1) They predominantly use mental computation strategies to track their in-store spending, (2) they adapt their mental computation strategy to the dominant range of price endings of items in their shopping baskets, (3) those who try to calculate the exact total price of their basket are less accurate than those who estimate the approximate price, and (4) motivated shoppers are less accurate than less motivated shoppers (because they tend to calculate rather than estimate the total basket price). A second field study demonstrates that shoppers who underestimate the total price of their basket are more likely to overspend, leading to negative store satisfaction.

Title: Exchanges in Marketing Systems: The Case of Subsistence Consumer–Merchants in Chennai, India
Author-Name: Madhu Viswanathan, 
Author-Name: José Antonio Rosa, 
Author-Name: Julie A. Ruth
Abstract: A qualitative study of subsistence consumer–merchants (SCMs) in Chennai, India, reveals that they sustain relationships in three interdependent relationship domains: vendor, customer, and family. Relying on long interview data, the authors interpret the subsystems as closed-loop and self-sustaining relationships. Subsystems are managed by SCMs through buying and selling activities alongside the receiving and granting of credit, and these activities engender three facets of commitment: continuance, affective, and normative. Different facets of commitment underlie the relationships in the three subsystems. Through different role-based activities, SCMs enhance or diminish commitment levels to keep all three types of relationships viable while moving their scarce time, energy, and financial resources into the domain with the greatest need. Activities and the management of commitment are performed within 24-hour business cycles, with negligible resources, and in highly unstable environments, providing valuable theoretical insights and managerial implications that guide recommendations for firms wanting to serve subsistence markets successfully.

Abstract: Fueled by digital distribution, unbundling is prevalent in many information and entertainment industries. What is the effect of this unbundling on sales, and what bundle characteristics drive this effect? The author empirically examines these questions in the context of the music industry, using data on weekly digital-track, digital-album, and physical-album sales from January 2005 to April 2007 for all titles released by a sample of more than 200 artists. The modeling framework, a system of an “album-sales” and a “song-sales” equation estimated with the seemingly unrelated regression method, explicitly accounts for the interaction between sales for the bundle and its components. The findings reveal that revenues decrease significantly as digital downloading becomes more prevalent, but the number of items included in a bundle (a measure of its “objective” value) is not a significant moderator of this effect. Instead, bundles with items that are more equal in their appeal and bundles offered by producers with a strong reputation suffer less from the negative impact of the shift to mixed bundling in online channels.

Title: Predictors of the Gap Between Program and Commercial Audiences: An Investigation Using Live Tuning Data
Author-Name: David A. Schweidel, 
Author-Name: Robert J. Kent
Abstract: Audience measures serve as the basis on which billions of dollars of television advertising are purchased each year. However, these measures often fall short of providing marketers and media planners with information about the size of the audience that has the opportunity to see advertisements during commercial breaks. Although program audience measures remain relevant for product placement, the size of the gap between the audience potentially exposed to programming and the audience exposed to commercial breaks has implications for advertisers and networks, affecting decisions such as program selection and ad pricing. The authors use a full television season of live tuning data to study variation across programs in the size of the program audience and the size of the gap between the potential program audiences and the potential commercial audiences, which is found to exceed 20% of the program audience in some cases. Across program genres, the authors find that dramas have increased program popularity and reduced ad avoidance, whereas reality television experiences increased ad avoidance. The analysis reveals the importance of incorporating show-specific random effects because their omission can result in spurious attribution of differences in ad avoidance and program popularity to genre. The authors discuss the implications for networks and advertisers.

Title: Spending on the Fly: Mental Budgets, Promotions, and Spending Behavior
Author-Name: Karen M. Stilley, 
Author-Name: J. Jeffrey Inman, 
Author-Name: Kirk L. Wakefield
Abstract: Recent research has suggested that consumers have in-store slack for grocery trips—that is, they leave room in their mental budgets to make unplanned purchases. Drawing on this work, this article examines how the impact of promotions depends on whether the shopper still has in-store slack remaining in his or her mental budget. Specifically, the authors evaluate how the effect of promotional savings for both planned and unplanned items on spending varies as a function of whether the item is purchased before or after the shopper's in-store slack is depleted. In addition, they examine how these relationships vary depending on income. To achieve these goals, the authors conducted a field study in which respondents used a handheld scanner to record the order of purchases. The results suggest that savings on planned items lead to stockpiling by higher-income shoppers when the savings occur before the in-store slack has been depleted but lead to increased purchase of unplanned items when they occur after in-store slack is depleted. The results also show that promotions on unplanned grocery items generate incremental spending at the basket level, which increases with income but only when the item is purchased after the in-store slack is exceeded. The authors discuss implications for shopper marketing strategies.

Title: Is Customer Participation in Value Creation a Double-Edged Sword? Evidence from Professional Financial Services Across Cultures
Author-Name: Kimmy Wa Chan,

Author-Name: Simon S.K. Lam
Abstract: Emergent perspectives in marketing highlight new opportunities for co-opting customers as a means to define and cocreate value through their participation. This study delineates and empirically tests hypotheses regarding the effects of customer participation (CP) on value creation and satisfaction for both customers and employees with different cultural value orientations in the context of professional financial services. Using data collected from 349 pairs of customers and service employees in two national groups (Hong Kong and the United States) of a global financial institution, this study examines how (1) CP drives performance outcomes (i.e., customer satisfaction, employee job satisfaction, and employee job performance) through the creation of economic and relational values and (2) the effects of CP on value creation depend on participants' cultural value orientations. Promoting CP could be a double-edged sword for firms: CP enhances customers' economic value attainment and strengthens the relational bond between customers and employees, but it also increases employees' job stress and hampers their job satisfaction. Moreover, the effects of CP on value creation depend on the cultural values of both customers and service employees; this result implies that arranging customers and service employees with “matched” cultural value orientations could facilitate the creation of value through CP.

Title: Why Are Some Salespeople Better at Adapting to Organizational Change?
Author-Name: Michael Ahearne, 
Author-Name: Son K. Lam, 
Author-Name: John E. Mathieu, 
Author-Name: Willy Bolander
Abstract: This study empirically examines the longitudinal influences of salesperson goal orientations on performance trajectories during a planned change intervention that requires learning to answer two questions. First, what is the functional form of salespeople's performance trajectories during a period of change implementation? Second, why are some salespeople better at adapting to change than others? Polynomial growth models show that the average salesperson performance trajectory displays an initial decline, gradual recovery, and eventual restabilization. Salesperson learning orientation is related positively to larger initial declines, steeper recovery slopes, and higher restabilization levels. In contrast, performance orientation is related positively to smaller initial declines, but shallower recovery slopes and lower restabilization levels. The results suggest that successful implementation of planned change interventions largely depends on identifying and appreciating the heterogeneity of individual traits that share meaning with the change. The study has implications on what sales managers should expect in terms of performance losses and gains during change and how managers can predict which salespeople will reap the largest performance benefits from a change intervention.

Title: What Makes Brands Elastic? The Influence of Brand Concept and Styles of Thinking on Brand Extension Evaluation
Author-Name: Alokparna Basu Monga, 
Author-Name: Deborah Roedder John
Abstract: Why are some brands more elastic than others? Prior research shows that consumers are more accepting of extensions into distant product categories for brands with prestige concepts (Rolex) than for brands with functional concepts (Timex). In this article, the authors examine consumers' style of thinking—analytic versus holistic thinking—to better understand the elasticity of prestige versus functional brands. For functional brands, the authors find that holistic thinkers provide more favorable responses to distant extensions than analytic thinkers; however, for prestige brands, holistic and analytic thinkers respond equally favorably. Thus, analytic thinkers are identified as the roadblocks for functional brands launching distant brand extensions. To meet this challenge, the authors offer several strategies, including (1) using a subbrand (Excer wallets by Toyota) instead of a direct brand (Toyota wallets) to reduce analytic thinking; (2) using elaborational communications, which address potentially problematic features of the extension, to reduce analytic thinking; and (3) matching extension information with the consumer's style of thinking, which increases the persuasiveness of ad messages.

Title: Marketing Healthful Eating to Children: The Effectiveness of Incentives, Pledges, and Competitions
Author-Name: Sekar Raju, 
Author-Name: Priyali Rajagopal, 
Author-Name: Timothy J. Gilbride
Abstract: This research examines how school administrators can motivate children to make more healthful food choices using incentives, pledges, and competitions as interventions. A six-month field study was conducted across 55 elementary and middle schools, and the authors analyzed the data using a two-level Bayesian hierarchical linear model. All three interventions increased the choice of fruits and vegetables (the proportion of children choosing additional servings increased 3 to 24 percentage points) ten weeks after the interventions ended. However, younger (Grades 1 and 2) and older (Grades 3–8) children responded differently to the interventions. Although both younger and older children responded more favorably to the competition intervention than to the pledge or incentive interventions, the effects of the competition and incentive interventions were more pronounced among the younger children. A second field study, also with schoolchildren, examined the role of pledge reminders on adherence to the pledge. The presence of a visible reminder of a pledge resulted in significantly better outcomes than no reminder of a pledge.

Title: Survival in Markets with Network Effects: Product Compatibility and Order-of-Entry Effects
Author-Name: Qi Wang, 
Author-Name: Yubo Chen, 
Author-Name: Jinhong Xie
Abstract: This article proposes a new conceptual framework in which the impact of network effects (NE) on a pioneer's survival advantage compared with its early followers can be positive or negative depending on two important but previously ignored market characteristics: (1) cross-generation product compatibility and (2) within-generation product compatibility. The authors empirically test the theoretical predictions using data from 45 NE markets. They show that these two types of compatibility affect the pioneer's survival advantage in opposite directions and that such directions are reversed when NE changes from extremely strong to extremely weak. Specifically, in markets with strong NE, cross-generation incompatibility harms but within-generation incompatibility favors the pioneer's survival advantage. Consequently, pioneers are likely to enjoy a survival advantage when their product is cross-generation compatible but within-generation incompatible. However, in markets with weak NE, pioneer survival advantage is likely to occur under opposite conditions (i.e., cross-generation incompatible but within-generation compatible). The policy analysis further suggests that the best survival condition for pioneers often turns out to be the worst for followers in these markets.

Title: To Bundle or Not to Bundle: Determinants of the Profitability of Multi-Item Auctions
Author-Name: Peter T.L. Popkowski Leszczyc, 
Author-Name: Gerald Häubl
Abstract: This article introduces and empirically tests a conceptual model of the key determinants of the profitability of bundling in auction markets.The model encapsulates hypotheses about how seller revenue from the combined (i.e., bundle) auction of component products relative to that from separate auctions of the components is influenced by the heterogeneity in bidders' product valuations, the degree of complementarity between component products, the particular multi-item selling strategy, and the outside availability of the products. The results of three field experiments show that though bundle auctions tend to be less profitable for noncomplementary and substitute products, they are on average 50% more profitable than separate auctions when there is (even only moderate) complementarity between the component products. The latter effect is greater when the bundle and the separate components are offered at different times, and it is more pronounced for services than for tangible goods. The findings also identify conditions under which each of the essential multi-item selling strategies for fixed-price settings (pure components, pure bundling, and mixed bundling) tends to maximize seller revenue in auctions.

Title: Signaling Status with Luxury Goods: The Role of Brand Prominence
Author-Name: Young Jee Han, 
Author-Name: Joseph C. Nunes, 
Author-Name: Xavier Drèze
Abstract: This research introduces “brand prominence,” a construct reflecting the conspicuousness of a brand's mark or logo on a product. The authors propose a taxonomy that assigns consumers to one of four groups according to their wealth and need for status, and they demonstrate how each group's preference for conspicuously or inconspicuously branded luxury goods corresponds predictably with their desire to associate or dissociate with members of their own and other groups. Wealthy consumers low in need for status want to associate with their own kind and pay a premium for quiet goods only they can recognize. Wealthy consumers high in need for status use loud luxury goods to signal to the less affluent that they are not one of them. Those who are high in need for status but cannot afford true luxury use loud counterfeits to emulate those they recognize to be wealthy. Field experiments along with analysis of market data (including counterfeits) support the proposed model of status signaling using brand prominence.

Title: Consumer Response to Drug Risk Information:The Role of Positive Affect
Author-Name: Anthony D. Cox, 
Author-Name: Dena Cox, 
Author-Name: Susan Powell Mantel
Abstract: Risk disclosure is an essential element of the marketing of prescription drugs and other medical products. This study examines how consumers respond to verbal information about the frequency and severity of medical-product risks and how media-induced affect can moderate such responses. The study finds that consumers tend to overestimate the actual likelihood of adverse events described with words such as “common” or “rare” (compared with the probabilities such terms are typically intended to convey) and that consumers tend to give little weight to such probability language when forming product use intentions. However, consumers in positive media-induced moods seem to engage in more nuanced evaluation of product risk information, weighing both frequency and severity information and using such information to make inferences about other product attributes (e.g., product efficacy). These findings suggest that medical marketers and regulators need to devise more effective means of communicating risk probability to consumers and that positive mood induction (e.g., by placing advertisements in upbeat media environments) can enhance consumers' ability to process product risk information.

Title: Governance Mechanisms in Business-to-Business Electronic Markets
Author-Name: Rajdeep Grewal, 
Author-Name: Anindita Chakravarty, 
Author-Name: Amit Saini
Abstract: Rather than relying on traditional relational exchanges, recent technological advances have made it feasible for firms to undertake market-based transactions through information technology–mediated electronic markets. The success of such business-to-business electronic markets depends on the governance practices of the market maker—that is, the firm that manages and administers the electronic market.Market makers use three governance mechanisms to manage electronic markets: (1) monitoring the market participants (i.e., buyers and sellers that participate in the market), (2) building a sense of community among market participants to instill mutual respect and trust, and (3) self-participating in the electronic market to build know-how about how the market functions. Building on transaction cost analysis theory, the authors suggest that the influence of these governance mechanisms on electronic market performance (i.e., meeting strategic and financial objectives) depends on behavioral and external uncertainty in the market. Survey data from market makers show that (1) monitoring is effective for reputed market makers and when demand uncertainty is high, (2) community building is beneficial when pricing is static rather than dynamic, and (3) self-participation is useful when the market maker is well reputed and when the market relies on dynamic pricing.

Title: The Service Models of Frontline Employees
Author-Name: Rita Di Mascio
Abstract: Service literature has implicitly assumed that frontline employees (FLEs) share a common understanding of the term “customer service.” Perhaps because of this assumption, differences in FLE attitudes, behaviors, and performance have been ascribed to organizational characteristics, social environment, job characteristics, or personality. This article shows that FLEs' interpretations of customer service also matter. Using qualitative and quantitative data, this study finds that three distinct interpretations of customer service, or service models, exist among retail FLEs: (1) the act of giving customers what they ask for, efficiently and courteously; (2) a means to accomplishing immediate objectives, such as sales quotas; and (3) the formation of mutually beneficial relationships with customers through problem solving. Service models are related to FLEs' customer orientation, competence, surface and deep acting, and interpersonal values. The findings indicate that differences in FLEs' attitudes, behaviors, and performance can arise from their keeping of different service models; illuminate individual-level beliefs underlying service typologies, such as goods- and service-dominant logic; and suggest that FLE recruitment and training should take service models into account.

Title: Energizing the Reseller's Sales Force:The Power of Brand Identification
Author-Name: Douglas E. Hughes, 
Author-Name: Michael Ahearne
Abstract: A manufacturer's success in the marketplace is contingent in part on its ability to energize its downstream channel members in support of its brands. Gaining the focused effort of the reseller's sales personnel is particularly important, and this has become increasingly challenging as resellers broaden their brand portfolios in the wake of industry consolidation. This study reveals a motivating influence that can potentially be harnessed by both manufacturer and channel member: identification. Using a multilevel analysis, the authors explore the sometimes conflicting impact of salesperson brand identification, salesperson organizational identification, and manufacturer–channel member control system alignment on brand and channel member sales performance. The authors also examine favorable extra-role consequences of salesperson brand identification. The results show that while organizational identification strengthens salesperson adherence to controls, brand identification can increase salesperson effort behind a specific brand, and ultimately improved brand performance, even in the face of control systems to the contrary. This suggests that suppliers can exercise influence over the reseller's sales force by strengthening the psychological connection between their brands and reseller sales personnel.

Abstract: Recent research has demonstrated that linguistic characteristics of brand names can cognitively affect product evaluations. In six experiments, the authors demonstrate that affect arising from sound repetition may also be influential. The results reveal across multiple brand names and product categories that exposure to a brand name that has sound repetition in its phonetic structure and is spoken aloud produces positive affect, which favorably affects consumers' brand evaluations, reactions to cross-selling, and product choice. The effects are moderated by consumers' sensitivity to repetition, consumers' opportunity to experience emotions, and the degree to which the brand name's phonetic sound repetition deviates from linguistic expectations. The authors discuss implications for managers and avenues for further research.

Title: Driving Profitability by Encouraging Customer Referrals: Who, When, and How
Author-Name: V. Kumar,

Author-Name: Robert P. Leone
Abstract: Many firms are now using referral marketing campaigns to harness the power of word of mouth and to increase referrals to acquire new customers. Prior research has identified a method of computing the value of referrals using only a customer's actual past referral behavior to compute customer referral value (CRV). In this article, the authors develop and test a new four-step approach to compute CRV. In addition, they determine the behavioral drivers of CRV and then identify the most effective methods of targeting the most promising customers on the basis of their customer lifetime value (CLV) and CRV scores. The authors illustrate and test this approach through four separate field experiments with firms from two industries: financial services and retailing. They find that to maximize profitability, it is critical to manage customers in terms of both their CLV and CRV scores and that understanding the behavioral drivers of CRV can help managers better target the most profitable customers with their referral marketing campaigns.

Title: Why Do Older Consumers Buy Older Brands? The Role of Attachment and Declining Innovativeness
Author-Name: Raphaëlle Lambert-Pandraud, 
Author-Name: Gilles Laurent
Abstract: The authors compare three mechanisms that may explain why older consumers tend to prefer older brands. Data are from the French perfume market, in which some market leaders are decades old while hundreds of new entrants launch yearly. The authors reveal monotonically increasing differences across age ranges. Younger consumers have a greater propensity to change their preferred brand, a form of innovativeness that benefits relatively recent entrants, whereas older consumers exhibit a propensity to remain attached for a longer duration to the same preferred brand. Nostalgia for options encountered during an early “formative period” has only a limited impact. Furthermore, strong heterogeneity emerges: At all ages, some consumers frequently change their preferred brand, whereas others remain attached to it for long periods. It is the proportion of these two behaviors that varies across age ranges. The resultant managerial implications indicate that mature consumers are attractive targets because they likely remain attached to a brand longer, that long-established products may still attract new consumers, and that the success of a new brand among young consumers may be ephemeral.

Author-Name: Michael G. Luchs,

Author-Name: Rajagopal Raghunathan
Abstract: Manufacturers are increasingly producing and promoting sustainable products (i.e., products that have a positive social and/or environmental impact). However, relatively little is known about how product sustainability affects consumers' preferences. The authors propose that sustainability may not always be an asset, even if most consumers care about social and environmental issues. The degree to which sustainability enhances preference depends on the type of benefit consumers most value for the product category in question. In this research, the authors demonstrate that consumers associate higher product ethicality with gentleness-related attributes and lower product ethicality with strength-related attributes. As a consequence of these associations, the positive effect of product sustainability on consumer preferences is reduced when strength-related attributes are valued, sometimes even resulting in preferences for less sustainable product alternatives (i.e., the “sustainability liability”). Conversely, when gentleness-related attributes are valued, sustainability enhances preference. In addition, the authors show that the potential negative impact of sustainability on product preferences can be attenuated using explicit cues about product strength.

Title: Managing Distributors' Changing Motivations over the Course of a Joint Sales Program
Author-Name: Flora F. Gu, 
Author-Name: Namwoon Kim,

Author-Name: Danny T. Wang
Abstract: Ensuring joint program participation by distributors is essential to channel management. Although studies confirm that firms can promote distributor participation by attending to their participation motivations, the authors argue that distributors may change their motivations over the course of a joint program, driven by an increase of program-related information and how their peer distributors behave. Drawing insights from the information asymmetry literature, the authors postulate that distributors' ex ante commitment is driven by their motivation to avoid losses, and after they participate, their ex post adaptation reflects rent-seeking motivations. This study also examines how the participation of peer distributors operates as an information signal that moderates the motivation–participation link for the focal distributor. In the context of an actual sales program, this study confirms the postulate of motivation shift and the salience of network-based information in distributors' program participation. The results show that a manufacturer needs to manage its distributors' participation in a discriminant, process-oriented, and system-sensitive manner by addressing the latter's diverse motivations, changing goals in the joint program, and influences from peer distributors.

Title: The Stopping Power of Advertising: Measures and Effects of Visual Complexity
Author-Name: Rik Pieters, 
Author-Name: Michel Wedel, 
Author-Name: Rajeev Batra
Abstract: Advertising needs to capture consumers' attention in likable ways, and the visual complexity of advertising plays a central role in this regard. Yet ideas about visual complexity effects conflict, and objective measures of complexity are rare. The authors distinguish two types of visual complexity, differentiate them from the difficulty of comprehending advertising, and propose objective measures for each. Advertisements are visually complex when they contain dense perceptual features (“feature complexity”) and/or when they have an elaborate creative design (“design complexity”). An analysis of 249 advertisements that were tested with eye-tracking shows that, as the authors hypothesize, feature complexity hurts attention to the brand and attitude toward the ad, whereas design complexity helps attention to both the pictorial and the advertisement as a whole, its comprehensibility, and attitude toward the ad. This is important because design complexity is under direct control of the advertiser. The proposed measures can be readily adopted to assess the visual complexity of advertising, and the findings can be used to improve the stopping power of advertisements.

Title: The Diffusion of Market Orientation Throughout the Organization: A Social Learning Theory Perspective
Author-Name: Son K. Lam, 
Author-Name: Florian Kraus, 
Author-Name: Michael Ahearne
Abstract: This study examines the diffusion of market orientation (MO) as a social learning process to acquire and transfer individual-level MO. Central to the diffusion are important work-group members, or envoys. Through their market-oriented action, top managers serve as market-oriented role models to two important types of observers in work groups—formal middle managers and work-group expert peers. In turn, these observers become top managers' envoys and role models of market-oriented behavior to frontline employees. Empirical results from a three-level data set from a Fortune 500 company support this perspective. While envoys who are neither market oriented nor identified with the firm are the least effective, envoys who are not market oriented but are strongly identified with the firm are also detrimental. Network size hinders the informal route of learning through expert peers but not the formal route through middle managers. By identifying who the important work-group envoys are and under what conditions certain envoys are likely to be most effective, this study helps managers select the best envoys to implement MO.

Title: Sales, Marketing, and Research-and-Development Cooperation Across New Product Development Stages: Implications for Success
Author-Name: Holger Ernst,

Abstract: Prior research has identified the integration of marketing with research and development (R&D) as a key success factor for new product development (NPD). However, prior work has not distinguished the sales and marketing functions, even though they are distinctive departments within an organization. Therefore, the authors extend prior research and examine the effect of cross-functional cooperation among sales, marketing, and R&D on NPD performance across multiple stages of the NPD process. The authors use multiple-informant data from 424 sales, marketing, and R&D managers as well as project leaders of 106 NPD projects to test several hypotheses. The results show that the cooperation between sales and R&D and between sales and marketing has a significant, positive effect on overall NPD project performance beyond marketing–R&D cooperation. The authors also find that the effect of cross-functional cooperation among sales, marketing, and R&D on overall NPD project performance varies across stages of the NPD process. More specifically, the authors find that sales–R&D cooperation in the concept and product development stages is critical for greater new product success. Sales–marketing cooperation is important in the concept development stage but has surprisingly less impact in the implementation stage.

Title: How Salary Receipt Affects Consumers' Regulatory Motivations and Product Preferences
Author-Name: Himanshu Mishra, 
Author-Name: Arul Mishra, 
Author-Name: Dhananjay Nayakankuppam
Abstract: In this article, the authors find that consumers' preferences change as a function of their temporal distance from the receipt of their last salary. The authors propose and test that when consumers have just received their salary (“the near-salary condition”), they exhibit promotion motivations in their product preferences. However, they exhibit prevention motivations in their product preferences when significant time has elapsed since their last salary receipt (“the far-from-salary condition”). The authors collected data from two longitudinal studies to validate these findings and to test the underlying process. Using actual purchase behavior and collecting product preference during a one-month period, the authors show that consumers' product preferences change in response to temporal distance from their last salary receipt. The findings suggest to managers that the best time to promote products or messages with a promotion appeal is near to consumers' last salary receipt and that the best time to promote products or messages with a prevention appeal is far from consumers' last salary receipt.

Title: Brand Attachment and Brand Attitude Strength: Conceptual and Empirical Differentiation of Two Critical Brand Equity Drivers

Abstract: Research has not verified the theoretical or practical value of the brand attachment construct in relation to alternative constructs, particularly brand attitude strength. The authors make conceptual, measurement, and managerial contributions to this research issue. Conceptually, they define brand attachment, articulate its defining properties, and differentiate it from brand attitude strength. From a measurement perspective, they develop and validate a parsimonious measure of brand attachment, test the assumptions that underlie it, and demonstrate that it indicates the concept of attachment. They also demonstrate the convergent and discriminant validity of this measure in relation to brand attitude strength. Managerially, they demonstrate that brand attachment offers value over brand attitude strength in predicting (1) consumers' intentions to perform difficult behaviors (those they regard as using consumer resources), (2) actual purchase behaviors, (3) brand purchase share (the share of a brand among directly competing brands), and (4) need share (the extent to which consumers rely on a brand to address relevant needs, including those brands in substitutable product categories).

Title: How Complementarity and Substitution Alter the Customer Satisfaction–Repurchase Link
Author-Name: Glenn B. Voss, 
Author-Name: Andrea Godfrey, 
Author-Name: Kathleen Seiders
Abstract: Customer satisfaction is universally acknowledged as a key driver of customer repurchase behavior, but recent evidence suggests that satisfaction has no effect on repurchase under certain circumstances. In this study, the authors develop a framework for understanding the complex relationships among satisfaction, moderating variables, and repurchase. They propose that the satisfaction–repurchase link is subject to complementary and substitute effects and present satiation and inertia as key theoretical mechanisms that explain and predict those effects. In weak-satiation purchase categories, complementary effects are more likely, which suggests that managers should invest in customer satisfaction and complementary initiatives simultaneously. In strong-satiation purchase categories, substitute effects are more likely, which suggests that managers should invest in either customer satisfaction or substitute initiatives. An empirical test combining survey and longitudinal purchase data from two categories—fashion apparel and automobile service—provides a remarkable degree of support for the propositions. The findings offer new theoretical insights and substantive guidance for managers to effectively allocate resources to initiatives that complement or substitute for customer satisfaction.

Title: Resistance to Brand Switching When a Radically New Brand Is Introduced: A Social Identity Theory Perspective
Author-Name: Son K. Lam, 
Author-Name: Michael Ahearne, 
Author-Name: Ye Hu, 
Author-Name: Niels Schillewaert
Abstract: There has been little research on how market disruptions affect customer–brand relationships and how firms can sustain brand loyalty when disruptions occur. Drawing from social identity theory and the brand loyalty literature, the authors propose a conceptual framework to examine these issues in a specific market disruption, namely, the introduction of a radically new brand. The framework focuses on the time-varying effects of customers' identification with and perceived value of the incumbent relative to the new brand on switching behavior. The authors divert from the conventional economic perspective of treating brand switching as functional utility maximization to propose that brand switching can also result from customers' social mobility between brand identities. The results from longitudinal data of 679 customers during the launch of the iPhone in Spain show that both relative customer–brand identification and relative perceived value of the incumbent inhibit switching behavior, but their effects vary over time. Relative customer–brand identification with the incumbent apparently exerts a stronger longitudinal restraint on switching behavior than relative perceived value of the incumbent. The study has important strategic implications for devising customer relationship strategies and brand investment.

Title: A Global Investigation into the Constellation of Consumer Attitudes Toward Global and Local Products
Author-Name: Jan-Benedict E.M. Steenkamp, 
Author-Name: Martijn G. de Jong
Abstract: In this article, the authors introduce attitude toward global products (AGP) and attitude toward local products (ALP) as generalized attitudinal constructs and address the four issues these constructs raise: (1) How are AGP and ALP related to each other? (2) What is the motivational structure underlying AGP and ALP? (3) Is the proposed theory culturally circumscribed, or does it generalize across countries? and (4) What are the managerially relevant implications of these consumer attitudes? To answer these questions, the authors propose and empirically test an integrated structure for AGP and ALP and their antecedents, organized around the powerful motivational concept of values. They test their theory using a unique data set involving 13,000 respondents from 28 countries in the Americas, Asia, and Europe, thus allowing for a global investigation of a global issue. The study findings provide managers with strategic direction on how to market their products in a globalized world.

Title: Promoting Brands Across Categories with a Social Cause: Implementing Effective Embedded Premium Programs
Author-Name: Ty Henderson, 
Author-Name: Neeraj Arora
Abstract: Embedded premium (EP) promotions promise purchase-contingent donations to a social cause and are typically studied within a single category. However, EP programs spanning multiple product categories and brands are widespread. This research investigates fundamental questions regarding where and to what extent an EP promotion should be used in multicategory contexts. Using experimental choice data from more than 3500 people in two studies, the authors examine multicategory EP programs in two distinct branding environments: spanning a diverse house-of-brands portfolio or covering a multicategory product line that shares a common corporate brand name. For the corporate brand context, the results show that EP effects in one category carry over to adjacent categories that do not have an EP association. Greater multicategory EP prevalence does not enhance brand attractiveness beyond the effect of a single EP exposure. For the house-of-brands context, there is an inverse relationship between brand strength and incremental gain from EP. From a return-on-investment standpoint, EP promotions are more efficient than price promotions because they enhance brand preference and are relatively cheaper to deploy. The results make a strong case for a more discriminating implementation of EP programs across brands and categories.

Title: Motivating Salespeople to Sell New Products: The Relative Influence of Attitudes, Subjective Norms, and Self-Efficacy
Author-Name: Frank Q. Fu, 
Author-Name: Keith A. Richards, 
Author-Name: Douglas E. Hughes, 
Author-Name: Eli Jones
Abstract: This research explores the relative influence of salespeople's attitudes toward selling a new product, perceptions of subjective norms, and self-efficacy on the development of selling intentions and, ultimately, the success of a new product launch. The longitudinal study employs a nonlinear growth curve model that leverages survey data from industrial salespeople and objective performance records of their daily sales during the first several months in the market of two new products: a new-to-market product and a line extension. By examining salesperson-level variance on new product performance, the authors suggest that managers should focus on increasing salesperson self-efficacy and positive attitudes toward selling the product to build selling intentions and quickly grow new product performance. They also suggest that sales managers should resist the temptation to rely on normative pressure during a new product introduction. Not only are subjective norms less effective in building selling intentions, but they also diminish the positive impact of attitudes and self-efficacy on salesperson intentions and constrain the positive relationships between intentions and performance and self-efficacy and performance.

Title: Does Accommodating a Self-Serving Partner in an International Marketing Alliance Pay Off?
Author-Name: Daniel C. Bello, 
Author-Name: Constantine S. Katsikeas, 
Author-Name: Matthew J. Robson
Abstract: This research examines a firm's performance in an international marketing alliance when it responds to a self-serving partner's exploitive behavior with accommodation, a cooperative response motivated by the firm's commitment to the venture. The authors theorize that a wronged firm's payoff from accommodation depends on its approach to monitoring, either employing overt surveillance or relying on its partner's self-control. Overt surveillance is believed to undermine accommodation's ability to convince a selfish partner that cooperation is beneficial and not inconsistent with its self-interest. In contrast, because no or low monitoring is a relational approach to evaluation, it tends to reinforce accommodation, persuading a competitive partner to reciprocate cooperatively. Data collected from 174 international marketing alliances support the authors' prediction that under low monitoring, accommodation is positively associated with performance in the alliance. Unexpectedly, under high monitoring, performance is greatest under both low and high accommodation. An explanation may lie in accommodation theory's notion that as accommodation increases, a selfish partner transitions from competition to cooperation, ceasing to exploit accommodation and upturning performance.

Title: Geographical Information Systems–Based Marketing Decisions: Effects of Alternative Visualizations on Decision Quality
Author-Name: Ana-Marija Ozimec, 
Author-Name: Martin Natter, 
Author-Name: Thomas Reutterer
Abstract: Marketing planners often use geographical information systems (GISs) to help identify suitable retail locations, regionally distribute advertising campaigns, and target direct marketing activities. Geographical information systems thematic maps facilitate the visual assessment of map regions. A broad set of alternative symbolizations, such as circles, bars, or shading, can be used to visually represent quantitative geospatial data on such maps. However, there is little knowledge on which kind of symbolization is the most adequate in which problem situation. In a large-scale experimental study, the authors show that the type of symbolization strongly influences decision performance. The findings indicate that graduated circles are appropriate symbolizations for geographical information systems thematic maps, and their successful utilization seems to be virtually independent of personal characteristics, such as spatial ability and map experience. This makes circle symbolizations particularly suitable for effective decision making and cross-functional communication.

Title: The Effects of Business and Political Ties on Firm Performance: Evidence from China
Author-Name: Shibin Sheng, 
Author-Name: Kevin Zheng Zhou, 
Author-Name: Julie Juan Li
Abstract: Despite increasing attention to the role of social ties in emerging economies, few studies have explicitly distinguished the differential roles of business versus political ties. Drawing on relational governance and institutional theories, this study offers a contingent view of business and political ties in China. The findings from a survey of 241 Chinese firms indicate that business ties have a stronger positive effect on performance than political ties, and both effects depend on institutional and market environments. Business ties are more beneficial when legal enforcement is inefficient and technology is changing rapidly, whereas political ties lead to greater performance when general government support is weak and technological turbulence is low. These findings indicate that firms operating in China should be cautious in their use of business and political ties and adapt their tie utilization to changing institutional and market environments.

Title: Why Do Firms Invest in Consumer Advertising with Limited Sales Response? A Shareholder Perspective
Author-Name: Ernst C. Osinga, 
Author-Name: Peter S.H. Leeflang, 
Author-Name: Shuba Srinivasan, 
Author-Name: Jaap E. Wieringa
Abstract: Marketing managers increasingly recognize the need to measure and communicate the impact of their actions on shareholder returns. This study focuses on the shareholder value effects of pharmaceutical direct-to-consumer advertising (DTCA) and direct-to-physician (DTP) marketing efforts. Although DTCA has moderate effects on brand sales and market share, companies invest vast amounts of money in it. Relying on Kalman filtering, the authors develop a methodology to assess the effects from DTCA and DTP on three components of shareholder value: stock return, systematic risk, and idiosyncratic risk. Investors value DTCA positively because it leads to higher stock returns and lower systematic risk. Furthermore, DTCA increases idiosyncratic risk, which does not affect investors who maintain well-diversified portfolios. In contrast, DTP marketing has modest positive effects on stock returns and idiosyncratic risk. The outcomes indicate that evaluations of marketing expenditures should include a consideration of the effects of marketing on multiple stakeholders, not just the sales effects on consumers.

Title: Is Market Orientation a Source of Sustainable Competitive Advantage or Simply the Cost of Competing?
Author-Name: V. Kumar, 
Author-Name: Eli Jones, 
Author-Name: Rajkumar Venkatesan, 
Author-Name: Robert P. Leone
Abstract: The authors use panel data constructed from the responses of repeatedly surveyed top managers at 261 companies regarding their firm's market orientation, along with objective performance measures, to investigate the influence of market orientation on performance for a nine-year period from 1997 to 2005. The authors measure market orientation in 1997, 2001, and 2005 and estimate it in the interval between these measurement periods. The analyses indicate that market orientation has a positive effect on business performance in both the short and the long run. However, the sustained advantage in business performance from having a market orientation is greater for the firms that are early to develop a market orientation. These firms also gain more in sales and profit than firms that are late in developing a market orientation. Firms that adopt a market orientation may also realize additional benefit in the form of a lift in sales and profit due to a carryover effect. Market orientation should have a more pronounced effect on a firm's profit than sales because a market orientation focuses efforts on customer retention rather than on acquisition. Environmental turbulence and competitive intensity moderate the main effect of market orientation on business performance, but the moderating effects are greater in the 1990s than in the 2000s.

Title: From Point of Purchase to Path to Purchase: How Preshopping Factors Drive Unplanned Buying
Author-Name: David R. Bell, 
Author-Name: Daniel Corsten, 
Author-Name: George Knox
Abstract: Many retailers believe that a majority of purchases are unplanned, so they spend heavily on in-store marketing to stimulate these types of purchases. At the same time, the effects of “preshopping” factors—the shoppers' overall trip goals, store-specific shopping objectives, and prior marketing exposures—are largely unexplored. The authors focus on these out-of-store drivers and, unlike prior research, use panel data to “hold the shopper constant” while estimating unbiased trip-level effects. Thus, they uncover opportunities for retailers to generate more unplanned buying from existing shoppers. The authors find that the amount of unplanned buying increases monotonically with the abstractness of the overall shopping trip goal that is established before the shopper enters the store. Store-linked goals also affect unplanned buying; unplanned buying is higher on trips in which the shopper chooses the store for favorable pricing and lower on trips in which the shopper chooses the store as part of a multistore shopping trip. Although out-of-store marketing has no direct effect, it reinforces the lift in unplanned buying from shoppers who use marketing materials inside the store. The authors discuss the implications for retailers.

Title: Referral Programs and Customer Value
Author-Name: Philipp Schmitt, 
Author-Name: Bernd Skiera, 
Author-Name: Christophe Van den Bulte
Abstract: Referral programs have become a popular way to acquire customers. Yet there is no evidence to date that customers acquired through such programs are more valuable than other customers. The authors address this gap and investigate the extent to which referred customers are more profitable and more loyal. Tracking approximately 10,000 customers of a leading German bank for almost three years, the authors find that referred customers (1) have a higher contribution margin, though this difference erodes over time; (2) have a higher retention rate, and this difference persists over time; and (3) are more valuable in both the short and the long run. The average value of a referred customer is at least 16% higher than that of a nonreferred customer with similar demographics and time of acquisition. However, the size of the value differential varies across customer segments; therefore, firms should use a selective approach for their referral programs.

Title: Marketing in the C-Suite: A Study of Chief Marketing Officer Power in Firms' Top Management Teams
Author-Name: Pravin Nath, 
Author-Name: Vijay Mahajan
Abstract: Some chief marketing officers (CMOs) are more powerful than others. The authors investigate the drivers and outcomes of this phenomenon using a hierarchical measure of power for the CMO in the top management team (TMT), or corporate executive suite (C-suite). Theory suggests that CMO power in the TMT should increase with (1) the CMO's control over resources required by other executives in the C-suite, (2) the criticality and (3) effective provision of these resources, and (4) the nonsubstitutability and (5) centrality of the CMO. The authors use these rationales to identify factors that affect CMO power in public U.S. firms with the CMO position for at least two of the five observed years. The findings show that CMO power increases when the CMO has the additional responsibility of sales, as TMT marketing experience decreases, and as firms with low levels of TMT marketing experience pursue innovation. Furthermore, CMO power in highly divisionalized TMTs and the CMO's additional responsibility of sales improve sales growth, but CMO power in firms that are unrelated diversifiers reduces profitability. The authors discuss the theoretical and practical implications of these results for marketing's influence in the C-suite and the firm, the integration of marketing and sales, and market orientation.

Author-Name: Shibin Sheng
Abstract: This research examines how sales professionals use emotions in marketing exchanges to facilitate positive outcomes for their firms, themselves, and their customers. The authors conduct three field studies to examine the impact of emotional intelligence (EI) in marketing exchanges on sales performance and customer relationships. They find that EI is positively related to performance of real estate and insurance agents, even when controlling for the effects of domain-general EI, self-report EI, cognitive ability, and several control variables. Sales professionals with higher EI are not only superior revenue generators but also better at retaining customers. In addition, the authors demonstrate that EI interacts with key marketing exchange variables—customer orientation and manifest influence—to heighten performance such that high-EI salespeople more effectively employ customer-oriented selling and influence customer decisions. Finally, the results indicate a complementary relationship between EI and cognitive ability in that EI positively influences performance at higher levels of cognitive ability. These findings have implications for improving interactions between buyers and sellers and for employee selection and training.

Title: Product Development Team Stability and New Product Advantage: The Role of Decision-Making Processes
Author-Name: Rebecca J. Slotegraaf, 
Author-Name: Kwaku Atuahene-Gima
Abstract: Innovation scholars have long touted the value of cross-functional teams, and though firms have embraced a cross-functional design in their new product development (NPD) teams, these teams continue to face challenges. Stability in an NPD team may offer important advantages for decision making; however, its effectiveness as a structural coordination mechanism remains largely unexplored. Therefore, to offer insight into the value of NPD team stability, the authors develop a process-based model that examines the extent to which stability influences certain decision-making processes, which in turn influence new product advantage. They examine these relationships with a sample of cross-functional NPD project teams from 208 high-technology firms. The results reveal that the degree of stability in an NPD project team has a curvilinear relationship to team-level debate and decision-making comprehensiveness. In turn, whereas debate is positively related to decision comprehensiveness, decision comprehensiveness is positively related to new product advantage only at high levels. These curvilinear patterns shed light on anecdotal evidence that currently attributes success to both stable and unstable project teams.

Title: Performance Implications of Mismatched Governance Regimes Across External and Internal Relationships
Author-Name: Alok Kumar, 
Author-Name: Jan B. Heide, 
Author-Name: Kenneth H. Wathne
Abstract: This article examines how a manufacturer's governance of an external supplier relationship affects its performance toward a downstream retail customer. In line with sociological and economic theory, a manufacturer's reliance on supplier norms and incentives, respectively, promotes performance. However, the performance effect of each external governance mechanism weakens in the presence of a different governance regime within the manufacturer firm itself. Specifically, internal incentives weaken the effect of external norms, and internal norms weaken the effect of external incentives. From a practical standpoint, these findings point to the difficulty of managing sets of relationships that involve different parties and mechanisms. From a theoretical standpoint, they point to the complex interplay between social norms and economic incentives in driving performance outcomes.

Title: The Effect of Goal Visualization on Goal Pursuit: Implications for Consumers and Managers
Author-Name: Amar Cheema, 
Author-Name: Rajesh Bagchi
Abstract: This research demonstrates that as people approach a goal, external representations, which increase the ease of visualizing the goal, enhance goal pursuit. Specifically, consumers judge easy-to-visualize goals to be closer than difficult-to-visualize goals, which in turn increases effort and commitment. Ease of visualization affects performance in swimming competitions and the physical effort exerted in the lab. Visualization also affects commitment toward savings, willingness to wait for service, and performance in a simulated sales task. Importantly, the beneficial effects of visualization exist only when people are close to the goal. In addition, the effect of visualization attenuates when the goal is split into subgoals. Managers can use these results to enhance consumer goal pursuit, influence consumer satisfaction in online service encounters, and motivate employees to improve performance. In these varied contexts, visual representations of goal progress (e.g., progress bars) enhance motivation as people approach their goal.

Title: Consumer Disidentification and Its Effects on Domestic Product Purchases: An Empirical Investigation in the Netherlands
Author-Name: Alexander Josiassen
Abstract: Consumers' local bias is an important determinant of domestic product purchase behavior. Because of its importance, authors across various disciplines have investigated this phenomenon using the consumer ethnocentrism model. However, the research reported herein demonstrates that such an approach provides an incomplete picture at best. This research provides an initial test of the consumer disidentification (CDI) construct. In contrast with consumer ethnocentrism, the CDI model predicts that consumers' repulsion toward their domestic country negatively affects the purchase of products made in their domestic country or by domestic firms. The model is tested using survey data from 1534 second-generation immigrants who were born in and live in the Netherlands. Structural equation modeling supports the model and shows that CDI has a significant impact on buying decisions beyond the effect of consumer ethnocentrism. The results further show that for second-generation Turkish immigrants, acculturation and ethnic identification are important predictors of both consumer ethnocentrism and CDI. The article discusses the implications of these findings for research and practice.

Abstract: The authors empirically examine the effect of gas prices on grocery shopping behavior using Information Resources Inc. panel data from 2006 to 2008, which track panelists' purchases of almost 300 product categories across multiple retail formats. The authors quantify the impact on consumers' total spending and examine the potential avenues for savings when consumers shift from one retail format to another, from national brands to private labels, from regular-priced to promotional products, and from higher to lower price tiers. They find a substantial negative effect on shopping frequency and purchase volume and shifts away from grocery and toward supercenter formats. A greater shift occurs from regular-priced national brands to promoted ones than to private labels, and among national brand purchasers, bottom-tier brands lose share, midtier brands gain share, and top-tier brand share is relatively unaffected. The analysis also controls for general economic conditions and shows that gas prices have a much larger impact on grocery shopping behavior than broad economic factors.

Title: Designing Solutions Around Customer Network Identity Goals
Author-Name: Amber M. Epp, 
Author-Name: Linda L. Price
Abstract: When companies fail to account for collective and relational goals in customer solutions, a mismatch can occur between firms' solutions and those that customers envision. Understanding the integration processes of customer networks is essential to improving solution design. This investigation draws on depth interviews with 21 families, the focal customer network, to generate collective and relational vacation narratives that contextualize their accounts. The authors identify four customer network integration processes: offerings assembled around prioritized goals, alternate participation, concurrent participation, and offerings assembled around separate coalitions. The findings reveal that the resulting mix of integrated products and services, or the solution, is shaped by customer network identity goals, goal management approaches, and constraints. The authors conclude with recommendations for how firms can use this information to improve solution design, identify new network partners, and revise value propositions.

Abstract: In today's age of relational selling, a key challenge for salespeople is to determine the degree to which their customer-oriented behaviors drive sales performance. Therefore, this study analyzes whether a salesperson's customer orientation in sales encounters has an optimum level with regard to sales performance and customer attitudes. Using triadic data from a cross-industry survey of 56 sales managers, 195 sales representatives, and 538 customers, the authors provide strong empirical support for a curvilinear, inverted U-shaped effect of a salesperson's customer orientation on sales performance, whereas the effect of customer orientation on customer attitudes is continuously positive. Moreover, the findings reveal that the optimum level of customer orientation with regard to sales performance is higher for salespeople selling individualized products, in firms pursuing a premium price strategy, and in markets with a high degree of competitive intensity.

Title: An Empirical Test of Warranty Theories in the U.S. Computer Server and Automobile Markets
Author-Name: Junhong Chu, 
Author-Name: Pradeep K. Chintagunta
Abstract: Four theories on the economic rationale for warranty provision have been proposed in the literature: (1) Warranties provide insurance to customers and work as a risk-sharing mechanism, (2) warranties are a sorting mechanism and work as a means for second-degree price discrimination among customers with different risk preferences, (3) warranties work as a signal of product quality to consumers under information asymmetry, and (4) warranties work as an incentive mechanism for firms to reveal and improve product quality. The authors examine the conditions under which each theory would apply and derive testable implications from the data. They then assess whether these theories have empirical support in the U.S. computer server and automobile markets in the context of manufacturer base warranties. The results indicate that in both markets, warranties primarily provide customers with insurance against product failure, and warranties of different durations work as a sorting mechanism across customers with different levels of risk aversion. Warranties are not used to signal product quality or to provide an incentive for manufacturers to reveal or improve product quality.

Title: Return on Interactivity: The Impact of Online Agents on Newcomer Adjustment
Author-Name: Clemens F. Köhler, 
Author-Name: Andrew J. Rohm, 
Author-Name: Ko de Ruyter, 
Author-Name: Martin Wetzels
Abstract: As service offerings grow in both range and complexity, how service providers and their customers interact is becoming increasingly important. In response to the challenge of optimizing these interactions, companies have introduced sophisticated online “socialization agents,” whose purpose is to help new customers more effectively adjust to and function within the service environment. The objective of these online agents, or virtual employees, is to help customers evaluate new or unfamiliar service offerings, as well as help companies achieve greater levels of service delivery and financial performance. To investigate this, the authors analyze the process by which online agents help both new and current customers adjust to and function within new, unfamiliar, or complex service contexts. They examine the impact of an online agent on account performance in the banking industry. They find that both interaction style and content of the online agent significantly influence the newcomer adjustment process over time, which in turn influences firm-level performance.

Title: Balancing Risk and Return in a Customer Portfolio

Abstract: Marketing managers can increase shareholder value by structuring a customer portfolio to reduce the vulnerability and volatility of cash flows. This article demonstrates how financial portfolio theory provides an organizing framework for (1) diagnosing the variability in a customer portfolio, (2) assessing the complementarity/similarity of market segments, (3) exploring market segment weights in an optimized portfolio, and (4) isolating the reward on variability that individual customers or segments provide. Using a seven-year series of customer data from a large business-to-business firm, the authors demonstrate how market segments can be characterized in terms of risk and return. Next, they identify the firm's efficient portfolio and test it against (1) its current portfolio and (2) a hypothetical profit maximization portfolio. Then, using forward- and back-testing, the authors show that the efficient portfolio has consistently lower variability than the existing customer mix and the profit maximization portfolio. The authors provide guidelines for incorporating a risk overlay into established customer management frameworks. The approach is especially well suited for business-to-business firms that serve market segments drawn from diverse sectors of the economy.

Title: Customer Equity Sustainability Ratio: A New Metric for Assessing a Firm's Future Orientation
Author-Name: Bernd Skiera, 
Author-Name: Manuel Bermes, 
Author-Name: Lutz Horn
Abstract: Securitization is a remarkable financial instrument; it enables securitizers to increase their short-term profits at the expense of the long-term value of their customer base. This ability might be tempting for firms, especially because it does not need to be disclosed transparently to stakeholders. The authors show how their newly developed customer equity sustainability ratio (CESR) complements customer equity reporting and creates more transparency about the consequences of securitization for future earnings and the riskiness of the underlying business model. Their model compares the future value of an existing customer base with current earnings. In an empirical study of 38 banks in ten countries, the authors demonstrate the limited transparency of long-term value creation in financial statements. Next, they outline the adequacy of CESR for creating more transparency in empirical cases of Countrywide Financial Corporation and nine firms from nonbanking industries. They recommend that marketing should play a prominent role in providing stakeholders with substantial information about the long-term value of the customer base.

Title: It's Got the Look: The Effect of Friendly and Aggressive “Facial” Expressions on Product Liking and Sales
Author-Name: Jan R. Landwehr, 
Author-Name: Ann L. McGill, 
Author-Name: Andreas Herrmann
Abstract: When designing their products, companies try to employ shapes that are both emotionally appealing and compatible with the brand's image. One way to accomplish these aims is to anthropomorphize a product's appearance. The current research investigates how people decode emotional “facial” expressions from product shapes and how this affects liking of the design, using three studies in the domain of cars and one in the domain of cellular phones. In accordance with theories on the perception of human faces, the first study shows that perception of friendliness is limited to the grille (mouth), while aggressiveness can be communicated with both grille and headlights (eyes). The next study examines the best-liked combination of these two emotional expressions and finds that consumers prefer the combination of an upturned (friendly) grille with slanted (aggressive) headlights. The authors further explain this finding on a process level by showing that this combination triggers a positive affective state of both high pleasure and arousal. The third study validates the results with automobile sales data, and a fourth study extends the findings to another product category.

Title: Do Marketing Media Have Life Cycles? The Case of Product Placement in Movies
Author-Name: Ekaterina V. Karniouchina, 
Author-Name: Can Uslay, 
Author-Name: Grigori Erenburg
Abstract: This article examines the economic worth of product placement in movies over a time span of 40 years (1968–2007). The authors find an inverted U-shaped relationship between the year of the movie release and the returns associated with product placements. In addition, a similar inverted U-shaped relationship characterizes the economic worth of tie-in campaigns associated with product placements. These findings are consistent with the habituation–tedium theory used to explain the inverted U-shaped pattern in response to novel advertisements and suggest that the same mechanism could be influencing the response to an entire marketing medium. Overall, the results reinforce the notion that marketers find it increasingly difficult to get their message across using traditional media and underscore the need for the marketing industry to reinvent itself when new tactics lose their luster. The authors conclude with a discussion of additional empirical regularities.

Title: Should Firms Spend More on Research and Development and Advertising During Recessions?
Author-Name: Raji Srinivasan, 
Author-Name: Gary L. Lilien, 
Author-Name: Shrihari Sridhar
Abstract: Whenever a recession occurs, there is a heated dialog among marketing academics and practitioners about the appropriate levels of marketing spending. In this article, the authors investigate whether firms should spend more on research and development (R&D) and advertising in recessions. They propose that the effects of changes in firms' R&D and advertising spending in recessions on profits and stock returns are contingent on their market share, financial leverage, and product-market profile (i.e., business-to-consumer goods, business-to-business services, business-to-business goods, or business-to-consumer services). They estimate the model using a panel of more than 10,000 firm-years of publicly listed U.S. firms from 1969 to 2008, during which there were seven recessions. Their results support the contingency approach. The authors compute the marginal effects, which show how the effects of changes in R&D and advertising spending in recessions vary across firms. The marginal effects provide evidence of inadequate spending (e.g., 98% of business-to-consumer goods firms underspend on R&D), proactivity (e.g., 96% of business-to-business services firms are at approximately the right levels on advertising). and excess spending (e.g., 92% of business-to-consumer services firms overspend on advertising). Using the authors' approach and publicly available data, managers can estimate the effects of their firms' and competitors' R&D and advertising spending on profits and stock returns in recessions.

Title: Competing for Consumer Identity: Limits to Self-Expression and the Perils of Lifestyle Branding
Author-Name: Alexander Chernev, 
Author-Name: Ryan Hamilton, 
Author-Name: David Gal
Abstract: The idea that consumers use brands to express their identities has led many companies to reposition their products from focusing on functional attributes to focusing on how they fit into a consumer's lifestyle. This repositioning is welcomed by managers who believe that by positioning their brands as means for self-expression, they are less likely to go head-to-head with their direct competitors. However, the authors argue that by doing so, these companies expose themselves to much broader, cross-category competition for a share of a consumer's identity. Thus, they propose that consumers' need for self-expression through brands is finite and can be satiated when consumers are exposed to self-expressive brands. Moreover, they argue that consumers' need for self-expression can be satiated not only by a brand's direct competitors but also by brands from unrelated product categories, nonbrand means of self-expression, and self-expressive behavioral acts. The authors examine these propositions in a series of five empirical studies that provide converging evidence in support of the notion that the need for self-expression can be satiated, thus weakening preferences for lifestyle brands.

Title: Process and Outcome Interdependency in Frontline Service Encounters
Author-Name: Zhenfeng Ma, 
Author-Name: Laurette Dubé
Abstract: Although marketing researchers have emphasized the interactive nature of service encounters, there has been scant research regarding how dyadic behaviors in a service encounter are interrelated. The authors recognize two distinct forms of dyadic interdependency: process interdependency, in which each party's enactment of behavior influences the other's enactment of behavior, and outcome interdependency, in which the impact of each party's behavior on service outcome depends on the other party's behavior. Using the interpersonal circumplex model and its related concept of complementarity, the authors examine both forms of dyadic interdependency by directly observing provider–client interpersonal behaviors in a natural frontline service setting over an extended period. The findings on process interdependency indicate that dyadic behaviors elicit or inhibit each other largely in a complementary manner. The findings on outcome interdependency show that, in general, complementary interactions between the provider and client enhance the client's satisfaction, whereas anticomplementary interactions dampen the client's satisfaction.

Title: Poisoning Relationships: Perceived Unfairness in Channels of Distribution
Author-Name: Stephen A. Samaha,

Author-Name: Rajiv P. Dant
Abstract: Understanding how relationships are damaged is a critical component in building and preserving strong distribution channels. Using longitudinal data from a Fortune 500 firm and its channel members, this research shows that perceived unfairness truly acts as “relationship poison” by directly damaging relationships, aggravating the negative effects of both conflict and opportunism, and undermining the benefits of using contracts to manage channel relationships. Surprisingly, at low levels of perceived unfairness, conflict and opportunism have small or even insignificant effects on channel member outcomes, which implies that research investigating the negative impact of conflict and opportunism on exchange outcomes may need reevaluation because these effects are contingent and may vary depending on the levels of perceived unfairness. In addition, the findings support the premise that using contracts to manage channel relationships represents a double-edged sword that suppresses the negative effects of conflict and opportunism while aggravating the negative effect of unfairness.

Title: The Alignment of Contract Terms for Knowledge-Creating and Knowledge-Appropriating Relationship Portfolios
Author-Name: Jongkuk Lee
Abstract: Interfirm collaborative relationships for developing new products involve the two fundamental tasks of creating new knowledge and appropriating the newly created or current stocks of knowledge. This study examines the alignment of two contract terms—form of resource integration (how partners integrate their resources) and form of equity sharing (whether partners are engaged in equity investment)—for knowledge-creating and knowledge-appropriating relationship portfolios. By analyzing interfirm relationship agreements initiated in the pharmaceutical industry between 1990 and 2006, the author shows that knowledge-creating and knowledge-appropriating relationship portfolios benefit from different alignments of contract terms to address their unique concerns. The author also shows that the appropriate alignments of contract terms are more critical for small firms than for large firms. The results provide specific insights into the management of knowledge-creating and knowledge-appropriating relationship portfolios for developing a greater number of radical and incremental new products.

Title: Reinventing Marketing to Manage the Environmental Imperative
Author-Name: Philip Kotler
Abstract: Marketers in the past have based their strategies on the assumption of infinite resources and zero environmental impact. With the growing recognition of finite resources and high environmental costs, marketers need to reexamine their theory and practices. They need to revise their policies on product development, pricing, distribution, and branding. The recent financial meltdown has added another layer of concern as consumers adjust their lifestyles to a lower level of income and spending. Companies must balance more carefully their growth goals with the need to pursue sustainability. Increased attention will be paid to employing demarketing and social marketing thinking to meet the new challenges.

Abstract: Conceptual advances are critical to the vitality of the marketing discipline, yet recent writings suggest that conceptual advancement in the field is slowing. The author addresses this issue by developing a framework for thinking about conceptualization in marketing. A definition of conceptualization is followed by a typology of types of conceptual contributions. The types of conceptual contributions, their similarities and differences, and their importance to the field are described. Thinking skills linked to various types of conceptual contributions are also described, as are the use of tools that can facilitate these skills. The article concludes with a set of recommendations for advancing conceptualization in our field in the years to come.

Abstract: Over the years, the level of analytical rigor has risen in articles published in marketing academic journals. While, ceteris paribus, rigor is desirable, there is a growing sense that rigor has become a, if not the, goal for research in marketing. Consequently, other desirable characteristics, such as relevance, communicability, and simplicity, have been downplayed, to the detriment of the field of marketing. The authors explore this imbalance, setting forth the consequences of overemphasis on rigor for (1) the manuscript review process, (2) PhD programs, (3) hiring, and (4) the tenure and promotion review process. Two surveys of “successful” authors provide empirical support for the conjectures put forth. The authors then identify the causes for this trend and propose some directions to reestablish a better balance between rigor and relevance.

Title: Impact of Emerging Markets on Marketing: Rethinking Existing Perspectives and Practices
Author-Name: Jagdish N. Sheth
Abstract: The core idea of this article is that five key characteristics—market heterogeneity, sociopolitical governance, chronic shortage of resources, unbranded competition, and inadequate infrastructure—of emerging markets are radically different from the traditional industrialized capitalist society, and they will require us to rethink the core assumptions of marketing, such as market orientation, market segmentation, and differential advantage. To accommodate these characteristics, we must rethink the marketing perspective (e.g., from differential advantage to market aggregation and standardization) and the core guiding strategy concepts (e.g., from market orientation to market development). Similarly, we must rethink issues of public policy (e.g., from compliance and crisis driven to purpose driven) and the marketing practice (e.g., from glocalization to fusion marketing).

Title: Closing the Marketing Capabilities Gap
Author-Name: George S. Day
Abstract: Marketers are being challenged by a deluge of data that is well beyond the capacity of their organizations to comprehend and use. Their strategies are not keeping up with the disruptive effects of technology-empowered customers; the proliferation of media, channel, and customer contact points; or the possibilities for microsegmentation. Closing the widening gap between the accelerating complexity of their markets and the limited ability of their organizations to respond demands new thinking about marketing capabilities. Three adaptive capabilities are needed: (1) Vigilant market learning that enhances deep market insights with an advance warning system to anticipate market changes and unmet needs, (2) adaptive market experimentation that continuously learns from experiments, and (3) open marketing that forges relationships with those at the forefront of new media and social networking technologies and mobilizes the skills of current partners. The benefits of these adaptive capabilities will only be realized in organizations that are more resilient and free-flowing, with vigilant leadership and more adaptive business models.

Abstract: The marketing decision models field has produced many striking developments that have had a dramatic impact on practice. However, the field has produced orders of magnitude more developments that have received minimal use. In this article, the author notes the many successful marketing model developments but then considers the relatively low level of practical use (trial or adoption) and questions why that is the case. He then suggests how changes in the incentive and reward systems for marketing academics, marketing practitioners, and marketing intermediaries can bring about adoption and implementation improvements that would be mutually beneficial, bridging the academic–practitioner divide. The author also outlines a program of research in the area of the adoption and use of marketing decision models that will provide guidance on what to develop and how to get those developments adopted.

Title: Getting a Grip on the Saddle: Chasms or Cycles?
Author-Name: Deepa Chandrasekaran, 
Author-Name: Gerard J. Tellis
Abstract: The “saddle” is a sudden, sustained, and deep drop in sales of a new product, after a period of rapid growth following takeoff, followed by a gradual recovery to the former peak. The authors test for the generalizability of the saddle across products and countries and for three rival explanations: chasms in adopter segments, business cycles, and technological cycles. They model both boundary points of the saddle—start of the sales drop and recovery to the initial peak—using split-population models. Empirical analysis of historical sales data from ten products across 19 countries shows that the saddle is fairly pervasive. The onset of the saddle occurs in 148 product–country combinations. On average, the saddle occurs nine years after takeoff, at a mean penetration of 30%, and it lasts for eight years with a 29% drop in sales at its depth. The results support explanations of chasms and technological cycles for information/entertainment products and business cycles and technological cycles for kitchen/laundry products. The authors conclude with a discussion of the findings, contributions, and implications.

Title: On Managerial Relevance
Author-Name: Bernard J. Jaworski
Abstract: The concept of managerial relevance continues to be a significant topic for both research faculty and business schools alike. Despite decades of debate, it is surprising that there is virtually no work on the nature of the concept itself. Thus, the author defines the concept of managerial relevance, makes three specific observations, and discusses research implications for each observation. The key message is that the field needs a much deeper understanding of the marketing roles within the firm, and research programs must be crafted to fit the needs of these particular roles. The author calls this approach “role-relevant” managerial research. With this central thesis in mind, he examines the role of the chief marketing officer (CMO) as an illustrative case study to identify areas of inquiry that are both novel and highly managerially relevant. This analysis reveals that of the seven core tasks of the CMO, three have been lightly investigated. The author concludes with advice to both academics and practitioners on how to increase the role relevance of academic research.

Title: Marketing Scholarship 2.0
Author-Name: Richard J. Lutz
Abstract: The system for the design, production, and dissemination of marketing scholarship aimed at contributing to marketing practice is under increasing strain due to pressures exerted by globalization, digitization, and environmentalism. Scholarly research in marketing adheres largely to a twentieth-century manufacturing model. Change is needed now. Marketing scholarship can benefit from embracing a twenty-first-century, collaborative approach to the conception, design, and dissemination of research. “Crowdsourcing” is becoming a frequently employed strategy in industry. Marketing academe should adopt some of the same techniques and technologies to make stronger research contributions that will benefit marketing practice. In particular, more collaboration is needed, both among academic researchers and between academe and industry, to be sure important problems are being investigated using sound theories and methods. An open, collaborative model will allow the field to evolve from Marketing Scholarship 1.0 to Marketing Scholarship 2.0.

Title: The Asymmetric Effects of Extending Brands to Lower and Higher Quality
Author-Name: Timothy B. Heath, 
Author-Name: Devon DelVecchio, 
Author-Name: Michael S. McCarthy
Abstract: Managers often extend brands to different quality levels (e.g., Charmin's lower-quality Charmin Basic), which may increase sales but risks diluting brand image. This study examines such line extensions by testing middle-quality brands (e.g., Giovanni's pasta sauce [fictitious], Foster's beer [real]) that offer higher-quality (e.g., Giovanni's Magnifico) or lower-quality line extensions (e.g., Foster's Grog). A robust asymmetry emerges in which higher-quality extensions improve brand evaluation far more than lower-quality extensions damage it. The asymmetry prevails across various perceptual and evaluative dimensions, multiple product classes, numerous fictitious and real brands that differ on various dimensions (familiarity, liking, personality, and prestige), and consumer regulatory focus. Group and individual-level tests show that the standard asymmetry is the modal pattern (though not universal) and that it is associated with two primary underlying processes: (1) opponent processes produced by lower-quality extensions whose negative quality-association effects are tempered by positive variety effects (in general, consumers prefer broader product lines) and (2) best-of-brand processing, in which consumers consider higher-quality extensions more relevant to brand evaluation than lower-quality extensions.

Title: Emotional Brand Attachment and Brand Personality: The Relative Importance of the Actual and the Ideal Self
Author-Name: Lucia Malär, 
Author-Name: Harley Krohmer, 
Author-Name: Wayne D. Hoyer, 
Author-Name: Bettina Nyffenegger
Abstract: Creating emotional brand attachment is a key branding issue in today's marketing world. One way to accomplish this is to match the brand's personality with the consumer's self. A key question, however, is whether the brand's personality should match the consumer's actual self or the consumer's ideal self. On the basis of two empirical studies of 167 brands (evaluated by 1329 and 980 consumers), the authors show that the implications of self-congruence for consumers' emotional brand attachment are complex and differ by consumers' product involvement, consumers' individual difference variables, and the type of self-congruence (fit of the brand's personality with the consumer's actual self versus with the consumer's ideal self). On a general level, actual self-congruence has the greatest impact on emotional brand attachment. Product involvement, self-esteem, and public self-consciousness increase the positive impact of actual self-congruence but decrease the impact of ideal self-congruence on emotional brand attachment. The authors discuss important managerial and academic implications of these findings.

Title: Facilitating and Rewarding Creativity During New Product Development

Abstract: In an effort to improve creativity in the new product development process, many firms offer incentive programs, creativity training programs, or both. However, creativity continues to be a construct that is not well understood in marketing, and little research has examined the joint influence of such initiatives on creative outcomes. As a result, there is considerable variance in the way firms approach these issues. A qualitative study of 20 firms indicates that 15 offered some type of incentive program, whereas only 7 engaged in creativity training (a subset of the firms used both). Given that previous research has consistently found that extrinsic rewards offered in isolation actually undermine the creative process (by reducing intrinsic motivation), it seems that many firms may be unwittingly hampering their own creative efforts. However, two experiments demonstrate that the effect of rewards can be made positive if offered in conjunction with appropriate training. Specifically, product creativity was highest when the monetary reward was paired with a dedicated creative training technique. The training alters the influence of the reward such that it reinforces, rather than undermines, intrinsic motivation. Managers can improve the effectiveness of their creative efforts by leveraging the use of incentives and training in combination.

Title: Stock Market Reaction to Unexpected Growth in Marketing Expenditure: Negative for Sales Force, Contingent on Spending Level for Advertising
Author-Name: MinChung Kim, 
Author-Name: Leigh M. McAlister
Abstract: Because firms do not publicly report marketing expenditures, most studies of the link between firm value and marketing consider advertising (which is publicly reported for many firms) a proxy for marketing. The authors extend those studies in two ways. First, they broaden the proxy for marketing by considering both advertising and sales force. Second, they offer an explanation for the fact that some studies linking advertising to firm value find a positive relationship, whereas others find a negative relationship. The accounting literature suggests that the link to firm value for both unexpected growth in sales force expenditures and unexpected growth in advertising expenditures should be negative. The authors confirm the hypothesized accounting relationship for sales force expenditures but find a contingent relationship for advertising expenditures. Firm value and unexpected growth in advertising expenditures are negatively related for firms that advertise below the advertising response threshold, but they are positively related for firms that advertise above that threshold. Perhaps because this contingent relationship is difficult for analysts to learn through observation of the stock market, analysts ignore value-relevant advertising expenditure information when they forecast firm value.

Title: The Impact of Incomplete Typeface Logos on Perceptions of the Firm
Author-Name: Henrik Hagtvedt
Abstract: This research investigates the influence of incomplete typeface logos on consumer perceptions of the firm. In these logos, parts of the characters in the company name are intentionally missing or blanked out, giving rise to a form of perceptual ambiguity. Three studies demonstrate that although incomplete typeface logos have an unfavorable influence on perceived firm trustworthiness, they have a favorable influence on perceived firm innovativeness. The former influence is tied to the logo's perceived clarity, while the latter influence is tied to its perceived interestingness. Furthermore, incomplete typeface logos have an unfavorable influence on overall attitude toward the firm, but only for consumers with a prevention, rather than promotion, focus. These findings suggest that firms should avoid incomplete typeface logos if perceptions of trustworthiness are critical or if consumers are likely to have a prevention focus. However, such logos may be successfully employed with promotion-focused consumers, and they may be used as a tool to position a firm as innovative.

Title: Enough Is Enough! The Fine Line in Executing Multichannel Relational Communication
Author-Name: Andrea Godfrey, 
Author-Name: Kathleen Seiders, 
Author-Name: Glenn B. Voss
Abstract: In an effort to build long-term, profitable relationships, many companies systematically engage in multichannel relational communication—personalized messages sent to existing customers through various channels as part of a broader relationship marketing strategy. In this research, the authors examine three key drivers of relational communication effectiveness: volume of communication, mix of communication channels, and alignment of those channels with customers' preferences. They hypothesize that customer response to relational communication follows a continuum in which reciprocity explains response to lower levels of communication, the classic ideal point describes a transition phase, and reactance explains response to higher levels of communication. They empirically test the theoretical framework by examining the impact of multichannel communication on repurchase over a three-year period. The results indicate that after the ideal level of communication is exceeded, customers react negatively. This negative response can be exacerbated by the use of multiple channels but attenuated by aligning channels with customer preferences. The findings suggest that the complex effects of multichannel communication can actually drive customers away from rather than closer to a company.

Title: Will Consumers Be Willing to Pay More When Your Competitors Adopt Your Technology? The Impacts of the Supporting-Firm Base in Markets with Network Effects
Author-Name: Qi Wang, 
Author-Name: Jinhong Xie
Abstract: Network effects and standards competition introduce significant market uncertainty, creating a substantial challenge to the success of innovating firms. Although the literature has highlighted the importance of establishing a large installed-user base (the number of users adopting the same product) in such markets, the authors draw attention to a different, but potentially important, market force: the supporting-firm base, which they define as the number of firms supporting the same technological standard. They test their proposed hypotheses using data from two markets: the floppy disk drive and personal digital assistant markets. Their results show that (1) consumer product valuation is positively affected not only by the installed-user base but also by the supporting-firm base, (2) the two positive effects interact with each other and the nature of the interaction changes over the evolution of the market (i.e., they strengthen each other's impact in the early stage but weaken each other's impact in the late stage of the product life cycle), and (3) not all supporting firms are equally valuable to the innovator—specifically, consumers are affected more by firms exclusively supporting a single standard than by firms supporting multiple standards and by incumbents than by new entrants.

Title: The Repetition-Break Plot Structure Makes Effective Television Advertisements
Author-Name: Jeffrey Loewenstein, 
Author-Name: Rajagopal Raghunathan, 
Author-Name: Chip Heath
Abstract: The plot structure in television advertisements can enhance consumers' brand attitudes and foster increasing consumer and industry recognition. A corpus analysis of contemporary television advertisements shows that advertisements using the repetition-break plot structure are a small percentage of television advertisements but a large percentage of Clio and Effie award–winning advertisements. They are also likely to attain postings and views on YouTube. Three experiments using television advertisements from contemporary brands show that repetition-break advertisements are persuasive, leading to more favorable brand attitudes and greater purchase intentions than similar plot structures and that this effect is attributable in part to the advertisements being more engaging. Thus, a theoretically explainable and generic plot structure yields effective advertisements. The result is a new and flexible tool for marketing professionals to use to generate advertisements, with guidelines for when and why it should and should not be effective.

Title: It's the Thought (and the Effort) That Counts: How Customizing for Others Differs from Customizing for Oneself
Author-Name: C. Page Moreau, 
Author-Name: Leff Bonney, 
Author-Name: Kelly B. Herd
Abstract: While interest in customization is growing among consumers and academics, researchers have focused on consumers designing products for themselves. Many customization firms, however, are successfully positioning themselves as key sources for unique gifts. In this research, the authors examine whether factors under the firm's control (i.e., the level of design support provided and the presence of a strong brand) are differentially effective when consumers design products for themselves or as gifts for others. Using participants drawn from the relevant target market, they report two studies involving real customization tasks undertaken on fully functioning customization websites. The findings lead to the surprising conclusion that design support is less effective for consumers designing products intended as gifts rather than for themselves, raising expectations without a corresponding rise in evaluations. However, the results offer some good news to firms targeting gift-giving consumers. Both Studies 1 and 2 reveal that gift-givers place a higher value on their own time and effort and thus report a higher willingness to pay than those designing for themselves. This effect is diminished, however, when a strong brand is present and consumers share credit with the brand for the product's design.

Title: Is Retail Category Management Worth the Effort (and Does a Category Captain Help or Hinder)?
Author-Name: Richard A. Gooner, 
Author-Name: Neil A. Morgan, 
Author-Name: William D. Perreault, Jr.
Abstract: Category management (CM) is challenging for retailers that sell thousands of products across hundreds of categories and often lack the resources and capabilities to manage all of them intensively. Some retailers respond by picking one supplier to be a “category captain” that manages the category—including rivals' brands—on their behalf. Others worry that influential captains will be opportunistic and that the benefits of intensive CM are simply not worth the costs. However, there is little conceptual development or empirical evidence concerning CM best practices. The authors develop a comprehensive model of retail CM based on a synthesis of field interviews and relevant literature, especially work on governance value analysis theory. Their test of the model using category and financial growth data from U.S. supermarket chains shows that more intensive CM improves results. Furthermore, use of a category captain increases CM effort and results, without increasing opportunism or problems with other suppliers. The authors also find that retailers with more resources are less likely to rely on help from a category captain; yet the level of retailer resources is not related to CM intensity. Thus, “go-it-alone” retailers do not deploy their own resources on CM and miss out on the corresponding performance improvements.

Abstract: Although the number and importance of joint innovation projects between suppliers and their customers continue to rise, the literature has yet to resolve a key question: Do embedded ties with customers help or hurt supplier innovation? Drawing on both the tie strength and knowledge literatures, the authors theorize that embedded ties interact with supplier and customer innovation knowledge to influence supplier innovation. In a sample of 157 Dutch business-to-business innovation relationships, they observe that embedded ties weaken how much suppliers benefit from customer innovation knowledge because of worries about customer opportunism (the dark side of embedded ties). However, they uncover three moderating relationship and governance features that allow suppliers to overcome these dark-side effects and even increase innovation (the bright side of embedded ties). Finally, although the authors predicted a bright-side effect, they find that embedded ties neither help nor hinder the supplier to leverage its own innovation knowledge in the relationship.

Title: Behemoths at the Gate: How Incumbents Take on Acquisitive Entrants (and Why Some Do Better Than Others)
Author-Name: Prokriti Mukherji, 
Author-Name: Alina Sorescu, 
Author-Name: Jaideep C. Prabhu, 
Author-Name: Rajesh K. Chandy
Abstract: Corporate acquisitions are a ubiquitous feature of today's business landscape and a widely used means by which large firms enter new markets. As large acquirers swoop in to acquire firms in new markets, they are almost inevitably met with a chorus of concerns about the potential effects of their actions on the markets they enter. What is the actual impact of acquisitive entry by large firms on the strategies and performance of incumbents? How do incumbents reconfigure the way they compete after a behemoth enters their market? The authors focus on an important facet of firms' competitive positions—their product mix—and propose a framework that explains incumbent firms' reaction to acquisitive entry by large firms, as well as the performance implications of these reactions. They test the hypotheses that result from this framework by examining the impact of acquisitive entry across a large number of firms and consumer markets over time: The data cover 839 acquisitions in 583 metropolitan statistical areas in the U.S. banking industry. The results indicate that incumbents are more likely to align their product mix strategy with that of the acquisitive entrant if (1) the incumbent is large, (2) the acquirer's past performance has been strong, and (3) the market served by the incumbent is small. Importantly, how incumbents react has significant performance implications: The authors find that large incumbents that deviate from acquirers' product mix strategy perform better than other incumbents do.

Title: Extreme Makeover: Short- and Long-Term Effects of a Remodeled Servicescape
Author-Name: Elisabeth C. Brüggen, 
Author-Name: Bram Foubert, 
Author-Name: Dwayne D. Gremler
Abstract: Using survey and transaction data from a natural experiment in a fast-food chain, the authors investigate the effects of store remodeling. They test (1) short- and long-term effects on customers' cognitions, affect, and behavioral intentions; (2) the moderating impact of spontaneous versus planned and group versus single-customer store visits; and (3) the differential effects on two store performance measures: average customer spending and store traffic. The results show that, in line with adaptation-level theory, short-term remodeling effects lose strength in the long run (i.e., after six months). Furthermore, customers on a spontaneous trip or in a group tend to be more responsive to store remodeling than customers on a planned trip or alone. Finally, whereas average spending increases in the short run and then returns to the baseline, store traffic initially remains unaffected and even shows a dip in the long run. These findings imply that ignoring the time-variant character of remodeling effects, the nature of customers' store visits, or the impact on store traffic may lead to inappropriate allocation of marketing resources.

Title: The Impact of Brand Quality on Shareholder Wealth
Author-Name: Sundar G. Bharadwaj, 
Author-Name: Kapil R. Tuli, 
Author-Name: Andre Bonfrer
Abstract: This study examines the impact of brand quality on three components of shareholder wealth: stock returns, systematic risk, and idiosyncratic risk. The study finds that brand quality enhances shareholder wealth insofar as unanticipated changes in brand quality are positively associated with stock returns and negatively related to changes in idiosyncratic risk. However, unanticipated changes in brand quality can also erode shareholder wealth because they have a positive association with changes in systematic risk. The study introduces a contingency theory view to the marketing–finance interface by analyzing the moderating role of two factors that are widely followed by investors. The results show an unanticipated increase (decrease) in current-period earnings enhances (depletes) the positive impact of unanticipated changes in brand quality on stock returns and mitigates (enhances) their deleterious effects on changes in systematic risk. Similarly, brand quality is more valuable for firms facing increasing competition (i.e., unanticipated decreases in industry concentration). The results are robust to endogeneity concerns and across alternative models. The authors conclude by discussing the nuanced implications of their findings for shareholder wealth, reporting brand quality to investors, and its use in employee evaluation.
