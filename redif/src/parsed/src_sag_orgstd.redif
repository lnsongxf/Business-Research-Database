Title: Imitating Uniqueness: How Big Cities Organize Big Events
Author-Name: Tatiana Pipan
Author-Name: Lena Porsander
Abstract: This article summarises two studies of how a city organized a big event: the Jubilee of the Third Millennium of Christianity (in Rome) and the Cultural Capital of Europe 1998 (in Stockholm). Despite their differences, the supposed uniqueness of both events and the temporary character of the organizations created for their construction, the studies reveal interesting similarities in how the actors framed the two organizing processes. Both the Jubilee and the Cultural Capital of Europe are, in fact, repetitive events. In both cases, the organizing process adopted was one of first delineating an appropriate organizational field, then choosing multiple models to imitate, whereby hybrid organizations were created, the desirable traits of which could then be translated into a local context. Thus the local context encourages variation, whereas global modelling results in events that are more similar to one another.

Title: Performing the Absolute. Marina Abramovic Organizing the Unfinished Business                 of Arthur Schopenhauer
Author-Name: Pierre Guillet de Monthoux
Abstract: Performance is a way of organising for value creation. The kind of value performance art aims to generate is neither use-nor exchange-value but aesthetic value, philosophically defined as searching for 'the absolute'. Philosophical asthetics, from Kant to Schopenhauer and Nietzsche, thus claims that art is the modem gateway to metaphysics. Pictures, texts and other artefacts are spin-offs of artists main function; performing the absolute. This paper illustrates this philosophical position by taking three practical examples which show how the artists Hans Makart, Herman Nitsch and Marina Abramovic three famous performance art managers - go about organizing the supply of an art to satisfy a demand for metaphysics.

Based on a personal account, it emphasizes the empathic-aesthetic understanding of action in interactive organizational contexts. The issues addressed are the social construction of organizational memory, the importance of time in organizational life, the interweaving between the reality and non reality of organizational artefacts, the pervasiveness of organizational reproduction, the relation between the 'I' and the 'eye' in the investigation of organizational processes, the improper use of organizational production, and the relationships between the collective and social construction of creativity niches.

Author-Name: Margaret M. Camina
Abstract: This article draws on the author's experience as a UK aid worker operating in a business support agency in former Yugoslavia and, through empirical work at employee level, seeks to understand the ways in which national cultural differences impinge on development work in economies undergoing transformation. Yugoslavia was the only Eastern block country included in Hofstede's major analysis of national cultural differences. A small-scale replication of his study, based on four comparable business support organizations, two in the United Kingdom and two in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, first examines the extent to which the fundamental differences which he identified still hold true and then looks at the ways in which the Macedonian findings can be interpreted as a legacy of empires. The implications of the cultural gap in the sphere of cross-national development assistance are then explored through a management log.

Title: Managerial Strategies of Domination. Power in Soft Bureaucracies
Author-Name: David Courpasson
Abstract: This paper discusses the emergence and reinforcement of organizational political regimes based on domination and centralization in French organizations. Domination and power are old concepts in organizational sociology, but the confrontation of two well-known approaches to politics in organizations, that of Weber and that of Crozier, suggests that an `archaic' notion such as domination is still very useful for understanding how business leaders `govern' organizations today.Based on empirical studies, the paper proposes that organizations should be seen as `soft bureaucracies', in which centralization and entrepreneurial forms of governance are combined. Thus, choosing a Weberian point of view, this paper simultaneously describes organizations as `structures of domination' and as `structures of legitimacy'. It defends the idea that, in spite of the success of the network form utopia, the re-emergence of bureaucracies is a sign that organizations are more and more politically centralized and governed.

Title: Entrepreneurship and the Evolution of Angel Financial Networks
Author-Name: Lloyd Steier
Author-Name: Royston Greenwood
Abstract: The success of a new venture often depends on an entrepreneur's ability to establish a network of supportive relationships. The mobilization of financial resources is a particularly important entrepreneurial activity. Informal or `angel' investors represent a significant source of venture capital. However, the challenges of organizing and managing a supportive angel network are considerable. This paper reports the findings of a longitudinal study of the development and evolution of an angel financial network within a newly created firm and further refines how theories of social capital and structural holes might be usefully applied to an entrepreneurial context. Suggestions for further research are presented in the form of propositions.

Title: Rule Enforcement among Peers: A Lateral Control Regime
Author-Name: Emmanuel Lazega
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to contribute to the understanding of control among peers. Drawing on a network study of a medium-sized Northeastern U.S. corporate law firm, this work shows that partners — all formally equal and locked in a cooperative situation — have developed an informal `lateral control regime' to help protect their common interests against free loading due to individual expressive problems. This regime helps peers exercise early monitoring and sanctioning by reducing costs of control. It maintains low costs through appropriate use of social resources or `relationships' between members. Sanctioners are chosen because they are structurally close to the infractors, but often also because they are relatively more powerful. Some of the costs of control are shown to be shifted to partners with a specific form of status within the firm, that of uncontroversial `protectors of the common good'. These main sanctioners help prevent situations in which infractors would be reserved preferential trea...

Title: Transaction Cost and Resource-Based Explanations of Joint Ventures: A Comparison and Synthesis
Author-Name: Eric W.K. Tsang
Abstract: Transaction cost theory has been the dominant theoretical lens used in the study of joint ventures. The purpose of this paper is to explain the formation of joint ventures from the resource-based perspective and to compare this perspective with transaction cost theory. By focusing on the cost aspect of a transaction, the transaction cost logic explains joint ventures in terms of market failure for intermediate inputs, asset specificity, and high uncertainty over specifying and monitoring performance. Putting more emphasis on the benefit side of a transaction, resource-based theory regards joint ventures as a means of exploiting and developing a firm's resources. The transaction cost and resource-based explanations are, to a certain extent, complementary. Taking the stance of theoretical pluralism, an attempt is made to synthesize the two theories into a more comprehensive perspective which takes both costs and benefits into account.

Abstract: This study examines the rise of discourse on uncertainty in management during th period 1879-1932. It offers quantitative empirical analyses that are based on primary data collected from the American Machinist and the Engineering Magazine, the central sources of documentation on management during this period. The research provides a critical interpretation of the emergence of uncertainty discourse by linking it to professional, cultural and social forces. The empirical findings lend strong empirical support for the `professionalization' and the `labour unrest' arguments. The implications for contemporary organization theory are discussed.

Title: Studying Moral Ethos Using an Adapted Kohlbergian Model
Author-Name: Robin S. Snell
Abstract: Alasdair MacIntyre's (1988) analysis of moral philosophy shows that liberal individualism, the dominant contemporary tradition, has failed to secure consensus on ethical principles. It follows that Kohlberg's stages model of socio-moral development, which proposes universal morality, lacks universal foundations. There are further pitfalls when applying the model to organizational moral ethos (OME). I argue that these problems can be circumvented, and I reformulate the Kohlberg model, building it into a framework for analyzing five interrelated sub-systems of organizational moral ethos. These are: approach to formal moral governance; basis of moral authority; deep implicit socialization; morality behind normative structure; and corporate outlook towards social responsibility. I present 19 propositions based on the core idea that in liberal individualist societies, postconventionally orientated OME would lead to a reduction in ethical dysfunctions such as bribery, discrimination, employee exploitation, dang...

Title: Comment: Gender Blindness or Gender Suppression? A Comment on Fiona Wilson's Research Note
Author-Name: Stephen Linstead
Abstract: This comment takes one term which Fiona Wilson in her excellent and useful review of the research on gender in organization studies makes central to her thesis. Whilst this term may be meaningfully applied to more recent studies of organizational behaviour with a largely technical emphasis, it cannot be applied accurately to the classical and human relations theorists — Taylor, Weber, Mayo and Maslow. Here they are very much aware of gender, and because of the nature of their particular knowledge projects, they actively suppress it. Contemporary reflexivity has again made blindness no longer an option — organization theory has to either embrace gender or suppress it, and acknowledge the motivations behind and the consequences of that suppression.

Title: The Evolution of Collective Strategies among Organizations
Author-Name: William P. Barnett
Author-Name: Gary A. Mischke
Author-Name: William Ocasio
Abstract: Many organizations are made up of other organizations that have decided to act collectively as with research and development consortia, industrial alliances, trade associations, and formal political coalitions. These collective organizations can be characterized by their differing strategies: some are general in scope, while others specialize on a more narrow purpose. What explains the prevalence of generalism and specialism among collective organizations? We develop an ecological model in which collective organizations compete over member organizations. Assuming that an organization joins a collective when its objectives match that of the collective, our model predicts a generalism bias in the ecology of founding and growth among collective organizations. This outcome is predicted to be path dependent, however, emerging over time according to relatively minor differences in initial conditions. These predictions are supported in an analysis of founding and growth rates among US R&D consortia, and the mode...

Title: Custom Service: Application and Tests of Resource-Partitioning Theory among Dutch Auditing Firms from 1896 to 1992
Author-Name: Christophe Boone
Author-Name: Vera Brdcheler
Author-Name: Glenn R. Carroll
Abstract: This article examines resource-partitioning theory in organizational ecology in the context of the Dutch auditing industry. The theory predicts that under certain conditions, specialist organizations will proliferate as the overall industry concentrates and becomes dominated by large generalist firms. Although Dutch auditing shows long-term trends towards market concentration and a burgeoning specialist sector, the professional service orientation of the industry presents some challenges for applying the theory. Accordingly, we first reconsider the theory in this new context. Using data on the life histories of (almost) all auditing firms ever to operate in the Netherlands, we also test the implications of the theory for exit rates of auditor organizations. Although we find substantial support for the basic theory, it is also apparent that resource-partitioning processes interact with regulatory changes in the institutional environment in interesting ways.

Title: Decreasing Concentration and Reversibility of the Resource Partitioning Process: Supply Shortages and Deregulation in the Bulgarian Newspaper Industry, 1987-1992
Author-Name: Stanislav D. Dobrev
Abstract: This paper examines the effect of decreasing industry concentration on organizational diversity and on the choice of positional strategies in the population of Bulgarian newspaper enterprises between 1987 and 1992. The results of the exit rate analysis of specialist organizations in a period of resource depletion confirm the reversibility of the resource partitioning process. In the case of post-socialist foundings spurred by deregulation, decreasing overall industry concentration is interpreted to conceal increasing concentration at the sub-industry level and points to the emergence of a second market centre. The formation of such polycentrist resource space accounts for the unexpected effect of overall diminishing industry concentration, which deters the entry of generalists and favours the start-up of specialists.

Title: Racing and Back-Pedalling into the Future: New Product Introduction and Organizational Mortality in the US Bicycle Industry, 1880-1918
Author-Name: Glen Dowell
Author-Name: Anand Swaminathan
Abstract: We hypothesize that some overlap of production between and within product generations reduces firm mortality, as it allows firms to retain valuable routines. Excessive overlap, however, becomes harmful. An analysis of the effects of new product introduction on mortality rates among the population of US bicycle producers over 1880-1918 supports our hypotheses. Our results suggest the value of separating out the content effects of innovation, which are often positive, from the process effects which tend to be disruptive.

Abstract: This paper examines founding rates of commercial banking organizations in Denmark between 1846 and 1989 with two main analytical objectives. The first is to provide an empirical test of the claim that density-dependent legitimation operates more broadly than density-dependent competition in the context of processes of organizational founding. The second objective strictly connected to the first is to learn more about the implications of using alternative analytical strategies to capture the effects of legitimation on organizational founding rates in the context of a specific empirical study. Predictions of the standard model of density dependence in organizational founding rates are found to be strongly supported at more aggregate levels of analysis. Because founding rates of banks located in Copenhagen are negatively affected by national density, only partial support is found for the multilevel density-dependence model. Finally, the paper documents the effects of asymmetric patterns of community-like int...

Title: Tacit Knowledge, Organizational Learning and Societal Institutions: An Integrated Framework
Author-Name: Alice Lam
Abstract: The importance of tacit knowledge in organizational learning and innovation has become the focus of considerable attention in the recent literature. Our understanding of the nature of the links between tacit knowledge and organizational learning, however, has been hampered by the lack of a conceptual framework integrating micro-level learning activities with organizational forms and macro-level societal institutions. This paper seeks to achieve such an integrative task. It argues that there is an interactive relationship between dominant knowledge types and organizational forms. Further, the extent to which tacit knowledge constitutes the knowledge base of the firm, and how it is formed and used are powerfully shaped by the broader institutional context. The paper develops a four-fold typology at the cognitive, organizational and societal levels, as an analytical framework to explain the links between knowledge types, organizational forms and societal institutions. It shows how the three levels interact t...

Title: Institutional Pressures and Symbolic Displays in a GAO Context
Author-Name: Mark W. Dirsmith

Author-Name: Parveen Gupta
Abstract: Two key organizational properties have long been studied: (1) the manner in which instrumental work processes are performed, and (2) the symbolic display of rational practice in response to institutional pressures. However, the relationship between these properties has proven to be contentious. For example, at different times, the sociology of professions, institutional theory and loose coupling perspectives have proposed that they should be decoupled and then loosely coupled with one another. Extending beyond these contending propositions, it has also been reasoned that a duality inheres in many elements of organizational structure such that they may be simultaneously instrumental and symbolic in character.To evaluate the relationship among institutional pressures, instrumental work processes and coordination practices, we administered a questionnaire to audit teams in the US General Accounting Office (GAO). Statistical results, augmented with field interviews, suggest that instrumental work processes ar...

Title: Power, Control and Computer-Based Performance Monitoring: Repertoires, Resistance and Subjectivities
Author-Name: Kirstie Ball
Author-Name: David C. Wilson
Abstract: This paper examines Computer-based Performance Monitoring (CBPM) in two UK financial services organizations. In doing so, it examines and critiques the existing manner in which this area has been theorized by both traditional and critical organization theorists. It then offers an alternative analysis of CBPM in terms of power, control and resistance, which involves the close interrogation of subject positioning within the speech of those who are subject to and manage this technology. By examining subject positions in interpretive repertoires, the paper demonstrates how power, control and resistance are constituted at an individual level and are specifically linked to the use (and abuse) of CBPM technology. It then further considers the nature and origins of the interpretive repertoires in relation to their organizational contexts, describing the differential circulation of disciplinary power in each. CBPM is thus understood as a politically neutral technology of power, which, when mobilized by management ...

Author-Name: Carmelo Mazza

Abstract: The transformation of management practices has recently become the object of many theoretical and empirical works. While most of these works focus mainly on universities, business schools and consulting firms, our paper aims at investigating the still largely unexplored role of the popular press in the production and legitimation of management ideas and practices. Based on the content analysis of the articles on human resource management published in the last decade in leading newspapers and magazines in Italy, we argue that popular press is the arena where the legitimacy of management ideas and practices is produced. We also suggest that the dynamics of management practice legitimation in Italy, described in this paper, is representative of similar processes occurring in other European countries.

Title: Essal: Reflections on Fiction, Representation, and Organization Studies: An Essay with Special Reference to the Work of Jorge Luis Borges
Author-Name: Christian De Cock
Abstract: This essai examines how Borges' narrative fiction may contribute to a reconceptualization of organizational interpretation and representation, and thus complexify the thinking of both organizational theorists and practitioners. This exploration is situated against the background of an increasing awareness of the fictionality of organizational life, and a sensitivity towards the representational practices employed by organizational scholars as they seek to construct persuasive accounts of the theory and practice of organization. By pushing standard interpretative and representational practices to their limits, we can reveal their arbitrariness (and sometimes absurdity), and thus open up new positions of intelligibility. In the denatured contexts of the digital economy, Borges' fantastic fictions appear closer to temporal experience than the authoritative discourses with which mainstream organizational discourse has accustomed us.

Title: The Threat of Failure, the Perils of Success and CEO Character: Sources of Strategic Persistence
Author-Name: Veronica Kisfalvi
Abstract: The survival and continuing prosperity of an organization depends on its ability to remain flexible and responsive to changes in its own performance levels as well as in its environment. However, some organizations persist instead in pursuing strategies that may no longer be appropriate and that can at times turn out to be disastrous. There are two related streams of explanations for this phenomenon: those that see inappropriate strategic persistence as a possible response to potential failure (escalating commitment to a chosen course of action) and those that see it as a possible outcome of success (the perils of success or excellence). Based on findings from a case study, this article argues that the strategist's character-based personal issues can also contribute to strategic persistence.

Title: Research Note: CEO Locus of Control and Small Firm Performance

Abstract: Boone et al. (1996) reported that Chief Executive Officer (CEO) locus of control was significantly associated with profitability in a cross-sectional study of 39 small firms. As the authors could not rule out the possibility that firm performance causes an internal locus of control rather than the other way around, a follow-up study was performed to provide us with a possible clarification of the direction of causation. We traced the life history of each of these 39 firms and analyzed the relationship between locus of control and long-run organizational survival. We found that 21 percent of the 39 firms studied in Boone et al. (1996) went bankrupt within 6 years. Among the CEOs classified as internals, only 1 company failed (1 out of 14), whereas among the external CEOs 45 percent did not survive (5 out of 11). We also found that the differences between internal and external CEOs were only observable for firms that were relatively unprofitable in 1990-1991, indicating that short-term performance shields t...

Title: Corporate Greening as Amoralization
Author-Name: Andrew Crane
Abstract: This paper explores the moral dimension of corporate greening. Drawing on extensive case-study evidence from three organizational types, the proposition is advanced that there is a tendency in corporations for greening to be accompanied by a process of amoralization, i.e. a lack of moral meaning and significance for organization members in relation to the natural environment. By presenting corporate greening in terms of issue selling, specific processes of amoralization are identified in the symbolic action and impression management behaviours of policy champions. Variations in these processes across organizational types are explored and potential explanations are advanced with recourse to the organizational politics, power and culture literatures. The implications of these findings are discussed in the context of the actual and potential role played by morality in advancing corporate greening.

Title: The Project of Rationalization: A Critique and Reappraisal of Neo-Institutionalism in Organization Studies
Author-Name: Hans Hasselbladh
Author-Name: Jannis Kallinikos
Abstract: This article critically approaches various neo-institutional accounts of the process of formal organizing. While acknowledging the importance of the overall orientation marked by neo-institutional studies, the article identifies several crucial aspects that have escaped the attention of neo-institutional research. In particular, it criticizes the inability of neo-institutionalism to provide an account of the means linking situated forms of organizing with wider instrumental beliefs and practices, in terms other than adaptivist, diffusionist. Such a limitation is partly a consequence of unwillingness of neo-institutionalism to focus on and analyze the very architecture of the rationalized patterns and relationships which neo-institutionalists claim to be diffusing across organizational populations and fields. Drawing on several sources, the article develops a framework that seeks to outline the conceptual means for decomposing the carriers of rationalized patterns, models and techniques and showing the dis...

Title: Constructing Organizations: The Example of Public Sector Reform
Author-Name: Nils Brunsson
Author-Name: Kerstin Sahlin-Andersson
Abstract: Organizations are socially constructed phenomena. A crucial task for organizational research is to analyze how and why people construct organizations rather than other social forms. In this paper, it is argued that recent public-sector reforms can be interpreted as attempts at constructing organizations. Public-sector entities that could formerly be described as agents or arenas have been transformed into `more complete' organizations by installing or reinforcing local identity, hierarchy and rationality. This interpretation helps to explain important aspects of the reform process.

Title: Developing Managers: The Functional, the Symbolic, the Sacred and the Profane
Author-Name: Ken Kamoche
Abstract: This paper offers a new perspective on international management by examining the role of culture and management development in creating international expertise, a sense of identity and realizing organizational control. A critical analysis of the culture transmission and management development philosophy and practice of a UK-based transnational reveals how the transmission of culture accomplishes management development objectives, while management development itself serves as a vehicle for the transmission of the desired corporate values. This recursiveness is sustained by a corporate ideology that urges the creation of integrative values and, in turn, is legitimized by the quest for favorable functional and symbolic consequences.

Title: Advanced Manufacturing Technologies and HRM Policies. Findings from Chemical and Food and Drink Companies in the Netherlands and Great Britain
Author-Name: Mariele G. Heijltjes
Abstract: This paper explores in two steps the relationship between the design of HRM policies and the use of advanced manufacturing technologies. First, the relationship between advanced manufacturing technologies and changes in the production environment is examined. Second, changes in the production environment are related to the design of HRM policies. For one, data from ten Dutch and eight British companies in the chemical and food and drink industries indicate that the use of advanced manufacturing technologies significantly alters the production environment in terms of product, production and process flexibility. The strength of the impact, however, differs between large batch and mass production on the one hand and continuous process production on the other, and is dependent on the type(s) of automation methods implemented. Subsequently, a refined classification of manufacturing types is developed to relate these changes to the design of HRM policies.

Abstract: In this paper we attempt to bridge the gap between theory and practice by developing the concept of `resourceful sensemaking'.1 Resourceful sensemaking is the ability to appreciate the perspectives of others and use this understanding to enact horizon-expanding discourse. Using a critical events technique, we assess the resourcefulness of the sensemaking activities of individuals in interdisciplinary product development teams. Data include researchers' and stakeholders' observations of teams in action, careful reviews of documents and questionnaires completed by team members and selected stakeholders, and interviews with team members and other stakeholders during, and six months after completion of, the projects. We focus attention on the articulation of the resourceful sensemaking concept rather than on the formulation of testable propositions. We end the paper with a discussion of the implications of our study for work organizations using interdisciplinary product development teams.

Title: The Institutional Structuring of Innovation Strategies: Business Systems, Firm Types and Patterns of Technical Change in Different Market Economies
Author-Name: Richard Whitley
Abstract: Innovation patterns and technological specialization vary considerably between market economies with different institutions because they coordinate economic activities in different ways with different kinds of firms developing contrasting innovation strategies. Six major forms of economic organization, or business systems, with different kinds of firms can be distinguished: fragmented, coordinated industrial district, compartmentalized, collaborative, highly coordinated and state organized. These kinds of business system develop and are reproduced in particular institutional contexts. They are associated with five kinds of innovation strategies: dependent, craft-based responsive, generic, complex and risky, and transformative. These strategies can be distinguished in terms of the following characteristics of innovations: technical and user uncertainty, user differentiation and product quality specialization, organizational competence destruction, use of codified knowledge, and the complexity of the knowle...

Title: Institutional Adaptiveness, Technology Policy, and the Diffusion of New Business Models: The Case of German Biotechnology
Author-Name: Steven Casper
Abstract: The German economy has been widely seen as failing to develop the commercial innovation competencies necessary to compete in new technologies. Starting in the mid-1990s, the German government instituted a series of new technology policies designed to orchestrate the development of small entrepreneurial technology firms. These policies have fostered several hundred new high-technology start-ups in Germany. This development represents an interesting challenge to prevailing institutional theory, which tends to view the characteristics of organizations as strongly constrained by the orientation of a number of key national institutional frameworks. Focusing on biotechnology, this article examines the relative importance of national institutional frameworks as opposed to sector-specific policies that are presently pervasive in Germany. Analysis of the new firms demonstrates that Germany's new technology policies have facilitated important extensions within the business system that have, for the first time, allo...

Title: Institutions and Forms of Co-ordination in Innovation Systems
Author-Name: Bart Nooteboom
Abstract: This article shows how institutions enable and constrain forms of co-ordination for inter-organizational relations, and how these affect innovative performance. The analysis is based on a theory of learning and on a theory of relations that combines a social exchange perspective with elements from transaction cost economics. Performance is analysed in terms of production costs, transaction costs, product differentiation, diffusion of innovations, incremental innovation, and radical innovation. The method is illustrated with a comparison between the US and Germany. The first is more flexible and market oriented; the second is more oriented towards inter-organizational networks. Policy recommendations focus on how flexibility and durability of relations might be reconciled.

Title: Innovation Systems and Innovative Performance: Voice Systems
Author-Name: Brigitte Unger
Abstract: The literature on `exit' and `voice' countries (Anglo-American versus continental European economies and Japan) points to performance differences between these two generic systems of innovation. However, little has been done so far to study differences among voice countries. This paper suggests that four `voice' countries, Austria, Finland, the Netherlands, and Germany, with stable long-term trust relations between economic actors and a relatively consensual style of decision making, show substantial differences in innovative performance. I argue that this is due to both sector specialization and the institutional environment. This is because the capacity to escape from historical patterns of industrial specialization depends in part on the set of institutions in a country. They provide important resources for innovation, such as capital and skilled personnel. Indirectly, innovations are affected by the system of economic governance, which is more or less corporatist in these four countries. However, a co...

Title: A Strategy for the Analysis of Idea Innovation Networks and Institutions
Author-Name: Jerald Hage
Author-Name: J. Rogers Hollingsworth
Abstract: The perspective of this paper is that variation in commercially successful radical product/process innovations among science-based industrial sectors can be explored by focusing on idea innovation networks. Idea innovation networks have six arenas reflecting research basic research, applied research, product development research, production research, quality control research, and commercialization/ marketing research. The paper develops two interrelated hypotheses. The first is that the greater the diversity of competencies or knowledges that are connected with frequent and intense communication within an arena and the greater the size of the arena, and the greater the likelihood that radical innovations will emerge. The second hypothesis involves the same kind of logic: if radical solutions are to occur in more than one arena, there must be intense and frequent communication among the different arenas involving radically new ways of thinking. Radical research solutions in one arena usually involve tacit ...

Title: Ordinary Theorists in Mixed Industries
Author-Name: Roland Calori
Abstract: In this article, the collective knowledge of practitioners, expressed in narratives and translated into a rigorous form (cognitive maps) is considered as a useful contribution to theory building. The article discusses the epistemic foundations of this pragmatic approach to organization studies, presents a method for analyzing and integrating the knowledge of practitioners, and reports an application in which such collective practical knowledge is compared to mainstream theories of the dynamics of international competition

Title: Relational Demography and Relationship Quality in Two Cultures
Author-Name: Lisa Hope Pelled
Author-Name: Katherine R. Xin
Abstract: Prior research has shown that demographic similarity between supervisors and sub-ordinates shapes supervisor-subordinate relationship quality in US settings. The current study extends this body of research by comparing effects in a US production facility to effects in a Mexican facility owned by the same company. Results suggest that, in both locations, demographic similarity influences the quality of relationships between supervisors and subordinates. The specific patterns in Mexico, however, are not identical to those in the United States. Age similarity has negative effects on relationship quality in Mexico, but not in the United States. Also, gender similarity has a stronger positive impact on one dimension of relationship quality (trust) in Mexico, but it has a stronger positive impact on a second dimension of relationship quality (leader-member exchange) in the United States. Both the overlap and disparities between demography effects in the two regions are important considerations when attempting t...

Title: Technology Adoption: Organizational Learning in Oil Firms Jaana Woiceshyn
Author-Name: Jaana Woiceshyn
Abstract: What makes the adoption of technology in some firms a successful process, while others experience difficulties? Based on a retrospective case study, this paper compares the process of adopting horizontal drilling technology in two large Canadian oil companies; one a more successful and the other a less successful adopter of technology. Adoption is viewed as a process of organizational learning which proceeds in a feedback loop from observing, interpreting, integrating to acting. The two companies differed both in these processes and in the factors facilitating or impeding them: capability, resources, motivation, effort, shared values, incentives, and external triggers. The implications for researchers and managers are discussed.

Title: Towards a Process Model of Corporate Greening
Author-Name: Monika L Winn
Author-Name: Linda C. Angell
Abstract: Internal processes of corporate greening have received little scholarly attention. A two-study investigation of consumer-goods producers, implementing environmental management and subject to the 1991 German Packaging Ordinance offers new insights. Findings from Study 1, an exploratory factor analysis, suggest two independent dimensions of environmental management: Policy Commitment and Approach to Implementation. We expand traditional strategic change models, and generate a typology of four types of corporate greening: Deliberate Reactive, Unrealized, Emergent Active, and Deliberate Proactive greening. These are fleshed out with four known cases in Study 2. Alternative conceptual scenarios, developed to explain those types with inconsistent values for Policy Commitment and Implementation, point to new directions for research on the dynamics of internal processes of corporate greening. We conclude with implications for corporate social performance and strategic process models.

Title: If Ethics is the Answer, You are Asking the Wrong Questions. A Reply to Martin Parker
Author-Name: Paul Thompson
Author-Name: Chris Smith
Author-Name: Stephen Ackroyd
Abstract: In OS Volume 20/1 Martin Parker contributed an article, `Capitalism, Subjectivity and Ethics: Debating Labour Process Analysis', in which he examined two camps within the UK labour process debate, and suggested the differences within both camps could be overcome by moving the debate on the labour process into the realm of moral philosophy. The two camps he identified broadly fall into materialists and post-structuralists. We have been identified as the principle exponents of the former group, and David Knights and Hugh Willmott the latter. Parker's misinterpretation of our contribution to writing on the labour process over the last decade, and our involvement with the International Labour Process Conference held in the UK over the last 17 years, requires that we try and set the record straight. The editor of OS has kindly allowed this to happen. We have tried to elucidate Parker's position as clearly as possible before indicating our objections, but readers may wish to read our reply alongside the origina...

Title: Competition between Alliance Blocks: The Case of the RISC Microprocessor Technology
Author-Name: Wim Vanhaverbeke
Author-Name: Niels G. Noorderhaven
Abstract: Competition between alliance blocks is a new form of rivalry: groups of firms link together for a common purpose by means of strategic alliances, and competition between alliance blocks is superimposed on competition between individual firms. This paper focuses on alliance blocks in the RISC microprocessor field. In this field, alliance block competition is shaped by battles over technical standards. Based on an analysis of the competitive forces in standards battles, and taking into consideration the need for internal coordination within alliance blocks, we expect to find the formation of alliance blocks around the various proprietary RISC designs, with scarce linkages across blocks. The blocks will consist of complementary firms, including all the capabilities necessary to compete against other alliance blocks. The requisites of internal coordination, finally, lead us to expect alliance blocks with star-like internal structures when the central firm has either a very weak, or a very strong position. In ...

Title: Cuban-American Entrepreneurs: Chance, Complexity and Chaos
Author-Name: Mark F. Peterson
Author-Name: Mark R. Meckler
Abstract: Bouchikhi (1993) introduces themes from chaos and complexity theory to gain an understanding about chance in entrepreneurship. We expand on these themes using an example from the Cuban immigrants to South Florida to increase the dynamism of Waldinger et al.'s (1990) model of immigrant entrepreneurship. These complexity and chaos themes are: (1) large differences in outcomes can come from small differences in initial conditions; (2) largely unpredictable, radical changes can be intermixed with and become directly dependent on incremental, predictable changes; (3) short-term predictability can accompany long-term nonpredictability; (4) seemingly random patterns can show an apparent attraction to specific configurations; and (5), mutual influence among a small number of predictors can appear to be random. An example from among the leading Cuban-born entrepreneurs illustrates three levels of generality in entrepreneurship theory. Most generally, this person's career reflects abstract conclusions about entrepr...

Abstract: This paper focuses on a single event in an organization — a meeting about the news bills and their presumed sales effects on a Swedish evening newspaper. The paper has three purposes. One is (strictly) empirical and shows in detail some aspects the editorial side of newspaper publishing. We show how shared meanings and a joint identification is accomplished, facilitating newspaper editorial work. A second purpose is methodological and illustrates the option of doing in-depth studies of micro events as a way of making organizations visible. Arguably, some situations in organizations may be seen as the organization `written small' and the close and detailed interpretation of these may, if combined with sufficient back-ground and context knowledge, open up a window for a broader understanding of organizations. The third, and most significant, purpose is to develop ideas about identity and identity construction in a specific work organizational context. In particular, we take an interest in how the self-regul...

Title: The Organization of Charisma: Promoting, Creating, and Idealizing Self
Author-Name: Stuart J. M. Weierter
Abstract: This paper focuses on charisma made possible by organization. For such charisma to emerge, two conditions are necessary. The first condition is that potential members perceive in the organization, something of profound significance for their lives. The second is that the organization offers the means through which this profound significance may be attained. Based on these two conditions, three charismatic relationships are described: the self-promoting, the self-creating, and the self-idealizing. In order to provide a more fully detailed account of the relationship between member expectations and satisfaction by an organization, an interpretivist study, which focuses on the way in which charisma is organized and sustained, is presented.

Title: `Doing' Organizational Culture in the Saturn Corporation
Author-Name: Terry L. Mills

Author-Name: Sandra Lorean
Abstract: As we break loose from an urban-industrial way of life and become engulfed in technological, information-based worlds, this dramatic shift in reality pushes many of us towards feelings of intense crisis. The fragmentation of the macro-cultural framework enables a multiplicity of thought-styles to emerge. This rise of social multiplicity, plurality, fragmentation, and indeterminacy leads to aggressive criticisms of traditional modern culture and politics. Yet while there is a break from the rationalized, homogeneous modern world, the `postmodern' world remains ambiguous. Deeply rooted within this struggle for meaning lies language and knowing. Reality is `made real' through language and thought. One way to remain organized is through the manipulation of thought through language. How is a meaningful, stable existence conveyed in a world in which the taken for granted meanings and stability that were `there' in modern settings now appear to be shattered? Our analysis of the Saturn Corporation, USA, focuses o...

Title: Patterns of Interactive Learning in a High-tech Region
Author-Name: Marius T.H. Meeus
Author-Name: Leon A.G. Oerlemans
Author-Name: Jerald Hage
Abstract: This paper aims at developing a theoretical framework that explains levels of interactive learning. Interactive learning is defined as the exchange and sharing of knowledge resources conducive to innovation between an innovator firm, its suppliers, and/or its customers. Our research question is: Why do levels of interactive learning of innovator firms, their customers, and/or suppliers vary? Our theoretical framework combines a resource-based perspective with an activity-based account of interactive learning. It starts with a resource-based argument, which is specified by introducing competing and complementary theoretical arguments such as the complexity and structuring of innovative activities, and sectoral technological dynamics. The strength of internal knowledge resources can either hamper or facilitate levels of interactive learning. We assume that more complex innovative activities urge firms to co-ordinate and exchange information between users and producers, which implies a higher level of intera...

Title: Organization, Trust and Control: A Realist Analysis
Author-Name: Michael I. Reed
Abstract: This paper develops a critical realist analysis of trust/control relations within and between complex organizations. It suggests that trust/control relations are most usefully seen as structures of interrelated `positioned-practices' which generate, shape and constrain the development of contrasting forms of expert power in a range of organizational contexts. The paper opens with a general overview of a number of currently influential theoretical perspectives on trust/control relations in social and organizational analysis. It then proceeds to advance a critical realist analysis of trust/control relations as generative mechanisms that govern, but do not determine, the production, reproduction and transformation of expert power. The explanatory significance of this realist analysis is illustrated by reference to a limited number of historical and institutional case studies on expert technologies and practices

Title: Trust, Control and Post-Bureaucracy
Author-Name: Chris Grey
Author-Name: Christina Garsten
Abstract: This paper is a contribution to the analysis of intra-organizational trust. From a discussion of concepts of trust, we suggest that trust is something which is constructed for and by people in organizations, thereby producing some degree of predictability. Trust is a precarious social accomplishment enacted through the interplay of social or discursive structures, including those of work organizations, and individuated subjects. We argue that bureaucratic organizations effected this construction in such an efficient manner that it `disappeared' as an issue for organizational theorists, but that shifting organizational forms have re-opened it. We suggest that the advent of corporate culturism in the 1980s offered one kind of reconfiguration of trust in organizations. However, subsequent extensions of organizational reform have undermined corporate culture as a way of constructing trust. These extensions, which, with some caveats, may be called post-bureaucratic, have brought with them new potential bases f...

Title: Trust, Control, and Risk in Strategic Alliances: An Integrated Framework
Author-Name: T. K. Das
Author-Name: Bing-Sheng Teng
Abstract: Trust and control are inextricably interlinked with risk in strategic alliances. Hence, to understand how partner firms can effectively reduce and manage this risk, we need to examine the inter-relationships between trust, control, and risk. In this article, we propose a comprehensive and integrated framework of the three constructs in the context of strategic alliances, contending that trust and control are the two principal antecedents of risk. First, we suggest that the three constructs are each comprised of certain key dimensions. Risk can be considered separately as relational risk and performance risk. The two dimensions of trust are identified as goodwill trust and competence trust, and control is differentiated in terms of the three modes of behaviour control, output control, and social control. Second, we discuss systematically the various linkages between the different types of trust, control, and risk in alliances. Third, we suggest several risk reduction approaches — minimizing relational risk...

Title: When `Silence = Death', Keep Talking: Trust, Control and the Discursive Construction of Identity in the Canadian HIV/AIDS Treatment Domain
Author-Name: Steve Maguire
Author-Name: Nelson Phillips
Author-Name: Cynthia Hardy
Abstract: When we trust someone, it is because we believe there is something about his or her behaviour that makes it predictable. From a control perspective, it means that their behaviour is subject to some type of control mechanism. Building on this connection, we argue that trust and control are closely related and, in fact, that different forms of trust are associated with different types of control. We present a model explaining the control mechanisms associated with three different forms of trust commonly proposed in the literature. Based on a three-year study of the Canadian HIV/AIDS treatment domain, we then explore in more detail the dynamics of identification-based trust and normative control. Our findings reveal the discursive foundations of generating identification-based trust

Author-Name: David Knights

Author-Name: Hugh Willmott
Abstract: In recent years, the topic of trust has become the focus of renewed attention in organizational theory and research and, in particular, where electronic distribution and associated `virtual' forms of organizing are prevalent. The question of trust, always an issue in financial transactions, is exacerbated the more the physical element is removed. The paper focuses on the issue of trust as it currently appears in the newest of these distribution channels, online and Internet financial services, and smart cards. In both theory and practice, notions of trust are often opposed to concepts such as power or control, and are deployed as part of a dualistic either/or proposition. Drawing on ongoing research in the financial services sector, the paper attempts a more nuanced exploration by focusing on attempts to `manage' trust, the problems such attempts encounter, the various techniques employed in their resolution and the power relations in which they are embedded

Title: Trust, Power and Control in Trans-Organizational Relations
Author-Name: Reinhard Bachmann
Abstract: This paper analyzes trust and power as means of co-ordinating trans-organizational relationships. It is argued that, depending on the institutional environment, there are two distinct patterns of controlling relationships, where trust and power are interrelated in quite different ways. First, both mechanisms are generated at the inter-personal level and either trust or power dominates the relationship. Second, power occurs at the level of the structural framework of relationships and is highly conducive to developing trust between individual organizations. Thus, specific forms of trust and power are identified and the institutional environment is viewed as playing a crucial role in shaping the quality of trans-organizational relations. The theoretical background of the paper mainly draws on conceptual ideas of Systems Theory, Structuration Theory and New Institutionalism

Title: Firm Selection: An Integrative Perspective
Author-Name: Rodolphe Durand
Abstract: This paper highlights the variable intensity of selection pressure on firms. Failing to include a theory of selection pressure in assessing a firm's performance can lead to ambiguous or incomplete judgements on the rationales of the firm's success. Building on previous threads of literature (population ecology, evolutionary economics, and the dynamic resource-based view of the firn), this paper paves the way for a unified theory of selection through seven research propositions. Emphasis is placed on the fact that managers can use the determinants of selection strategically, either to avoid the direct pressure of selection or to pass it on competitors.

Title: Revisiting Organizational Legitimation: Cognitive Diffusion and Sociopolitical Factors in the Evolution of Bulgarian Newspaper Enterprises, 1846-1992
Author-Name: Stanislav D. Dobrev
Abstract: Arguments about constitutive and sociopolitical legitimation of organizational forms are applied to studying the evolutionary dynamics of the Bulgarian news paper industry as it transitioned through multiple political and institutional environments. The notion of relegitimation is advanced in the context of comparing the cognitive diffusion of the organizational form prior to the Communist takeover in 1946, and its revival in the collective memory of the public after 1989. Variation in the rate of organizational founding is also linked empirically to the strength of political turbulence. Violent political conflict deters new foundings, while institutionally mediated political activism has a positive effect on the rate of organizational entry.

Title: Power, Identity and New Technology Homework: Implications for `New Forms' of Organizing
Author-Name: Michael Brocklehurst
Abstract: This paper reports on research which tracked the experience of a group of professional workers as they moved from being conventional office workers to becoming homeworkers where they used the new information and communication technologies (ICT's), but remained as full-time salaried employees. The paper evaluates the value of Giddens's conceptualization of power, identity and time/space in explaining the consequences of this move and compares his approach to post modem theorizations, which draw on the work of Foucault and Lash and Urry. The paper concludes with the view that such a form of organization is neither inherently corrosive of character (Sennett 1998) nor does it provide a space for aesthetic reflexivity (Lash and Urry 1994). What has yet to develop is a sense of `the other' within the emerging discourse serving to articulate this new form of organizing.

Title: Strategic Alliances and the Learning Life-Cycle of Biotechnology Firms
Author-Name: Amalya L. Oliver
Abstract: Strategic alliances in the biotechnology industry are used as an inter-organizational learning device, in addition to their ability to provide financial resources, vertical and horizontal integration facilities, and legitimacy to dedicated biotechnology firms (DBFs). However, despite the advantages associated with strategic alliances, the literature accounts for hazards and disadvantages as well. This paper analyzes the relationship between organizational life-cycle and the formation of strategic alliances based on a population of 554 new biotechnology firms (DBFs) in a 15-year period. Using event history analysis, this study tests two propositions: that the inability of DBFs to form strategic alliances will be associated with organizational death and that firm growth will make it possible to reduce network learning through alliances (exploration stage of learning), allowing the firm to enter a period of internalized learning (exploitation). These propositions are supported by the data. The findings showe...

Author-Name: Ingmar Bjorkman
Author-Name: Yuan Lu
Abstract: The human resource management (HRM) practices associated with local professionals and managerial-level employees in international joint ventures are analyzed in a study of 63 Chinese-Western joint ventures. Over all, the HRM practices more closely resemble those of the foreign parent company, than those of local companies. Institutionalization theory as well as the bargaining power perspective were instrumental in explaining the degree to which the HRM practices in the joint ventures were similar to those of the foreign parent company.

Title: Globalization, Athletic Footwear Commodity Chains and Employment Relations in China
Author-Name: Stephen J. Frenkel
Abstract: Globalization has hastened the growth of buyer-driven commodity chains that connect advanced country marketing or retail companies with contractors manufaturing in low-cost, developing countries. Allegations of labour exploitation have been levelled at the global firms for turning a blind eye to their contractors' labour practices. In response, some firms have implemented codes of practice. This paper focuses on the operation of these codes in two leading athletic shoe buyer-driven chains and their contractor plants in Southern China. The codes are administered differently by the two firms, encouraging a less authoritarian, more human-resource-oriented approach at the two plants associated with the larger and more successful global firm. Nevertheless, employment conditions at all four plants meet the requirements of the corporate codes of practice. The one major exception relates to worker representation and collective bargaining. While the current international context is conducive to upholding labour st...

Title: Effects of Reputational Sanctions on the Competitive Imitation of Design Innovations
Author-Name: Gerda Gemser
Author-Name: Nachoem M. Wijnberg
Abstract: This study examines whether and under what conditions reputational sanctions are a strong deterrent to imitative firm behaviour. Results indicate that reputational sanctions can be an effective barrier to imitation, in particular when firms perceive a reputation for innovation to be a factor in their competitive success. Linkages between firms foster the effectiveness of this barrier to imitation, as such linkages make it relatively easy to detect imitative behaviour and to impose reputational sanctions.

Title: `Two-Way Windows': Clinicians as Medical Managers
Author-Name: Sue Llewellyn
Abstract: This paper uses the metaphor of the `two-way window' to understand the aspirations and activities of clinical directors (doctors with management responsibilities). Clinical directors work simultaneously with sets of ideas from both clinical practice and from management, therefore, their role (as `two-way windows') allows the possibility to create a new area of expertise — medical-management. To explore how `two-way windows' are being constituted, clinician managers in three medical organizations were interviewed. Three narratives were constructed from their accounts. The first narrative outlines the theories-in-use of clinical directors, the second and third consist of the strategizing of clinical directors as they seek to maintain their primary focus on clinical work whilst, at the same time, developing their management expertise and influence. The paper concludes that clinical directors can relatively easily occupy the `two-way' space opened up by the mediation of medicine and management. Only a lack of...

Title: Organizational Responses to an Environmental Bill of Rights
Author-Name: Ruth Burnice McKay
Abstract: Organizations are continually confronted by new regulatory pressures, but there is debate as to how much freedom organizations have to select a strategic response to such pressures. Organizations do not respond to a regulatory pressure in isolation, but rather in concert with, and in reaction to, the response of other relevant stakeholders and pressures within the environment. This inductive study contributes to the established resource dependence and institutional literature by examining organizational responses to a new external regulatory pressure, the Ontario (Canada) Environmental Bill of Rights, and the influences that motivated such responses. Results of the study challenge the mechanistic approach of organizational responses to external pressures, presenting evidence of the interactive nature of such responses. This research also revealed four organizational strategies and three influences, not previously identified in organizational theory, which motivate organizational responses.

Title: Institutionalized Mindsets of Invulnerability: Differentiated Institutional Fields and the Antecedents of Organizational Crisis
Author-Name: David Wicks
Abstract: Building on Scott's (1995) institutional theory framework, this article uses a micro institutional approach to develop a model of the institutionalization of mind-sets in a differentiated institutional field. This model is grounded in textual data involving the 1992 explosion at Westray Mines, illustrating how regulative, normative and cognitive elements contributed to the institutionalization of a harmful mindset of invulnerability that clouded individual perceptions of the inherent risks in daily work practices. This process culminates in organizational crisis.

Title: The Production of Distrust by Means of Producing Trust
Author-Name: Peter Walgenbach
Abstract: ISO 9000 certifications are spreading throughout the world. ISO 9000 standards and certification should serve as a verification that it is justified to trust the ability of a supplier to produce quality goods. In this paper, results of an empirical study on the use of ISO 9000 standards and ISO 9000 certification in Germany will be presented. An important finding is that the standards and the certification do not, as was intended, serve as a means for producing trust between customers and suppliers. Reasons as to why ISO 9000 certification does not serve as a means for producing an institutional-based type of trust will be presented. However, despite the fact that certification does not produce trust, the implementation of the standards was evaluated positively by the organizations investigated. The implementation of the ISO 9000 standards was regarded as an occasion for structuring and led to the development of a system of bureaucratic control that was both enabling and coercive.

Title: Minimal Structures: From Jazz Improvisation to Product Innovation
Author-Name: Ken Kamoche
Author-Name: Miguel Pina e Cunha
Abstract: This paper demonstrates how the art form jazz improvisation can be applied to organizational innovative activities, focusing specifically on product innovation. In the past, the literature on product innovation focused on well-planned approaches which followed a clearly-understood structure based on a rational-functionalist paradigm. However, it is becoming increasingly evident that this model is inappropriate in today's highly competitive business environment. A balance between structure and flexibility seems to be an appropriate way to manage the contradicting demands of control and creativity faced by organizations in highly competitive environments. Jazz improvisation provides this synthesis through the concept of `minimal structures'. We characterize the minimal structures that allow jazz improvisers to merge composition and performance, and then proceed to apply this approach to new product development.

Title: Institutions and Innovation: The Legal Environment of Innovating Firms
Author-Name: Frans van Waarden
Abstract: The literature on `national systems of innovation' emphasizes that the innovative capacity of nations depends on their institutions. This paper investigates the influence of an ideal-typical institution, law and regulations, on innovation, both directly and indirectly, through its influence on the organizational structure of — and cooperation between — firms that (may) engage in innovation. The paper starts by noting that innovation is fraught with risk and uncertainty which raise transaction costs. If these costs become too high, one would expect firms to refrain from investing in innovation. A major function of law and regulation is to reduce such risk and uncertainty. However, national legal systems differ in their capacity to reduce risk and uncertainty both effectively and efficiently. A typology of legal systems is introduced, based on two dimensions: an emphasis on regulation or on litigation; and an active or passive use of these. Subsequently, two legal systems are compared, which form more or le...

Title: On the Shape of Verbal Networks in Organizations
Author-Name: Reed E. Nelson
Abstract: Almost without exception, organizations contain a pyramid-shaped formal hierarchy of some sort. It is also known that organizations harbour frequent informal relations that do not necessarily follow patterns set by the formal hierarchy. While the shape and features of formal hierarchies are known and understood by most members of organizations, very little is known — by either academics or practitioners — about the shape and attributes of these informal relations. This paper explores regularities in the shape of verbal ties — a relationship that escapes most formal regulation — across the hierarchies of diverse organizations. Results indicate that the verbal networks of the upper echelons of organizations rarely follow a classic hierarchical pattern. Rather, several different morphologies surface. The most common of these regularities — the centre-periphery pattern — has been frequently observed in large human systems, including tribal and modern societies, national and international economies, industries...

Title: Cooperation Contracts between Embedded Firms
Author-Name: Boris F. Blumberg
Abstract: Successful inter-firm cooperations require that the participating partners mitigate potential opportunistic behaviour. Contractual commitments are one management mechanism to achieve stable mutual cooperation. However, the impossibility in designing complete, explicit and easily enforceable contracts restricts their efficacy as a management mechanism. Mechanisms based on the social embeddedness of the partners can form a viable alternative and compliment for contracts. Hence, the usage of contractual commitments is explained by combining transaction cost economic reasoning with arguments on the social embeddedness of economic transactions. Finally, the derived hypotheses are tested on a data-set of 92 cooperations within five Dutch multinationals.

Title: Organizational Climate Similarity and Performance: International Joint Ventures in Russia

Abstract: This study examines how organizational climate dissimilarity between parent firms and the joint venture organization (JVO) affects joint venture performance. Data were obtained from interviews with the general manager of 40 IJVs and questionnaires were completed by top-level managers from both parents and the JVO (6 people / IJV). Results indicate that to have the best chance of success, it is important for a firm starting a joint venture to select a partner with an organizational climate similar to its own. Results also indicate that it is important to create an organizational climate at the JVO that is similar to the foreign parent's organizational climate.

Author-Name: Candace Jones
Abstract: An historical case analysis of the American film industry is undertaken to gain a better understanding of the co-evolutionary processes of entrepreneurial careers, institutional rules and competitive dynamics in emerging industries. The study compares technology and content-focused periods, which were driven by entrepreneurs with different career histories and characterized by distinct institutional rules and competitive dynamics. Archival data and historical analysis is used to trace how entrepreneurial careers, firm capabilities, institutional rules, and competitive dynamics co-evolved. A co-evolutionary perspective is integrated with insights from institutional and resource-based theories to explain how the American film industry emerged, set an initial trajectory with specific institutional rules and competitive dynamics, and then changed.

Title: Trajectories in the Evolution of Technology: A Multi-Level Study of Competition in Formula 1 Racing
Author-Name: Mark Jenkins
Author-Name: Steven Floyd
Abstract: This paper explores the trajectories of three key technologies in Formula 1 racing at the component, firm and system levels of analysis. The purpose is to gain an understanding of the evolutionary forces that contribute to the emergence and survival of dominant designs. Based on archival data and contemporaneous accounts of the period 1967-1982, we develop a series of propositions specifying the evolutionary forces acting on technological trajectories within each level of analysis. The resulting framework leads to a set of predictions about relationships between technological transparency, co-evolution, and the emergence of dominant designs. Specifically, we argue that when the costs and difficulty associated with transferring component knowledge between firms is low (technological transparency is high), technologies tend to co-evolve across firms, leading to the development of complementary technologies and increasing the likelihood of industry dominance. Where transparency is low, however, technologies ...

Author-Name: Marc Huygens
Author-Name: Frans A.J. Van Den Bosch
Author-Name: Henk W. Volberda
Author-Name: Charles Baden-Fuller
Abstract: This paper proposes that rival firms not only search for new capabilities within their organization, but also for those that rest in their competitive environment. An integrated analysis of these search processes at both firm and industry levels of analysis shows how their interaction makes industries and firms co-evolve over time. To contribute to an enhanced understanding of the concept of co-evolution, a dynamic and integrative framework crossing meso and micro levels of analysis is constructed. This framework is applied to a longitudinal study of the music industry with a time-span of 120 years. The first part, a historical study, covers the period 1877-1990. The second part, a multiple-case study, covers the period 1990-1997. We conclude that search behaviour drives co-evolution through competitive dynamics among new entrants and incumbent firms and manifests itself in the simultaneous emergence of new business models and new organizational forms.

Title: Subsidiary Embeddedness and Competence Development in MNCs A Multi-Level Analysis
Author-Name: Ulf Andersson
Author-Name: Mats Forsgren
Author-Name: Ulf Holm
Abstract: Recent research on the competitive advantage of multinational corporations (MNC) has emphasized the importance of the ability of subsidiaries to assimilate new knowledge from their external environment. Such an ability is important for the individual subsidiary's own performance as well as for the possibility it affords the MNC to combine and use resources from different parts of the corporate system.This paper explores the nature of business embeddedness at the subsidiary level and its role at the corporate level. It is suggested that the subsidiaries' embeddedness in a network of business actors can explain why certain subsidiaries demonstrate higher achievements than others, both in terms of their market performance and regarding their importance for competence development within the MNC. It is argued that the closer a subsidiary's external business relationships with suppliers and customers the easier it will be to assimilate new knowledge from outside, the more it will be able to innovate and therefo...

Title: Project Networks and Changing Industry Practices Collaborative Content Production in the German Television Industry
Author-Name: Arnold Windeler
Author-Name: Jorg Sydow
Abstract: Changing industry practices and forms of production organization are the medium and result of co-evolutionary processes of change. The disruptive event of transforming the German TV industry into a dual system triggered a change in content production from in-house to collaborative forms in project networks which are not only highly sensitive to previous and anticipated project practices, but also to industry practices. In turn, the change in the production organization recursively influences the reproduction of industry practices. The co-evolutionary analysis is based on structuration theory.

Author-Name: Alexander Styhre
Author-Name: Anders Ingelgdrd

Author-Name: Mattias Castenfors
Author-Name: Kina Mulec
Author-Name: Jonas Roth
Abstract: Emotions and stress are inextricably entangled: being stressed has bodily as well as emotional implications for human beings. The widespread distinction between mind and body in organization theory, following the Cartesian doctrine, blocks an adequate theoretization of stress. In general, there is a preference in organization theory for linguistic, literary, and semiotic interpretations of organizational practices. Consequently, notions such as culture and discourse have been largely favoured. The limitations of this tradition in Western thinking, Cartesian over Spinozist philosophy, are that mind is favoured over body, thinking over emotions, mind over matter. This paper presents a study of the experience of stress in a pharmaceutical company. It suggests that stress is to be conceived of as a bodily phenomenon while incorporating the emotional qualities of human beings. As an outcome of a set of ambiguities, stress is produced in a social setting, but it has immediate bodily effects on employees.

Title: Behaviour Prescriptions versus Professional Identities in Multi-cultural                 Corporations: A Cross-cultural Computer Simulation
Author-Name: Andreas Schneider
Abstract: There is a strong focus on cognitive, language-based, information processing in organizations. Acknowledging the gut decision of managers, this article introduces a symbolic interactionist framework that allows the investigation of organizational behaviour based on affective meaning, on emotion-generated implications. Unlike most symbolic interactionist approaches, affect-control theory is based on rigorous mathematical formalization that allows precise empirical methodologies. The effectiveness of this affective model is demonstrated in a multicultural setting where cultural differences and language differences make communication within the organization difficult. Computer-based simulations of interaction address the problems that managers experience following culture-centric behaviour prescriptions instead of using the affective meaning of their professional identities as guidance for their behaviour.

Title: Essal: On Paragrammatic Uses of Organizational Theory — A Provocation
Author-Name: Yiannis Gabriel
Abstract: Having indicated some of the recurring difficulties in establishing a conceptual or philosophical link between theory and practice, the author examines the relation between organization theory and the practices of academics, managers and other organizational participants. He argues that this relation is shaped by the way organizational theories are disseminated in the face of an expanding hegemony of consumerization and consumerism. Like other commodities, organizational theories are not used passively, in general, but in a creative, opportunistic and individualistic way. In this, they resemble folk knowledge, such as cooking recipes and cookery books, which different users employ or experiment with in widely differing ways, for widely differing ends. In contrast to both programme and paradigm, the author uses the term `paragramme' to indicate a shifting stock of ideas, routines, images and ingredients which invite improvization and elaboration, rather than copying or adherence.

Title: The Co-evolution of Institutional Environments and Organizational Strategies:                 The Rise of Family Business Groups in the ASEAN Region
Author-Name: Michael Carney
Author-Name: Eric Gedajlovic
Abstract: In this paper we consider Southeast Asian Family Business Groups (FBGs) as a form of business enterprise as well as existing theoretical accounts of their behaviour. To do so, we develop and describe a co-evolutionary framework that incorporates notions of interdependence, path dependence, and `system openness.' This co-evolutionary framework is used to anchor a case study describing the developmental paths of FBGs and their institutional environments. Because such neoevolutionary perspectives bring back into account adaptive behavior motivated by human agency and interests, they offer a promising means of capturing the dynamics (Fligstein and Freeland 1995) and complexity (Baum and Singh 1994) of the interaction between institutions and organizations.

Title: Task and Institutional Influences on Managers' Mental Models of Competition
Author-Name: Kevin Daniels
Author-Name: Gerry Johnson
Author-Name: Leslie de Chernatony
Abstract: From institutional theory, we argue (a) that the competitive, or task environment may encourage divergence of management cognition between organizations, management functions and amongst senior managers, and (b) that the institutional environment may encourage cognitive convergence at the level of the industry, the strategic group and within institutionalized practices linked to management functions and level. Using management cognition of competition as a vehicle and two cognitive mapping methods, we test a series of competing propositions amongst 32 managers in the UK personal financial services industry, an industry that evidences both task and institutional characteristics. Our findings indicate neither the superiority of exclusively task nor institutional explanations of management cognition. However, the results do indicate some influence of the institutional environment, most noticeably through the convergence of mental models within middle managers across the industry. The results also indicate so...

Title: Comparing Managers' Mental Models of Competition: Why Self-report Measures of                 Belief Similarity Won't Do
Author-Name: Gerard P. Hodgkinson
Abstract: In their study designed to investigate the relative impact of `task and institutional influences on managers' mental models of competition,' Daniels et al. (2002) elicited cognitive maps using two complementary ideographic mapping procedures: a card-sort technique and a variant of the repertory grid. Given that the resulting individual maps were each based on differing organizations and attributes, Daniels and his colleagues assessed belief similarity — their key dependent variable — by asking their participants to rate the overall similarity of the various maps so elicited to their own mental models which prevailed at the time the comparative rating exercise was subsequently performed, some three to six months later. Drawing on research into the cognitive processes underpinning similarity judgements, I argue that this approach to the comparison of cognitive maps suffers from a number of severe limitations which are likely to bias the results in favour of the research hypotheses under test, thus leading t...

Author-Name: Kevin Daniels
Author-Name: Gerry Johnson
Abstract: In his critique of Daniels et al. (2002), Hodgkinson (2001a) raises a number of issues concerning the use and comparison of ideographic cognitive maps. Hodgkinson claims that there are problems associated with global similarity ratings, and that ideographic methods should be replaced by methods that have some nomothetic component. In reply, we show that the specific issues raised by Hodgkinson are not at all problematic in the context of the research questions addressed by Daniels et al. We examine Hodgkinson's proposed alternative and explain why it would not be appropriate for the questions addressed by Daniels et al. We then argue that Hodgkinson' s approach, far from being a panacea for problems in cognitive mapping research, will deflect from the issues of real debate in this area.

Title: Uncharted Territories of Organizational Research: The Case of Karl Popper's Open Society and its Enemies
Author-Name: Thomas Armbrüster
Author-Name: Diether Gebert
Abstract: This paper argues that Karl Popper's notions in his work The Open Society and Its Enemies offer an approach to under-explored issues in organizational research, independent of Popper's epistemology. Popper's thoughts on the philosophy of science have largely been rejected in organization studies, and his socio-philosophical notions have hardly been considered. Yet they provide a frame of reference for viewing management trends, such as anti-bureaucratism and collectivist forms of work organization, in a different light. Popper's socio-philosophical notions suggest that `closed' patterns of thinking are detrimental to a liberal-democratic social order. The paper argues that an outline of the philosophy of openness and closedness and an application to managerial concepts allows for insights into whether certain types of managerial thinking stand in contrast to, or in accordance with, a liberal-democratic order. It is concluded that, through the Popperian lens, some supposedly liberationist movements of mana...

Title: Transforming the Architect: Ownership Form and Archetype Change
Author-Name: Ashly Pinnington
Author-Name: Timothy Morris
Abstract: The adoption of the incorporated form of ownership in preference to partnership is linked to the shift to a more modem organizational archetype in professional firms. Yet existing empirical research offers insufficient insight into the organizational processes of this transformation in different professional arenas. Where ownership and control become separated, there is a clearer theoretical explanation of the implications for the way the firm is run. Where ownership and control remain inside the firm, however, the consequences are not so clear and have not been well explored. Using survey and interview materials derived from a study of architecture practices, we examine the processes by which differences based on ownership emerge. Then, by drawing on Weberian theories, where they are concerned with professionalization as a project with material and social rewards, we specify more clearly the context for change in professional firms' archetypes. This, we conclude, provides a stronger basis for understandi...

Title: On the Discursive Construction of Success/Failure in Narratives of Post-Merger Integration
Author-Name: Eero Vaara
Abstract: This article concentrates on the discursive construction of success and failure in narratives of post-merger integration. Drawing on extensive interview material from eight Finnish-Swedish mergers and acquisitions, the empirical analysis leads to distinguishing four types of discourse — `rationalistic', `cultural', `role-bound' and `individualistic' — that narrators employ in recounting their experiences. In particular, the empirical material illustrates how the discursive frameworks enable specific (discursive) strategies and moves for (re)framing the success/failure, justification/legitimization of one's own actions, and (re)construction of responsibility when dealing with socio-psychological pressures associated with success/failure. The analysis also suggests that, as a result of making use of these discursive strategies and moves, success stories are likely to lead to overly optimistic or, in the case of failure stories, overly pessimistic views on the management's ability to control these change pro...

Title: Organizational Reforms, `Ideal Workers' and Gender Orders: A Cross-Societal Comparison
Author-Name: Janne Tienari
Author-Name: Sigrid Quack
Author-Name: Hildegard Theobald
Abstract: In this article, we put forth a comparative study of gender distinctions and relations within the processes of organizational reform in a German and a Finnish bank. We demonstrate how these processes are interwoven with assumptions about the `ideal worker' (cf. Acker 1990; 1992) that organizational members are measured against in management. We argue that the `ideal worker', even though, in general, a masculine notion, should not be perceived as a universal or as a static category. We suggest that notions of the `ideal worker' not only vary within different models of work organization, but that they vary across societal contexts. These notions are based on different gender orders (cf. Connell 1987) which penetrate organizational life and become incorporated in different, though predominantly masculine, conceptions. `Ideal worker' is also not a static category. If we consider gender distinctions and relations in organizations as produced, reproduced and redefined through continuously ongoing social interac...

Title: Masking the Need for Cultural Change: The Effects of Emotion Structuration
Author-Name: Jamie L. Callahan
Abstract: This study explores the ways in which the expression and management of emotion influence organizational action. The interview sample consisted of 21 volunteer leaders of a non-profit professional association. The triangulated design included interviews, observations, and document analyses. Emotion expression was primarily associated with externally oriented organizational actions, such as mission; emotion management was primarily associated with internally oriented organizational actions, such as culture. This expression and management combined to form a reciprocal connection between the volunteers and the organization that resulted in emotion structuration that masked the need for the organization to consider cultural change.

Author-Name: Stewart R. Clegg
Author-Name: Tyrone S. Pitsis
Author-Name: Thekla Rura-Polley
Author-Name: Marton Marosszeky
Abstract: The concept of governmentality was developed by Michel Foucault to address the specificity of contemporary neo-liberal forms of governance — premised on the active consent and subjugation of subjects, rather than their oppression, domination or external control. These neo-liberal forms of governance are evident in new forms of alliance contracting in the construction industry. We review the major innovations in organization form in the sector, before considering the specific management practices of surveillance and control that are typically associated with governance in these projects. Project management has been a historically evolving field. This paper reports on an example of governmentality applied to the practice of project management. While governmentality refers to the design of project governance as an activity, the management of projects as a mode of organization, irrespective of the mode of governance, is highly complex and uncertain. These themes have already been widely addressed in organizat...

Author-Name: Stan X. Li
Author-Name: Whitney Blair Berta
Abstract: We applied Giddens' (1979, 1984) structuration theory to investigate the US investment banking industry and found support for the notion that industry network structure impacts the strategic actions of the firms embedded in it, and that the status hierarchy component of the industry structure is reproduced by the dyad-level interactions of firms in this industry. Investment banks conform to the homophily phenomenon — they tend to transact with others in the industry of similar status. Status ranking also enables high-status banks to maintain an extensive exchange relationship with other banks, while status ranking constrains low-status banks to transact repeatedly with banks with which they have previously transacted.

Title: Enterprise Discourse, Professional Identity and the Organizational Control of Hospital Clinicians
Author-Name: Bill Doolin
Abstract: Recent reform of the healthcare sector in New Zealand involved the corporatization of public hospitals, and the contractualization of social relations between and within institutions. Various attempts were made to incorporate hospital clinicians within some system of organizational control in order to make them accountable for the resources consumed as a consequence of their treatment decisions. This paper considers how the general intention of government to control, curtail or influence the professional autonomy of hospital clinicians was played out in the context of a single New Zealand hospital. It considers the possibility that power effects of discourses associated with such neo-liberal programmes of reform could influence the subjectivity of hospital clinicians, aligning their clinical behaviour with the broader goals of the governmental programme. It explores how individuals manoeuvre in relation to these discourses of management and enterprise, whether in acceptance, resistance or compromise. The ...

Title: Mobilizing the Logic of Managerialism in Professional Fields: The Case of Academic Health Centre Mergers
Author-Name: Martin Kitchener
Abstract: This paper presents a qualitative inductive analysis of attempts to re-order the bases of legitimacy in fields of professional organizations. Concepts from institutional theory, political science and social movement theory are integrated to provide a model of the antecedents, processes and implications of this phenomenon. Findings from a study of US academic health centre mergers illustrate each element of the model. They show that as part of the political agenda to repress the prevailing institutional logic and structures of professionalism (Scott et al. 2000), executives are expected to adopt certain managerial innovations to maintain organizational legitimacy. Against this new basis of legitimacy, powerful agents have promoted merger so successfully that it has achieved mythical attributes of widespread and uncritical adoption (Meyer and Rowan 1977). The paper explains why the intended outcomes of this innovation emerge rarely when it is `sedimented' (Cooper et al. 1996) uncritically upon enduring aspe...

Title: Narratives of Organizational Identity and Identification: A Case Study of Hegemony and Resistance
Author-Name: Michael Humphreys
Author-Name: Andrew D. Brown
Abstract: This paper focuses on issues of identity and identification in a UK-based institution of higher education (Westville' Institute). It is suggested that identity, both individual and collective, and the processes of identification which bind people to organizations, are constituted in the personal and shared narratives that people author in their efforts to make sense of their world and read meaning into their lives. The research contribution this paper makes is threefold. First, it illustrates how an organization's identity narrative evolves over time, and the variety of identification narratives, including dis-identification, neutral identification and schizo-identification, in terms of which participants define their relationship to it. Second, it makes a contribution to what are still rather inchoate efforts to theorize the dynamics of individual-collective processes of identification and identity construction. Finally, it argues that the efforts of senior managers to control processes of organizational...

Title: Moral Atmosphere and Moral Influence Under China's Network Capitalism
Author-Name: Robin Snell
Author-Name: Choo Sin Tseng
Abstract: A weak legal system, weak civic accountability, market distortions, public cynicism, and workforces lacking moral self-efficacy, present challenges to moral integrity in Chinese mainland enterprises. Our predominantly qualitative study, in Wuhan, of organizational moral atmosphere (OMA) in two large state-owned enterprises (SOEs), two smaller, shareholder invested SOEs, two foreign-invested joint venture companies (JVCs) and one private company, indicated that felt distributive inequity may have compounded these problems. Government-championed, in-company ideological propagation of avowed business morality appeared to have little impact on OMA, owing to normative incoherence. The JVCs, by adopting the foreign partners' system of rational-legal administration and internal justice, appeared to have found a relatively more effective approach to formal moral governance. Non-JVCs had a more punishment-oriented yet less rigorous approach to regulation, which was commended only at the private company, where pers...

Title: Global Management Concepts and Local Adaptations: Working Groups in the French and German Car Manufacturing Industry
Author-Name: Michael Woywode
Abstract: In this paper, the diffusion process and organizational consequences of management concepts that spread globally through an industry are analyzed. Taking the example of the working group concept, the organization of the final assembly of a sample of French and German car manufacturers is studied. It can be shown that, in both countries, working groups similar to the ones used in Japanese car companies are widely diffused in the car industry. It also becomes clear from the analysis that plants have been experimenting with working groups and have adjusted them to their proper needs; a process which we call `local adaptation'. Our results indicate that the local adaptation of working groups is brought about to a large extent by the institutional differences between countries. Because of diffusion and adaptation processes, isomorphic as well as idiosyncratic tendencies in organizational structures can be observed at the same time.

Title: Learning in Dynamic Inter-Firm Networks: The Efficacy of Multiple Contacts
Author-Name: John Hagedoorn
Author-Name: Geert Duysters
Abstract: This paper examines the relevance of both efficiency-based and learning-based network behaviour in the context of inter-firm partnering. The effect of these different forms of network behaviour on company performance is analyzed for companies in the international computer industry. Strategies associated with learning through so-called exploratory networks appear to generate a greater impact on technological performance in a dynamic environment than efficiency strategies through exploitative networks.

Title: The Learning Organization, Sensegiving and Psychological Contracts: A Hong Kong Case
Author-Name: Robin S. Snell
Abstract: I discuss a qualitative case study of the development of a Hong Kong-based utility company towards the ideals of `Learning Organization' (LO). The case illuminates the irony of promoting greater openness and creativity through top-down sensegiving, as many managers and professionals participated in the collective development towards LO ideals, but nearly fell into a propaganda trap. The case also highlights the importance of honouring psychological contracts, as a covenant with the workforce, leveraged the company's dominant industry position, and restored an atmosphere of mutuality with a marginalized rump. Noting that the focal company may have been blessed with relatively munificent circumstances, I identify four viability tasks that aspiring LOs may need to perform continually in order to forestall disillusionment.

Title: The Dominance of Firm-Level Competitive Pressures Over Functional-Level Institutional Pressures: The Case of the Finnish-Based Forest Industry Firms
Author-Name: Juha Laurila
Author-Name: Kari Lilja
Abstract: Previous management and organization literature has recognized the contradictions between competitive and institutional pressures. Firms must simultaneously secure competitiveness by being different from their competitors, and legitimacy by being similar to them. While trade-offs between these conflicting pressures have been studied at the population and firm levels, little attention has been paid to the same phenomenon within firms. This paper suggests that, in order to achieve competitiveness at the firm level, firms need to deviate from some institutionally legitimate practices at the functional level. For example, we show how being strategically different at the firm level forces the Finnish-based forest industry firms to dismantle isomorphic practices in their organizational functions. Thus, we extend the previous work in this field by showing that the ability of firms to adopt and develop new practices is path-dependently biased in the sense that the firm-level definition of the strategic context ca...

Title: Strategic HRM through the Cultural Looking Glass: Mapping the Cognition of British and Indian Managers
Author-Name: Pawan S. Budhwar
Author-Name: Paul R. Sparrow
Abstract: This study examines the issues of `integration' of human resource management (HRM) into the corporate strategy, `devolvement' of HRM to line managers and the perceived influence of national culture on HRM in a cross-national comparative context. In order to achieve this, the cognition of personnel specialists from a matched sample of 48 Indian and British firms in the manufacturing sector using the `Visual Cards Sorting' and `CMAP2' methodologies are analyzed. The findings show that even where there is an apparent convergence of strategy — e.g., the desire of both Indian and British personnel managers to increase integration between HRM and business strategy, and to increase the level of devolvement to line managers, the two sets of specialists clearly follow a different logic of action, which is subject to a different set of cross-cultural influences. The implications of pursuing apparently similar HRM solutions in different cross-national contexts are considered. The analysis shows that HRM strategies, ...

Abstract: This paper addresses the relationship between organizations and the natural environment from both theoretical and empirical perspectives. In doing so, it contributes in three ways. First, it satisfies the need for more political perspectives in environment-related research. Second, by analyzing the end-of-life vehicle issue that the European automobile industry addressed in the 1990s, the paper satisfies the need of developing research that integrates organizational and field-level analysis. Finally, the use of the political ecology framework for the analysis of the end-of-life vehicle issue contributes to the development of a more politically charged institutional theory in which, as the study shows, both inertia and change in organizational fields depend on circuits of political ecology.

Title: Knowledge-Sharing Dilemmas
Author-Name: Angel Cabrera
Author-Name: Elizabeth F. Cabrera
Abstract: The exchange of information among organizational employees is a vital component of the knowledge-management process. Modem information and telecommunication technology is available to support such exchanges across time and distance barriers. However, organizations investing in this type of technology often face difficulties in encouraging their employees to use the system to share their ideas. This paper elaborates on previous research, suggesting that sharing personal insights with one's co-workers may carry a cost for some individuals which may yield, at the aggregate level, a co-operation dilemma, similar to a public-good dilemma. A review of the research on different types of public-good dilemmas provides some indications of the specific interventions that may help organizations encourage the kind of social dynamics that will increase overall knowledge sharing. These interventions can be classified into three categories: interventions aimed at restructuring the pay-offs for contributing, those that tr...

Title: National Business Systems and Industry-Specific Competitiveness
Author-Name: Sven Haake
Abstract: Countries have been shown to be competitive in specific industries. This paper contends that this industrial specialization can be understood in terms of an affinity between national `models of capitalism' and the characteristics of industrial task environments. Put differently, industry-specific competitiveness is conceived to arise out of a fit between patterns of national business systems and patterns of industrial task environments. Specifically, the paper will propose a relationship between the communitarian or individualistic nature of national business systems and the organization-specificity of knowledge in an industry. More communitarian business systems are thought to enjoy a competitive advantage in industries with a high organization-specificity of knowledge, i.e. in industries that rely more on the long-term accumulation of organization-specific knowledge within tightly-knit corporate communities. More individualistic business systems, on the other hand, are thought to enjoy a competitive adv...

Title: The Emergence of Business Groups: Israel and South Korea Compared
Author-Name: Daniel Maman
Abstract: This paper examines the emergence of business groups in Israel and South Korea. The paper questions how, in very different institutional contexts, similar economic organizations emerged. In contrast to the political, cultural and market perspectives, the comparative institutional analysis adopted in this research suggests that one factor alone could not explain the emergence of business groups. In Israel and South Korea, business groups emerged during the 1960s and 1970s, and there are common factors underlying their formation: state-society relations, the roles and beliefs of the elites, and the relative absence of multinational corporations in the economy. To a large extent, the chaebol are the result of an intended creation of the South Korean state, whereas the Israeli business groups are the outcome of state policies in the economic realm. In both countries, the state elite held a developmental ideology, did not rely on market forces for economic development, and had a desire for greater economic and...

Abstract: Using complementary theories derived from the foreign-entry mode and alliance literatures and two databases on Japanese/US alliances and investments, this study examines the prevalence — a combination of formation and termination — of the full range of investment and cross-border linkage alternatives available to firms. We find that some combinations among the administrative forms, the knowledge flow intent between the partners, and industry-related technology and risk factors were more prevalent than others. Specifically, there were three prevalent combinations consistent with the notions of production efficiency, transaction cost efficiency and learning/adaptation: (1) wholly owned subsidiaries in low R&D-intense industries with the intent of unidirectional knowledge flow; (2) joint ventures in medium R&D-intense industries with reciprocal knowledge flows; and (3) technical agreements with reciprocal knowledge flows in high-tech industries.

Title: A Configurational Analysis of International Joint Ventures
Author-Name: John Child
Abstract: A stream of research has focused on the ownership shares that partner companies take in international joint ventures [IJVs] and the leverage this may provide for control and performance. This research has normally adopted a `variance' approach, which examines `independent' variables as potential predictors of the focal phenomenon. The variance approach has yielded reasonably consistent results for the relationship between IJV ownership and control, but not in respect of performance. In searching for the optimum predictive model for whole samples, the variance approach risks overlooking inter-case nuances that may result from somewhat different configurations of variables. An alternative approach seeks to explore how and why variables configure together in different combinations.This paper draws on a study of 20 Sino-UK IJVs and their parent companies. It proceeds from a conventional variance analysis to identify different IV configurations. These configurations can be understood in the light of each IV's ...

Title: Essai: The Ghost in the Organism
Author-Name: Stephen Cummings
Author-Name: Torkild Thanem
Abstract: The emergence of the idea that organizations are like organisms is generally seen as having saved organization studies (OS) from its mechanistic precepts. We argue that it has not. Rather, the mechanistic underpinnings of organization merely found a new medium of expression in the organism metaphor. This is largely due to the particular legacy that first informed so-called organic thinking about organizations in the 20th century. This essai investigates the history of the words organization and organism and asks how it became possible for one to be used as a metaphor for the other. Then it examines the way that the organism was brought into the fold of organization so as to reinforce the Modernist and mechanistic underpinnings of the field. We conclude that if the mechanistic ghost in the organism is to be exorcised, OS needs to recognize and rethink these underlying premises. Towards this end, we offer two alternative ways of thinking organization via the organism: one pre-Modern and one post-Modern.

Author-Name: Haridimos Tsoukas
Abstract: The theme of this collection of essays arose from the broader theme of the American Academy of Management 2000 Conference in Toronto on `A New Time'. The five short papers included here, plus one by Christopher Grey (University of Cambridge) were presented at a special (All Academy) symposium, under the title `Organization Studies: It's Time for Reflection', organized by Elena Antonacopoulou. Following on from the discussion that ensued at the symposium and the comments made by the guest editors, five out of the initial six presenters revised their contributions and the symposium theme evolved into the present `Time and Reflexivity in Organization Studies'.

Title: Essai: Time, Duration and Simultaneity: Rethinking Process and Change in Organizational Analysis
Author-Name: Robert Chia
Abstract: The recent rediscovery of concrete lived time from `clock-time' by process theorists enables us to make important adjustments in our thinking about the true nature of temporality, movement and change. For these process theorists, change is reality itself, and `organizations' are nothing more than `temporary arrestations' in a sea of flux and transformation. From this perspective it is the phenomenon of organisation that requires analysis and explanation and not change itself. This understanding opens up new avenues of inquiry for Organization Studies as a field of study. Thus the shaping of contemporary modes of thought, codes of behaviour, social mannerisms, dress, gestures, postures, the rules of law, ethical codes, disciplines of knowledge and so on, makes for more appropriate theoretical foci for an expanded realm of Organization Studies-one which offers a deeper understanding of organisation and its consequences for the world of affairs.

Title: Essai: Doing Time in Organization Theory
Author-Name: Mary Jo Hatch
Abstract: In this essay I examine my proclivity to theorize time in a cyclical way. Using artist David Hockney's reflections on representing time in art through movement, I suggest that, like Hockney's paintings, my dynamic theories of organizational culture, identity and collective creativity were produced with an awareness of my movement through time. Hockney not only helps me to explain the necessity of movement to understand organizing more dynamically, he also suggests that taking a dynamic approach to theorizing introduces intimacy. On this basis, the essay concludes with the speculation that my way of theorizing moves beyond the claims of subjectivity to interiorization a willingness to embed oneself in the processes of organizing in order to describe their dynamics from the viewpoint of participation.

Title: Essai: Organizational Time: Modern, Symbolic and Postmodern Reflections
Author-Name: John Hassard
Abstract: This paper reflects upon how the concept of time is depicted in three major perspectives of organization theory modem, symbolic and postmodern. In so doing, it draws upon time metaphors from sociological theory to make sense of time related issues in the evolution of organizational analysis. The paper analyses, for example, the commodification of time identified in labour process analysis; the social construction of time described in workplace ethnographies; and the compression of time (and space) proposed in writing on post-Fordism. Overall, the paper promotes a reflexive pluri-paradigm appreciation of time in organization theory and research.

Title: Essai: Real-Time Reflexivity: Prods to Reflection
Author-Name: Karl E. Weick
Abstract: Growing attention to self-as-theorist threatens to shift reflexivity from a means to improve theory to an end in itself. Such a shift both muddles observations and conceals the possibility that reflexive liabilities are present-at-hand reconstructions of dissimilar ready-to-hand moments of data collection. Reflexivity lived forward differs from reflexive threats to validity understood backward. This difference is illustrated through an analysis of Wicklund's theory of multiple perspectives. It is concluded that current renderings of reflexivity may have focused on the wrong categories.

Title: Temporal Spans in Talk: Doing Consistency to Construct Fair Organization
Author-Name: Jeanie M. Forray
Author-Name: Jill Woodilla
Abstract: It is generally understood that time, among its other aspects, is a resource in organizational life. In this paper, we take an interpretive perspective to this notion by considering temporality as a verbal resource in the work of organizing. We introduce the concept of `temporal span' and discuss the ways in which temporal spans in talk serve to establish consistency as an ongoing attribute of organizational reality. Empirical examples drawn from an ethnomethodological study of human resource managers demonstrate interactions during which these managers invoke temporal spans to construct `fair organization'. We discuss the use of temporality as a verbal resource with respect to the interactional practices of human resource managers and the quality of consistency in organizational life.

Title: Organizational and Industrial Response to Market Liberalization: The Interaction of Pace, Incentive and Capacity to Change
Author-Name: Steven White
Author-Name: Greg Linden
Abstract: This paper draws on prior research on organizational change to link the pace of macroeconomic reforms in a transition economy to the ability of domestic firms and industries to face new foreign competition. We argue that if the pace of economic reforms exceeds the pace at which organizations can adopt appropriate strategies, those organizations will not be able to survive, even if they have the potential to do so otherwise. A comparison of the Polish and Chinese television manufacturing industries grounds our model that relates the pace of adaptation to environmental change, managerial incentives and organizational capacity to the likelihood that incumbent firms will be able to survive in newly liberalized markets. In Poland, domestic television producers were decimated by foreign entrants after the government implemented `big-bang' reform measures. China's `go-slow' approach to reform, in contrast, allowed managers in some but not all state-owned enterprises to make and implement strategic changes that e...

Title: Confronting Strategic Inertia in a Top Management Team: Learning from Failure
Author-Name: Gerard P. Hodgkinson
Author-Name: George Wright
Abstract: Recently there has been a growing interest in the use of scenario-planning techniques and related procedures such as cognitive mapping as a basis for facilitating organizational learning and strategic renewal. The overwhelming impression conveyed within the popular management literature is that the application of these techniques invariably leads to successful outcomes. To the extent that this is not the case, the absence of documented accounts of instances where these techniques have failed may mislead would-be users into embarking on inappropriate courses of action, unaware of their fundamental limitations. In keeping with a number of recent calls to make organizational research and management theory more relevant to the world of practice, we present a reflective account of our own (largely unsuccessful) attempt to apply these potentially powerful methods of intervention in the context of a private sector organization. Drawing on the rich seam of qualitative data gathered over the course of our work wit...

Title: Who Sustains Whose Development? Sustainable Development and the Reinvention of Nature
Author-Name: Subhabrata Bobby Banerjee
Abstract: This paper explores the contradictions inherent in one of the more popular buzzwords of today: sustainable development. I argue that, despite claims of a paradigm shift, the sustainable development paradigm is based on an economic, not ecological, rationality. Discourses of sustainable development embody a view of nature specified by modern economic thought. One consequence of this discourse involves the transformation of ‘nature’ into ‘environment’, a transformation that has important implications for notions of how development should proceed. The ‘rational’ management of resources is integral to the Western economy and its imposition on developing countries is problematic. I discuss the implications of this ‘regime of truth’ for the Third World with particular reference to biotechnology, biodiversity and intellectual property rights. I argue that these aspects of sustainable development threaten to colonize spaces and sites in the Third World, spaces that now need to be made ‘efficient’ because of the c...

Title: Contrary Prescriptions: Recognizing Good Practice Tensions in Management
Author-Name: Chris Huxham
Author-Name: Nic Beech
Abstract: This paper is concerned with rethinking the notion of ‘good management practice’. It explicates a way of framing management theory in terms of tensions between apparently contradictory pieces of good practice advice. The relevance of this, as a practical conceptualization that could usefully inform managers about the kinds of considerations they might take account of in both their day to day and longer term management thinking, is explored. The emerging theoretical framework is elaborated in terms of some characteristics of, and language about, tensions together with possible levels of use of the concept to inform practice. It is suggested that the use of the approach necessarily implies a view of the user as a reflective practitioner.

Title: Russian and Georgian Entrepreneurs and Non-Entrepreneurs: A Study of Value Differences
Author-Name: Alexander Ardichvili
Author-Name: Alexander Gasparishvili
Abstract: This study seeks to extend the body of knowledge of international and cross-cultural entrepreneurship and management research by testing hypotheses dealing with the degree of variance in cultural values between entrepreneurs and non-entrepreneurs in two countries of the former Soviet Union: Russia and Georgia. A total of 867 entrepreneurs, managers, and production employees responded to a survey based on Hofstede’s work-related cultural values framework. Significant differences between entrepreneurs and non-entrepreneurs existed on three of five cultural dimensions: Power Distance, Masculinity, and Long-term Orientation. However, the study also demonstrated that, in international entrepreneurship research, making distinctions between entrepreneurs and the rest of the population is not as fruitful as contrasting entrepreneurs with specific occupational and status groups. Thus, in this study entrepreneurs were, in some cases, different from managers but similar to employees, and, in some other cases, simila...

Title: Journeying from Hippocrates with Bergson and Deleuze
Author-Name: Martin Wood
Author-Name: Ewan Ferlie
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to situate the predominant medical model of Evidence Based Health Care (EBHC) in a processual framework by construing the organization of health care knowledge as non-linear, rhizomic communication. The paper is based on a theoretically driven, empirically based account of specific microprocesses of health care research and the particular settings in which those processes take place. We show how the production and appropriation of health care knowledge breaks out, cuts across and complicates simple lines of information transfer and dissemination. The boundary between research and practice is not seen simply as a frontier between two totally different realms, but rather as an interconnection between different patterns of relationality. It is this point that EBHC commentaries often miss. They typically see ‘research’ and ‘practice’ as pre-established forms, because both appear to enjoy what amounts to an independent existence, before any philosophical questions about their inher...

Title: Systemic Exchange: Responsibility for Angst
Author-Name: Ian Brooks
Abstract: This paper reports on research that tells the story of nurse managers’ attempts to provide a 24-hour service. Although research was contextualized within the National Health Service in the United Kingdom, the outcomes are not merely about the NHS. It is argued that middle managers, possessing delegated responsibility, are considered to be empowered. Such empowerment is accompanied by widely experienced anxiety. An escalatory and contagious process is observed which exaggerates ‘normal’ stress and challenge among middle managers into a state of selfperceived angst. It is argued that anxiety is, in effect, delegated, a process which serves to partially relieve superiors of anxiety-generating responsibilities. In contrast to arguments that players in bureaucracy ‘conspire’ to ensure that responsibility and consequent anxieties are largely held by the organizational elite, this paper argues that this traditional Weberian notion is worthy of challenge. Findings are based on qualitative data from an ethnographi...

Title: A Dynamic Model of Intra-and Interorganizational Learning
Author-Name: Mikael Holmqvist
Abstract: Two themes characterize the organizational learning literature: one focuses on intra organizational learning processes, and another focuses on inter organizational learning processes. This article stresses the need to cross-fertilize these themes of organizational learning by proposing a dynamic model of organizational learning within and between organizations. This cross-fertilization is important in order to understand how organizations may cope with the fundamental organizational learning problem of addressing exploitation and exploration, i.e., to create both reliability and variety in experience. In this article it is proposed that exploitation and exploration occur both within and between organizations and that they are deeply interlaced through intra-and interorganizational learning processes.

Title: Path Dependence and Contractual Relations in Emergent Capitalism: Contrasting State Socialist Legacies and Inter-Firm Cooperation in Hungary and Slovenia
Author-Name: Laszlo Czaban
Author-Name: Marko Hocevar
Author-Name: Marko Jaklic
Author-Name: Richard Whitley
Abstract: Inter-firm relations vary significantly between capitalist economies as a result of institutional differences, especially in terms of trust and mechanisms ensuring adherence to contractual commitments. The transformation of the state socialist economies in Eastern Europe might be expected to destroy the pre-1989 relationships between suppliers and customers and generate new types of connections. This study of 18 Hungarian firms and eight Slovenian firms found significant differences between the ways companies transformed and/or preserved the way they managed their supplier-customer relationships. These differences were mainly due to the differences between the legacies of state socialism, the mode of the macroeconomic transformation and the general business environment in the two countries. This study also shows that unlike the Japanese firms studied by Sako, firms in Eastern Europe show contradictory behaviours if Sako’s indicators of trust are applied.

Title: The Relative Impact of Country of Origin and Universal Contingencies on Internationalization Strategies and Corporate Control in Multinational Enterprises: Worldwide and European Perspectives
Author-Name: Anne-Wil Harzing
Author-Name: Arndt Sorge
Abstract: We examine the importance of country-of-origin effects and of universal contingencies such as industrial recipes in organizational practices at the international level of multinational enterprises. This is based on a study comparing European (Finnish, French, German, Dutch, Swiss, Swedish, British), American and Japanese multinational enterprises. Although multinationals are highly internationalized by definition, our study shows their organizational control practices at the international level to be more than anything else explained by their country of origin. Universal contingencies such as size and industry, on the other hand, are more related to internationalization strategy. Internationalization strategy and organizational control are associated with different sets of variables; to this extent they appear more de-coupled with regard to each other than the literature suggests. Multinationals appear to follow tracks of coordination and control in which they have become embedded in their country of orig...

Title: The Quality of Standard, Routine and Nonroutine Processes
Author-Name: Paul Lillrank
Abstract: Efforts to increase organizational effectiveness using standardization and quality techniques have been successful in repetitive production and administrative processes but less so when dealing with nonroutine processes typical of professional organizations. Routines are defined very broadly in organization theory as either mind-numbing repetition, repositories of knowledge, or effortful accomplishments. In this article, processes are analysed as systems with distinct input assessment, algorithms and output-generating action phases. These are structured differently depending on how they are set up to deal with variation (deviations from explicit targets) and variety (distinct but functionally equivalent targets). Thus processes can be classified into three types. Standard processes are set up to deal with a single variety using binary logic. Routine processes can distinguish a limited amount of variety using fuzzy logic. Nonroutine processes are open systems in which unrestricted variety is interpreted an...

Title: Strategic Innovation in Traditional Big Business: Case Studies of Two Japanese Companies
Author-Name: Mitsuru Kodama
Abstract: This paper presents two case studies of how large, traditional corporations simultaneously created new service markets and established a dominant position in the competitive fields of the Internet and mobile communications in Japan. The corporations accepted new organizational bodies imbued with an entrepreneurial spirit supported by different types of personnel and then continuously promoted entrepreneurial strategies based on time pacing. At the same time, with the aim of implementing strategic innovation, the companies integrated the above strategies with deliberate strategies based on event-based pacing practiced by the existing organizational bodies. This paper uses case studies to discuss the factors in success and the problems encountered in the course of achieving strategic innovation in the communications field, specifically in the creation of new markets, through the deliberate and strategic maintenance and subsequent integration of paradoxical organizations and strategies under a single corpora...

Title: A Resource-Based View of Corporate Responsiveness Toward Employees
Author-Name: María de la Cruz Déniz-Déniz
Author-Name: Petra De Saá-Pérez
Abstract: This paper demonstrates the strategic importance of developing a capability to manage human resources based on a set of social responsibility principles (normative and structural) with the aim of responding to the interests of the employees. Such corporate social responsiveness will encourage employees’ collaboration and could distinguish the company from other organizations. We have tried empirically to test the existence of a significant and positive relationship between organizational results and the institutionalization of a social responsiveness toward employees. To this end, we carried out a study in the Spanish savings bank sector to analyse the strategic value of corporate responsiveness toward employees from the resource-based view. Our results seem to show that those savings banks that have institutionalized high-commitment practices toward employees have greater profitability.

Title: Effects of the Social Origins of Alliances on Alliance Performance
Author-Name: Hitoshi Mitsuhashi
Abstract: This research responds to the charges of two criticisms about the embeddedness approach—(1) that it does not treat embeddedness as a variable and (2) that it does not explain economic performance—by investigating how variations in the social origins of alliances account for alliance performance. The hypotheses of this research state that the strength of ties between individuals who initiate alliance formation processes is positively related to alliance performance, because such ties eliminate the uncertainty that firms face when forming alliances, reduce the likelihood of partners’ malfeasance, and facilitate information exchange for sharing tacit knowledge. However, analysis of the mail survey data on biopharmaceutical R&D alliances indicates that such a simple association does not exist. Rather, one possible interpretation of the findings is that the activation of strong ties in forming alliances seems to be a double-edged sword that not only creates an opportunity for building successful alliances but ...

Title: Social Movement Organizations: A Metaphor for Strategic Actors in Institutional Fields
Author-Name: Manuel Hensmans
Abstract: Faced with increasing real-time dislocation of institutionalized practices in empirical studies, it has become clear that neo-institutional theory is still ill-equipped to elucidate strategies of change in institutional fields. In this article, I endorse the claim that neo-institutional theory can both become more strategic and give a richer meaning to the strategy-formation process by integrating issues of ideology, power and agency in a political-cultural rhetoric of legitimation. Using the social movement metaphor to describe institutional change, I study incumbents and challengers as potentially antagonistic social movement organizations (SMOs) that strive to hegemonize entrepreneurship in fields. After having outlined a model linking institutional change to the strategy-formation process, I identify four archetypes of SMOs and strategic propensities, and illustrate the presented propositions about the incumbent SMO-challenger SMO dynamic using the case of emerging Internet challengers in the music in...

Title: Communities of Practice and Habitus: A Critique
Author-Name: Alistair Mutch
Abstract: Pierre Bourdieu’s concept of habitus is frequently drawn upon in work on learning and knowledge in organizations. However, this use is much looser than Bourdieu’s emphasis on habitus as generative structure. This tension is explored in an examination of the work of UK public house managers, using the notion of communities of practice. The issues that this raises about habitus are developed through a consideration of the work of Basil Bernstein. His work indicates the value of a concept that emphasizes durable dispositions to act, but such a concept needs to be embedded in a relational conception of the agency-structure divide.

Title: Corporate Social and Financial Performance: A Meta-Analysis
Author-Name: Marc Orlitzky

Abstract: Most theorizing on the relationship between corporate social/environmental performance (CSP) and corporate financial performance (CFP) assumes that the current evidence is too fractured or too variable to draw any generalizable conclusions. With this integrative, quantitative study, we intend to show that the mainstream claim that we have little generalizable knowledge about CSP and CFP is built on shaky grounds. Providing a methodologically more rigorous review than previous efforts, we conduct a meta-analysis of 52 studies (which represent the population of prior quantitative inquiry) yielding a total sample size of 33,878 observations. The meta-analytic findings suggest that corporate virtue in the form of social responsibility and, to a lesser extent, environmental responsibility is likely to pay off, although the operationalizations of CSP and CFP also moderate the positive association. For example, CSP appears to be more highly correlated with accounting-based measures of CFP than with market-based ...

Title: The Structure of Knowledge and Seller-Buyer Networks in Markets for Emergent Technologies
Author-Name: Asaf Darr

Abstract: This empirical study compares the impact of knowledge structures on relational patterns in markets for emergent technology and in a mass market within the electronics industry. We hypothesized that in markets for emergent technologies, sellers and buyers do not have a common image of product use, and to reach it they must communicate contextual knowledge rooted in engineering practice. Furthermore, insofar as knowledge is contextual (as opposed to articulated in a mass market), sellers’ and buyers’ experts must engage in an intense technological dialogue. These hypotheses were tested by a key-parametric qualitative field study and quantitative network analysis. Communication activity was found more intense in the seller-buyer network in the emergent technology market than in the mass market. The seller-buyer network of emergent technology was also more hierarchical, with technical experts located at the center of the technological dialogue regarding product application. Shared practice and co-development ...

Title: Trust in Organizational Superiors: Systemic and Collective Considerations
Author-Name: Boas Shamir
Author-Name: Yael Lapidot
Abstract: The social-psychological literature on trust in organizational superiors implies that it is an interpersonal phenomenon, based on the superior’s behaviours and on subordinates’ perceptions of the superior’s behaviours and qualities. The sociological literature, in contrast, implies that trust in a superior is a property of the system in which the superior-subordinate relationship is embedded. In this article, we suggest that trust is both an interpersonal and a collective phenomenon and focus on the linkages between three levels of trust: the system level, the group level, and the individual level. We use a longitudinal quantitative analysis of cadets’ trust in their team commanders and a qualitative analysis of critical incidents of trust building and erosion to develop and support three propositions. First, trust in a superior reflects subordinates’ trust in the system that the superior represents. Second, subordinates employ criteria derived from systemic properties such as collective identities and va...

Title: The State Matters: Management Models of Singaporean Chinese and Korean                Business Groups
Author-Name: Lai Si Tsui-Auch
Author-Name: Yong-Joo Lee
Abstract: Both the proponents and critics of Asian economic organization have been preoccupied with the ideal-typical management models of family businesses, and have rarely identified their changing management structures. We, instead, identify the change and continuity in these management structures through an analysis of family-controlled business groups in Singapore and South Korea before and after the Asian currency crisis. In our view, these business groups professionalized their management, but retained family control and corporate rule before the crisis. The crisis, however, increased the pressure on such groups to relinquish family control and corporate rule. Singaporean Chinese business groups tended to loosen their tight grip on corporate rule by absorbing more professional managers into their upper echelons. The surviving Korean chaebol, however, intensified family control. Only a few chaebol, which were on the brink of bankruptcy, relinquished corporate rule to professional managers. We argue that other...

Based on face-to-face interviews with 75 Russian entrepreneurs in 1995 and follow-up interviews in 1999, the study examines effects of structural embeddedness, relational embeddedness and resource embeddedness on firm performance. The main finding is that relational embeddedness and resource embeddedness have direct positive impacts on firm performance, whereas structural embeddedness has no direct impacts on performance.

Author-Name: David Morris
Author-Name: Mustafa Tasliyan
Author-Name: Geoffrey Wood
Abstract: This paper is based on a survey of UK firms making use of Electronic Data Interchange (EDI), and deals with the social and organizational consequences stemming from the adoption of these systems. It was found that a major factor impelling the adoption of EDI systems was pressure from major customers rather than a desire to streamline work organization. However, they do represent a capital intensification of work in the areas of purchasing and supply. This may ultimately erode the position of the less skilled incumbents of the lower job bands, standardizing functions, and, over the medium and long terms, may facilitate downsizing. It is concluded that, above all, EDI represents a strengthening of existing power relationships and imbalances between organizations, a process which opens up few opportunities for the empowerment of the rank-and-file within them.

Abstract: In-house outsourcing is a major organizational innovation built on a combination of under-the-same-roof outsourcing, interdependent outsourcing and continual incomplete re-contracting. Its introduction has great impact on the production flow, organization of work, job content, and problems in everyday interactions. In-depth analysis of the Fiat Auto case sheds new light on this emerging innovation, showing in particular that relationships between the market and organizational interactions (formal and informal) vary according to the type of outsourcing. The paper also outlines a typology of the outsourced activities (sequential versus interdependent crossed with low versus high complexity).

Author-Name: Jannis Kallinikos
Abstract: This article is concerned with the changing premises of human involvement in organizations underlying current employment and labour trends. The appreciation of these trends is placed in the wider historical context signified by the advent of modernity and the diffusion of the bureaucratic form of organization. The article attempts to dissociate bureaucracy from the dominant connotations of centralized and rigid organizational arrangements. It identifies the distinctive mark of the modern workplace with the crucial fact that it admits human involvement in non-inclusive terms. Modern humans are involved in organizations qua roles, rather than qua persons. Innocent as it may seem, the separation of the role from the person has been instrumental to the construction of modern forms of human agency. An organizational anthropology is thereafter outlined based on Gellner's conception of `Modular Man'. Modernity and bureaucracy construe human beings as assemblages of relatively independent behavioural modules that...

Abstract: As traveller in perilous seas and storyteller, as trickster and bricoleur, as schemer and as bully, as lover and family man, as a leader of men and reader of situations, Odysseus has woven his way easily into discourses past and present. Focusing on one specific scene from the Odyssey, one in which Odysseus shipwrecked, naked and lost, in serious need of being organized, bursts into the organized routines of Princess Nausicaa, the author argues that the Odyssey offers insights into all encounters with the disorganized Other. Learning to listen to and understand the Other's voice is especially important at a time of ever-proliferating social, organizational and other boundaries.

Title: French Sociology of Work and Labor: From Shop Floor to Labor Markets to                Networked Careers
Author-Name: Catherine Paradeise
Abstract: Concentrating mostly on France, this paper considers the changing interests and the renewal of academic alliances in the sociology of work and labor over the last 50 years. Three periods result from the combined dynamics of sociology's internal agenda and societal changes: (1) analysis of blue-collar labor as the downgrading process of complete work in taylorist industry; (2) sociology of labor markets and employment, and analysis of the bargaining processes of rules, identities and the value of work; (3) reconciliation of work and labor in distributed and flexible organizations, based on mobile and involved workers.

Title: The Institutional Structuring of Organizational Capabilities: The Role of                Authority Sharing and Organizational Careers
Author-Name: Richard Whitley
Abstract: The development of competitive competences in firms involves the generation of core employee commitment to collective problem solving and the development of firm-specific capabilities. Such commitment is often gained through authority sharing and providing organizational careers that reward contributions to organizational problem-solving routines and goals. However, firms vary considerably in how authoritative coordination of economic activities (both within and between companies) is achieved, and in the extent and scope of organizational careers. These differences affect their development of coordinating, learning and reconfigurational organizational capabilities. Owners and managers are encouraged to adopt varying degrees of authority sharing with groups of employees and business partners, and to invest in organizational careers to varying extents, by different institutional frameworks. In particular, variations in states' coordinating roles, the strength of business associations, the market for corpora...

Title: Organizing Education by Drawing on Organization Studies
Author-Name: A. Georges L. Romme
Abstract: This study explores how scholars researching organizations and organizing processes can use and exploit their knowledge not only in terms of course contents, but also in organizing and managing students' learning activity. A design-oriented research approach is used in order to develop grounded design principles for organizing education. By drawing on the literature about organizational design and learning, several preliminary design ideas for organizing undergraduate education are described. Subsequently, two examples of how these design ideas can be applied are discussed. The first example involves the design of an undergraduate course in Organizational Behaviour. The second example is a tool for collaboratively supervising thesis projects. The design principles grounded in these two cases are, in sum: designing education as an authentic organization; exploiting the benefits of peer mentoring and assessment; acting and delegating as a senior manager; and setting vivid standards. Lastly, the contribution...

Title: Challenging Racial Silences in Studies of Emotion Work: Contributions from                Anti-Racist Feminist Theory
Author-Name: Kiran Mirchandani
Abstract: Little or no attention has been paid to the racialized dimensions of the emotion work done by individuals as part of their paid jobs. I argue that this exclusion of racial analyses is symptomatic of a static conceptualization of the subject underlying many studies of emotion work. While theorists illuminate the different forms of emotion work required by women and men, and by individuals in various professions, there is little understanding of the relationship between the emotion work people do and their social locations within interactive race, class and gender hierarchies. Drawing on feminist anti-racist theory I propose a multidimensional approach to difference and stratification, which would allow us to illuminate new forms of emotion work done by people living in today's heterogeneous social and economic context. The theoretical discussion in this article is complemented by an analysis of the experiences of an ethnically diverse group of women who are small-business owners in Halifax, Canada.

Abstract: Using data from 80 joint-venture (JV) experiences, this article compares the influence on JV effectiveness of two alternative ways of management: relational investment and formal control.

Title: Managing Intersecting R&D Social Communities: A Comparative Study of                European `Knowledge Incubators' in Japanese and American Firms
Author-Name: Mark Lehrer
Author-Name: Kazuhiro Asakawa
Abstract: Georg Simmel's notion of intersecting group affiliations is used to analyze the situation of European R&D personnel employed by Japanese and American corporations. The fact that foreign R&D personnel belong to multiple research communities poses strategic challenges for global firms. One notable finding concerns the issue of `competitive advantage in the basic research lab'. The traditional `ethnocentricity' of Japanese firms, while facilitating intra-firm tacit knowledge flows, may create obstacles in the ability to access and capture critical knowledge embedded in foreign innovation systems outside firm boundaries. In contrast, `explicit' US firms appear to possess a certain advantage for accessing the knowledge embedded in foreign systems of innovation.

Title: The Complexity of Rule Systems, Experience and Organizational Learning
Author-Name: Nikolaus Beck
Author-Name: Alfred Kieser
Abstract: In this article, we analyse organizational learning that is based on formal organizational rules. Organizational rules provide procedures for problem solving. However, whether rules are useful as media of organizational learning is dependent on properties of the rule system and on the organizational members' experience in dealing with rules and the rule system. For example, a voluminous rule system is usually assumed to impede rule changes that contribute to organizational learning. With regard to experience one can assume that organizational members who have learned how to deal effectively with a rule system should be able to design rules in such a way that, for some time, they do not require further changes. In an empirical analysis of all changes in the rules for personnel policy in a German bank from 1970 to 1989, we show that experience increases the stability of individual rules and the rule system. However, we cannot support the assumption that the volume of the rule system impedes organizational l...

Title: Knowledge Creation in Professional Service Firms: Institutional Effects
Author-Name: Maxine Robertson
Author-Name: Harry Scarbrough
Author-Name: Jacky Swan
Abstract: This article presents an analysis of institutional influences upon knowledge creation within professional service firms, whose main business is the provision of specialized consultancy. Such firms, we argue, provide an important setting for examining such influences because their survival depends on their ability to mobilize and synthesize professional bodies of knowledge. They, therefore, directly confront the constraints that institutionalized professions pose for processes of knowledge creation. By exploring the influence of the institutional context, the article extends earlier work on professional service and knowledge-intensive firms which has tended to adopt a more micro, organizational-level focus on knowledge creation and to neglect both the heterogeneous nature of knowledge and its embeddedness in institutional contexts.A comparative analysis of two firms located in different institutional contexts (science and the law) establishes some of the major mechanisms through which professional institut...

Abstract: The present article extends a previously published framework for the analysis of knowledge development in professional service firms by looking deeper into the underlying dynamics of the components and processes described in the framework. This extension is based on an in-depth comparative case study of knowledge development in two professional service firms from two very different industries, namely, engineering design and communication consulting. Despite the major differences between the firms and the industries, we found some remarkable similarities in terms of how professionals perceive knowledge development at work, in particular, the emphasis on the role of sophisticated and knowledgeable clients. In this article, we elaborate on this aspect. As a result of these findings, the framework is further refined, as the areas where clients play a major role in the knowledge-development processes of professional service firms are highlighted.

Title: Exploring Management Consulting Firms as Knowledge Systems
Author-Name: Andreas Werr
Author-Name: Torbjörn Stjernberg
Abstract: This article examines the nature and the generation, dissemination and translation of knowledge in large, global management consulting organizations. The knowledge system in consulting organizations is modelled as consisting of three interacting knowledge elements: methods and tools, providing a common language and knowledge structure; cases, carrying knowledge in a narrative form; and the experience of individual consultants that is essential for the adaptation of methods, tools and cases to the specific consulting project.A number of recent studies have characterized knowledge-management strategies as focusing on either articulate knowledge or tacit knowledge. We argue that a fruitful understanding of knowledge management in management consulting requires attention to the relations between the different elements that represent different kinds of knowledge. Based on case studies in Andersen Consulting (now Accenture) and Ernst & Young Management Consulting (now Cap Gemini Ernst & Young) these knowledge e...

Title: The Professional Partnership: Relic or Exemplary Form of Governance?
Author-Name: Royston Greenwood
Author-Name: Laura Empson
Abstract: The creation of the public corporation in the 19th century drove out the partnership as the predominant form of organizational governance. Yet, within the professional services sector, partnerships have survived and prospered. Moreover, professional services firms that chose to abandon the partnership form tended to become private rather than public corporations. Drawing upon several theories, we compare the efficiency of the partnership relative to corporate forms of governance in the context of the professional services sector. We argue that the professional partnership minimizes agency costs associated with both the private and public corporation. We also argue from tournament theory and property rights theory that partnerships have superior incentive systems for professionals in particular and knowledge workers more generally. However, drawing upon structural-contingency theory, we identify limiting conditions, which affect the relative efficiency of the partnership. We argue that the corporation, esp...

Title: The Nature of Knowledge and the Entry Mode Decision
Author-Name: Namrata Malhotra
Abstract: Previous work on the choice of mode of entry into foreign markets highlights the central role of knowledge and the attributes of knowledge in choosing an appropriate governance form for its transfer internationally. The literature suggests that protection of knowledge from the threat of opportunism posed by licensees and business partners in other contractual modes is a primary driver of the choice of mode. However, the knowledge construct itself is oversimplified in the entry mode literature and needs more explication to enable a clearer understanding of its implications for entry mode choice. In this article, I examine in depth the variety of different types of knowledge held by firms and how these relate to each other and combine to constitute a source of advantage. A qualitative case-based analysis of semi-structured interviews in firms entering foreign markets suggests that the combination of different knowledge types held by a firm is an important factor in reducing the risk of misappropriation of k...

Title: Good Visions, Bad Micro-management and Ugly Ambiguity: Contradictions of                 (Non-)Leadership in a Knowledge-Intensive Organization
Author-Name: Mats Alvesson
Author-Name: Stefan Sveningsson
Abstract: This article investigates how managers position themselves and their work in terms of leadership in a large knowledge-intensive company. The significance of contemporary discourse on leadership, practical aspects of managerial work, and ambiguity as a central dimension of organization and leadership (particularly in knowledge-intensive settings) are highlighted. We examine the presumed leadership in a company with respect to the three `moral' and `aesthetic' positions or aspects of leadership: good, bad and ugly leadership. The article shows how managers incoherently move between different positions on leadership. The study undermines some of the dominant notions of leadership, for example, the leader as a consistent essence, a centred subject with a particular orientation to work. We suggest a less comfortable view of managers aspiring to adopt, but partly failing to secure leadership identities and a coherent view of their work. Value commitments appear as disintegrated and contradictory. The study indi...

Author-Name: Sally Maitlis
Abstract: In this article, we explore the social construction of workplace envy through an analysis of its portrayal in a fictional narrative. Based on our examination of three excerpts from Richard Russo's novel Straight Man, we argue that envy is socially constructed in prominent and revealing episodes within broader organizational narratives. We further show that envy both serves as a catalytic emotion that engenders action and sensemaking, and at the same time, acts as a mechanism that reproduces the moral and cultural order within which it occurs.

Abstract: This article focuses on rationalization, its dimensions, the possibilities of reasoned justification in the public sphere, and the technologies that would operationalize this. It does so through an analysis of the introduction of performance measurement in the Provincial Government of Alberta, Canada. We argue that performance measurement represents twin dimensions of rationalization: the pursuit of reason in human affairs, that is, the process of bringing to light the justifications by which actions and policies are pursued; and rationalization as the increasing dominance of a means-end instrumental rationality. The article illustrates how an initial enthusiasm by managers for the performance management initiatives was replaced with scepticism and cynicism. We show how the potential for reasoned justification was frustrated in practice, through a growing disparity between a discourse of reasoned justification and the practical operationalization of mechanisms of business planning and performance measurem...

Author-Name: Galit Ailon-Souday
Author-Name: Gideon Kunda
Abstract: This article seeks to further understanding of the significance and impact of national identity in the context of organizational globalization. Arguing against the tendency of organizational researchers to pose this identity as an objective, cognitive essence, the article claims that national identity constitutes a symbolic resource that is actively and creatively constructed by organizational members to serve social struggles which are triggered by globalization. It offers support to this claim with ethnographic field data generated from an Israeli high-tech corporation undergoing a merger with an American competitor. The implications of the article concern the need for researchers to take into account the space for choice that organizational members have in defining national identity and the interrelationships between the enactment of this identity and processes of resistance to globalization.

Abstract: Despite the intuitive relation between national and organizational culture, empirical research relating the two phenomena is sparse. This article compares the national and organizational cultures of India, Brazil, and the USA, uncovering a significant but complex relationship. Clusters are found in all three countries that both systematically replicate and reject national values. Possible reasons for these `isomorphic' and `rejective' responses to national culture are explored and their theoretical implications developed.

Abstract: Despite a growing acknowledgement in the literature of the `socially embedded' character of organizational knowledge, in this article we argue that conceptualizations of knowledge management have remained aloof from the agency that they seek to inform, particularly in relation to managing within physically dispersed organizations. We seek, therefore, to explore the essential link between knowledge and action (`knowledge-ability') through an empirical investigation of the organizational conditions and managerial labour needed to preserve knowledge-ability within a transnational. In order to achieve this, we compare the experiences and practices of three managers located in China, Columbia and Australia as they seek both to communicate knowledge of their local context to the remote centre in order to influence policy and gather knowledge of what is happening remotely in order to coordinate their local action with shifts in corporate thinking. A model of the resources needed in order to limit and repair the ...

Title: Indifference or Obedience? Business Firms as Democratic Hybrids
Author-Name: David Courpasson
Author-Name: Françoise Dany
Abstract: To the perennial question of why and how people obey, organizational and political theories usually offer a restricted vision mainly based on interpersonal power processes and organizational control mechanisms. Although such theories are useful, the recent evolution of business organizations toward post-bureaucratic models means they must be combined with another dimension that we call ‘moral obedience’. In this article, we suggest that morality is developing in managerial strategies as business contexts become more and more fragile, uncertain and threatened. We argue that this ‘moral movement’ may be pervasive in hybrid political regimes of governance combining democratic and bureaucratic aspects. The purpose of business leaders is to create loosened communities where people should feel a sense of duty and where, at the same time, a sense of being unique and competitive should remain strongly embedded in individual rationales.

Title: The Combination of Strategic Games and Moral Community in the Functioning of Firms
Author-Name: Philippe D’Iribarne
Abstract: In order to describe the functioning of business firms, two different models of collective action are currently mobilized. The first represents the firm as an arena for the different strategies of actors who want to maximize their interests. The second model focuses on the existence of shared values, of a common culture. In order to contribute to synthesis between these two approaches, two opposite situations are compared: the running of a firm in Morocco, which appears to be a communitylike enterprise, and the running of a firm in the USA, where on the contrary, the community elements seem to be markedly absent. We analyze how the strategies of actors are combined with a collective adherence to a moral community. This enables us to propose a theoretical approach combining these two facets of the firms’ functioning. In the two cases, we have found a common perception of the good and the bad which enables us to talk about a moral community.

Abstract: How does social science based organization theory describe the business firm? Sociology, political science, social psychology and ethnology have inspired two almost classical perspectives. One theorizes the firm as an arena for strategic behavior. The other underlines the way social pressure mechanisms structure a moral community dimension. Two additional approaches exist, less explored. The firm can be defined as a collective actor, the agenda for knowledge being to explain how far collective choice is possible. Or the firm may be studied from a cognitive perspective, as an organization which interprets and thinks. The article argues that organization theory offers a unitary if not limited view of the business firm. Social sciences basically debate around two alternative views which differentiate according to four characteristics: the action arena or the context of behavior; the teleological property of the unit; the payoff matrix or the sources of preferences with which members enter collective choice c...

Title: Organizational Process, Strategic Content and Socio-Economic Resources: Small                Enterprises in East Germany, 1990–94
Author-Name: Arndt Sorge
Author-Name: Martin Brussig
Abstract: The theory of the firm implies a framework which links up conceptually diverse aspects and approaches. This article tests a specific framework: an interactionist variant of co-evolution theory derived from an article by Hrebiniak and Joyce. Organizations are viewed as enacting different combinations of strategic choice and environmental determinism, which point toward specific market forms and internal processes, through a process of mutual adaptation. Co-evolutionary configurations are hypothesized to have an effect on resource outcomes (profitability and employment). The present article tests this theory, based on a combined qualitative study and standardized questionnaire investigation of a quota sample of 120 smaller enterprises in East Germany. This refers to an environment which, because of the new and rapid emergence of new firms subdivided into different types, can be seen to render the application of interactionist co-evolutionism particularly exigent. It was found that the typology derived accor...

Title: A Theory of the Cultural Evolution of the Firm: The Intra-Organizational                Ecology of Memes
Author-Name: John Weeks
Author-Name: Charles Galunic
Abstract: In this article, we propose a theory of the cultural evolution of the firm. We apply cultural and evolutionary thinking to the questions posed by theories of the firm: What are firms and why do they exist? We argue that firms are best thought of as cultures, as social distributions of modes of thought and forms of externalization. Using the term ‘meme’ to refer collectively to cultural modes of thought (ideas, beliefs, assumptions, values, interpretative schema, and know-how), we describe culture as a social phenomenon, patterns of symbolic communication and behavior that are produced as members of the group enact the memes they have acquired as part of the culture. Memes spread from mind to mind as they are enacted and the resulting cultural patterns are observed and interpreted by others. The uncertainties of interpretation and the possibilities of reinterpretation and recontextualization create variation in the memes as they spread. Over time, firms evolve as a process of the selection, variation, and ...

Title: Bridging Uncertainty in Management Consulting: The Mechanisms of Trust and Networked Reputation
Author-Name: Johannes Glückler
Author-Name: Thomas Armbrüster
Abstract: This article analyzes the market of management consulting and identifies institutional and transactional uncertainty as its principal features. Based on these uncertainties, we argue that competition in this market takes place on entirely different grounds than in other business sectors. We suggest that the main drivers of competitiveness are neither price nor measurable quality, but rather experience-based trust and a mechanism we label ‘networked reputation.’ An embeddedness perspective is employed to develop the concept of networked reputation as an intermediate mechanism that complements the duality of system versus personal trust and accounts for firm growth. We reinterpret secondary data on the German consulting market, illustrate the significance of these mechanisms, and demonstrate how management consulting is situated in structures of social relations.

Title: Occupation Regimes Alike and Unlike: British, Dutch and French Patterns of                Inter-Organizational Control of Foreign Territories
Author-Name: Cornelis J. Lammers
Abstract: Occupation, in the sense of foreign domination brought about or sustained by force, is nearly always characterized by the use (or threat) of negative sanctions, by some form of authority, and by the application of positive sanctions. Furthermore, loyal elites (auxiliaries legitimized from above) and native elites (legitimized from below) generally play a crucial role in the control of the subjugated populace. Intercultural variations in occupation regimes are illustrated by the historical example of Dutch, British and French patterns of control in the Spanish Netherlands in the early 18th century. Whereas the Dutch and the English preferred indirect rule via native elites, the French tended to favour direct rule by assimilated loyal elites. However, the French and the Dutch practised, albeit in varying ways, ‘close supervision’, while the British displayed a fairly relaxed ‘laissez-faire’ pattern of control. Similar differences were discerned in studies of the colonial administration practices of Britain,...

Title: Strategic Choice and the Nature of the Chinese Family Business: An                Exploratory Study of the Hong Kong Watch Industry
Author-Name: Howard Davies
Author-Name: Catherine Ma
Abstract: This study examines the relationship between the nature of the Chinese Family Business (CFB) and the business strategies adopted, in the setting of the Hong Kong watch industry. The nature of the CFB is conceptualized and measured as a set of sub-dimensions, represented by continuous variables. It is hypothesized that ‘ CFBness’ is positively associated with ‘traditional’ business strategies, but inhibitive of ‘upgrading’. The results show that the hypotheses are partially supported. While the findings support the view that firms’ strategic choices are constrained by material and ideational influences in their environment, only a small proportion of the variation in business strategies is accounted for by ‘CFB-ness’, leaving ample room for human agency. Overall, the results support a ‘middle view’ between the deterministic and voluntaristic perspectives, whereby firms exercise strategic choice within an environment that predisposes, but does not fix, their behaviour.

Title: Families Divided: Culture and Control in Small Family Business
Author-Name: Susan Ainsworth
Author-Name: Julie Wolfram Cox
Abstract: In this article, we explore the dynamics of control, compliance and resistance using two case studies where ‘family’ has symbolic, material and ideological significance. While the ‘family’ metaphor is often invoked to suggest a normative unity and integration in large organizations, we investigate the use of shared understandings of divisions (Parker 1995) and difference, as well as unity and similarity, in constituting organizational culture in two small family-owned firms. Diverging from mainstream family business research, we adopt a critical and interpretative approach that incorporates employee perspectives and explores how forms of control and resistance need to be understood in relation to their local contexts. We also argue that organization studies could benefit from revisiting progressive assumptions that equate developments in forms of organization with forms of organizational control.

Title: The History of Organizational Renewal: Evolutionary Models of Spanish Savings                and Loans Institutions
Author-Name: Valle Santos ¡lvarez
Author-Name: Teresa GarcÌa Merino
Abstract: This study is aimed at, first, gaining a better understanding of organizational evolutionary processes and, second, their adaptation mechanisms. The research on selection makes it clear that different evolutionary patterns can be characterized, particularly if resources and capabilities are considered. By applying this theoretical model to the population of Spanish savings and loans entities, we have found not only diverse adaptation mechanisms, but also the important role played by strategic behaviour in achieving internal adaptation. In addition, we have also found that each organizational evolution is clearly influenced by resources and capabilities. Hence, the process of organizational evolution appears complex and dependent on environmental dynamics. In sum, it can be concluded that the process of organizational renewal faced by Spanish savings and loans institutions led to different adaptation mechanisms, mechanisms which were strongly influenced by organizational resources and capabilities.

Title: From Americanization to Colonization: The Diffusion of Productivity Models Revisited
Author-Name: Michal Frenkel
Author-Name: Yehouda Shenhav
Abstract: Drawing on postcolonial studies, this article seeks to add a layer to the literature concerning the Americanization of productivity models and management in general. Based on a genealogical analysis of Israel’s productivity models, we juxtapose two processes by which productivity models were disseminated: first, by the British colonial authorities, and then as part of American technical assistance to Israel. Thus, we draw attention to the close ties between Americanization and colonialism. Our objective is to show empirically how earlier colonial practices preceded and set the stage for later processes of Americanization, and to stress the similar logic that both processes tend to follow.

Title: Implications of Self-Reference: Niklas Luhmann’s Autopoiesis and                Organization Theory
Author-Name: Tor Hernes
Author-Name: Tore Bakken
Abstract: This article reviews the potential of Niklas Luhmann’s autopoiesis as a contribution to organization theory. We consider organization theory to consist of three epistemological foundations, which we label equilibrium-based theory, process-based theory and recursivity-based theory. We review critically Luhmann’s autopoietic theory in relation to each of these three foundations. We suggest that whereas it deviates radically from equilibrium-based theory and deviates significantly from process-based theory, it holds potential in its complementarity with Giddens’s structuration theory in providing a promising basis for recursivity-based organization theory.

Title: ‘Subterranean Worksick Blues’: Humour as Subversion in                Two Call Centres
Author-Name: Phil Taylor
Author-Name: Peter Bain
Abstract: This article engages in debates stimulated by previous work published in Organization Studies, and more widely, on the purpose and effects of workers’ humour and joking practices. The authors emphasize the subversive character of humour in the workplace, rejecting perspectives which see humour as inevitably contributing to organizational harmony. Drawing on methodologies, including ethnography, which permitted the authors to penetrate the organizational surface of two call centres, rich evidence of satire and joking practices were uncovered. While long-acknowledged motives were revealed, particularly relief from boredom and routine, workers’ use of humour took novel, call centre specific forms. Overwhelmingly, though, humour contributed to the development of vigorous countercultures in both locations, which conflicted with corporate aims and priorities. However, the particular combinations of managerial culture, attitudes to trade unionism and dissent, and the nature of oppositional groupings helped impar...

Title: Contradictions of Democracy in a Workers’ Cooperative
Author-Name: Rahul Varman
Author-Name: Manali Chakrabarti
Abstract: Organizational democracy has become a key issue in current change-management programmes, such as restructuring, total quality management and Enterprise Resource Planning, and there has been a persistent quest for a post-Fordist model in recent times. The article emphasizes the need to study democratic processes per se, given that democracy faces significant odds vis-a-vis the larger context, even in those organizations that have been expressly initiated for democratic functioning. The contradictions with the context inevitably manifest themselves inside the organization as well. The present study makes a case for understanding organizational democracy as an evolving reality, based on participant observation of democratic functioning within a workers’ cooperative over seven years.

Title: Cognitive Style and the Management of Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises
Author-Name: Eugene Sadler-Smith
Abstract: A long-standing dilemma in theories of management surrounds the question of whether effective managerial action is better served by ‘rational analysis’ or ‘creative intuition’. In the present article, analysis and intuition are conceived within a framework of cognitive style in which a distinction is drawn between the processing of information (rational and intuitive) and the organizing of information in memory (local and global). Such styles are thought to affect a range of management behaviours (including decision-making). The relationship between managers’ cognitive styles and firm performance was examined from a contingency perspective in which environmental instability was hypothesized as moderating the relationship between style and performance. The study was based upon data obtained from owner-managers and managing directors of small and medium-sized firms in two contrasting sectors. There was a positive relationship between intuitive decision style and contemporaneous financial and non-financial p...

Abstract: The aim of this article is to outline in discursive-linguistic terms how doctor-managers (or ‘physician-executives’ as they are termed in the USA) manage the incommensurate dimensions of their boundary position between profession and organization. In order to achieve this we undertook a discourse analytical study of both recorded, situated talk and open interview data focusing on one doctor-manager navigating between profession and organization. The doctor-manager at the centre of this study locates himself on the boundary of at least three discourses which, in many respects, are incommensurate. These are the profession-specific discourse of clinical medicine, the resource-efficiency and systematization discourse of management, and an interpersonalizing discourse devoted to hedging and mitigating contradictions. While this multi-vocality in itself is not surprising, data show that the doctor-manager positions himself across these discourses and manages their inherent incommensurabilities before a heteroge...

Author-Name: Linda L. Putnam
Abstract: This article reviews and critiques traditional approaches to the study of discourse in negotiations. Then, drawing from an ethnographic study, it contrasts different ways in which discourse either constrains disputants or enables them to transform issues and the very nature of their disputes. Through an analysis of two rhetorical tropes used in the discourse, it examines the way in which bargainers enact tacit norms, use bargaining formulas, and define the nature of their interdependence. The article then draws from the textual analysis of negotiation to contrast different ways that meanings and organizational understandings are produced and reproduced through social interaction.

Author-Name: Patrizia Zanoni
Author-Name: Maddy Janssens
Abstract: This article analyses texts on diversity produced in 25 interviews with Flemish human resource (HR) managers from a critical discourse analysis and rhetorical perspective. Following critical discourse analysis, we analyse how HR managers define diversity, how their diversity discourses reflect existing managerial practices and underlying power relations, and how they reaffirm or challenge those managerial practices and power relations. Specifically, we examine how power enters HR managers’ local discourses of diversity through the very micro-dynamics of language by analysing the rhetorical schemes they use and the grand Discourses they draw from. This critical, text-focused approach to diversity discourses contributes to the development of a non-essentialist reconceptualization of diversity that acknowledges power.

Abstract: This article is concerned with the introduction of the agenda of New Public Management (NPM) within the board of a UK Hospital Trust: West London Hospital (WLH). We discuss the literature on New Public Management, including its limitations for analysing the organizational reality of implementing NPM. But we will also be drawing on discourse theory and the literature on rhetoric. The main argument in this article is that in order to understand the reality of the NPM paradigm, we need to study the rhetorical strategies of protagonists involved in the negotiation of the NPM agenda. Rhetorical strategies are means of making general viewpoints more convincing, for example, by comparing ‘our’ organization with similar organizations. Rhetorical strategies show patterns, which reappear in conversations and arguments made by protagonists. Specifically, we identified three rhetorical strategies justifying why and what kind of a more ‘rounded picture’ was required: widening the argument to include national productiv...

Title: Authoritative Sensemaking in a Public Inquiry Report
Author-Name: Andrew D. Brown
Abstract: This article analyses the Cullen Report into the Piper Alpha disaster in order to research how public inquiry teams represent their efforts to make sense of events as authoritative. It is argued that inquiry reports are highly convention-governed sensemaking narratives that employ various forms of verisimilitude in order to bolster their authority. They are also monological storytelling performances that function hegemonically to impose a particular version of reality on their readers. The investigation of the means by which inquiry reports accomplish verisimilitude and hegemony are important as they may shed light on how this form of public discourse depoliticizes disaster events, legitimates social institutions, and lessens anxieties by concocting myths that emphasize our omnipotence and capacity to control.

Abstract: Product substitution is an important discontinuity in technology evolution. Conventional accounts draw on rational, linear models of change and emphasize that the process is driven by the appearance and adoption of new artifacts. This article adopts a constructivist approach to address the question of whether the social reconstruction of incumbent artifacts can trigger their substitution, even in the absence of new alternatives. Drawing on a case study of the insecticide DDT and employing a discourse analytical perspective, four artifact-constituting discourses which have been employed to construct and reconstruct DDT are identified, and their implications for product substitution discussed.

Title: The Cross-National Diffusion of Work Systems: Translation of Japanese                Operations in the UK
Author-Name: Ayse Saka
Abstract: This article investigates the process of the cross-national diffusion of work systems to the affiliate firms of three Japanese multinational companies in the UK. It examines the degree to which structural, cultural, and control-related work systems of the source company are adopted by the recipient. The case studies highlight the interplay between institutional forces and organizational action through a process of work-systems translation. The study is based on a systematic comparative analysis of the ways in which Japanese work systems are implemented and sustained in the given firms. It concludes that firms attempt to translate alternative work systems rather than submit to environmental pressures toward isomorphism. The process of diffusing work systems is not driven by pre-existing legacies alone. There is room for social action in that actors, through their interaction, contribute actively to shaping the work organization.

Title: A Dual-Motor, Constructive Process Model of Organizational Transition
Author-Name: Paul E. Cule
Author-Name: Daniel Robey
Abstract: The hyper-competitive global business environment of the information age has challenged many companies to transform their business models and organizational forms. Drawing from the theoretical models of Van de Ven and Poole, we propose a process theory of organizational transition that incorporates two generative mechanisms, or ‘motors’. At the individual level, we employ a teleological motor, which captures the managerial actions undertaken to promote transformation. At the organizational level, we employ a dialectic motor, which captures forces both promoting and opposing change. The model consists of three sequential phases of transition: creation, destruction, and unification. The model is grounded in an empirical study of a large company undergoing a major transition in business model and organization structure during the decade of the 1990s.

Title: Narrative Temporality: Implications for Organizational Research
Author-Name: Ann L. Cunliffe
Author-Name: John T. Luhman
Author-Name: David M. Boje
Abstract: Our aim is to stimulate critical reflection on an issue that has received relatively little attention: how alternative presuppositions about time can lead to different narrative ways of researching and theorizing organizational life. Based on two amendments to Paul Ricoeur’s work in Time and Narrative, we re-story narrative research in organizations as Narrative Temporality (NT). Our amendments draw upon the temporality perspective of Jean-Paul Sartre in order to reframe narrative research in organizations as a fluid, dynamic, yet rigorous process open to the interpretations (negotiated) of its many participants (polyphonic) and situated in the context and point of enactment (synchronic). We believe an approach to narrative organizational research grounded in NT can open up new ways of thinking about experience and sense-making, and help us take reflexive responsibility for our research.

Abstract: Findings regarding the direction and intensity of the relation between size and innovation in the literature are contradictory. In the journal Organization Studies in 1992, Damanpour proposed a meta-analytical study in an attempt to clarify the diversity of existing conclusions. The present article is a replica and an extension of that study using the same methodology. Our aim is to (1) bring the pool of accumulated knowledge up to date, examining the time span 1970–2001, and (2) review in greater depth the effects of alternative ways of measuring organizational size. The sample used was made up of 87 correlations drawn from 53 empirical studies published in the most important journals on business administration. The analysis enabled us to confirm the existence of a significant and positive correlation between size and innovation. It also provided evidence showing that the contradictory results obtained in previous studies are due to divergences in the methods used to operationalize one, or more, of the v...

Abstract: This article revisits a central question in the debates on the management of multinationals: the balance between centralized policy-making and subsidiary autonomy. It does so through data from a series of case studies on the management of human resources in American multinationals in the UK. Two strands of debate are confronted. The first is the literature on differences between multinationals of different national origins which has shown that US companies tend to be more centralized, standardized, and formalized in their management of human resources. It is argued that the literature has provided unconvincing explanations of this pattern, failing to link it to distinctive features of the American business system in which US multinationals are embedded. The second strand is the wider debate on the balance between centralization and decentralization in multinationals. It is argued that the literature neglects important features of this balance: the contingent oscillation between centralized and decentraliz...

Title: Field Approaches to Institutional Change: The Evolution of the National                Collegiate Athletic Association 1906–1995
Author-Name: Marvin Washington
Abstract: This article uses qualitative and quantitative data to examine the institutional change of an interest association. Interest associations are unique institutions in that they may be more concerned with membership growth than with economic gain. However, these associations play a vital role in the social control and evolution of organizational fields. After a discussion of the theoretical literature on institutional change, I examine the change of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) as it competed for dominance in the US collegiate athletic field with a contender institution, the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics. I hypothesize, and find support for the claim that to contend with the competing institution, the NCAA changed by changing its membership criteria. In the early period of the NCAA, it was a place for only high-status schools. After 1952, the NCAA attracted lower-status schools, which were previously not interested in joining the NCAA. This study advances institutio...

Title: Learning Groups: What Types are there? A Theoretical Analysis and an                Empirical Study in a Consultancy Firm
Author-Name: Irma Bogenrieder
Author-Name: Bart Nooteboom
Abstract: This article attempts to unpack the notion of ‘communities of practice’, in more detail than has been done before, and looks more generally at intra-organizational groups for learning. First, it gives a theoretical analysis of the relevant characteristics of learning groups which affect the possibilities and conditions for the sharing and joint development of knowledge. These characteristics include opportunities for learning (on the ‘competence’ side of relations), relational risk (on the ‘governance’ side of relations), and the effects on both from the ‘structural features’ of groups. On the competence side, it analyses the implications of different types of knowledge and learning, and the trade-off between stability of relations (for the sake of mutual understanding and trust) and flexibility of relations (for the sake of variety as a source of learning). On the structural side, it considers the effects on competence and governance of network density, the strength of ties, structural holes, and stabili...

Title: Codes of Good Governance Worldwide: What is the Trigger?

Author-Name: Alvaro Cuervo-Cazurra
Abstract: This article examines the mechanisms underlying the worldwide diffusion of organizational practices. We suggest that the two main theoretical explanations in the diffusion literature, efficiency and legitimation, can be complementary. More specifically, we argue that endogenous forces seek to enhance the efficiency of existing systems, while exogenous forces seek to increase legitimation. To assess our argument, we explore the worldwide diffusion of codes of good governance. These codes are a set of ‘best practice’ recommendations regarding the behavior and structure of a firm’s board of directors issued to compensate for deficiencies in a country’s corporate governance system regarding the protection of shareholders’ rights. We have collected data on codes of good governance for 49 countries. We operationalize efficiency needs in terms of the characteristics of shareholder protection, and legitimation pressures in terms of government liberalization, economic openness, and presence of foreign institutiona...

Title: Ocularcentrism and its Others: A Framework for Metatheoretical Analysis
Author-Name: Donncha Kavanagh
Abstract: There is a contemporary scepticism towards vision-based metaphors in management and organization studies that reflects a more general pattern across the social sciences. In short, there has been a shift away from ocularcentrism. This shift provides a useful basis for metatheoretical analysis of the philosophical discourse that informs organizational analysis. The article begins by briefly discussing the vision-generated, vision-centred interpretation of knowledge, truth, and reality that has characterized the western philosophical tradition. Taking late 18th-century rationalism as the high-point of ocularcentrism, the article then presents a metatheoretical framework based on three trajectories that critiques of ocularcentrism have subsequently taken. The first exposes the limits of the metaphor by, paradoxically, taking it to its limits. The second trajectory seeks to displace the primordial position of the ocular metaphor and replace it with an alternative lexicon based on other human senses. Last, the ...

Title: The Effects of Liminality on Individual and Organizational Learning
Author-Name: Sue Tempest
Author-Name: Ken Starkey
Abstract: This article uses an examination of the changing nature of organization in the UK television industry to reflect on the impact of liminality on learning. We take as our starting point Garsten’s (1999) use of the term ‘liminality’ (being situated ‘betwixt and between’) to examine individual and organizational learning in the context of organizational recomposition, where learning increasingly occurs at the limits of organizations within networks and teams that cross organizational divides. Garsten argues that the contractualization of work can be seen to challenge the old boundaries of organization and that it suggests new ways of organizing and experiencing work. By extending liminality to the concept of learning, we suggest that as more industries adopt temporary project teams as a way of organizing work, this not only challenges the concept of organization as an enduring social artefact, but also raises issues about how learning and knowledge development takes place. We examine the effects of liminal ep...

Title: Strategy as Practice: Recursiveness, Adaptation, and Practices-in-Use
Author-Name: Paula Jarzabkowski
Abstract: In this article, a social theory framework is developed to explain the common themes of recursive and adaptive practice underpinning the existing strategic management literature. In practice, there is a coexistent tension between recursive and adaptive forms of strategic action that spans multiple levels from macro-institutional and competitive contexts to within-firm levels of analysis to individual cognition. This tension may be better understood by examining how management practices are used to put strategy into practice. Such practices span multiple levels of context and are adaptable to their circumstances of use, serving to highlight both general characteristics and localized idiosyncrasies of strategy as practice. The article develops the concept of management practices-in-use into a research agenda and nine broad research questions that may be used to investigate empirically strategy as practice.

Abstract: While there has been much discussion of the social dynamics of technology evolution within the technology management literature, this has made relatively little use of work done by sociologists on similar issues. In this article, the potential of sociological research to inform our understanding of technology evolution and dominance is explored, focusing in particular on the contribution of actor network theory. The bringing together of questions posed by technology management theorists and insights offered by social theorists provides new insights on technology evolution, and generates several important implications for both research and practice.

Title: In Search of Modernization: The Negotiation of Social Identity in Organizational Reform
Author-Name: Nick Llewellyn
Abstract: Based on the analysis of two short documents, this article considers how social categories, such as bureaucracy, council, business, and so on, are utilized in descriptions of project work. Specifically, it examines the locally occasioned interpretative practices that enabled a single project (in a UK local authority) to be described as modernizing the way services were delivered. In part, this involved negotiating the category ‘bureaucratic’, with the author often reasoning it would be somehow misleading to use such a category to describe the project. The article focuses on the negotiation of social categories and on the work done to present aspects of the project as ‘documents’ (Garfinkel 1967) of the authority’s category membership, as ‘in keeping’ with what would be expected of such a type. Categorization, the act of tying specific events to social types or categories, is shown to be a significant resource in accounting for the character of project work. The article adds to debates on organizational id...

Author-Name: Steve Toms
Author-Name: Igor Filatotchev
Abstract: This article develops a theoretical model to explain the variation of network structures and network dynamics according to industry and firm resource characteristics and the extent of resource dependency. It incorporates an accountability and corporate governance dimension and thereby seeks to explain the long-run processes of industrial and corporate change. To verify the theoretical framework, the article examines the long-run evolution of network structures in the British cotton industry. It shows how this industry developed network structures as part of the process of industrialization and then goes on to explain how these structures prevented flexible and timely responses to the later challenges of restructuring and re-equipping. The article also shows that the application of the theoretical model offers an opportunity to reinterpret the history of this archetypal industry.

Title: Power, Action and Constraint in Strategic Management: Explaining Enterprise                Restructuring in the Czech Republic
Author-Name: Ed Clark
Abstract: One significant strand of organization and management theory has been the development of approaches that focus on the active role of management in formulating strategic responses, such as organizational restructuring, to the external business environment. Despite subscribing to the idea that ‘management matters’, however, influential theories have often ignored or minimized the role of human agency. This article examines the strategic management process by placing the interaction between management power and action at the heart of the empirical and theoretical enterprise. The theory construction process evolves inductively from case study research on the restructuring processes and outcomes in four large Czech enterprises. The empirical findings and theoretical arguments strongly support the importance of introducing a political dimension into a sensemaking framework as a fruitful way of progressing the theory of strategic management action.

Title: Expectations of Alignment: Examining the Link Between Financial Markets and                Managerial Work
Author-Name: Stefan Tengblad
Abstract: Based on a direct observation study of eight CEOs of large corporations, this paper examines how control is exercised in an era of financial transparency. In particular, the impact and effects of the increasing power of shareholders (corporate governance, shareholder value) with regard to managerial practices are investigated. The results show that CEOs were to a great extent influenced by expectations from exchange market actors and that such expectations, in a modified form, were passed down the hierarchy. Senior managers were given discretion in their work, but their performance (on the basis of how well they met expectations) was closely watched. The exercise of control by setting and monitoring expectations resulted in some managers working to exhaustion, and also in conformity and non-constructive communication. At the end of the paper, the effects of shareholder value management are discussed in relation to the societal level regarding issues of governance ethics, organizational development and wor...

Title: Toward a Scientific Inquiry into Superstitious Business Decision-Making
Author-Name: Eric W. K. Tsang
Abstract: This article presents the findings of an exploratory study of the role of superstition in Chinese business decision-making. The study confirms the general perception that superstition constitutes a crucial part of business life in Chinese societies. Superstition helps Chinese businessmen cope with uncertainty by providing a sense of certainty and alleviating the anxiety associated with uncertainty. Although superstition is often regarded as irrational and unfounded, practitioners try to justify it on the grounds of superstition’s substantive validity or instrumental value. Interestingly, half-believers of superstition admit that they experience cognitive dissonance: they should not base their decisions on superstition but they do. Another important finding is that feng shui experts play their roles as expert, provocateur, legitimizer, and comforter in strategic decision-making when providing advice to their business clients.

Title: Means-End Frames and the Politics and Myths of Organizational Fields
Author-Name: Finn Borum
Abstract: The processing of means-end frames is proposed as a key to understanding the reproduction and evolution of organizational fields. In lieu of regarding ‘rationalized myths’ as established social constructs that are diffused within a field, the present analysis looks into how the field constituents construct a rationalized myth, the operations through which they strive to accomplish this, and the unresolved divergences and problems tied to establishing shared understandings of central causal chains. It is argued that the social construction of means-end frames is central to preserving a shared understanding of an organizational field’s goals and the organizing principles by which these can be realized. In participating in the construction and interpretation of means-end frames the central actors reproduce and evolve the organizational field. The processing of means-end frames may contribute to both field reproduction and destabilization. Based on an analysis of the Danish hospital field, it is demonstrated ...

Title: From Press to E-Media? The Transformation of an Organizational Field
Author-Name: Carmelo Mazza
Author-Name: Jesper Strandgaard Pedersen
Abstract: The dynamics of field transformation is an under-investigated topic within organization theory. Drawing on the new institutional theory of organization, field transformation dynamics is examined, focusing on four change factors—external shocks, changes at the field periphery, ineffective isomorphic pressures and rearrangement of field boundaries. The impact of and interplay between these change factors is investigated within the business press field in Denmark and Italy over the last four decades. Four propositions are suggested and explored to analyse the relevance of change factors in the transformation of the business press field. The evidence from the Danish and Italian cases reveals how changes from the field periphery have minor impact on the field transformation, whereas external shocks, ineffective isomorphic pressures and boundary rearrangements play a major role. Based on these findings, a research agenda is suggested encompassing theory-driven attempts to define change factors and identify patt...

Abstract: The craft of idea generation is explored autobiographically, using as the core principle the theme that ideas generate their own contexts for development. Ideas generate their own contexts by means of conceptual affinities, as is illustrated by the author’s movement from ideas about unintended consequences to ideas about cognitive dissonance, enacted environments, organizational failures, and wisdom. Ideas also generate their own context by means of the assumptions they entail, in the author’s case, these entailments being assumptions of continuity, evolution, ambivalence, complexity, and levels of analysis. When activated, these diverse resources may generate portraits of human organizing that have poetic overtones, but that resemblance simply mirrors the fact that people do poetry in their everyday living.

Title: Aristotle, Ethics and Business Organizations
Author-Name: Robert C. Solomon
Abstract: I have developed a theoretical framework which I call ‘an Aristotelian approach to business’ to talk about corporations and organizations in general. Although Aristotle is famous largely as an enemy of business, he was the first economist and he might well be called the first business ethicist as well. We can no longer accept the amoral idea that ‘business is business’ (not really a tautology but an excuse for being socially irresponsible and personally insensitive). According to Aristotle, one has to think of oneself as a member of the larger community—the Polis for him, the corporation, the neighborhood, the city or the country (and the world) for us—and strive to excel, to bring out what is best in ourselves and our shared enterprise. What is best in us—our virtues—are in turn defined by that larger community, and there is therefore no ultimate split or antagonism between individual self-interest and the greater public good. The Aristotelian approach to business ethics, rather, begins with the two-pron...

Title: What Are We Playing at? Theatre, Organization, and the Use of Metaphor
Author-Name: Joep P. Cornelissen
Abstract: This article addresses the question of how metaphor works and illustrates this with an explication of the ‘organization as theatre’ metaphor. It is argued that the so-called comparison account of metaphor that has dominated organization studies to date is flawed, misguided, and incapable of accounting for the fact that metaphors generate inferences beyond the similarities required for comprehending the metaphor and that metaphoric understanding is creative, with the features of importance being emergent rather than existing antecedently. A new model of metaphor for organizational theorizing is therefore proposed in this article and illustrated through an extended discussion and explication of the ‘organization as theatre’ metaphor. This explication shows furthermore that the ‘organization as theatre’ metaphor has not broken any new ground or led to any conceptual advances in organization theory, but has just provided a language of theatre (actors, scenes, scripts, and so on) for framing and communicating ...

Abstract: This article uses the improvisational theatre metaphor to examine the performance implications of improvisational processes in firms. We recognize similarities and differences between the concepts of performance and success in both theatre and organizations, and extract three main lessons from improvisational theatre that can be applied to organizational improvisation. In the first lesson, we start by recognizing the equivocal and unpredictable nature of improvisation. The second lesson emphasizes that good improvisational theatre arises because its main focus, in contrast to the focus of firms, is more on the process of improvising and less on the outcomes of improvisation. Lastly, in the third lesson, we look at the theatre techniques of ‘agreement’, ‘awareness’, ‘use of ready-mades’, and ‘collaboration’, and translate them into concepts that are relevant for organizations in developing an improvisational capability.

Abstract: Enron shows us dramaturgy gone amuck. In this article, critical theory and postmodern theory are crossed to form a critical dramaturgyresulting in two main contributions. First, critical dramaturgy is differentiated from other forms of dramaturgy, showing how ‘spectacle’ is accomplished through a theatrical performance that legitimates and rationalizes, and casts the public in the role of passive spectators. Second, critical dramaturgy has important connections with public relations theory. While contemporary public relations is concerned with the building of relationships, critical dramaturgy looks at how corporate theatrical image management inhibits relationships by erecting the barrier of the metaphorical proscenium. The Enron scandal is viewed as the collapse of a corporate spectacle illusion into megaspectacle fragments. These fragments include the naming of Enron, the Valhalla Rogue Traders scandal, the Gas Bank, Greenmail, Cowboy Capitalism, the Skilling–Mark rivalry, and the Masters of the Univer...

Title: Comic Relief: Subversion and Catharsis in Organizational Comedic Theatre
Author-Name: Robert Westwood
Abstract: There has been a growth of interest in the role of humour in organizations from both practitioner and academic perspectives. Various claims for the functionality of humour have been made, ranging from stress reduction to helping form and cement corporate cultures. Latching on to these presumed benefits, businesses and consultants have begun to employ humour and comedy in a direct and explicit manner. However, there is a counterpoint, which suggests that humour cannot always be managed and in fact has subversive qualities. This article addresses the issue of the subversive potential of comedy in organizational contexts. It draws illustratively on the case of a successful corporate comedian to do so. The article argues, through an analysis of the case, the history and philosophy of comedy, and theories of the comedic, that while comedy has inherent subversive potential, it most often is contained. Indeed, it suggests that comedy works by intruding as a potential threat to mundane reality, but offers comic r...

Title: Which Catharsis Do They Mean? Aristotle, Moreno, Boal and Organization Theatre
Author-Name: Stefan Meisiek
Abstract: An often-suggested effect of dramatic performances is catharsis. In this essay, three catharsis-related concepts are used to help explain the effects of organization theatre. First, according to Aristotle, theatre leads to release from negative affect, whereby the eliciting of emotions is seen as a means of purifying related bad memories. Theatre is supposed to arouse feelings connected with recognized problems by presenting these on the stage, thus allowing the audience to relive them passively and, because of their non-real presentation as drama, also to resolve them. The second concept, Moreno’s idea of a creativity-generating catharsis, was developed in connection with active participation in psychodrama and with actors’ training. By drawing on negative experiences and actively reliving them on stage, participants can develop the creativity needed to find new solutions. Third, Boal assumes that when an audience actively engages in the play by proposing solutions after an introductory scene has been pe...

Title: The Politics of Performance in Organizational Theatre-Based Training and Interventions
Author-Name: Nick Nissley
Author-Name: Steven S. Taylor
Author-Name: Linda Houden
Abstract: In this article, we first ‘set the stage’, taking our focus as theatre inorganizations, in contrast to the more traditional approach within the field of organizational studies of the use of ‘theatre’ as a metaphorical means of making sense of organizational life (organizations astheatre). More specifically, we examine the phenomenon of theatrebased training and interventions. However, we move beyond the practitioner-oriented ‘how-to’ understanding of theatre-based training, instead undertaking a more critical examination of the phenomenon. We analytically look ‘behind the curtain’, exposing the ‘politics of performance’ in theatre-based training and interventions by considering who controls the script and who controls the role in a performance. Lastly, we close with an ‘offer’ to the organization studies scholar — similar to the kind of ‘offer’ found in improvisational theatre. We offer a Boalian perspective of organizational theatre. We intentionally mean to be provocative by using Boal’s language (for e...

Title: Stripping to the Undercoat: A Review and Reflections on a Piece of                Organization Theatre
Author-Name: Timothy Clark
Author-Name: Iain Mangham
Abstract: In this article, we review one ‘tailor-made play’, one piece of organization theatre called Varnishing the Truth. We then reflect on the questions we asked of ourselves while watching this performance and reviewing the video of it: how does this activity relate to its claimed theoretical foundations (Boal’s forum theatre)? Is forum theatre an appropriate model for organization theatre? Can ‘things be made to move’ by an activity such as the one to which we were an audience? In the process of answering these questions, we emphasize the reductive adoption of radical techniques (that is, Boal’s forum theatre); the depoliticization of corporate theatre; and, the limitations of the theory of negotiated order as a model for learning, given the discursive construction of organizational roles.

Title: Peripheral Vision
Author-Name: Magoroh Maruyama
Abstract: There are several meta-level considerations which are seldom taken up but are crucial. Two of them are discussed in this article: polyocular vision, in which the differences between images obtained from many angles enable the brain to compute invisible mental coordinates; and illusion of understanding, in which a person is convinced that he or she has a perfect understanding while missing the most important points of others. Job rotation and quasi-rotation help cultivate polyocular vision. On the other hand, concept inbreeding in an organization poses a barrier to polyocular vision. Intellectual outbreeding is facilitated by establishing conceptual ‘free trade zones’ such as the Peripheral Vision section in this journal.

Title: Women and Wages Worldwide: How the National Proportion of Working Women Brings Underpayment into the Organization
Author-Name: Evert van de Vliert
Author-Name: Gerben S. van der Vegt
Abstract: Many employees are underpaid relative to their country’s level of wealth. In agreement with social identity theory principles extended to the national level, our 59-nation study uncovered that this form of wealth-referenced underpayment is associated with the proportion of working women. In countries with a relatively small or relatively large proportion of female workers, all workers are underpaid to the extent that merit pay and strikes are relatively rare. Payroll taxes, labour supply, unemployment rate, collective bargaining power, and the national wage gap could not disconfirm the results. We discuss how these country-level findings may innovate theory building on the impact of female worker proportion, merit pay, and strikes on payment in occupations, departments, and organizations.

Title: The Characteristics of Chinese Personal Ties (Guanxi): Evidence from Hong Kong
Author-Name: Irene Hau-Siu Chow
Author-Name: Ignace Ng
Abstract: A widely held view in management is that guanxi(or Chinese personal connections) are a key element in the success of East Asian economies. In spite of their importance, very little is known about the various characteristics of guanxi. Using data obtained from Hong Kong respondents, we found that classmates, club members, and family friends are guanxibases from which the respondents developed close relationships. Contrary to expectations, associates who work with the respondents or are distant family relatives, or both, tend to have distant relationships with the respondents. We also found that the effect of gender on the closeness of relationships is asymmetrical, with female-to-female dyads being close and male-to-male dyads being distant. Further, our study shows that there is a tendency to request ‘costly’ favors from family members instead of nonfamily members. Lastly, we provide some evidence linking the size of one’s network to one’s ‘face’ in society. Overall, the results suggest a weakening of the...

Title: Re-Applying Beliefs: An Analysis of Change in the Oil Industry
Author-Name: Ysanne Carlisle
Author-Name: Charles Baden-Fuller
Abstract: Beliefs and values are hard to alter; yet they strongly influence employees’ attitudes towards strategic changes. Using a longitudinal case study in the oil industry, we show how to distinguish between ideological beliefs (justified by ethical values) and mundane beliefs (substantiated by knowledge structures). We explain that the willingness of workers to participate in change was promoted by a dynamic interaction between these interdependent belief sets. More critically, we show that acceptance of change did not require a change in values, but rather a change in the way that values were applied. We develop propositions that move theory forward and point to future directions for research.

Title: Bringing Space Back in: Organizing the Generative Building
Author-Name: Martin Kornberger
Author-Name: Stewart R. Clegg
Abstract: In this article, we re.ect on architecture and management and organization theory, in terms of their mutual implications. We focus especially on a tacit implication in mainstream organization theory, which has an architectural genesis. In the past, management has been largely undergirded by a Cartesian rationality, one seen most clearly in the argument that structure follows strategy. Architecturally, this Cartesianism is present in the injunction that form follows function. Criticizing this point of view, we argue that organizations should be thought of as material, spatial ensembles — not just cognitive abstractions writ large. Linking space and organization in this way, we re.ect on the power that every spatial organization necessarily implies, both in negative and positive terms. After examining existing approaches to this issue, we discuss some positive power implications for management. We introduce the concept of the generative building that, instead of being a merely passive container for actions ...

Title: Privatization in Bosnia and the Craft of IOR Process Analysis
Author-Name: Eric Martin
Abstract: International efforts to help Bosnia and Herzegovina privatize its state-owned enterprises proved dif.cult, but the complex web of interorganizational relationships (IORs) among international donors, implementers, contractors, and local players, at times, seemed even more daunting to effective implementation of reforms than the technical dif.culties of the task itself. By employing a theoretical framework of IOR development over time, important stages in the evolution of the International Advisory Group on Privatization were identi.ed, and variables within each discussed. Analysis employed linear and nonlinear process logics to help explain what linked some variables withinand betweenthese various phases. Insights seemed valuable for practitioners seeking to implement interdependent tasks, organizational representatives trying to form relationships with others, and scholars trying to understand process theories of IOR formation. In addition, this research provides an introduction to the complexities of in...

Title: The Paradox of Managerial Downsizing
Author-Name: Craig R. Littler
Author-Name: Peter Innes
Abstract: Delayering and the flattening of organizational hierarchies was a widespread trend through the 1990s. Peters (1992) in the USA promoted .attening as an organizational strategy and Keuning and Opheij (1994) promoted the prescriptions in Europe. Despite these strategies and apparent structural changes, the number and ratio of managers appears to have grown. This paradox of managerial downsizing has not been adequately probed in the literature. The predominant explanation, that there has been a ‘myth of managerial downsizing’, is associated with Gordon (1996). However, this debate has been shaped by the US experience and data. There is a need to reassess the dynamics of the 1990s in relation to other economies. This article focuses on a semi-peripheral economy, that of Australia. A study of the population of firms over time is necessary in order to resolve the issues. The article utilizes a comprehensive range of data, including several national surveys and a longitudinal database of all larger private-secto...

Title: Work Intensification and Emotional Labour among UK University Lecturers: An                 Exploratory Study
Author-Name: Emmanuel Ogbonna

Abstract: Until the early 1980s relatively little research interest was devoted to the concept of emotional labour in organizational settings. Although it is now acknowledged that emotional labour is present at different hierarchical levels and among many occupational groups, no study has explored the issue of emotional labour in the context of work intensi.cation among professional groups. This article presents evidence derived from interviews with university lecturers to assess (1) the frequency and propensity of emotional labour and the extent to which emotional labour is increasingly becoming part of the work of university lecturers, (2) the extent to which such emotional labour is derived from the intensifying changes to the work environment of university lecturers, and (3) the positive and negative consequences of such emotional labour and work intensi.cation. The article .nds evidence of emotional labouring among university lecturers. It is argued that the increase in such emotional labouring is largely a re...

Title: Taking it from the Top: How CEOs Influence (and Fail to Influence) their Boards
Author-Name: Sally Maitlis
Abstract: This article examines how chief executive officers (CEOs) influence their boards in symphony orchestra governance. Traditional governance research has studied the impact of structural factors on the CEO-board relationship, but less attention has been paid to the ways in which influence in these relationships is enacted, and to the role of the CEO in particular. Drawing on two intensive, longitudinal case studies, this article investigates the behavioural dynamics of the CEO-board relationship, identifying four key processes that underpin successful CEO influence: exploiting key relationships, managing impressions, managing information, and protecting formal authority. It concludes with an examination of the interrelated and embedded nature of these processes, and considers the implications for theory and research in organizational governance.

Abstract: This article presents some evidence on an aspect of the design of a strategic control system, at the microlevel, within a single organization. The research we report used an ethnographic approach to provide an understanding of strategy formulation. Our aim is to contribute to an area of literature which is of increasing significance, but relatively underdeveloped in terms of the application of in-depth, field-research techniques. We take an intensive look at the manner in which performance measures are formulated, at the microlevel, within a single organization. The article presents, as an in-depth case analysis, the experience of a fisheries holding company in New Zealand. The article recounts the experiences of managers within the organization of the process of identification of such things as critical success factors and key performance indicators (KPIs) and, more broadly, the formulation of a strategic performance measurement system.

Title: Intra-cultural Variation and Job Autonomy in 42 Countries
Author-Name: Kevin Au
Author-Name: Mike W. L. Cheung
Abstract: Intra-cultural variation (ICV)—dispersion of individuals within a culture—is not often the focus of international management compared to the cultural mean. However, researchers in international management and multi-level modeling have acknowledged the theoretical uniqueness of ICV, and have pled for its use in theory building and empirical testing. Responding to such a call, this paper explains at the societal level the theoretical importance of ICV of job autonomy. It also demonstrates, using secondary data from 42 countries, that the ICV of job autonomy influences organizational and social outcomes beyond the cultural mean of job autonomy. Specifically, the cultural mean and ICV of job autonomy exert different effects on job satisfaction and life satisfaction. The effect of the cultural mean is positive and that of the ICV is negative. Moreover, the effect of the ICV is independent of and similar in magnitude to that of the cultural mean. Research implications for international management and multi-leve...

Title: From Freemasons to the Employee: Organization, History and Subjectivity
Author-Name: Tim Newton
Abstract: This paper uses historical studies as a means to explore the relation of organizations to subjectivity. The first part of the paper illustrates this relation through exploring the work of Elias, Kieser and Brewer. It focuses on the interrelation between 18th-century freemasonry, the emergence of complex financial credit networks and figurational shifts in power relation. The second part of the paper uses the prior analysis in order to engage with recent debate concerning history, organizations and subjectivity. First, the issue of whether we can ascribe continuity, closure and unity to subjectivity is examined. Second, the ‘default’ assumption of historical continuity is debated, drawing on studies by Baert, Jacques, Halttunen and Morgan. In contrasting between ‘traditional’ history and the alternative assumptions contained in post-structural and Foucauldian work, the paper argues for openness rather than rebuttal of particular positions. It suggests that subjectivity, such as that of employees, should be...

Title: Process Transformation: Limitations to Radical Organizational Change within                 Public Service Organizations

Abstract: This paper draws on a study of the implementation of business process reengineering (BPR) in a UK National Health Service (NHS) hospital to examine the challenge of effecting a transformatory shift to a new form of process organization in a large and complex public service organization. The paper’s theoretical and empirical interests go beyond BPR by bringing together literatures about organizational transformation, new organizational forms and the new public management (NPM) in a novel way. Data reveal important limits to intended organizational transformation and develop findings about sedimented rather than transformational change and the limitations of radical top-down change strategies in professionalized public service organizations. Within the domain of public service organizations, the paper also advances a new argument about why intended moves to post-NPM forms may remain contained in scope.

Title: Innovation and Organization: Value and Competition in Selection Systems
Author-Name: Nachoem M. Wijnberg
Abstract: New definitions are proposed for the concepts ‘innovation’ and ‘organization’ by looking at the concepts in terms of value and competition and using the framework of the selection system. Also, new definitions are proposed for ‘importance of an innovation’ and ‘stylistic innovation’. Some results can be directly derived from the definitions, such as that economic entities can exist that are organizations in the perception of the individual members and groups of competing actors in the perception of others. Together the new definitions provide a foundation for a better understanding of not just the concepts themselves but also of the relationships between the type and importance of innovations and the most likely characteristics of successful innovators.

Title: Discursive Psychology and the Boundaries of Sense
Author-Name: Rom Harré
Abstract: There are problems in applying the methodology of the natural sciences to problems in psychology. This has led to a rethinking of psychology as the study of discursive practices, including the semantics of working vocabularies and the rules governing orderly thought and action. This has an affinity with analytical philosophy. At the same time it suggests a reinterpretation of older psychological research. First-order experiments study psychological phenomena, but second-order experiments, now very common, study how people describe imaginary situations, and their reactions to them, so that it is essentially a study of discursive practices. Wittgenstein’s use of the word ‘grammar’ suggests a convenient term for clusters of working rules. Philosophers have identified similar clusters of propositions, as a priori but synthetic propositions, expressing principles of order imposed on raw material by human beings. Psychologists have identified contingent universals which have such an ordering function. The revel...

Author-Name: Arndt Sorge
Author-Name: Arjen van Witteloostuijn
Abstract: The global business world is infected by a virus that induces a permanent need for organizational change, which is fed by the management consultancy industry. The nature of the organizational change hype changes colour frequently, through the emergence of new universal management fashions. An urge to change is understandable from the perspectives of the consultant and the manager, but often organizational changes are ineffective or counter-productive when implemented. In this context, this article’s purpose is threefold. First, on the basis of an interpretation of different literatures, we .esh out an argument about the nonsense of organizational change that is driven by sick consultancy metaphors. Second, we argue that the application of healthy organization theories offers ample guidelines for organizational change initiatives that make more sense than prominent management consultancy rhetoric. Third, pulling both strings together, we plead for the development of an evidence-based (change) consultancy p...

Abstract: Years ago, I believed that rationality could manufacture understanding. I lived in physical and social environments that were real and I wanted to understand the social realities. I wanted to create a genuine ‘behavioral science’ based on mathematical models, computer simulation, and systematic experiments. Various experiences over the years have challenged these beliefs. I discovered that rationality can not only be a deceptive tool but a potentially dangerous one, and I learned a few techniques to help me challenge my rational thought. I discovered that research .ndings have very low reliabilities, that some .elds make no discernible progress over many decades, and that societal cultures strongly in.uence researchers’ judgments about what constitutes useful knowledge. I saw that much that passes for research is merely random noise dressed up in pretentious language. Rather than realities, the social systems I was studying proved to be arbitrary categories created by observers or social conventions. I be...

Title: Temporary Architectures of Learning: Knowledge Governance in Project Ecologies
Author-Name: Gernot Grabher
Abstract: This paper is motivated by the intention to contribute to a contextual understanding of projects. More specifically, the analysis starts from the assumption that essential processes of creating and sedimenting knowledge accrue at the interface between projects and the organizations, communities, and networks in and through which projects operate. By adopting such a contextual perspective, the chief aim of the present study is to unfold a conceptual framework for analyzing processes of project-based learning. This conceptual framework is built around the notion of the project ecology. By consecutively disentangling the constitutive layers of project ecologies — the core team, the firm, the epistemic community, and the personal networks — the basic organizational architecture of project ecologies is revealed.

Title: Postcards from the Edge: Local Communities, Global Programs and Boundary Objects
Author-Name: Jonathan Sapsed
Author-Name: Ammon Salter
Abstract: This paper considers the limitations of project management tools as boundary objects within dispersed or global programs of teamwork. The concept of boundary object is receiving growing attention in the management literature. These artefacts are argued to provide a basis for negotiation and knowledge exchange between differentiated communities of practice. The paper assesses these claims theoretically and empirically in the context of global projects. Theoretically it draws on the literatures on boundary objects, dispersed work and project management tools and organization. The paper then analyses a case study of a global program in a major computing corporation. The program spanned numerous geographical sites across the US, Europe and Japan as well as several functional communities of practice including production, services, sales, IT and company registry. The method involved interviews with 33 program managers at six sites and analysis of program management devices such as integrated timelines, online s...

Title: Embedding New Management Knowledge in Project-Based Organizations
Author-Name: Mike Bresnen
Author-Name: Anna Goussevskaia
Author-Name: Jacky Swan
Abstract: The embedding of new management knowledge in project-based organization is made particularly problematic due to the attenuated links that exist between organization-wide change initiatives and project management practice. To explore the complex processes involved in change in project-based organization, this paper draws upon a case study of change within the UK construction industry. Analysing the case study through the lens of structuration theory (Giddens 1984), the paper examines the complex, recursive relationship that links change in project management practice with the peculiarities of that context. The findings demonstrate that a number of features of project-based organization — namely, decentralization, short-term emphasis on project performance and distributed work practices — are critically important in understanding the shaping and embedding of new management practice.

Title: Peripety in an R&D Drama: Capturing a Turnaround in Project Dynamics
Author-Name: Mats Engwall
Author-Name: Gunnar Westling
Abstract: This article examines the process dynamics of a complex R&D project, which for a long period of time had suffered from little technical progress, then abruptly became highly structured and effective. The article examines the mechanisms behind this dramatic turnaround and discusses its implications for research and practice. Drawing on the dramaturgical concept of ‘peripety’ (‘moment of sudden change’), the article captures how the turnaround came about due to the emergence of the participants’ shared conceptualization of the project mission. The article provides insights into the process dynamics and sensemaking in complex R&D projects and demonstrates how time and evolution need to be included in the analysis of project management and temporary organizations.

Author-Name: Sue Newell
Abstract: This paper seeks to analyse the extent to which organizations can learn from projects by focusing on the relationship between projects and their organizational context. The paper highlights three dimensions of project-based learning: the practice-based nature of learning, project autonomy and knowledge integration. This analysis generates a number of propositions on the relationship between the learning generated within projects and its transfer to other parts of the organization. In particular, the paper highlights the ‘learning boundaries’ which emerge when learning within projects creates new divisions in practice. These propositions are explored through a comparative analysis of two case studies of construction projects. This analysis suggests that the learning boundaries which develop around projects reflect the nested nature of learning, whereby different levels of learning may substitute for each other. Learning outcomes in the cases can thus be analysed in terms of the interplay between organizati...

Title: Building Project Capabilities: From Exploratory to Exploitative Learning
Author-Name: Tim Brady
Author-Name: Andrew Davies
Abstract: This paper presents a model of project capability-building consisting of two interacting levels of learning. First, it describes the bottom-up, ‘project-led’ phases of learning that occur when a firm moves into a new technology/market base: an exploratory ‘vanguard project’ phase; a ‘project-to-project’ phase to capture lessons learned; and a ‘project-to-organization’ phase when an organization increases its capabilities to deliver many projects. Second, it addresses the ‘business-led’ learning (within which the project-led learning is embedded) that occurs when ‘top-down’ strategic decisions are taken to create and exploit the company-wide resources and capabilities required to perform increasingly predictable and routine project activities.

Author-Name: Eric Gedajlovic
Author-Name: Toru Yoshikawa
Author-Name: Motomi Hashimoto
Abstract: Using data spanning the 1996-98 fiscal years of 247 of Japan’s largest manufacturers, we empirically evaluate the extent to which a firm’s investment behaviour and financial performance are influenced by its ownership structure. To do so, we examine six distinct categories of Japanese shareholders: foreign investors, investment funds, pension funds, banks and insurance companies, affiliated companies and insiders. Our findings strongly indicate that the relationship between the equity stakes of a particular category of investor and a firm’s financial performance and investment behaviour is considerably more complex than is depicted in simple principal-agent representations. Such a result emphasizes the importance of making finely grained and contextually relevant distinctions when modelling and evaluating corporate governance relations.

Title: Organizational Buffering: Managing Boundaries and Cores
Author-Name: Monty L. Lynn
Abstract: Organizations generally are more innovative, relevant, and responsive when they are exposed to market influences, yet they must regulate or limit the impact of outside influences to operate efficiently. This dynamic organization-environment tension has inspired the creation of several models of organizational buffering which delineate the systematic exposure and insulation of organizations from environmental uncertainty. We review three buffering paradigms — core, minimalist, and dispersed — and attempt to synthesize a model which weaves these perspectives together. The key to understanding functional and dysfunctional buffering lies with the organization’s requisite variety and continuous or discontinuous environmental change.

Title: Walking the Talk? Gendered Rhetoric vs. Action in Small Firms
Author-Name: Jennifer E. Cliff
Author-Name: Nancy Langton
Author-Name: Howard E. Aldrich
Abstract: This study challenges the assumption that male and female business leaders establish gender-stereotypic organizational characteristics in their firms. Data collected from 229 businesses in Vancouver, Canada, indicate that an owner’s sex has no effect on the extent of a firm’s bureaucracy or the femininity of its employment relationships. These findings hold even in situations theoretically conducive to eliciting gender stereotypes. Rather than conforming primarily to the archetypically masculine model of organizing, both male and female owners manage their firms with a mix of masculine and feminine approaches. Subsequent analyses revealed, however, that business owners tend to talk as if they organize and manage their firms in different (and gender-stereotypic) ways, even though they do not do so in practice. This finding may help explain the persistent belief that a leader’s sex leaves an identifiable imprint on organizational characteristics.

Title: The Social Construction of Events: A Study of Institutional Change in the                 Photographic Field
Author-Name: Kamal A. Munir
Abstract: Institutional theorists have recently been moving towards a notion that non-isomorphic institutional change is precipitated by significant events or ‘jolts’. In this paper, we argue that in doing so theorists have tended to move away from the social constructivist roots of institutional theory towards an understanding which implies the emergence of new organizational forms or practices in response to functional imperatives. In this context, we examine the ongoing institutional change from photography to digital imaging. Our analysis suggests that attributing institutional change to a single event or ‘jolt’ leads to a flawed understanding of institutional change processes. We demonstrate that, rather than causing institutional change, events are a part of the change process, and only become significant as actors bring them to our notice and ‘theorize’ around them (Greenwood et al. 2002). This social construction process determines the scope, significance and relevance of events, leading to the development ...

Abstract: What do middle managers do? Based on a conceptualization of knowledge as the capacity to act in response to uncertain, complex and ambiguous environmental stimuli, we analyse the role of middle managers in Germany, Great Britain and Italy as holders of different types of knowledge in relation to national institutions such as the education system, the system of industrial relations and the career system. We identify the common role of middle managers in the three countries as the responsibility to both maintain a positive social environment and to handle exceptions and solve unexpected problems. German and Italian managers are directly involved in the solution of technical problems, while their British counterparts act as brokers of technical specialized competences. Italian firms differ from German ones in that the role of middle managers is less formalized.

Title: Legitimating Agencies in the Face of Selection: The Case of AACSB
Author-Name: Rodolphe Durand
Author-Name: Jean McGuire
Abstract: This article proposes that legitimating agencies such as accreditation organizations face selection pressures to both maintain their legitimacy among their constituents, but also to expand the domain of their activities. We argue that domain expansion raises three important research questions: first, the factors that lead legitimating agencies to expand their domain; second, the need to maintain legitimacy among existing constituents; and third, the establishment of legitimacy in the new domain. We use the domain expansion of the AACSB to develop propositions relevant to these three research issues. Quality concerns, process vs. content strategy, and institutional entrepreneurship are the main factors that impact the legitimation of legitimating agencies.

Title: The Scripting of Total Quality Management within its Organizational Biography
Author-Name: Frank Mueller
Author-Name: Chris Carter
Abstract: The last 20 years or so have seen a proliferation of managerialist innovations, including Total Quality Management. Many existing accounts, however, tend to view TQM either as a copy of an institutional template or lose themselves in the richness of ‘the case’. Our intention is to trace institutional influences at the organizational level. For this purpose, we put forward an organizational biography perspective. The main promise of an organizational biography perspective is its concern with scripts of typical activities occurring during the ‘biography’ of an organizational innovation. We argue that scripts such as ‘exhortation’, ‘mimetic learning’, ‘structuring’, ‘contesting’, ‘routinizing’ and ‘disbanding’ are useful concepts in order to understand the dynamics of a management innovation at organizational level. The scripts refer to different combinations of rhetoric and practice(s). There will be some form of temporal sequence, but it will not be a strict sequence: for example, exhortation in some parts...

Title: Vita Contemplativa: A Life in Part
Author-Name: Stewart R. Clegg
Abstract: Life, art and science are irremediably intertwined: how, where and with whom one shares the brief moments of existence necessarily affect what one thinks, how one writes, and what one will address. Being a scholar is a vocation, as Weber knew only too well, in which science, ethics and art blend; sometimes seamlessly, sometimes not. None who live an intellectual and public life are immune to the normal glosses of the sociology of knowledge and this paper provides glimpses, through a personal lens, of what such a gloss might see. It is a glimpse of a life still living and lived; an artist still at work, an agenda still being developed, frozen like a snapshot of an instant - and just as representative. Can a snapshot capture an essence? Sometimes. Whether this does is left to others to judge.

Title: ‘Inside the Moment of Managing’: Wittgenstein and the                 Everyday Dynamics of Our Expressive-Responsive Activities
Author-Name: John Shotter
Abstract: It is easy to ignore small, concrete, and idiosyncratic details as unimportant in our inquiries into management processes. Indeed, at the moment, we feel that if we are to improve them and to avoid mistakes, then we must still seek a better understanding of them in the same way that we seek a better understanding of all else in the world around us in the proposing of theories of the supposed ‘hidden’ causes responsible for the outcomes of the management process, and in seeking and discussing evidence in favor of (and against) such explanatory theories. In other words, we adopt the same mode of inquiry toward other people (and other living things) as toward inert, physical objects. Wittgenstein’s philosophy, however, is oriented toward showing us that if we fail to distinguish between the relations we can have with living beings as compared to those with dead things, then we can mislead ourselves in ways that can have disastrous consequences for us. With respect to the process of managing, instead of achie...

Title: Organizational Commitment and Person-Environment Fit in Six Western Countries
Author-Name: Carl Hult
Abstract: The connection between work environment and organizational commitment (OC) is investigated and compared across six western countries, using data from the 1997 International Social Survey Program (ISSP). Differences in work environment are examined on two levels: (1) with reference to theoretical literature and empirical findings in comparative research and (2) with reference to how individuals perceive their workplace situation in relation to their personal evaluations of different workplace features (person-environment fit). Although no connection between work environment and OC is found when countries are compared on the basis of literature on the differences in the organization of production, the connection proves to be salient with respect to individual and group levels. The result suggests that the most important factor for OC in all countries is a job that the individual finds interesting. A control for job satisfaction makes it clear that the effect of finding the work interesting is independent of...

Title: Organizational Learning via Expatriate Managers: Collective Myopia as                 Blocking Mechanism
Author-Name: May M. L. Wong
Abstract: Qualitative case studies of two Japanese multinational department stores in Hong Kong are used to illustrate possible blocking mechanisms and collective myopia that hinder Japanese expatriate managers in acquiring double-loop organizational learning in their international assignments. Four major blocking mechanisms were identified — parent company community spirit, dozoku inhabitants, parent company’s translators and desire for normality. These blocking mechanisms were related to the Japanese head office’s culture, ideology and desire to control. They inhibited the expatriates from challenging established practices, procedures and norms, prevented them from becoming knowledgeable human agents, and hindered them from forming reflexivity. The expatriates, as a result, failed to learn from their international assignments. A conceptual model for expatriate learning and blocking mechanisms is drawn from the case examples, and implications for improving expatriate management to strengthen organizational learnin...

Title: Changes in Academic Work and the Chair Regime: The Case of German Business                 Administration Academics
Author-Name: Michael Muller-Camen
Author-Name: Stefan Salzgeber
Abstract: Today universities around the world are becoming subject to audits and evaluations that not only open them to outside scrutiny, but also force them to compete with each other for students, staff and funding. This development is supposed to lead to radical changes to academic work in business schools. Whereas there is an intensive debate about this issue in the UK, much less is known about changes in higher education in other European countries. This paper will show through the example of German business administration academics that similar pressures might not lead to similar outcomes. In the German system, hierarchy will remain more important than the market for academic work. Although role conflicts seem to increase for academics at all hierarchical levels, the traditional regime is likely to resist any far-reaching changes.

Title: The Recomposition of an Organizational Field: Health Care in Alberta
Author-Name: Trish Reay
Author-Name: C. R. (Bob) Hinings
Abstract: In this paper we develop a theoretical model that helps to understand change in mature organizational fields by emphasizing the role of competing institutional logics as part of a radical change process. Our investigation into a large-scale, government-led health reform initiative in Alberta, Canada, is based upon a qualitative case study approach to understanding the process of field recomposition. This study focuses on the later portions of change in an organizational field — that is, rather than explaining the sources of change, we investigate how a field becomes re-established after the implementation of a radical structural change.

Title: Institutional Entrepreneurship, Partaking, and Convening
Author-Name: Silvia Dorado
Abstract: This paper proposes that processes of institutional change vary depending on the form taken by the three factors that define them: agency, resource mobilization, and opportunity. The paper builds on a conceptualization of agency that considers that change may result from diverse forms of agency (i.e. strategic, routine, and sense-making). It develops the concept of resource mobilization, focusing on the process as opposed to the skills required for mobilization. It then suggests that the mobilization of resources, support and acceptance, accompanying the diffusion and legitimation of institutional changes may follow leverage, partaking, or convening processes. Finally, the paper defines institutional opportunity as an objective condition of organizational fields, suggesting that fields may be opportunity opaque, transparent, or hazy. Opportunities, of course, only become real when perceived by actors. Building on current sociological work, the paper suggests that actors’ perception of the opportunity tran...

Title: Learning and Knowledge Transfer in Strategic Alliances: A Social Exchange View
Author-Name: Senthil K. Muthusamy
Author-Name: Margaret A. White
Abstract: Although social interactions and exchanges between partners are emphasized as imperative for alliance success, comprehensive examination of how social exchanges facilitate learning and knowledge transfer in strategic alliances is lacking. Drawing on social exchange theory, we examined the effects of social exchange processes between alliance partners on the extent of learning and knowledge transfer in a strategic alliance. An empirical examination of data collected from alliance managers of 144 strategic alliances revealed that social exchanges such as reciprocal commitment, trust, and mutual influence between partners are positively related to learning and knowledge transfer in strategic alliances.

Title: Perceived External Prestige, Affective Commitment, and Citizenship Behaviors
Author-Name: Abraham Carmeli
Abstract: In a study that involved social workers in the Israeli health care system, two forms of perceived external prestige (social and economic) were identified. The results indicate that both forms of perceived external prestige augment employees’ affective commitment to their organization. Compared to perceived external economic prestige, however, perceived external social prestige seems to have a larger effect on affective commitment. In addition, employees’ affective commitment to their organization appeared to mediate the relationship between perceived external social prestige and citizenship behavior. It appears, however, that affective commitment augments altruistic behavior to a larger degree than that of compliance behavior.

Title: Peripheral Vision
Author-Name: Theodore R. Schatzki
Abstract: This essay introduces a new form of social ontology and sketches its bearings on the analysis of organizations. The essay begins by contrasting the two social ontological camps — individualism and societism — into which social theory has been divided since its inception. It then describes the new approach, called site ontology, according to which social life is tied to a context (site) of which it is inherently a part. Examples of such ontologies are presented, as is my own thesis that the site of social life is composed of a nexus of human practices and material arrangements. The bearing of the latter ontology on the character, origin, and perpetuation of organizations is then considered, using an academic department as an example. Contrasts are also drawn with various approaches in organizations theory, including rational organizations, neoinstitutionalism, systems theories, and selection theories. A final section considers the complex psychological structure of organizations, working off Karl Weick and...

Title: A Neo-Weberian Theory of the Firm
Author-Name: Pursey Heugens
Abstract: The field of organization studies harbors two types of theory of the firm: ‘why’ and ‘how’ theories. The former seeks to explain why firms exist despite the availability of institutional alternatives, whereas the latter explores how firms meaningfully connect the actions of many interdependently operating individuals to collective outcomes. Since the two approaches are complements rather than substitutes, the field would benefit from the development of a parsimonious theory that integrates ‘why’ and ‘how’ perspectives. It is argued that Max Weber’s writings on bureaucracy, and especially his focus on the organization as a collective actor governed by rational-legal decision rules, provide a meaningful conceptual background structure for such a theory. Specifically, through a rational reconstruction of certain elements of the Weberian legacy, a neo-Weberian theory of the firm is constructed here that simultaneously provides reasons for the existence of the firm and explores the nature of cooperation within...

Title: From Iron Cage to Pigeon House: The Birth of Reflexive Authority
Author-Name: Marcel Hoogenboom
Author-Name: Ringo Ossewaarde
Abstract: In recent years, Weber’s image of the ‘iron cage’ has been challenged by the sociologists Ulrich Beck and Anthony Giddens. They claim that this image no longer applies to the late modern world we are entering. In the late modern era, individuals, institutions and organizations have become or will become reflexive, and as a consequence the iron cage of rationalization is opening. In this article, the authors largely subscribe to the theories of Beck and Giddens though formulate two objections. First, they demonstrate that the theories each illuminate only one level of social life in late modernity and should be combined. Second, they claim that in the theories of Beck and Giddens a search for a possible integrating phenomenon is largely missing. By combining the theories they disentangle a new form of integration, which may emerge in late modernity. This new form of integration they dub ‘reflexive authority’.

Title: The Persistence of Bureaucracy: A Meta-analysis of Weber’s Model of                 Bureaucratic Control
Author-Name: Eric J. Walton
Abstract: The model of bureaucratic control is an enduring part of modern organizational theory. This study draws on almost four decades of empirical research in assessing the general validity of the model. Meta-analytical techniques are used for estimating the general relationships among key aspects of bureaucratic control, removing the effects of statistical artefacts and exploring the relative persistence of the model. The results provide substantial support for the model of bureaucratic control. The average correlation among the structural variables is .54. Overall, the paper concludes that there are reasons to see the bureaucratic model of control as generalizable and of continuing relevance to discussions of organizational structures.

Author-Name: Michael Lounsbury
Author-Name: Edward J. Carberry
Abstract: While the work of Max Weber was an omnipresent guiding force in the early development of organizational theory, contemporary scholars have seemingly little connection to that heritage. In this paper, we probe the dynamics of Weberian organizational theory scholarship from mid-century to the present and examine how shifts in research orientation have facilitated Weber’s apparent fall from grace. We draw on a dataset of all articles published in the Administrative Science Quarterly from 1956 to 2002 to track shifts in Weber citation patterns and three streams of Weberian-inspired organizational research: intraorganizational, social organization and organization-environment relations. We show how the shift from the early bureaucracy and social organization studies of the 1950s and 1960s to the more instrumental, resource focus of the organization-environment tradition in the 1970s and 1980s went hand-in-hand with the marginalization of Weber in organizational theory. We also show that Weber has increasingly ...

Abstract: Institutionalists have emphasized the importance of law for the spread of bureaucracy and examined its effects; but they have not examined the evolution of law as an institution in its own right, particularly from a Weberian standpoint. In this paper, we investigate whether or not there is an inexorable proliferation and refinement of rational legal rules within a law, as we have found to be the case with bureaucratic rules. In other words, are the same tendencies toward proliferation and refinement associated with the ‘closing of the iron cage’ found in the context of legal rules? An examination of all sections of a regional water law over a 90-year period shows that the number of law sections and the text covered by the sections actually declines over time, through alternating phases of gradual expansion followed by rapid collapse; that is via punctuated equilibrium. Most of the expansion is due to revisions of existing sections, rather than to births of new sections. Poisson models of births and event ...

Title: Puritans, Visionaries and Survivors
Author-Name: Stewart R. Clegg
Abstract: All readings take place in the here-and-now, even of texts written back there and then. Nowhere in management and organization theory has this been truer of anyone than Max Weber. Unread in English during his lifetime, it was nearly 30 years after his death before his ideas had much impact. When they did, they were read in a context and tradition years away from those in which they were conceived. And, ever since, they have been subject to systematic reinterpretation on the one hand and neglect on the other. The paper addresses how one might use Weber today, in terms of his sensitivity to current issues, such as sustainability, as well as the still largely unacknowledged foundation that Weber constructed for contemporary cultural studies. The paper will bring these two themes together, using analysis of contemporary equivalents to the popular culture that formed the basis for some of Weber’s own investigations.

Abstract: This study defines the construct of team atmosphere and provides a framework within which causes and consequences of team atmosphere in knowledge transfer and creation can be empirically investigated. Data were collected using a survey of 363 individuals of 12 companies who worked in self-managed teams. As predicted, results indicated that a ‘high care’ atmosphere among team members favours both the transfer and the creation of knowledge. Findings also showed that certain management initiatives foster this type of atmosphere. The study concludes with some recommendations for future research in this area.

Author-Name: Robyn Thomas
Author-Name: Annette Davies
Abstract: This article presents theoretical and empirical analysis of the micro-politics of resistance. We theorize resistance at the level of meanings and subjectivities, drawing attention to the multidirectional and generative effects in identity construction. We address two shortcomings present in much of the theorizing of resistance, namely, the conceptualizing of resistance as a set of actions and behaviours, and the narrow conception of resistance as a reaction to repressive power. Focusing on the UK public services, we draw from texts generated within interviews with public service professionals in the police, social services and secondary education to explore the meanings individuals ascribe to the discourse of New Public Management (NPM) and their positioning within these meanings. The analysis contributes to the study of organizations in three respects. First, it offers a more detailed and varied understanding of resistance that can account for different motivations and ways in which individuals struggle ...

Title: Sales Work under Marketization: The Social Relations of the Cash Nexus?
Author-Name: Marek Korczynski
Author-Name: Ursula Ott
Abstract: In lightly regulated economies many jobs are becoming subject to a process of ‘marketization’ involving an externalization of the employment relationship in the context of intensified product market competition. At the same time, a number of front-line jobs are becoming redefined to encompass more proactive sales aims. This study examines two sites at an intersection of these trends — sites where financial service jobs have been marketized and redefined to revolve around proactive sales activity. It examines the key social relations of the sales workers — relations with managers, immediate colleagues, back-office staff, customers and referrers — in considering how far marketization leads to the social relations of the cash nexus along bare market principles. It is found that one group of workers is enmeshed in a dehumanized, instrumental and antagonistic set of relations, while another, smaller, group of workers is insulated against such relations by the functioning of tight trust-based referral networks....

Abstract: This article documents aspects of my life as a contributor to what has become known as the dramaturgical perspective on social and organizational life. Beginning nearly 40 years ago, when I was a graduate student, it traces my growing enthusiasm for the ideas of symbolic interactionists such as George Herbert Mead, and in particular for those — like Erving Goffman and Kenneth Burke — who held that theatre was a master metaphor for understanding and describing our everyday activity as citizens and employees. The article reflects the use I and others made of these ideas as teachers, researchers, writers and consultants during the latter part of the 20th century during which time the notion of management as performance struggled to articulate itself as an important aspect of an ars poetica of organizational practice.

Abstract: In this paper we describe a five-stage phenomenological model of skill acquisition, of which expertise is the highest stage. Contrary to the claims of knowledge engineers, we argue that expertise in general, and medical expertise in particular, cannot be captured in rule-based expert systems, since expertise is based on the making of immediate, unreflective situational responses; intuitive judgment is the hallmark of expertise. Deliberation is certainly used by experts, if time permits, but it is done for the purpose of improving intuition, not replacing it. The best way to avoid mistakes is to take responsibility for them when they occur, rather than try to prevent them by foolproof rules. In bureaucratic societies, however, there is the danger that expertise may be diminished through over-reliance on calculative rationality.

Title: Essai
Author-Name: Peter Pelzer
Abstract: This paper explores the connection between management and organization and a notion that is generally ignored in literature but that we nevertheless quite often experience as normal in our daily lives in organizations: contempt. Personal experience provides a suitable starting point. An incident in a bank involves a situation where the behaviour of a manager, new to the position, was interpreted by the employees present, in a period of reorganization, as contempt. Contempt is an emotion that is usually denied in organizations, and, if not, is always condemned. A good manager is not allowed to be contemptuous; at least he or she shouldn’t show it. But contempt is a feeling that almost no one can deny having felt at some time. It seems to be ubiquitous. Along these lines, it will be asked if the incident described is a singular perception of misbehaviour or if it hints at a more general phenomenon.

Author-Name: Irene Goll
Author-Name: Abdul A. Rasheed
Abstract: This study examines the relationships between top management demographics, rational decision making (RDM), munificence, and firm performance. We expect top management demographics to influence rational decision making, and rational decision making to influence firm performance. In addition, we hypothesize a moderating effect of environmental munificence on the rational decision making-firm performance relationship. To test these hypotheses, we conducted a survey that measured RDM. Top management demographic characteristics, environmental munificence, and firm performance were collected from archival sources. We examined the relationships between RDM and top management age, tenure, and education level, using regression analyses. The results of this study provide support for the assertion that top management demographic characteristics influence decision making, and for the role of environmental munificence as a moderator in the relationship between decision making and organizational performance.

Title: Sounds of Silence: Graduate Trainees, Hegemony and Resistance
Author-Name: Andrew D. Brown
Author-Name: Christine Coupland
Abstract: This paper analyses how graduate trainees in one UK-based private sector retail organization talked about being silenced. The paper illustrates how the trainees’ constructions formed a set of discursive practices that were implicated in the constitution of the organization as a regime of power, and how they both accommodated and resisted these practices. Our case focuses on the trainees’ discursive construction of normative pressures to conform, compliant and non-compliant types of worker, and explicit acts of silencing, together with their reflexive interrogation of the nexus of discursive constraints on their opportunities to be heard. Drawing on the analytical resources associated with the ‘linguistic turn’ in organization studies, our research is an exploration of the importance of language as a medium of social control and power, and means of self-authorship. It is also an attempt to locate ‘silence’ in putatively polyphonic organizations.

Abstract: I summarize my view of organization theory and then explain how it developed over my life. I stress that it arose gradually from a series of empirical tests, so that my views are based on good reasons, despite being in some ways unconventional. Early influences upon me include the non-conformist climate of my school days and the empirical ethos at the University of Aston. I have long been interested in the creation of social science. This has been informed by the philosophy of science, which emphasizes the centrality of theory and its empirical testing. My early work in the Aston programme laid the basis for commitment to functionalism and generalization. The vociferous rejection of this style of research by ideologically oriented critics led me to defend it, both theoretically and philosophically. My later work on strategy and structure led me to reject strategic choice and embrace situational determinism. I analysed these and other research topics as being within structural contingency theory. I also us...

Title: The Diffusion of Medical Innovations: Can Figurational Sociology Contribute?
Author-Name: Sue Dopson
Abstract: This article seeks to present and explore the relevance of a figurational, or process sociological approach, as developed by Norbert Elias, to the investigation of innovation and change. It is argued that Elias’s work offers a theoretically robust framework for exploring such issues. Applications of the principles of his work, in particular the emphasis on an understanding of longer-term unplanned processes, are a potential help to those charged with planning and managing complex change, such as the introduction of innovation. The example of health policy-makers’ attempts to use the principles of evidence-based medicine (EBM) to change clinical practice is used to explore these claims.

Title: Trust, Contract and Relationship Development
Author-Name: Rosalinde Klein Woolthuis

Author-Name: Bart Nooteboom
Abstract: This article contributes to the debate on the relation between trust and control in the management of inter-organizational relations. More specifically, we focus on the question how trust and formal contract are related. While there have been studies on whether trust and contract are substitutes or complements, they offer little insight into the dynamic interaction between the two. They fail to answer, first, whether contract precedes trust or follows it, in other words, what causal relationship exists between the concepts; second, how and why trust and contract can substitute or complement each other; and third, how the various combinations of trust and contract affect a relationship’s development and outcome. In search of answers, we conducted longitudinal case studies to reveal the relationship between trust, contract and relationship outcome in complex inter-firm relationships. We find trust and contract to be both complements and substitutes and find that a close study of a contract’s content offers ...

Title: Professional Competition, Economic Value Added and Management Control Strategies
Author-Name: Mahmoud Ezzamel
Author-Name: John Burns
Abstract: This paper examines a failed change initiative (the implementation of economic value added, EVA™) in an in-depth case study of a major UK retailer (RetailCo, a pseudonym). The paper locates this change initiative within inter-professional competition between on the one hand the finance managers and on the other hand the buyers and merchandisers in RetailCo. Finance managers sought to strengthen their professional jurisdiction and enhance their financial and symbolic rewards by imposing stricter controls over buyers and merchandisers, which the latter resented as an undesirable intervention into their work practices and mobilized their influence and work knowledge to ensure the abandonment of EVA. This boundary work involved the use of a multiplicity of entry points centred on control strategies and the fundamentals of retailing. Implications for professional competition and organizational change are considered.

Author-Name: Nikolaus Beck
Author-Name: Peter Walgenbach
Abstract: In this paper we examine technical and internal organizational contingencies which encourage and discourage the adoption of institutionalized structural elements, namely ISO 9000 standards. The results show that the extent of customized production and a dominant influence of top management on quality control decisions reduce the likelihood of adopting ISO 9000 standards. However, the latter factor changes its influence significantly with greater organizational size and administrative intensity — two entities which increase the pressure to adapt to external expectations.

Title: Overcoming Resistance to Surveillance: A Genealogy of the EAP Discourse
Author-Name: Richard M. Weiss
Abstract: Through an examination of employee assistance programs we address Foucault’s contention that the pervasive surveillance characteristic of disciplinary control is facilitated by a discourse claiming therapeutic rather than punitive aims. By characterizing poor job performance as evidence of substance abuse or other ‘behavioral-medical’ illness, the EAP discourse endeavors to overcome the reluctance of supervisors to identify poor performers, for whom job loss is the frequent consequence of failure to improve. Following Foucault’s view that power effects occur without express intention to exercise power, we analyze the web of institutional and professional disciplinary mechanisms that effect heightened supervisory surveillance.

Abstract: We reason that agency theory’s behavioral assumptions may too closely reflect the US institutional context to explain the governance heritages that exist elsewhere. We propose that what constitutes opportunistic behavior and what can be done to limit it may vary due to differences in national background and formal institutions. We then test the validity of this nationally bounded model using historical sociology analysis of three nations whose corporate governance heritages are believed to differ (USA, Sweden, and France). Specifically, we review their political, cultural, and economic institutions to explore the different ways that their governance practices have evolved and infer causes for these historical variations.

Title: Decision-Making in High-Velocity Environments: The Importance of Guiding Principles
Author-Name: David Oliver
Author-Name: Johan Roos
Abstract: This paper presents a field study of decision-making processes at two organizations operating in high-velocity environments. It reviews existing literature on managerial knowledge structures and decision-making, and identifies methodological and conceptual limitations with these approaches with respect to organizations in high-velocity environments. The authors develop two interpretive cases that focus on the articulated and social methods management teams used to make decisions. They found that both organizations used rules of thumb or heuristic reasoning in their decisionmaking, that these rules of thumb functioned as headlines of deeper organizational narratives, and that these narratives were grounded in emotional as well as purely rational considerations. They suggest that the term ‘guiding principle’ usefully integrates their three findings into a second-order concept that may be further explored in future research of both a descriptive and prescriptive nature.

Title: Recasting the Home-Work Relationship: A Case of Mutual Adjustment?
Author-Name: Susanne Tietze
Author-Name: Gill Musson
Abstract: Advances in communication and information technologies, changing managerial strategies and changing cultural expectations about the location of (paid) work, have meant that paid work is increasingly conducted from home. Home then becomes the place where the discourse of industrial production meets with the discourse of household production. We analyse the relationship between these two traditionally separate discourses, which, through the disintegration of the time/space compression, increasingly come to bear on each other. We report on the experiences of home-workers and their families coping with the co-presence of the sometimes conflicting and sometimes competing demands and values embedded in such discourses. In doing so, we contribute to current understandings of the complexities inherent in emergent forms of organization, as the relationship between work and home is recast. Theoretically and methodologically, this empirical study is located within a discursive framework, and we emphasize the usefuln...

Author-Name: Joseph Ofori-Dankwa
Author-Name: Scott D. Julian
Abstract: The process by which theories form into schools of thought has been the focus of much scholarly attention, but the current model of McKinley et al. (1999) focuses primarily on theory content attributes. In this paper, we introduce theory context attributes that also influence the school formation process. Specifically, we suggest that factors such as the quality of the publication outlet, the reputation of the theory originator and the reputation of the theory originator’s university will all influence the likelihood of a theory being detected and assimilated and, consequently, evolving into a school of thought. We further highlight the effects of different combinations of theory and context attributes on the probability of a theory developing into a theory school. We suggest that theories with high content and high context attributes are more likely to evolve into a school of thought than theories with low content or low context attributes. Finally, we discuss future research implications.

Title: Challenges in Conducting Empirical Work Using Structuration Theory: Learning                 from IT Research
Author-Name: Marlei Pozzebon
Author-Name: Alain Pinsonneault
Abstract: Giddens’s structuration theory is increasingly used as an alternative approach to studying numerous organizational phenomena. However, the applicability of Giddens’s concepts is not without difficulties because of two main challenges. First, structuration theory is complex, involving concepts and general propositions that operate at a high level of abstraction. Second, structuration theory is not easily coupled to any specific research method or methodological approach, and it is difficult to apply empirically. Arguing that structuration theory is a valuable framework for a rich understanding of management, organization and related subjects of inquiry, this paper aims to improve the application of structuration theory in empirical work by drawing on the experience in information technology (IT) research. It identifies patterns of use of Giddens’s theory in publications in the domain of IT, and then describes how IT researchers have attempted to address its major empirical challenges. The paper presents a ...

Title: From Intended Strategies to Unintended Outcomes: The Impact of Change                 Recipient Sensemaking
Author-Name: Julia Balogun
Author-Name: Gerry Johnson
Abstract: The tendency for intended strategies to lead to unintended consequences is well documented. This longitudinal, real-time analysis of planned change implementation provides an explanation for this phenomenon. We focus on the social processes of interaction between middle managers as change recipients as they try to make sense of the change interventions. We show the extent to which lateral, informal processes of inter-recipient sensemaking contribute to both intended and unintended change outcomes, and therefore the unpredictable, emergent nature of strategic change. The findings raise the issue of the extent to which it is possible to manage evolving recipient interpretations during change implementation.

Title: You Bastard: A Narrative Exploration of the Experience of Indignation within Organizations
Author-Name: David Sims
Abstract: Our patience with forming interpretations and reinterpretations of others' behaviour is not unlimited. The time comes when we lose interest in trying to understand, and conclude that another person is behaving in a way that is simply unacceptable. This paper explores the narratives that go with immoderate indignation, even for those best versed in the idea that they should attempt to understand the perspective of the other. The paper offers a reflexive comment on the difficulty of analysing such a topic, on the grounds that the phenomenon under discussion can debilitate analytic writing. Three narratives are discussed in which one person was seen as behaving in a despicable way by others. The description and analysis of the narratives are used to offer a narrative understanding of the process by which some people become indignant with others. It suggests a narrative construction of how sense is made of indignation, particularly in cases where two narratives come up against each other. It concludes by cons...

Title: Exploring Resistance from a Rhetorical Perspective
Author-Name: Gillian Symon
Abstract: Contemporary accounts of resistance at work have emphasized processes of identity construction and regulation (e.g. Alvesson and Willmott 2002). Case study examinations (e.g. Knights and McCabe 2000; Ezzamel et al. 2001) have been recently extended by detailed studies of the operation of discourse at the level of talk (e.g. Dick and Cassell 2002). This paper adds to these recent accounts by providing an analysis of arguments for and against a technological change project in a UK public sector organization. The objective is to demonstrate how such arguments are constructed to achieve particular interpretations of reality while resisting others (i.e. the use of persuasive rhetoric). In the examples analysed here, rhetorical strategies included: producing a range of identities for 'the resistant', IT support staff and others; disputing the 'realness' of people, things and processes (e.g. information, participation); producing and negotiating various boundaries (e.g. we/other, production worker/support staff)...

Title: Circuits of Power in Practice: Strategic Ambiguity as Delegation of Authority
Author-Name: Sally Davenport
Author-Name: Shirley Leitch
Abstract: Most power relationships between organizations and stakeholders are episodic circuits of power whereby resource dependence is exacerbated by prohibitive rules. Such relationships are usually constraining rather than empowering and generate resistance and reluctant compliance rather than co-operation and creativity. Clegg's (1989) concept of facilitative circuits of power, however, suggests that some power relationships, particular where high amounts of discretion are delegated, can result in innovation by stakeholders. Public sector agencies have multiple and diverse external stakeholder groups that they need to influence in order to implement their strategies. In this paper, we explore a facilitative circuit of power using a case study of a public sector research funding organization that employed strategic ambiguity to delegate considerable authority to stakeholders, stimulating a variety of creative responses during a period of major system restructuring. Risks associated with such a practice include t...

Title: The Story of Work: A Narrative Analysis of Workplace Emotion
Author-Name: Connie J. Boudens
Abstract: This paper argues that work-related emotion is best accessed using indirect means, including figures of speech and narrative. An analysis of 452 narratives drawn from previously published works is presented to the end of addressing two research questions: Where is the emotion in work? and What is the emotion in work? In response to the first question, a series of prototypical work situations are isolated, all of which are heavily charged with emotion. In response to the second question, clusters of emotion associated with each prototypical situation are identified. An image of the vital dynamics of organizational life is presented based on these results, and it is argued that narrative analysis is a useful and accessible means of examining the experience of emotion in organizations.

Abstract: Influence activity is a central aspect of organizations and has attracted a wide range of theoretical and empirical research. Most studies in this field rely on categorization schemes to classify either actors or acts. This article draws on the notion of organizations and actors as socially constructed phenomena and understands influence activities as social practices whose shape and meaning is derived from the social contexts they are embedded in. In this paper, we argue that it is necessary to gain an understanding of the activities’ diverging meanings in their organizational contexts before generalized typologies of tactics and strategies can be fruitfully applied. By drawing on ‘objective hermeneutics’ as methodology, our analyses focus on influence activities within three organizational contexts.

Title: Idealistic and Pragmatic Versions of the Discourse of Partnership
Author-Name: Frances Tomlinson
Abstract: Although the term ‘partnership’ is increasingly widely applied to a range of inter-organizational engagements within diverse international settings, its meaning is very unclear. This paper analyses how actors involved in implementing partnership working constructed its meaning. It draws on a case study from within the refugee resettlement field to reveal two contrasting versions of the discourse of partnership: a more ‘idealistic’ version of partnership as a ‘good thing’, and a more ‘pragmatic’ version that represented partnership largely in terms of the instrumentality of stakeholders. The tensions between trust and power within inter-organizational relationships are reflected in the uneasy relationship between these versions, and the effects of this tension on the enactment of partnership in the case study project are discussed. The paper considers the implications of these findings for researching and implementing partnership working more widely.

Title: The Othello Conundrum: The Inner Contagion of Leadership
Author-Name: Mark Stein
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to contribute to the literature on leadership, emotions and organizations by examining Shakespeare’s Othello. While much of the existing literature focuses exclusively on the external dimensions of leadership, this paper adds a new dimension by focusing as well on the internal workings of the mind of the leader, here that of Othello. This focus is made possible by postulating that the subordinate Iago — whose relationship to Othello is central to the plot — represents an inner character within Othello’s mind, as well as an external character. As an inner character, Iago fills Othello’s mind with powerful feelings of jealousy and envy, especially about an alleged relationship between Othello’s wife and his lieutenant, Cassio. Othello’s conundrum thus concerns whether he should tolerate these feelings and live with his uncertainty about his wife’s purported infidelity, or, alternatively, try to rid himself of these feelings by killing her and Cassio. Concepts from psychoanalysis...

Title: Unpacking Regional Ethnicity and the Strength of Ties in Shaping Ethnic Entrepreneurship
Author-Name: Lai Si Tsui-Auch
Abstract: This study is based on an interpretive content analysis of oral history data and documentary data on ethnic Indian and Chinese entrepreneurs in Singapore and their enterprises. This data is complemented by personal interviews with family members, informants and business community leaders, as well as historical analysis. The data reveals that most ethnic Indian entrepreneurs maintained their trade specializations and family management, whereas most ethnic Chinese entrepreneurs pursued unrelated diversification and incorporated outsiders into their operational management over time. What is particularly intriguing is the existence of an intra-ethnic division in business structure among the ethnic Indian enterprises. I argue that the opportunity structure in the country of residence and ethnic resources play only a limited role in shaping the differential management and business structures of the two ethnic groups. Rather, I attribute such differences primarily to the differential strength of ties of the entr...

Abstract: The proliferation of transnational institutions in the form of protocols, conventions, regimes and standards is a growing influence on organizational practice. Recent work on the origins and impact of transnational institutions focuses upon processes in ‘core’ states, but their influence in developing countries has not received much attention. In this paper we narrate a case study of the diffusion of two institutional regimes represented by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and the International Air Transport Association (IATA) in Iranian civil aviation. The case study describes a seemingly frictionless and uncontested embedding of the emergent international aviation regime in post-World War II Iran and a severe challenge to those institutions in the years following Iran's Islamic revolution. We characterize the rise and decline of these regimes as a double process of institutionalization and de-institutionalization, and identify political and technical factors that drive institutional ...

Title: Managing Co-operation: Trust and Power in Ghanaian Associations
Author-Name: Fergus Lyon
Abstract: Through a rich empirical study of forms of collective action in Ghana, this paper examines how groups sustain co-operation in the absence of strong legal institutions and mechanisms (such as legal contracts or regulated loan finance) that are often taken for granted in most ‘western’ economies. It presents evidence from case studies of micro-saving groups, palm oil processing groups and transport associations, which indicate that co-operation is based on trust and power, both of which are based on culturally specific norms. Decisions to co-operate are shaped by a combination of conscious calculations, habitual actions and unquestioning compliance or obedience. The way that trust and power are articulated also varies according to local context, and attempts to facilitate and support co-operative activities have to build on the existing co-operative structures that are embedded in the local, culturally specific, social relations.

Abstract: How to address empirically the calculative character of markets without dissolving it? In our paper, we propose a theoretical framework that helps to deal with markets without suspending their calculative properties. In the first section, we construct a broad definition of calculation, grounded on the anthropology of science and techniques. In the next sections, we apply this definition to three constitutive elements of markets: economic goods, economic agents and economic exchanges. First, we examine the question of the calculability of goods: in order to be calculated, goods must be calculable. In the following section, we introduce the notion of calculative distributed agencies to understand how these calculable goods are actually calculated. Thirdly, we consider the rules and material devices that organize the encounter between (and aggregation of) individual supplies and demands, i.e. the specific organizations that allow for a calculated exchange and a market output. Those three elements define conc...

Author-Name: Kamal A. Munir
Author-Name: Nelson Phillips
Abstract: In this paper, we adopt a discourse analytic methodology to explore the role of institutional entrepreneurs in the process of institutional change that coincides with the adoption of a radically new technology. More specifically, we examine how Kodak managed to transform photography from a highly specialized activity to one that became an integral part of everyday life. Based on this case, we develop an initial typology of the strategies available to institutional entrepreneurs who wish to affect the processes of social construction that lead to change in institutional fields. The use of discourse analysis in analysing institutional change provides new insights into the processes through which institutional fields evolve as well as into how institutional entrepreneurs are able to act strategically to embody their interests in the resulting institutions.

Title: Organizational Citizenship Behaviour as Performance in Multiple Network Positions
Author-Name: Kai Lamertz
Abstract: This paper employs structural role theory to theorize why and how the performance of organizational citizenship behaviour (OCB) may be associated with an individual's occupation of social network positions. OCB is modelled as behaviour related to the occupation of position–role combinations in the informal structure of organizations. It is proposed that the performance of OCB occurs in conjunction with informal role enactment at a given network position because such performance is characteristic of position occupancy. A given actor may occupy multiple network positions, which profile the actor's links to the informal organization and place him or her in the position to perform OCB. An empirical study of employees in a telecommunications company showed that cohesiveness, centrality and network bridges predict two different types of OCB that characterize a ‘good colleague’ and a ‘good employee’ role.

Abstract: The act of relating is analysed as a constitutive feature of human agency. Relating is viewed as the continuous work of connecting and disconnecting in a fluctuating network of existential events. Relating re-lates the human world as a restless scene of flowing parts in which whole, self-contained objects take second place to the continuous transmission of movement. The relating of the world of moving parts is illustrated through the examples of modern methods of mass production and the transmission of information which both produce a 'weakening of reality'.

Abstract: Seen from a perspective of symbolic interaction and social constructivism, organizational learning is a practical accomplishment that takes place among and through other organizational members. This study sets out to explore the social construction of organizational learning by examining the responses of members to a management-imposed teaching curriculum that contradicted basic assumptions regarding professional identity. We build on the results of recent ethnographic fieldwork which has investigated the incorporation of communication skills training in an Israeli medical school. This professional socialization is examined in terms of its theoretization by the management, its implementation in the curriculum, and its interpretation by supervising physicians and medical students. These various facets of meaning and their mismatches provide a concrete example for the study of situated learning in organizations. We conclude by exploring the meaning and interplay of managerial ideology, workplace culture and...

Title: Challenges of Teamwork in Production: Demands of Communication
Author-Name: Heiner Minssen
Abstract: Implementing teamwork in production is an element of a gradual transfer of the company's steering from coordination by hierarchy to a form of coordination which can be characterized as discursive coordination. This generates an increasing density of communication which is the actual challenge — for the team members as well as for the organization as a whole. Workers often unused to communicating at work have to guarantee cooperation and control by self-regulating and so are forced to communicate more than before; superiors who are afraid of losing their influence, status, power and at worst their jobs have to treat workers as experts rather than as recipients of orders. The question is therefore why organizations expose themselves to challenges like these. Regarding the neo-institutionalistic concept of isomorphism it can be argued that the dissemination of teamwork in production is a case of mimetic isomorphism. But a new guideline for rationalization, in this case the implementation of teamwork, must su...

Title: Alternative Approaches for Studying Organizational Change
Author-Name: Andrew H. Van de Ven
Author-Name: Marshall Scott Poole
Abstract: Scholars hold different views about whether organizations consist of things or processes and about variance or process methods for conducting research. By combining these two dimensions, we develop a typology of four approaches for studying organizational change. Although the four approaches may be viewed as opposing or competing views, we see them as being complementary. Each approach focuses on different questions and provides a different — but partial — understanding of organizational change. We argue that coordinating the pluralistic insights from the four approaches provides a richer understanding of organization change than any one approach provides by itself.

Title: Introduction to the Special Issue. 'Connectivity' in Merging Organizations:                 Beyond Traditional Cultural Perspectives
Author-Name: Duncan Angwin
Author-Name: Eero Vaara
Abstract: This editorial provides an introduction to the themes of this special issue on ‘connectivity’ in merging organizations. The growing impact of mergers and acquisitions on organizations, industries and economies has generated substantial research interest in the ensuing change processes from strategic, human resource and cultural perspectives. However, this research has focused on certain perspectives and failed to interrogate others. In the case of the cultural perspective, researchers have tended to focus on cultural differences between merging firms and how these differences may be bridged. This focus has provided important insights into the dynamics of these processes, but at the same time has constrained our appreciation of the richness of connectivity between organizations and their contexts as well as clouded our efforts in developing new concepts and angles for research. Through the focus of the special issue on connectivity, the strengths and limitations of the cultural paradigm in M&A research wil...

Author-Name: Louis Hébert

Abstract: Do expatriate managers fulfil the role of ‘value-seeking connectors’ in cross-border acquisitions? Building from the organizational knowledge and the MNC literature, this paper focuses on the use of expatriate managers for transferring experience-based knowledge within the MNC and its impact on the survival of acquired subsidiaries. Using a sample of cross-border acquisitions by Japanese MNCs, we analysed the impact of expatriate managers on the relationship between the acquirer’s industry, host country and acquisition experience and the survival of the acquired subsidiary. Results show that the contribution of expatriation to the acquired firm’s survival varies considerably depending on the type of experience considered. In fact, connectivity through expatriation is costly and only when appropriately sent abroad do expatriate managers build an effective bridge over the troubled water that characterizes the challenging post-acquisition integration.

Title: Facilitating Acquisition Integration Through Deep-Level Cultural Learning                 Interventions: A Longitudinal Field Experiment
Author-Name: David M. Schweiger
Author-Name: Philip K. Goulet
Abstract: In this exploratory study we argue that achieving an effective employee mindset toward acquisition may be less a process of limiting acquisitions to firms with more similar cultures than it is an ability to manage cultural differences through cultural learning. This study is the first to systematically and empirically examine cultural learning interventions as they apply to the post-acquisition integration process. The longitudinal results from a field experiment across three pairs of matched plants indicate that cultural distance between employees from combining firms can be bridged during the early stages of the integration process. Deep-level cultural learning interventions were found to develop constructive employee perceptions and attitudes that are believed to enhance performance in acquisitions requiring human integration to achieve synergies.

Author-Name: Andrew H. Van de Ven
Abstract: This paper reports findings from an eight-year ethnographic study of the integration process in a large healthcare system formed in a 1994 merger. We examine the post-merger integration process by analyzing the relative amounts of time that senior managers in one unit of this organization spent discussing various integration topics and issues in their bi-weekly meetings from 1995 to 2002. We also describe the different patterns observed when managers addressed topics in their meetings related to internal unit integration versus integration with other parts of the organization. Finally, we identify a vicious cycle of repeated conflicts in how organizational members made sense of issues that emerged during the post-merger integration journey.

Title: The Power of 'Organizational Culture' as a Discursive Formation in Merger Integration
Author-Name: Sally Riad
Abstract: This paper argues that knowledge on ‘organizational culture’ has acquired authority and constitutes a ‘truth’ on mergers, a truth imbued with both enabling and constraining power effects. Taking a Foucauldian perspective, the paper theorizes ‘organizational culture’ as a discursive formation that is implicated in a regime of truth. This regime has involved a process of disciplinary normalization in merger integration with the result that ‘culture’ has become naturalized to ‘organization’. Drawing on ethnographic research into merger integration, these arguments are illustrated through two vignettes titled ‘surveillance’ and ‘sanctuary’. These represent the reproduction of, and resistance to, the truth effects of ‘organizational culture’. The implications of critically examining ‘organizational culture’ in this way are twofold: first, it opens up space for other merger discourses, and second, it enables positioning of merger accounts within cultural discourses in a way that forwards productive rather than ...

Title: Duality and Paradox: Trust and Duplicity in Japanese Business Practice
Author-Name: Stewart Johnston
Author-Name: John W. Selsky
Abstract: This paper extracts several dualistic constructs from the anthropological literature on Japan and interprets them in terms of recent understandings of paradox in organizational behaviour. Two historical and one contemporary illustration of these dualities within the Japanese business macroculture are offered. Each is interpreted using a normative, critical and paradox approach, and the different approaches are shown to constitute competing explanations of the phenomena. The findings are discussed in terms of how the dualities affect the dynamics of Japanese business conduct and how they reproduce a macroculture among the large business conglomerates. Insights are offered into how individual firm behaviour is shaped by dualistic features of the macroculture. Implications are drawn for how the conduct of cross-cultural business relationships and government policy may be informed by paradox.

Title: Translating Management Ideas
Author-Name: Timothy Morris
Author-Name: Zoë Lancaster
Abstract: Accounts of the spread of management ideas emphasizing the role of ‘supply-side’ actors underplay the active role recipients play in translating them into new and different forms. Comparing firms undergoing a similar process and looking at how a specific event unfolded, this paper aims to extend understanding of the concept of translation. It examines how ideas are rendered appropriate to a new setting through translation from the broad policy level into a set of specific practices. To do this, it looks at how a proposal to introduce lean management into the construction industry was applied within a set of firms and the projects they were undertaking. In the context of large ‘distance’ between the original arenas of the idea and its new one, the paper uncovers how the editing rules that are said to guide the process of translation are operationalized using a set of change interventions.

Title: Stakeholder Power and Organizational Learning in Corporate Environmental Management
Author-Name: Nigel Roome
Author-Name: Frank Wijen
Abstract: The literatures on stakeholder engagement by companies and organizational learning give little consideration to the power (or influence) of stakeholders to affect the process or content of organizational learning. These literatures generally assume that common ground between companies and their stakeholders can be established as a prerequisite for learning, that learning is a quasi-autonomous process unaffected by the motives or power of stakeholders, and that actors have the power to fulfil roles that are critical in fostering learning. The paper seeks to address these omissions, examining how and why stakeholder power and organizational learning interact, drawing on comparative case studies of the environmental management practices found in two major companies. The evidence from these cases suggests a complex relationship between the ambition of company goals, the structure of learning, and the influence of stakeholders on the process and outcomes of learning. Exploitative learning routines were effecti...

Author-Name: Filippo Carlo Wezel
Author-Name: Ayse Saka-Helmhout
Abstract: In this paper, we highlight the conditions under which organizations initiate changes in two distinct institutional contexts. While the focus within behavioral research has been on aspiration-driven organizational change, the effect of institutional dynamics on the probability of change has been given limited attention. Pooled cross-sectional data covering the period 1920-2001 in the baseball industry are regressed to examine a set of hypotheses that predict the drivers of organizational change in periods of institutional stability and instability, as well as the impact of these changes on performance. Our findings show that the role of aspiration-driven organizational change diminishes in environments characterized by institutional instability. Rather, mimetic and cognitive pressures pave the ground for responses to institutional dynamics. We also shed light on how the relative stability/instability of the institutional environment heterogeneously influences the implications of behavioral changes for org...

Title: Beyond Guanxi: Network Contingencies in Taiwanese Business Groups
Author-Name: Chi-Nien Chung
Abstract: Business groups consisting of legally independent affiliates with institutionalized relationships with each other exist in almost every market economy. While the groups are important and pervasive, little attention has been paid to the processes by which business groups emerge and grow. Reasons for this gap include a) a deficiency of the top-down, macro perspective of many business group studies, and b) the overemphasis of Guanxi networks in the literature of business organizations in East Asia. Personal relationships (Guanxi) are treated as the necessary and sufficient condition for the entrepreneurship and evolution of business groups. In an attempt to refine the Guanxi perspective, the author uses case studies of five major Taiwanese business groups to propose a set of contingency factors. The suggestion offered in this paper is that entrepreneurs’ attributes and contextual factors are inseparable from the functions of the Guanxi network in the entrepreneurial process. Tracing the movements of these gr...

Title: Organization/Literature: Exploring the Seam

Abstract: In this paper we develop a particular way of understanding literature and organization with the aim of drawing on and extending the relationship between the two. Hence our subtitle: exploring the seam. Although the use of literary concepts and theories within our discipline is now well established, the way in which such ideas are taken up often neglects debate and contestation by treating ‘literature’ as a relatively homogeneous field. By following some of the ardent debates relating to issues of representation, the relation between text and extra-textual reality, and literature’s disclosure of its status as fiction, we find a discussion of (social) organization at the heart of contemporary literary theory. It is the oscillation between literature and organization that structures this paper and gives us our argument: that ‘organization’ and ‘literature’ are mutually co-articulating and interdependent concepts and fields of enquiry.

Title: Institutions and Development: Electronic Commerce and Economic Growth
Author-Name: Mark J. F. Lund
Author-Name: Steven McGuire
Abstract: Trade in e-commerce is well known to have benefited individuals, firms and countries in the developed world. However, according to organizations including the WTO, OECD and UNCTAD, as well as the USA and EU, trade in e-commerce is also a means of improving the overall economic growth and performance of less developed nations. In fact, the WTO considers e-commerce to be the key force in integrating LDCs into the multilateral trading system. This paper sets out to problematize this view, not by arguing that e-commerce cannot make an important contribution to development, but by querying the assumptions that underpin current thinking. We start by repairing these defects: the absence of any role for the state; the underestimation of polarization in society and its effect on economic growth; and the failure to distinguish between types of e-commerce. Employing the participation and enhancement classification of e-commerce adoption, we consider whether developing states are ready for the participation phase of ...

Title: Institutional Legacies and Firm Dynamics: The Growth and Internationalization                 of UK and German Law Firms

Author-Name: Sigrid Quack
Abstract: This article addresses the question of how economic actors (re)shape their organizational and institutional contexts as their activities internationalize. By focusing on law firms, we choose a professional activity that has been regarded as highly determined by the national distinctiveness of professional and legal systems and would lead us to expect strong institutional legacies on firm dynamics. The comparative study of the growth and internationalization of corporate law firms in the UK and Germany presented in this article, however, refutes this view. The results reveal that in both settings ‘institutional pockets’ of corporate lawyers existed whose entrepreneurial orientations and international reach were much stronger than among other subgroups of the profession. From the 1970s onwards, these lawyers and law firms engaged in redefining their organizational and institutional contexts with the aim of positioning themselves in ways that would allow them to seize upon the emerging international markets ...

Abstract: The aim of the paper is to identify the basis of regional competence in industry sectors that are not key performers at the national level. The paper examines the ICT sector in two regions: Dresden (Germany) and Adelaide (Australia). The performance of Australia and Germany in ICT is not high by OECD standards. However, both Dresden and Adelaide have some competence in parts of the ICT sector that departs from national patterns. In Dresden the development of the ICT sector is more advanced than in Adelaide. In both regions, there are distinctive institutional features and policies that explain the development of the ICT sector. Further, in Dresden, the state has coordinated the ICT sector within the regional space, giving focus to institutional strengths in research and training, such that it is possible to describe the institutional environment as ‘thick and coherent’. As such, the regional space of Dresden has experienced an agglomeration of ICT and can be regarded as more successful than Adelaide, wher...

Abstract: This paper reports an empirical study on the co-evolution of competitive conditions dominating firms and organizational forms in the paper industry1. It has two main theoretical implications. First, with respect to research on national business systems and the societal effect, we suggest that the country of origin imprints firms especially by allowing them to develop distinctive organizational forms. Second, we show that the competitive conditions, dominant forms and dominant firms remain in constant flux even in mature industries. There is, therefore, a need for co-evolutionary research to continue to combine long-term perspectives and intensive research designs in the study of specific industries.

Author-Name: Andrew Popp
Abstract: Focusing on the North Staffordshire Potteries in the later 19th century, this paper explores the role of formal trade associations in the governance of industrial districts. Contrary to the ‘ideal-typical’ model of the industrial district, we find that associationalism is not always a formal expression of an informal spirit of cooperation. However, the case also suggests that associations can be difficult to establish in large, complex industrial districts. In particular, the failure of associationalism in the Potteries is traced to interlinked economic, industrial and social variables.

Title: The Dynamic Limits of Specialization: Vertical Integration Reconsidered
Author-Name: Eugenia Cacciatori
Author-Name: Michael G. Jacobides
Abstract: Existing studies, largely based in transaction cost economics, approach the issue of vertical scope as the decision of the individual firm about whether to make or buy, given the set of existing markets and well defined vertical segments. However, recent research has shown that the ability to make or buy should not be taken for granted. We argue that this applies not only to dis-integration, but also to re-integration, which often demands new ‘all-in-one’ markets. Drawing on the British building industry, we develop an inductive framework to explain why, after long periods of vertical specialization, industries shift to vertical reintegration. We observe that various groups, including professionals, play an active role in shaping the nature and the boundaries of the industry, facilitating the onset of vertical specialization, which, in turn, shapes a number of increasingly distinct knowledge bases in the industry, defining the trajectories along which capabilities evolve over time. As specialization in sc...

Title: The Limits to Specialization: Problem Solving and Coordination in                 ‘Modular Networks’
Author-Name: Stefano Brusoni
Abstract: This paper builds upon current research into the organizational implications of ‘modularity’. Advocates of modularity argue that the ‘invisible hand’ of markets is reaching activities previously controlled through the visible hand of hierarchies. This paper argues that there are cognitive limits to the extent of division of labour: what kinds of problems firms solve, and how they solve them, set limits to the extent of division of labour, irrespective of the extent of the market. This paper analyses the cognitive limits to the division of labour, relying on an in-depth case study of engineering design activities. On this basis, it explains why coordinating increasingly specialized bodies of knowledge, and increasingly distributed learning processes, requires the presence of knowledge-integrating firms even in the presence of modular products. Such firms, relying on their wide in-house scientific and technological capabilities, have the ‘authority’ to identify, propose and implement solutions to complex pr...

Title: Institutional Influences on Manufacturing Organization in Multinational                 Corporations: The ‘Cherrypicking’ Approach
Author-Name: Mike Geppert
Author-Name: Dirk Matten
Abstract: Research on the multinational corporation (MNC) is increasingly concerned with the alleged evolution of companies towards a more standardized and rationalized global organization. Only recently, this field has been informed by alternative approaches which generate a more differentiated picture and consider the influence of divergent national institutional contexts on the multinational organization. This paper makes a contribution to this debate from a comparative institutionalist perspective by focusing on manufacturing organization within MNCs. It argues that organization structures and processes in MNCs are sector specific and influenced by national institutional features of the home and host countries. Drawing on data from a specific industrial sector, it identifies the crucial role of home country and host country embeddedness in the (re)organization of manufacturing tasks and work systems. The key question is how actors shape the interaction of these institutional pressures and, hence, manufacturing ...

Abstract: This paper explores the relations between management discourse and employee subjectivity in the process of organizational change, drawing on a new empirical study of doctors and nurses working in the British National Health Service (NHS). It builds on recent critiques of more muscular accounts of discourse to examine the manoeuvres made by working subjects in response to managerialist discourses of the entrepreneurial self. While others have shown that alternative discourses including gender, age and profession are important here, this paper argues that we must pay attention to the spatial and temporal contexts within which such generic discourses are received and understood in order to interpret the practices of subjectivity and power in organizational life. We suggest that this approach allows new insights to policy concerns in the NHS; to our understanding of the nature of work subjectivities; and to sociological understandings of organizational power.

Title: The Political Dynamics of Organizational Culture in an Institutionalized Environment
Author-Name: Suzana Braga Rodrigues
Abstract: This paper addresses organizational culture change from a longitudinal perspective. It analyses how the organizational culture of a major Brazilian telecommunications company changed during its 27-year history from a condition of integration to one of fragmentation and then differentiation. The paper identifies the sources of these changes, paying particular attention to the role of institutional and political factors. Based on the empirical data, a framework for analysing the dynamics of culture change in organizations is proposed.

Author-Name: Gladys E. R. Tummers
Author-Name: Godefridus G. van Merode
Author-Name: Jan A. Landeweerd
Abstract: The current study aims to examine effects of organizational characteristics (decision authority and environmental uncertainty) on nurses’ psychological work reactions (job satisfaction and intrinsic work motivation; burnout and health complaints). In this context, we were primarily interested in the congruence between decision authority and environmental uncertainty. The contingency approach of organizations was used as a leading framework. In order to investigate these relationships, questionnaires were administered to 1188 nurses working in general hospitals in the Netherlands. Because the standardization of tasks is expected to be different between intensive care units (ICUs) and non-ICUs, and consequently, this difference might influence the effects of organizational characteristics on psychological work reactions, the relationships were investigated separately for each type of unit. Correlation and hierarchical regression analysis were used to analyse the data. From the results of these analyses, it ...

Title: Defeating the Minotaur: The Construction of CEO Charisma on the US Stock Market
Author-Name: Angelo Fanelli
Author-Name: Nora Ilona Grasselli
Abstract: This paper illustrates the construction of CEO charisma within the US stock market. By metaphorically employing the myth of the Minotaur, we discuss three forces underlying the rise of heroic CEO images in the USA: Ariadne, or charismatic leadership theory and its formulation of charisma; Theseus, or the CEOs struggling to obtain power over stock market actors; and the Minotaur, or the stock market itself and the securities analyst profession. Building on the literature on organizational symbolism, we present a qualitative study of two CEO successions, focusing on the form and content of the persona and the vision projected by CEOs and elaborated by securities analysts. The results suggest that jointly constructing charisma through discourse, CEOs and analysts enact a form of power that does not lie in top-down coercion, but rather on the emergent, active involvement and contribution of its very subjects.

Title: Pulp and Paper Fiction: On the Discursive Legitimation of Global Industrial Restructuring
Author-Name: Eero Vaara
Author-Name: Janne Tienari
Author-Name: Juha Laurila
Abstract: Despite the central role of legitimacy in social and organizational life, we know little of the subtle meaning-making processes through which organizational phenomena, such as industrial restructuring, are legitimated in contemporary society. Therefore, this paper examines the discursive legitimation strategies used when making sense of global industrial restructuring in the media. Based on a critical discourse analysis of extensive media coverage of a revolutionary pulp and paper sector merger, we distinguish and analyze five legitimation strategies: (1) normalization, (2) authorization, (3) rationalization, (4) moralization, and (5) narrativization. We argue that while these specific legitimation strategies appear in individual texts, their recurring use in the intertextual totality of the public discussion establishes the core elements of the emerging legitimating discourse.

Title: Innovation and Virtual Environments: Towards Virtual Knowledge Brokers
Author-Name: Gianmario Verona

Abstract: We examine the implications of virtual customer environments for supporting the innovation process. By building on the literature of knowledge brokers, we introduce the concept of virtual knowledge brokers—actors who leverage the internet to support third parties’ innovation activities. These actors enable firms to extend their reach in engaging with customers and they also allow firms to have a richer dialogue with customers because of their perceived neutrality. Consequently, virtual knowledge brokers help firms to complement the knowledge they can acquire through traditional physical and virtual channels for customer interaction. We highlight the capabilities and contributions of virtual knowledge brokers, and we discuss the implications of these entities for theory and practice in the management of innovation.

Title: Changing Experiences of Work in Reformed State-Owned Enterprises in China
Author-Name: Catherine C. H. Chiu
Abstract: Although previous studies on state-owned enterprise (SOE) reforms in China report the ascendancy of management control and highlight the exploitation of workers, studies that adopt a path-dependent approach report that managers in reformed SOEs are constrained by their traditional socialist ideology and practices in imposing drastic changes. Against this background, a study involving seven reformed SOEs was conducted. This paper focuses on worker reactions to enterprise reforms, and presents analyses that are based on the context-dependent approach to organizational changes in the West. Management control has become stricter in all of the reformed SOEs, but there are significant differences in various work dimensions across enterprises. Multivariate analyses indicate that improved job security and increased mental labour are key predictors of increased job satisfaction. This paper confirms the theoretical values of the context-dependent approach and introduces theoretically derived analyses to worker reac...

Title: The Emergence of New Global Institutions: A Discursive Perspective

Abstract: We examine how a new discourse shapes the emergence of new global regulatory institutions and, specifically, the roles played by actors and the texts they author during the institution-building process, by investigating a case study of the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) and its relationship to the new environmental regulatory discourse of ‘precaution’. We show that new discourses do not neatly supplant legacy discourses but, instead, are made to overlap and interact with them through the authorial agency of actors, as a result of which the meanings of both are changed. It is out of this discursive struggle that new institutions emerge.

Title: The Cognitive-Cultural Systems of the Research Laboratory
Author-Name: Nancy J. Nersessian
Abstract: A central challenge for science studies researchers in developing accounts of knowledge construction in science and engineering is to integrate the cognitive, social, cultural, and material dimensions of practice. Within science studies there is a perceived divide between cognitive practices, on the one hand, and cultural practices, on the other. Any such divide, though at times analytically useful, is artificial. Producing scientific knowledge requires the kind of sophisticated cognition that only rich social, cultural, and material environments can enable. This paper aims to move in the direction of an integrative account of these dimensions of practice. It discusses model-based reasoning practices in biomedical engineering research laboratories construed as ‘evolving cognitive-cultural systems’.

Title: Understanding Process From Within: An Argument for ‘Withness’-Thinking
Author-Name: John Shotter
Abstract: If our task is simply that of theorizing process, then there are many brilliant writers and thinkers in the recent past to turn to. But as I see it, these writers are mostly oriented toward helping us think about process ‘from the outside’, about processes that we merely observe as happening ‘over there’. But if we are to rethink appropriate styles of empirical research, then we need a different form of engaged, responsive thinking, acting, and talking, that allows us to affect the flow of processes from within our living involvement with them. Crucially, this kind of responsive understanding only becomes available to us in our relations with living forms when we enter into dialogically structured relations with them. It remains utterly unavailable to us as external observers. I will call this kind of thinking, ‘thinking-from-within’ or ‘withness-thinking’, to contrast it with the ‘aboutness-thinking’ that is more familiar to us. What we can gain in our understandings-from-within, is a subsidiary awarenes...

Title: Introduction to the Special Issue. In Search of Organizational Virtue: Moral                 Agency in Organizations
Author-Name: Richard P. Nielsen
Abstract: This editorial provides an introduction to the themes of this ‘Special Issue on Organizational Virtue and Moral Agency in Organizations’. MacIntyre, in After Virtue (1981), critically observed that, under the severe pressures of narrowly focused, system-driven, utilitarian financial and bureaucratic calculation, it can be very difficult both for organizations and individuals in their organizational lives to realize and express moral agency and virtue. The articles contained here trace the development of MacIntyre’s analysis of this possibility and consider how organizational pressures against moral agency can be an important problem. In addition, the special issue considers how both philosophical and social-behavioral science approaches reveal similar problems and diagnoses. Further, there is discussion of how the possibilities of and constraints on virtue vary and are more and less severe in different types of organizational systems and situations. The special issue also considers what degrees of freedom...

Abstract: This paper introduces the work of moral philosopher Alasdair MacIntyre in the area of virtue and organization. It aims to provide one point of entry to MacIntyre’s work for readers who have not been introduced to it and makes some novel suggestions about its development for those who have. Following some initial comments on MacIntyre’s approach to social science, it traces the development of his ideas on organization from 1953 to 1980, before outlining the general theory of virtues, goods, practices and institutions which emerged in the publication of his seminal After Virtue in 1981. Finally, the paper outlines some of the uses to which these ideas have been put in the organizational literature.

Title: Virtue in Organizations: Moral Identity as a Foundation for Moral Agency
Author-Name: Gary R. Weaver
Abstract: Framing issues of organizational ethics in terms of virtues and moral agency (rather than in terms of rules and ethical behavior) has implications for the way social science addresses matters of morality in organizations. In particular, attending to matters of virtue and moral agency directs attention to the moral identity, or self-concept, of persons, and to the circumstances that influence self-identity. This article develops parallels between philosophical theories of virtue and the concept of moral identity as developed in social cognitive identity theory. Explicating notions of virtue and moral agency in terms of social cognitive identity theory, in turn, helps direct attention to a range of factors—including both organizational and extraorganizational, macro-cultural ones—that can foster or inhibit moral agency in organizations.

Title: In Search of Organizational Virtue in Business: Agents, Goods, Practices,                 Institutions and Environments
Author-Name: Geoff Moore
Author-Name: Ron Beadle
Abstract: In this paper we argue that MacIntyre’s virtues-goods-practice-institution schema (MacIntyre 1985) provides a conceptual framework within which organizational virtue in general, and virtue in business in particular, can be explored. A heuristic device involving levels of individual agency, mode of institutionalization and environment is used to discuss why some businesses protect practices, develop virtues and encourage the exercise of moral agency in their decision making, while others struggle or fail to do so. In relation to conventional shareholder-owned capitalist business, both the mode of institutionalization and the environment are shown to be largely antithetical to the development of practices. Other businesses may meet the necessary internal conditions for the sustenance of practice-like features but remain dependent upon features within their environments. To illustrate this, we use participant observation to show how one particular organization—Traidcraft plc—meets the relevant conditions.

Author-Name: Pursey P.M.A.R. Heugens
Author-Name: Muel Kaptein
Author-Name: J. (Hans) van Oosterhout
Abstract: Some centers of gravity are finally emerging in the field of business ethics after a decades-long search for action-guiding theories. Among the foremost of these are contractualism and virtue ethics. The former focuses on the morals of economic exchange, the latter on the moral qualities of economic actors. We demonstrate that these dyadic and nodal ethics are not competing contenders to the throne of business ethics, but complementary approaches that are best used in tandem if we want to identify the generic normative core of the field. Specifically, virtue ethicists benefit from contractualists’ aptitude for highlighting the conditions that exchange relationships must meet in order to become vehicles for the pursuit of excellence. In turn, contractualists profit from virtue ethicists’ ability to identify the qualities actors must possess to efficaciously engage in exchange transactions.

Title: Ethics Blind Spots in Organizations: How Systematic Errors in Person                 Perception Undermine Moral Agency
Author-Name: Dennis J. Moberg
Abstract: Moral agency in work organizations is vulnerable to systematic patterns of person perception. Employing cognitive structuralism and drawing upon cases of corporate wrongdoing, it is argued that common perceptual frames create ethics blind spots that undermine moral agency. By focusing on the possibility of others’ moral transgressions, employees overlook virtuous acts and morally admirable propensities. Their frame makes them especially critical of the morality of organizational officials. Exacerbating this tendency are the blind spots evident among officials who disregard the need to communicate their moral priorities and who pay little attention to the moral actions of their subordinates. Since perceptual frames are shaped in part by volition, ethics blind spots can be corrected by a self-improvement regimen.

Title: Conventional versus Radical Moral Agents: An Exploratory Empirical Look at                 Weber’s Moral-points-of-view and Virtues
Author-Name: Bruno Dyck
Author-Name: J. Mark Weber
Abstract: Max Weber’s work suggests that conventional management theory and practice is underpinned by a moral-point-of-view that places relatively high emphasis on both materialism and individualism. He calls for the development of radical management theory and practices to serve as a counterpoint. Both the conventional and radical moral-points-of-view are associated with specific virtues and practices. Weber suggests that, from a conventional moral-point-of-view, four primary virtues—mercy, submission, obedience and non-worldliness—give rise to specialization, centralization, formalization and standardization. In contrast, from a radical moral-point-of-view, these same four primary virtues are expected to give rise to sensitization, dignification, participation and experimentation (Dyck and Schroeder 2005). Our study contrasts and compares a sample of conventional and radical managers, to provide an empirical look at these expected differences, as well as testing for differences in their personal and spiritual vi...

Title: From Binarism Back to Hybridity: A Postcolonial Reading of Management and                 Organization Studies
Author-Name: Michal Frenkel
Author-Name: Yehouda Shenhav
Abstract: Drawing on recent theoretical developments in postcolonial research, we examine the effect of the colonial encounter on the canonization of management and organization studies (MOS) as well as the field’s epistemological boundaries. In contrast to Orientalism, which is founded on a neat, binary, division between West and East, we offer (following Latour) a hybrid epistemology, which recognizes that the history of management and organizations should include the fusion between the colonizer and the colonized and their mutual effects on each other. Thus, while we discern the Orientalist assumptions embedded in the writing of management scholars, we also show that certain texts and practices that emerged during the colonial, as well as neo-colonial, encounter were excluded from the field, resulting in a ‘purified canon’. We conclude by arguing that hybridization between the metropole and colonies, and between western and non-western organizational entities, needs to be acknowledged by students of cultural div...

Abstract: In this paper we argue that organizational culture is an important factor influencing relationship skills, defined as a firm’s ability and behavioral tendency to actively cultivate and manage its ties with other firms. Testing our model on a sample of 102 inter-firm relations, we find that firms with organizational cultures characterized by an orientation towards stability and predictability, a positive orientation towards innovation, and not characterized by a strong focus on immediate results, score high on relationship skills. Relationship skills, in turn, positively affect the perceived relationship performance.

Title: Completing the Practice Turn in Strategy Research
Author-Name: Richard Whittington
Abstract: This paper identifies a practice turn in current strategy research, treating strategy as something people do. However, it argues that this turn is incomplete in that researchers currently concentrate either on strategy activity at the intra-organizational level or on the aggregate effects of this activity at the extra-organizational level. The paper proposes a framework for strategy research that integrates these two levels based on the three concepts of strategy praxis, strategy practices and strategy practitioners. The paper develops implications of this framework for research, particularly with regard to the impact of strategy practices on strategy praxis, the creation and transfer of strategy practices and the making of strategy practitioners. The paper concludes by outlining the distinctive emphases of the practice perspective within the strategy discipline.

Title: Strategy as Practical Coping: A Heideggerian Perspective
Author-Name: Robert Chia
Author-Name: Robin Holt
Abstract: What strategic actors actually do in practice has become increasingly the focus of strategy research in recent years. This paper argues that, in furthering such practice-based views of strategy, we need a more adequate re-conceptualization of agency, action and practice and how they interrelate. We draw from the work of the continental philosopher Martin Heidegger to articulate a relational theory of human agency that is better suited to explaining everyday purposive actions and practices. Specifically, we argue that the dominant ‘building’ mode of strategizing that configures actors (whether individual or organizational) as distinct entities deliberately engaging in purposeful strategic activities derives from a more basic ‘dwelling’ mode in which strategy emerges non-deliberately through everyday practical coping. Whereas, from the building perspective, strategy is predicated upon the prior conception of plans that are then orchestrated to realize desired outcome, from a dwelling perspective strategy do...

Abstract: Drawing on empirical evidence in Germany and the UK, this article examines the institutional effects on a fast-growing area of knowledge-intensive business services — IT outsourcing. This is an important area for research since the IT outsourcing market provides many organizations with an important specialized production input and is characterized by complex inter-organizational relations. By exploring institutional influences in the context of IT outsourcing, the research extends earlier studies on how client–supplier relations shape markets for business services. It also contributes to varieties of capitalism debates by highlighting heterogeneous institutional effects within countries and common systemic trends (involving powerful multinational IT firms) in the development of the market for IT outsourcing. Comparative analysis of 13 IT outsourcing contracts in Germany and the UK, focusing on the organizational practices of client organizations and IT firms, illuminated institutional effects within the o...

Title: Surveillance, Resistance, Observance: Exploring the Teleo-affective                 Volatility of Workplace Interaction
Author-Name: Rick Iedema
Author-Name: Carl Rhodes
Author-Name: Hermine Scheeres
Abstract: Central to the critical study of contemporary management practice has been an understanding of the possibilities for worker subjugation framed in terms of the disciplinary practices of surveillance and responses to it in terms of compliance and resistance. In this paper, we explore how the volatility of everyday interaction also leads to a different response — one we call ‘observance’. We introduce this term to refer to the process of identity diversification at work, and to create an analytical-conceptual space that is not fully circumscribed by compliance and resistance. To give the concept of observance empirical flesh, we present an account of team meetings held as part of a quality improvement programme in a manufacturing workplace in Sydney, Australia. We use this account to show how the interpersonal dynamics among team workers led to ‘emergent’ subject positions and conducts. Capturing the effects of the volatility of everyday workplace interaction, the concept of observance is shown to account fo...

Title: Constructing Scientific Careers: Change, Continuity and Context
Author-Name: Joanne Duberley
Author-Name: Laurie Cohen
Author-Name: Mary Mallon
Abstract: This paper examines the ways in which public sector research scientists make sense of and seek to develop their careers within their current organizational, policy, social and cultural contexts. It argues that to access such understandings, both structure and agency and the relationship between them need to be considered. Using empirical evidence from research in the United Kingdom and New Zealand, this paper further develops Barley's (1989) structuration model of career. It highlights the diverse (and frequently intersecting) institutional contexts in which research scientists seek to develop their careers, and their characteristic modes of engagement with such contexts, and utilizes the concept of career scripts to illustrate the dynamic interaction between these dimensions.

Title: Managerial Frames and Institutional Discourses of Change: Employee                 Appropriation and Resistance
Author-Name: Samia Chreim
Abstract: This paper proposes that the notions of frame and frame appropriation are useful tools for the study of control in organizations, as well as for the analysis of the connection between micro-level discursive activities and wider discourses that enable and constrain such activities. To date, most studies of framing and of wider discourses have proceeded independently of each other. An empirical study of bank employees' accounts of their responses to two different changes introduced by management indicates that employees frame their responses in part according to their individual capabilities and experiences; that employee frames show an alignment with managerial frames and institutional discourses that are unified and reified; and that employee frames exhibit both alignment and misalignment with managerial frames that are open to contestation. The study also indicates that institutional discourses can both constrain and enable employee resistance to managerial frames.

Title: Reshaping the Hourglass? The Environmental Movement and Civil Society                 Development in the Russian Federation
Author-Name: Jo Crotty
Abstract: Rose's and Mishler and Rose's ‘hourglass’ construction of post-Soviet Russian society illustrates that the civil space traditionally occupied by advocacy and community groups continues to be constricted. Such groups fail to successfully bridge the space between the individual and the state, thereby holding the fledgling Russian democracy to account. In this paper, to shed light on reasons for the continuing constriction of Russian civil space, the behavior of the environmental movement in one Russian region — Samara Oblast — is observed through the lens of social capital. By utilizing Adler and Kwon's schema for assessing the benefits and risks arising from social capital stocks possessed by collectives, it will illustrate that the Russian environmental movement is inward looking and parochial; built on pre-existing friendships or elite connections; and uninterested in forming a mass movement or actively engaging with the Russian public. Moreover, rather than being situated within the constricted civil sp...

Author-Name: Ruey-Lin Hsiao

Abstract: This research examines the knowledge management challenge underlying technology use. It proposes to examine the key question: how can knowledge management problems and technology adoption difficulties be analysed through experts' practices embedded in their work contexts? The problems of knowledge transfer, coordination and reuse are investigated by examining experts' practices and work contexts. The inquiry is grounded in a qualitative case study of a knowledge management system designed to support maintenance work performed by two groups of engineers in a semiconductor-fabrication equipment company. The findings illustrate two contrasting outcomes: the equipment engineers found the system to be useful; the field engineers considered it to be irrelevant to their work contexts. An analysis of the fabrication process (the technical context), engineers' professional communities (the social context), and the pace of product/process innovation (the innovative context) helps us to understand the main problems ...

Abstract: We present an in-depth analysis of post-flight reviews in a fighter aircraft squadron of the Israel Defense Force Air Force. Our findings demonstrate how organizations can learn non-metaphorically and highlight the dynamics of learning in a central organizational learning mechanism in this type of after-action review. They also show that learning in the post-flight reviews is a multi-layered process of retrospective sense-making, detection and correction of error, social comparison, social control, socialization, and bonding, where lessons-learned pertain to different domains and different levels — individual, unit, and Force-wide. The process is facilitated by five values specified by the multi-facet model (Lipshitz, Popper and Friedman 2002), and the assumption that learning through critical examination of one's own experience is the key to improvement.

Title: To Text or Context? Endotextual, Exotextual, and Multi-textual                 Approaches to Narrative and Discursive Organizational Studies
Author-Name: David Barry
Author-Name: Brigid Carroll
Author-Name: Hans Hansen
Abstract: Organizational researchers doing narrative and discursive research have three choices in how they approach a text: an ‘endotextual’ approach where the researcher works within a text, an ‘exotextual’ approach where the researcher works outward from a text to its context(s), or a combined exo/endotextual approach which embeds a textual analysis within contextual inquiry. Although all three methods are now widely used in mainstream organizational research, the merits of combining, sequencing, or separating them have never been systematically considered. After reviewing the advantages and limitations of each perspective, we discuss an experiment in which endo and exo methods were applied to a skit co-written by management and a communications company specializing in organizational theater. The finding that using one approach creates multiple, subtle blind spots towards the other, and even more significantly affects a researcher's capacity to effectively adopt a combined method, is used to construct an alterna...

Title: ‘Afterwards we can understand what went wrong, but now                 let’s fix it’: How Situated Work Practices Shape Group Decision Making
Author-Name: Francesca Alby
Author-Name: Cristina Zucchermaglio
Abstract: The paper proposes an ethnomethodological approach to the study of naturalistic decision making. We present an analysis of design practices in an Internet company, showing that, besides ‘professional design’ of technological systems, designers are continually involved in an activity of maintenance and replanning of these same systems (‘design-in-use’). Through an interaction-based analysis, we describe a serious emergency design-in-use situation. Results show that (1) decision-making activities are not clearly identifiable in ongoing problem-solving action but are embedded in complex work practices; (2) work practices and organizational features shape when, how and which decisions are made, underlying the situated character of the decision-making process; (3) considering the group of designers as unit of analysis allows the complex and distributed nature of decision making in organizations to be described.

Author-Name: Thomas Raslear
Abstract: Cooperative strategies of individuals within a distributed organization can contribute to increased efficiency of operations and safety. We examine these processes in the context of a particular work domain: railroad operations. Analyses revealed a variety of informal cooperative strategies that railroad workers have developed that span across multiple railroad crafts including roadway workers, train crews, and railroad dispatchers. These informal, proactive communications foster shared situation awareness across the distributed organization, facilitate work, and contribute to the overall efficiency, safety, and resilience to error of railroad operations. We discuss design implications for leveraging new digital technologies and location-finding systems to more effectively support these informal strategies, enhance shared situation awareness, and promote high reliability performance.

Title: Extending Naturalistic Decision Making to Complex Organizations: A Dynamic                 Model of Situated Cognition
Author-Name: Lawrence G. Shattuck
Author-Name: Nita Lewis Miller
Abstract: Naturalistic decision making (NDM) has become established as a methodological and theoretical perspective. It describes how practitioners actually make decisions in complex domains. However, NDM theories tend to focus on the human agents in the system. We extend the NDM perspective to include the technological agents in complex systems and introduce the dynamic model of situated cognition. We describe the general characteristics of NDM and the field of situated cognition, and provide a detailed description of our model. We then apply the model to a recent accident in which a US Navy submarine (USS Greeneville) collided with a Japanese fishing vessel (Ehime Maru). The discussion of the accident illustrates how decisions made are often a result of the interaction between a variety of technological and human agents and how errors introduced into the complex system can propagate through it in unintended ways. We argue that the dynamic model of situated cognition can be used to describe activities in virtually...

Author-Name: Richard Cook
Abstract: Healthcare systems, especially hospital operating room suites, have properties that make them ideal for the study of the cognitive work using the naturalistic decision-making (NDM) approach. This variable, complex, high-tempo setting provides a unique opportunity to examine the ways that clinicians plan, monitor, and cope with the irreducible uncertainty that underlies this work domain. As frontline managers, anesthesia coordinators plan and manage anesthesia assignments for surgical procedures. As frontline managers, coordinators develop and use cognitive artifacts to distribute cognition across time and among members of the acute care staff. Examination of these cognitive artifacts and their use reveals the hidden subtleties of the coordinators’ work. The use of NDM methods including cognitive artifact analysis to understand cognitive work generates insights that extend beyond the operator level to the study of team-level cognition. Results can be used to create computer-based artifacts that aid individ...

Abstract: We explore the linkages between naturalistic decision making, which examines decisions in context, and team and organizational learning, which examines how feedback from decisions affects context. We study 27 problem investigation teams in three nuclear power plants, a setting that combines complex team decisions with organizational learning. Further, managers who commission the teams and receive team reports are a key aspect of context for the teams and a critical conduit for organizational learning and change. Questionnaires were given to both team members and manager recipients of written team reports, and team reports were coded for qualities of their analyses and recommendations. We find that team members value reports in which the team discovered causes or lessons that could be used in other contexts, whereas managers appreciate reports with logical corrective actions from teams with investigation experience. Teams with managers or supervisors as team members are better able to reach shared understa...

Abstract: Although naturalistic decision making (NDM) and organizational decision making (ODM) have much in common, they hardly interact. Both NDM and ODM focus on what decision makers actually do in their ‘natural habitats’ and reject the equivalence of decision making with normative economic and statistical reasoning which can be studied in sparse laboratory settings. Linking with ODM would help NDM researchers to include organizational goals, norms, and other aspects of context in their models. Conversely, linking with NDM would provide ODM researchers with detailed descriptions of how individuals and groups perform functions such as decision making, sensemaking, and planning on the basis of pattern matching, story telling and argumentation, and detailed descriptions of the processes through which distributed teams build and maintain shared situation awareness. In the introduction to this special issue we outline the two fields, argue why they should be in closer contact, and summarize the papers contributed to ...

Abstract: This article summarizes, in a style that I have never before been brave enough to adopt, my work as an academic over the last 30 years. I have come closer here to practising what I have preached concerning the idea of being in the text as a self-reflexive, embodied subject rather than representing the world as a detached observer. Our self-imposed, but also heavily institutionalized, pressure to conform to certain modes of writing can produce standardized and anodyne accounts. While we often pretend that personal life is distant from our intellectual endeavours, this is rarely the case, for personal and professional lives are interdependent. I have also tried to offer more conventional accounts of those ideas and theories that have informed my work yet have also been intertwined with personally meaningful experiences. I am grateful to Organization Studies for offering me this opportunity.

Title: A Price is a Social Thing: Towards a Material Sociology of Arbitrage
Author-Name: Daniel Beunza
Author-Name: Iain Hardie
Author-Name: Donald MacKenzie
Abstract: Arbitrage is a form of trading crucial both to the modern theory of finance and to market practice, yet it has seldom been the focus of study outside of economics. This article draws upon four initially separate ethnographic and interview-based studies to sketch a ‘material sociology’ of arbitrage. (The article follows financial market usage in viewing ‘arbitrage’ as trading that exploits discrepancies in relative prices, trading which is seldom the entirely riskless arbitrage posited by finance theory.) Prices are physical entities, and the extent and speed of the mobility of these entities are crucial to arbitrage. Traders' bodies sometimes need to be trained to conduct arbitrage, and the relative placement of different bodies can be crucial. Arbitrage generally involves a theory of the similarity of different assets, and material representations of relative value are often required in order to check the theory's plausibility. Arbitrageurs need to convince themselves and others such as investment-bank m...

Then, drawing on distinctions proposed by Boyer, I discuss four types of scholarly work in which I have been engaged: (1) the scholarship of discovery, in which I studied principally authority systems, organizational effectiveness and institutional structures and processes; (2) the scholarship of teaching, where I describe the variety of courses I have taught; (3) the scholarship of application, involving primarily my work with policy groups at the national level; and (4) the scholarship of integration, including my writing of textbooks and attempts to create community among organizational scholars. I assert that more value should be placed by the academy on the latter three types of scholarship.

Abstract: Given the socially constructed nature of social phenomena, such as scientific knowledge and economic systems, and the considerable differences in how they are organized in different societies, the comparative analysis of variations in patterns of social organization and their consequences seems to me to be central to the social sciences. Beginning with the study of how and why scientific fields are differently organized and then comparing business schools and their graduates in Britain and France, a core theme in my intellectual career has been to understand how the organization of particular kinds of social activities varies between different contexts and has contrasting outcomes. More recently, this concern has been extended to the comparative analysis of economic organization in different institutional contexts, first of all in East Asia and then in Europe, leading to the elaboration of the comparative business systems framework. In all cases, I have developed intellectual frameworks for describing the...

Abstract: Organizational knowledge creation is the process of making available and amplifying knowledge created by individuals as well as crystallizing and connecting it to an organization's knowledge system. In other words, what individuals come to know in their (work-)life benefits their colleagues and, eventually, the larger organization. The theory explaining this process — the organizational knowledge creation theory — has developed rapidly in academia and been broadly diffused in management practice over the last 15 years. This article reviews the theory's central elements and identifies the evolving paths taken by academic work that uses the theory as a point of departure. The article furthermore proposes areas in which future research can advance the theory of organizational knowledge creation.

Title: An Eclectic Explanation of Shopfloor Control Using Efficiency and Power Theories
Author-Name: Xosé H. Vázquez
Abstract: The paper identifies four control mechanisms on the shopfloor and explains their determinants. By enriching contingency and transaction cost theories with power notions, several hypotheses are tested in a dataset composed of 329 Spanish firms in the food and electronic industries. Results show that shopfloor control is shaped by efficiency concerns, power asymmetries and interdependences between control modes. In particular, control mechanisms depend on several structural traits of the firm and labour transaction attributes. However, managers’ opportunism also plays an important role through its effect on workers’ opportunism. This fact calls for the internalization of principals’ opportunistic behaviour in efficiency-driven organizational theories. Furthermore, control mechanisms also show specific interdependences through their relations with certain labour transaction attributes and organizational traits. In fact, the level of human capital can at the same time be the outcome and the cause of certain c...

Title: Inertia in Japanese Organizations: Knowledge Management Routines and Failure                 to Innovate
Author-Name: Simon Collinson
Author-Name: David C. Wilson
Abstract: This paper argues that features of Japanese organizations, previously held to be the foundations of innovation, change and flexibility, can equally be significant barriers to change, innovation and adaptation in turbulent economic environments. This paper draws on two in-depth case studies of Japanese organizations. It shows how, in both cases, these firms displayed specific weaknesses in the ways in which they integrate and bundle knowledge, in particular around their research and development (R&D) functions. Despite the adoption of strategies of technological innovation and internationalization, the data suggest that the pursuit of both strategies is beset by barriers of inertia. Embedded internal network connections and knowledge-sharing routines between central R&D and other divisions are inappropriate for the revised strategy. Existing external connections, with preferred suppliers and customers within keiretsu structures, and close relationships with existing R&D partners retard these firms' strateg...

Abstract: One key to understanding the contours of late modernity is to examine workers’ allocations of time to their organizations. In this article, I frame workplace time commitments as the outcome of two forces: individuals’ efforts to portray a positive and distinctive identity (identity work) and the organizational and social discourses shaping those identities (identity regulation). Analysis of interviews with 53 employees from two distinct organizations shows that identity work and identity regulation related to workplace time commitments are not the result of totalizing managerial discourses, but are influenced by the arrays of discursive resources proffered by both locales and organizational practices. Importantly, these arrays tend to ‘tilt’ toward agency or structure in the conceptions of the individual–organization relationship they afford. Based on this finding, I argue that studies of workplace control and resistance should examine the features of such arrays of discursive resources, that understandin...

Title: Neither Market nor Hierarchy nor Network: The Emergence of Bazaar Governance
Author-Name: Benoît Demil
Author-Name: Xavier Lecocq
Abstract: A growing body of literature describes the open source phenomenon in the software industry. Drawing on transaction cost economics, we propose that open source projects illustrate a new generic governance structure — which we label bazaar governance — based on a specific legal contract: the open licence. We characterize this structure in terms of its strengths and weaknesses and compare it to market, firm and network forms. Low levels of control and weak incentives intensity are distinctive features of bazaar, lending a high uncertainty to governed transactions. However, bazaar governance promotes the openness of open source communities, which can generate strong positive network externalities and subsequent efficiency in cumulative transactions. Our theoretical developments offer a potential basis for future research.

Title: Governmental Context Determines Institutional Value: Independently Certified                 Performance and Failure in the Spanish Newspaper Industry
Author-Name: Manuel Núñez-Nickel
Author-Name: Isabel Gutiérrez
Author-Name: Salvador Carmona
Abstract: Many societies demand that independent professionals (e.g. auditors) certify the performance of firms. The value placed on such certification (i.e. the public perception of reliability/unreliability that may impact on an organization's success/failure) is not uniform, however, but contingent upon changing political contexts. This study presents and analyses data on the entire population of newspapers in Spain from 1966 to 1993, a time of peaceful transition from military dictatorship to capitalist democracy. Our results highlight the contingent nature of institutional life, demonstrating how changes in political contexts are associated with varying understandings of institutions. In particular, our findings support the prediction that, under a dictatorship, independently certified performance is not instrumental in organizational success or failure whereas, in a modern democracy, the certification process has a positive effect on the survival chances of firms.

Title: New Organizational Forms, Human Resource Management and Structural                 Convergence? A Study of Japanese Organizations
Author-Name: Jonathan Morris
Author-Name: John Hassard
Author-Name: Leo McCann
Abstract: The prolonged, 10-year, economic downturn in Japan has had far-reaching implications for structure and human resource management (HRM) practices in Japanese organizations. In particular, the demise of hierarchical and group structures has been predicted, together with the end of distinctive HRM features such as lifetime employment and seniority-based pay. Using interview-based empirical data with a variety of Japanese organizations, this paper argues that such organizations are indeed moving towards flatter, less hierarchical structures. Moreover, there are marked shifts in HRM practices. In particular, the seniority-based pay system has been subject to reform. However, other practices have proved considerably more robust than the popular literature would suggest. For example, the lifetime employment system, although under significant pressure, remains largely intact. Indeed, we will argue that certain other key practices are being sacrificed to maintain job security.

Title: Beyond the Convergence–Divergence Debate: The Role of Spatial                 Scales in Transforming Organizational Logic
Author-Name: André Spicer
Abstract: Studies of organizational globalization typically assume that space is progressively ‘overcome’, resulting in the convergence of organizational logics, or that organizations continue to be embedded within the space of the nation state, resulting in divergent organizational logics. I argue that organizational logics are transformed as they move across space. Transformations in organizational logic are also underpinned by changes in space. I use the concept of spatial scale to theorize changes in space. I argue that spatial scales are multiple spatial levels that are produced through three interconnected processes: capital accumulation, regulation and articulation of discourse. Organizational logics are typically positioned on a number of spatial scales at once. The transformation of organizational logic is underpinned by processes of rescaling and resistance involving the political contestation of scale. I conclude by reflecting on what contributions the concept of scales makes to studies of the transforma...

Title: How Does Tacit Knowledge Proliferate? An Episode-Based Perspective
Author-Name: Michael A. D’Eredita
Author-Name: Charmaine Barreto
Abstract: Evidence has accrued that tacit knowledge is personal and ineffable as proposed by Polanyi (1958). Proponents of this view do not explain the mechanism responsible for the proliferation of tacit knowledge. This paper introduces a cognitive perspective to the process of tacit knowledge proliferation while maintaining that tacit knowledge is personal, ineffable and context-specific. Three propositions are discussed: tacit knowledge is episodic, thus personal, context-specific and acquired through experience; experience results from the construction or relating of episodes, but does not necessarily result in specifically ‘intended’ tacit knowledge; and the proliferation of tacit knowledge within an organization is the result of a constructive and collaborative process. The crux of this perspective has three assumptions: constructing and relating of tacit knowledge is episodic, constructing new episodes is obligatory upon attention, and relating to past episodes is obligatory upon attention.

Abstract: We revisit the original meaning of turbulence in the socioecological tradition of organization studies and outline a perspective on strategy making grounded in that tradition. This entails a contrast of the socioecological perspective with the more well-known neoclassical perspective on strategy, based on their core decision premises and their different understandings of environmental turbulence. We argue that while some mainstream strategy approaches have taken important strides toward addressing advanced turbulence, many others remain tethered to the neoclassical origins of the strategy discipline and are insufficiently responsive to the new landscape of strategy that now characterizes many industries. This new landscape is construed as the ‘hyper environment’, in which positive feedback processes and emergent field effects produce high volatility. We use two case illustrations from the US healthcare sector to examine how neoclassical and socioecological perspectives contribute to strategizing in hyper ...

Title: The Secret Life of Mundane Transaction Costs
Author-Name: Richard N. Langlois
Abstract: Transaction costs, one often hears, are ‘the economic equivalent of friction in physical systems’. Like physicists, economists can sometimes neglect friction in formulating theories; but like engineers, they can never neglect friction in studying how the system actually does — let alone should — work. Interestingly, however, the present-day economics of organization also ignores friction. That is, almost single-mindedly, the literature analyzes transactions from the point of view of misaligned incentives and (especially) transaction-specific assets. The costs involved are certainly costs of running the economic system in some sense, but they are not obviously ‘frictions’. Stories about frictions in trade are not nearly as intriguing as stories about guileful trading partners and expensive assets placed at risk. But I will argue that these seemingly dull categories of cost — what Baldwin and Clark call mundane transaction costs — actually have a secret life. They are at least as important as, and quite pro...

Abstract: The creation of markets for new products involves interplay between various field constituents. A major challenge in this process is to establish a sufficient level of legitimacy in order for a market to become accepted in the organization field. Yet, this process of market creation may be suppressed by established institutional arrangements that actively block the diffusion of innovations and constrain change. In this paper, we examine the roles of regulatory structures, professional associations and competitors in market suppression. We pay particular attention to the actions and circumstances preventing change in a mature sector of the economy, despite state policies directed at change. Active resistance from professional associations and corporate actors inhibited creation of a new market. We draw upon institutional theory to provide an account of the different communities of interest involved in an institutional field, exploring how they are developed and negotiated. We argue that the role of the gov...

Title: Switching Strategic Perspective: The Reframing of Accounts of Responsibility
Author-Name: John Sillince
Author-Name: Frank Mueller
Abstract: We provide an empirical study of the reframing of accounts of responsibility for strategy. We found that top management ambivalence about strategy provided a middle management team with wide scope for interpretation of responsibility for developing and implementing a strategic initiative. In the early stage, responsibility as well as expectations about the strategy’s successful outcome were ‘talked up’. In the later stage, when it was considered that the strategic initiative was failing, the middle management implementation team engaged in ‘talking down’ of expectations. We show that reframing from initial duty to capability to later accountability shaped and reflected actors’ changing goals. By focusing on responsibility we increase understanding of the division of labour in the actual practice of strategizing, including where and how strategizing is done. Most important, we show how protagonists’ goals drive the framing and reframing of strategic agendas, and how linguistic devices such as disclaimers a...

Abstract: Accounts of institutional change developed from structuration theory (Barley and Tolbert, 1997; Greenwood et al., 2002) are compared with an account developed from Foucauldian theory (Hasselbladh and Kallinikos, 2000). They are considered in the context of a project that was intended to pioneer a new, integrated approach to child and family support services in a deprived area in the North of England. It was undertaken at a time when the British government was pursuing an ambitious programme of reform across the public sector. The project challenged entrenched practices in the statutory agencies (social services, health, education and the police) and also those within independent, voluntary organizations providing services to children and families in the area. None of the theories of institutional change considered here anticipated the muddles, misunderstandings, false starts and loose ends that were a feature of the case. While both structuration theory and Foucauldian theory stress the significance of th...

Abstract: Understanding the effects of ownership upon organizational performance is a well-established theme in organization theory, but comparison across ownership forms has been neglected. We develop hypotheses comparing public corporations, private corporations and partnerships and test them in a sample of large management consultancies. We find that private corporations and partnerships outperform public corporations. We attribute this difference to increased monitoring by owners and greater motivation by professional workers seeking ownership stakes. Contrary to Durand and Vargas (2003), we find that organizational complexity has neither a direct nor a moderating effect.

Title: Introducing the Agents...
Author-Name: Sue Llewellyn
Abstract: This article aims to expand our understanding of what it is to be an agent within an organization. To do this, the views of both Archer and Giddens on the constitution of the agent are analysed. These expositions are used to differentially illuminate the specifics of an empirical case, where it is argued that a team of ten agents were crucial in taking forward a merger between two pharmaceutical companies (‘A’ and ‘ω’). A discussion compares the insights into how agents are constituted that arise from the conceptual frames offered by Archer and Giddens. The article concludes that the constitution of the organizational agent encompasses both agential positioning (vis-à-vis organizational resources) and agential powers (where these powers can be appropriated from the organization and incorporated by the agent).

Title: General Strategy Concepts and the Ecology of Strategy Discourses: A                 Systemic-Discursive Perspective
Author-Name: David Seidl
Abstract: Drawing on Wittgenstein, Lyotard and Luhmann the article develops a systemic-discursive perspective on the field of strategy and the respective role of general strategy concepts. The perspective suggests that the field of strategy should not be conceptualized as a unified field but rather as fragmented into a multitude of autonomous discourses. Owing to their autonomy, no transfer of strategy concepts across different discourses is possible. Instead, every single strategy discourse can merely construct its own discourse-specific concepts. Different discourses, however, draw on the same strategy labels, which leads to ‘productive misunderstandings’ (Teubner). On the basis of the particular perspective advanced here, the entire field of strategy is re-described as an ecology of strategy discourses.

Abstract: In this article we examine the process of organizational identity formation in emerging industries. We argue that organizational identity is best understood in terms of the relationship between temporal difference (i.e. the performance of a stable identity over time) and spatial difference (i.e. by locating organizational identity in relation to other firms, both similar and different). It is the relationship between these two forms of difference that enables the construction of a legitimate sense of organizational identity. Our discussion is illustrated using empirical material from a study of the emerging industry of business coaching in Australia.

Abstract: Although Schumpeter's theory on `creative destruction' and Kirzner's on `entrepreneurial discovery' dominate current entrepreneurship research in organization studies, one of the most fundamental debates in modern Austrian economics is that between Kirzner and Lachmann. Using Low and MacMillan's (1988) key specifications as a rubric, we introduce organizational entrepreneurship scholars to Lachmann's work, identify the direction in which his radical subjectivist approach would lead the field, and encourage exploring important questions from, and adopting methods consistent with, his provocative perspective. This unique disequilibrium perspective, which takes into account institutional contexts and multiple levels of analysis, offers new theoretical insight into how entrepreneurs create opportunities through expectations of an imagined future and exploit opportunities through continuous resource combination and recombination. Conceptualizing time as subjective and heterogeneous, it facilitates the examinat...

Title: Modelling the Firm in its Market and Organizational Environment:                 Methodologies for Studying Corporate Social Responsibility
Author-Name: Colin Crouch
Abstract: The study of corporate social responsibility (CSR) can best be mainstreamed within the wider social science literature if it is defined as firms voluntarily assuming responsibility for their externalities, thereby setting the puzzle of how this can be reconciled with the maximization of shareholder value as the central challenge of the subject. Means of resolving the puzzle require modelling the firm interacting with its environment as both a market actor and as an organization, and in particular through the interaction between these two. Such an approach has no need of a separate concept of ‘stakeholders’. The analysis develops through the firm's relations with actual and potential political action (raising the separate issue of corporate citizenship), and the tastes of consumers, investors and employees—the last raising interesting implications for principal–agent theory.

Abstract: This paper explores the complex processes of identity construction of female ethnic minority entrepreneurs. Informed by discursive approaches to identity, we make an intersectional analysis of five life stories of female entrepreneurs of Moroccan or Turkish origin in the Netherlands. Being female, Turkish or Moroccan, and entrepreneur at the same time requires various strategies to negotiate identities with different constituencies. These strategies of identity work vary in the degree of conformity: one type is to mainly adhere to conventional images of femininity, a second one is to denounce femininity and/or ethnicity situationally, and the third is to resist the masculine connotation of entrepreneurship by disconnecting it from masculinity. Our focus on this hitherto neglected group of entrepreneurs makes for a situated contribution to the deconstruction of the entrepreneurial archetype of the white male hero. It furthers the understanding of the micropolitics of identity construction in the workplace ...

Abstract: This paper investigates whether the expression of sexuality in organizations represents an opportunity for employee resistance or increased management control. It draws upon an empirical study of a high-commitment culture programme that encouraged both heterosexual and homosexual discourses. The study reveals a complex scenario in which sexuality is simultaneously a facet of control, a site of empowerment and an object of resistance. It is suggested that a multilevelled conceptualization of power and resistance is required in order to untangle the complex political implications of sexuality and re-eroticization at work.

Abstract: There has been increasing recognition of the importance of informal interactions in organizations, but research examining the effects of the physical environment on informal interaction has produced contradictory results and practical attempts to control the level of informal interaction by design have been marked by unintended consequences. Drawing on a qualitative study of informal interactions observed in photocopier rooms in three organizations, this paper builds on the work of ecological psychologist James Gibson to develop a theory of the affordances of informal interaction. The affordances of an environment are the possibilities for action called forth by it to a perceiving subject. Research on affordances has typically focused on the affordances of individual behavior. We introduce the notion of social affordances and identify the social and physical characteristics that produce the propinquity, privacy, and social designation necessary for an environment to afford informal interactions.

Title: Making Sense of Theory Construction: Metaphor and Disciplined Imagination
Author-Name: Joep P. Cornelissen
Abstract: This article draws upon Karl Weick’s insights into the nature of theorizing, and extends and refines his conception of theory construction as ‘disciplined imagination’. An essential ingredient in Weick’s ‘disciplined imagination’involves his assertion that thought trials and theoretical representations typically involve a transfer from one epistemic sphere to another through the creative use of metaphor. The article follows up on this point and draws out how metaphor works, how processes of metaphorical imagination partake in theory construction, and how insightful metaphors and the theoretical representations that result from them can be selected. The paper also includes a discussion of metaphors-in-use (organizational improvisation as jazz and organizational behaviour as collective mind) which Weick proposed in his own writings. The whole purpose of this exercise is to theoretically augment and ground the concept of ‘disciplined imagination’, and in particular to refine the nature of thought trials and ...

Title: Organizing is Both a Verb and a Noun: Weick Meets Whitehead
Author-Name: Tore Bakken
Author-Name: Tor Hernes
Abstract: Weick’s work on organizing and sensemaking has contributed significantly towards efforts in organization theory to explore organization as process. His discussion of the relationship between verbs and nouns in particular has served to highlight central dynamic features of processes. Weick’s conception of the verb-noun relationship is one of tension between levels of analysis. We propose, drawing upon the work of Alfred North Whitehead, to draw attention to the formation of nouns and how verbs shape nouns and vice versa. We argue that Weick’s work may be extended by looking more closely at the selection of verbs and nouns, i.e. by looking at how selection may be made on the basis of their relationality, thus allowing for their mutual transformation. We illustrate our point using the imagery provided by the ‘pseudopod’.

Author-Name: Paul W.L. Vlaar
Author-Name: Frans A.J. Van den Bosch
Author-Name: Henk W. Volberda
Abstract: Research into the management of interorganizational relationships has hitherto primarily focused on problems of coordination, control, and to a lesser extent, legitimacy. In this article, we assert that partners cooperating in such relationships are also confronted with ‘problems of understanding’. Such problems arise from differences between partners in terms of culture, experience, structure and industry, and from the uncertainty and ambiguity that participants in interorganizational relationships experience in early stages of collaboration. Building on Karl Weick’s theory of sensemaking, we advance that participants in interorganizational relationships use formalization as a means to make sense of their partners, the interorganizational relationships in which they are engaged and the contexts in which these are embedded so as to diminish problems of understanding. We offer a systematic overview of the mechanisms through which formalization facilitates sensemaking, including: (1) focusing participants’ ...

Title: Making Sense with Institutions: Context, Thought and Action in Karl                 Weick’s Theory
Author-Name: Klaus Weber
Author-Name: Mary Ann Glynn
Abstract: Karl Weick’s sensemaking perspective has proven to be a central influence on process theories of organizing. Yet, one persistent criticism levelled at his work has been a neglect of the role of larger social and historical contexts in sensemaking. We address this critique by showing how institutional context is a necessary part of sensemaking. We propose that there are salient but unexplored connections between the institutional and sensemaking perspectives. We explain how three specific mechanisms—priming, editing and triggering—bring institutional context into processes of sensemaking, beyond a more conventional notion of internalized cognitive constraint. Our contribution seeks to be forward-looking as much as reflective, addressing a critique of one of Karl Weick’s key theoretical contributions and offering amendments that extend its reach.

Title: A Golden Braid: Allport, Goffman, Weick
Author-Name: Barbara Czarniawska
Abstract: One of the central tenets of Karl Weick’s work and one of his original contributions to organization theory is his insistence that organizational scholars should study structures of events rather than people, objects, or pseudo-objects, important as they all are. Through the operation of sensemaking, events may be portrayed as meaningful actions or random occurrences, but it is the connections among them that are central to organizing. This paper connects Karl Weick’s work to that of Floyd H. Allport and Erving Goffman, two among several writers who inspired Weick. These three authors shared an interest in what Allport called structuring, Goffman called ordering, and Weick called organizing of the events and experiences of everyday life. This genealogical presentation of their work attempts to situate their thoughts within contemporary debates in social sciences, including those determined by the spirit of the times.

Title: How Can We Know What We Think Until We See What We Said?: A Citation and                 Citation Context Analysis of Karl Weick’s The Social Psychology of Organizing
Author-Name: Marc H. Anderson
Abstract: A substantial portion of Karl Weick’s influence on organization studies is based upon his classic book The Social Psychology of Organizing (abbreviated as Organizing). A citation analysis shows the magnitude of this influence compared to five other organization studies classics, and reveals that Organizing continues to be highly cited. A citation context analysis (i.e. content analysis) of all citations to Weick (1979) in three top organization studies journals (Academy of Management Review, Administrative Science Quarterly, and Organization Studies) shows that 12 concepts account for 67.6% of citations to Organizing, but that the book is cited for a remarkable diversity of additional content as well. Furthermore, a consideration of differences between the concepts cited in the US journals versus Organization Studies reveals several regional differences. Finally, very few citations are critical of Organizing or involve empirical tests. These results hold a variety of implications for future research.

Title: Karl Weick and the Aesthetics of Contingency
Author-Name: Eric M. Eisenberg
Abstract: In this essay, I reflect on Karl Weick’s best-known texts as a means of tracing his influence on the field of organizational communication. From this perspective, his main contributions are: (1) recognizing the centrality of language and interaction in the social construction of organizational realities; and (2) focusing squarely on communicative praxis as a site for improving our understanding of cognition and culture. Beyond these substantive contributions, an ‘aesthetics of contingency’ pervades Weick’s writings. I maintain that this perspective presents a much needed alternative to seeking meaning and stability through the pursuit of various fundamentalisms.

Title: Talking About Machines, Thick Description, and Knowledge Work
Author-Name: Beth A. Bechky
Abstract: In the decade since the publication of Julian Orr’s Talking About Machines: An Ethnography of a Modern Job, the field of organization studies has yet to develop a rich and complete picture of the world of knowledge workers. In this essay, I argue that organization theory would benefit if scholars followed Orr’s lead and devoted increased ethnographic attention to knowledge and technical work. Thick descriptions of the situated work practices of knowledge workers would help us understand the complex relationship of work, occupations, and organizations. In particular, I suggest further investigation of the intersection of occupational communities within organizations, as well as additional empirical studies of networks of practice that extend beyond organizational boundaries.

Title: Studying Practice: Situating Talking About Machines
Author-Name: Alessia Contu
Author-Name: Hugh Willmott
Abstract: Julian Orr’s Talking About Machines (TAM) is celebrated for communicating something of the richness and complexity of work practices. Our endeavour is to connect the current wave of interest in practice with Orr’s focal attentiveness to the practices of photocopier-repair technicians. More specifically, we revisit how, in TAM, a careful examination of work practice is commended by Orr as a way of ‘deepen[ing] our under-standings’—for example, about ‘the relations of employment and the role of work in the constitution of workers’ identity’. This central theme of TAM, we contend, provides illuminating insights into, and poses interesting questions for students of, the politics of work organization. The novelty of our reading of TAM stems from a mobilization of some Marxist and Lacanian ideas, as developed in theorizations of hegemony, that enable us to problematize both the self-identification of the technicians as heroic, and the distancing of their practices from the corporation’s bureaucratic prescriptio...

Title: What Talking About Machines Tells Us
Author-Name: Paul Duguid
Abstract: Orr’s work falls on one side of a marked divide separating rule-based theories from practice-focused research. From within the tradition of workplace studies (which show themselves intermittently susceptible to rule-based assumptions), Orr argues that his pre-decessors failed to see the sort of improvisation and bricolage central to his analysis, for want of looking. I claim, by contrast, that it was more for want of seeing. Early work-place studies could barely conceive of workplace autonomy or improvisation as anything but counterproductive. By attacking the theoretical demarcation between mental and manual labour implicit in this presupposition, Orr’s analysis presents both management and theorists with the surprisingly uncomfortable challenge of the knowledgeable worker. A brief analysis of the EUREKA project’s support of workplace learning suggests how Orr’s work challenged and still challenges more complacent views of knowledge in organization and ‘knowledge management’.

Title: From Well-Bounded Ethnographies to Intervening in Mycorrhizae Activities
Author-Name: Yrjö Engeström
Abstract: Julian Orr’s book is a carefully crafted ethnography of a well-bounded and stable occupational community obsessed with control and largely dependent on stories as mediating epistemic tools. Today’s world of work is going through, or at least making possible, some major transformations: from control to swarming, from bounded occupational communities to mycorrhizae-like formations, from latent dilemmas to dynamic contradictions, and from singular epistemic tools, such as stories, to multilevel instrumentalities. The emerging landscapes of work call for radically revised methodologies of research that carry out interventions to find developmental potentials in the contradictions of work in capitalism.

Author-Name: Dvora Yanow
Abstract: Julian Orr’s ethnographic study of copier technicians explores three themes—practices, practitioners, and learning—gathered under the heading of ‘work’ and situated in geographic spaces—the team’s territory—and places. In my reading, the book addresses three central concerns in organizational studies today: moves to (re-)ground theorizing in work practices, drawing on methods suitable for studying what it is that people in organizations actually do; developing practice-based understandings of organizational learning; and attending to the settings—the places and spaces—in which those practices take place.

Title: On Organizations as they Happen
Author-Name: Theodore R. Schatzki
Abstract: The essay examines what organizations are as they happen. It first argues that the happening of an organization has two basic components: the performance of its constituent actions and practices and the occurrence of events whereby its material arrangements causally support these activities. Equating the idea of something as it happens with that of something in real time, the essay then examines two kinds of real time in which organizations occur. The first is the unfoldings of the performances and events that are the happening of the organization. The second is the co-occurrences of the teleological past, present, and future in organizational actions. As it happens, however, an organization is more than what there is to it in real time. It also embraces the persisting structures of its practices and its enduring material arrangements, both of which, among other things, institute possible real times for the organization. The essay argues that the perpetuation of practice structure should be understood as ...

Both sets of tensions play crucial roles in my formulations of organizational change and transformation and in the insider/outsider joint research methodology I have helped to develop. These dualities and tensions were once reconciled in a Christmas gift whose ramifications have unfolded throughout my scholarly career.

Abstract: In an attempt to display the power of his meta-theoretical framework to fill in key gaps in ‘the practice turn in strategy research’, Whittington (2006) drew upon our previously published case study account of a failed strategy process workshop (Hodgkinson and Wright 2002), arguing that as strategy practitioners we were inept in our praxis, seeking to apply practices that were ill-suited to the organizational context in which we were operating. In response, we demonstrate that his analysis is based on a series of misconceptions and unwarranted inferences. Providing additional background information, we clarify our involvement and reinforce our original interpretation of the case.

Title: Bicycling on the Moon: Collective Tacit Knowledge and Somatic-limit Tacit Knowledge
Author-Name: Harry Collins
Abstract: The idea of tacit knowledge plays an important role in many areas of academic debate, not least automation and its role in management. Here it is shown that tacit knowledge comes in two distinct types, with different causes and consequences. The first kind, ‘somatic-limit tacit knowledge’, has to do with the limitations of the human body and brain and has no consequences for encoding knowledge into machines. The second kind, ‘collective tacit knowledge’, is more ‘ontological’ than biological, having to do with its location in the social collectivity. Here the human body and brain’s unique capacity gives it special access to the tacit knowledge; known and foreseeable machines do not have this capacity.

Title: Original and Derived Judgment: An Entrepreneurial Theory of Economic Organization
Author-Name: Kirsten Foss
Author-Name: Nicolai J. Foss
Author-Name: Peter G. Klein
Abstract: Recent work links entrepreneurship to the economic theory of the firm, using the concept of entrepreneurship as judgment introduced by Frank Knight. When judgment is complementary to other assets, it makes sense for entrepreneurs to hire labour and to own assets. The entrepreneur's role, then, is to arrange or organize the human and capital assets under his or her control. We extend this Knightian concept of the firm by developing a theory of delegation under Knightian uncetainty. What we call original judgment belongs exclusively to owners, but owners may delegate a wide range of decision rights to subordinates, who exercise derived judgment. We call these employees `proxy-entrepreneurs', and ask how the firm's organizational structure — its formal and informal systems of rewards and punishments, rules for settling disputes and renegotiating agreements, means of evaluating performance and so on — can be designed to encourage forms of proxy entrepreneurship that increase firm value while discouraging acti...

Title: Reading Dewey: Reflections on the Study of Routine
Author-Name: Michael D. Cohen
Abstract: Early twentieth-century American pragmatists such as John Dewey placed a strong emphasis on the human faculties of habit and emotion. That contrasts with the emphasis in recent decades on cognitive processes. In contemporary organizational research there has been an increasing interest in recurring action patterns, such as routines and practices. The conceptual difficulties this work has encountered are usefully illuminated by Dewey's view of the primacy of habit and its interplay with emotion and cognition.

Author-Name: André Spicer
Author-Name: Steffen Böhm
Abstract: How do groups resist the apparently all-encompassing discourse of management? Rejecting current theories of resistance as `re-appropriation' or `micro-politics', we argue that resistance may be thought of as a hegemonic struggle undertaken by social movements. We identify four major resistance movements that engage with management: unions, organizational misbehaviour, civic movements and civic movement organizations. We argue that these forms of resistance differ in terms of location (civil society or workplace) and strategy (political or infra-political). We chart out the possible interconnections between these different modes of resistance and detail how these interconnections are established. By doing this, the paper provides a framework for understanding the many forms of resistance movements that seek to disrupt the hegemonic discourse of management.

Abstract: In this study, we examine the process of interfirm knowledge transfer in R&D relationships. Based upon an embedded case study, we develop a model for understanding the initiation and evolution of interfirm knowledge transfer. Complementing previous cross-sectional research, this model points to the importance of legal clauses as a formal design alternative to equity governance structures, expectations of a long-term relationship as a specific indicator of trust, and similarity of technological equipment as an important facilitator for acquisition and assimilation of knowledge. This model also indicates that interfirm knowledge transfer is likely to continue in R&D relationships as long as perceived market threats remain limited and perceived technological complementarities remain extensive. In addition, we point to two strategies to organize an R&D relationship such that continuation of interfirm knowledge transfer is more likely to occur.

Author-Name: Geoffrey M. Hodgson
Abstract: The conceptualization of the relation between individual and structure is central to social science. After making some key definitions, this paper overviews some recent developments in the social theory of structure and agency, and makes a novel addition, based on a concept of habit derived from pragmatism and Veblenian institutional economics. Processes of habituation provide a mechanism of ‘reconstitutive downward causation’ where institutional circumstances may affect individual preferences. Finally, special characteristics of organizations are discussed, endorsing an evolutionary analytical approach that combines insights from both evolutionary economics and organization science.

Author-Name: Frans A. J. Van Den Bosch
Author-Name: Henk W. Volberda
Abstract: Many product innovation studies have described key determinants that should lead to successful incremental product innovation. Despite numerous studies suggesting how incremental product innovation should be successfully undertaken, many firms still struggle with this type of innovation. In this paper, we use an institutional perspective to investigate why established firms in the financial services industry struggle with their complex incremental product innovation efforts. We argue that although the impact of micro institutional forces is often overlooked in innovation studies, these forces matter for innovation success. Our study complements the existing innovation literature and provides an additional explanation why incremental product innovation is highly complex and suffers from several liabilities in established firms. Using qualitative data from the Dutch financial services sector collected over the period 1997—2002, the paper illustrates how micro institutional forces at the business unit level ...

Title: Knowing Bodies at Work: Embodiment and Ephemeral Teamwork in Anaesthesia
Author-Name: Jon Hindmarsh
Author-Name: Alison Pilnick
Abstract: In spite of a growing corpus of studies concerned with the body and its relationships to organizing and organization, there is a distinct lack of empirical work to take seriously the nature of `embodiment' in the workplace. This paper presents a video-based study of teamwork in preoperative anaesthesia in order to propose an approach to analysing the body that focuses on organizational members' practical orientations to the body, and in particular dynamic bodies, in the workplace. To demonstrate the value of this approach, the paper considers coordination work among anaesthetic teams and highlights the importance of intercorporeal knowing in the real-time coordination of a team's work. The analytic orientation is drawn from ethnomethodology and conversation analysis.

Title: The Institutionalization of Knowledge in an Automotive Factory: Templates, Inscriptions, and the Problem of Durability
Author-Name: Giovan Francesco Lanzara
Author-Name: Gerardo Patriotta
Abstract: This paper focuses on the process of institutionalization of technical and organizational knowledge in the work setting. Drawing on a rich qualitative study, we apply an inscription—delegation model to the analysis of knowledge dynamics in a greenfield automotive plant. In particular, we depict knowledge institutionalization as a recursive process that involves the progressive writing, enactment and reproduction of a generative template or code within a stable medium. We first reconstruct the chain of transformations by which agency and knowledge are embedded into a variety of technical and organizational artifacts, leading to the creation of a cognitive and institutional order. We then focus on the frictions and tensions that can emerge in the transformations, and we discuss problems of vulnerability and durability that may arise in the maintenance and reproduction of such order.

Title: Towards a Dynamic Resource-based View: Insights from Austrian Capital and Entrepreneurship Theory
Author-Name: Nicolai J. Foss
Author-Name: Ibuki Ishikawa
Abstract: Over the last two decades, the resource-based view (RBV) has become dominant in the strategic management field. It has often been observed that the RBV is lacking in the dynamic dimension. For example, processes of building competitive advantages by means of combining existing complementary resources in novel ways are not inquired into. We argue that the RBV may profitably draw on insights in entrepreneurship and capital theory, drawn from Austrian economists as well as Frank Knight, in order to strengthen its dynamic dimension. We link the RBV and Austrian ideas in the context of the theory of complex systems pioneered by Herbert Simon. We draw a number of implications for strategic management from this synthesis, notably into resource value and sustainability of competitive advantage.

Title: The Reconstructed Professional Firm: Explaining Change in English Legal Practices
Author-Name: Stephen Ackroyd
Author-Name: Daniel Muzio
Abstract: The paper provides a structural analysis of change in the English and Welsh legal profession over the last 25 years, using concepts drawn from Weberian sociology of the professions and more recent theory connecting agency and structure. Through a consideration of data returned to the Law Society, and other data, this paper outlines changes in the internal division of labour in English law firms. It is argued that, in response to external threats, especially the growth in the numbers of qualified recruits, the elite of the profession has reworked professional closure. From controlling access to training places (i.e. labour market closure), legal firms have shifted towards controlling conditions of work and promotion (identified as internal organizational closure). This has produced recognizable effects: it has sustained the remuneration and status of the professional elite of partners, but has also allowed the assimilation of large numbers of recruits to the profession, and the expansion in the size of leg...

Title: Explaining Variations in Co-worker Assistance in Organizations
Author-Name: Stephen J. Frenkel
Author-Name: Karin Sanders
Abstract: In an age of flattened hierarchies and networked organizations, lateral processes in organizations take on added significance. Co-worker assistance refers to a key aspect of lateral relations: workers' helping behaviour in relation to their immediate colleagues. Using data from a Dutch survey of public sector and related service employees, we develop and test a model of co-worker assistance. We argue that reciprocity facilitates management-induced co-worker assistance and that this depends on the extent of workers' organizational commitment. This in turn is influenced by the manner in which management exercises control over employees. We find evidence for organizational commitment acting as a partial mediator between co-worker assistance and bureaucratic control, co-worker control, and facilitative supervision respectively. Group cohesion, forged by workers independent of management, has a strong direct effect on co-worker assistance and a particularly strong effect when interacting with co-worker control...

Title: Formal Strategic Analyses and Organizational Performance: Decomposing the Rational Model
Author-Name: George C. Mueller

Abstract: Although a substantial body of literature suggests a positive relationship between decision process rationality and organizational performance, there is also compelling evidence that this relationship is negative. We argue that these equivocal findings may be due, in part, to a lack of construct specificity and different methodologies employed to assess decision process rationality. Drawing from Langley's (1989) framework of decision process rationality, we examined the effects of formal analysis for purposes of information, persuasion and communication, control and direction, and symbolism, considering also their effects in the context of environmental dynamism. Using survey data from top management teams in 42 organizations, we found that in both high and low dynamism environments, the instrumental use of information in decision processes was positively linked with organizational performance. In dynamic environments, while analyses for symbolic and control purposes were positively associated with perfor...

Title: Politics and the Evolution of Inter-firm Networks: A Post-Communist Lesson
Author-Name: Gerald A. McDermott
Abstract: This article attempts to account for both continuity and change in network structures and relationships by analyzing how a country's political approach to institution building shapes the reproduction of industrial networks. While firm-level actors may develop tenacious socio-economic relationships, the authority structure of a network emerges from the ways certain constituent firms align themselves with public institutions. I empirically examine this approach by analyzing the evolution of Czech industrial networks during and after communism. The fragility, eventual stability, and subsequent changes in networks come not from purely `intra-network' factors, but rather from the political approaches of the government toward institution building. In short, this article aims to renew our focus on the origin and evolution of social capital and networks by enjoining network analysis with recent work in political economy.

Title: On the Multi-modality, Materially and Contingency of Organization Discourse
Author-Name: Rick Iedema
Abstract: This essay considers the ways that organizational discourse studies have deployed the concept `discourse'. A review of the literature reveals conceptual ambiguities in the definition of `discourse', as well as pre-analytical distinctions that are imposed between discourse, action and text, and between discourse, beliefs and material practices. The paper suggests that such a priori analytical categories risk tying the researcher to an inflexible research agenda, ruling out engaging with organizational specifics and emergent aspects of practice. The essay argues for an alternative view of discourse that centres on the following three arguments: discourse is not limited to language but also includes image, design, technology and other modes of meaning making; discourse and materiality co-emerge; and discourse manifests a specific, historically situated form of life.

Title: A Rhetoric-in-Context Approach to Building Commitment to Multiple Strategic Goals
Author-Name: Paula Jarzabkowski
Author-Name: John Sillince
Abstract: There are still few explanations of the micro-level practices by which top managers influence employee commitment to multiple strategic goals. This paper argues that, through their language, top managers can construct a context for commitment to multiple strategic goals. We therefore propose a rhetoric-in-context approach to illuminate some of the micro practices through which top managers influence employee commitment. Based upon an empirical study of the rhetorical practices through which top managers influence academic commitment to multiple strategic goals in university contexts, we demonstrate relationships between rhetoric and context. Specifically, we show that rhetorical influences over commitment to multiple goals are associated with the historical context for multiple goals, the degree to which top managers' rhetoric instantiates a change in that context, and the internal consistency of the rhetorical practices used by top managers.

Title: Product Strategies and Survival in Schumpeterian Environments: Evidence from the US Security Software Industry

Abstract: This paper seeks to explore the drivers of survival in environments characterized by high rates of entry and exit, fragmented market shares, rapid pace of product innovation and proliferation of young ventures. The paper aims to underscore the role played by post-entry product strategies, along with their interaction, after carefully controlling for `at entry' factors and demographic conditions. Based on a population of 270 firms that entered the US security software industry between 1989 and 1998, we find evidence that surviving entities are those that are more aggressive in the adoption of versioning and portfolio broadening strategies. In particular, focusing on any one of these two strategies leads to a higher probability of survival as opposed to adopting a mixed strategy.

Title: Person-In-Community: Whiteheadian Insights into Community and Institution
Author-Name: John B. Cobb
Abstract: The philosophy of Alfred North Whitehead differs from most of those that have been influential in the West in its emphasis on process and on internal relations instead of substances and their external relations. For human beings this supports a model of person-in-community instead of the widely influential and highly individualistic and substantialist model of Homo economicus. Communities are societies that are held together by internal relations. The importance of community is widely recognized in organizational studies, but most business decisions are informed chiefly by the substantialist thinking expressed in Homo economicus. To endure and prosper, communities need institutional structures, but these should serve community.

Title: The Study of Organizations and Organizing Since 1945
Author-Name: James G. March
Abstract: The history of organization studies is embedded in its times and the ways those times affect different regions differently. In particular, significant features of the field were molded by the moods and prejudices associated with academia after three critical events in 20th-century history: (1) the Second World War, (2) the social and political protest movements of the late 1960s and early 1970s, (3) the collapse of the Soviet Empire and the triumph of markets. Speculating about the unfolding of the events of the future that will have similar impacts is discouraged by an awareness that neither their timing nor the severity of their impacts can be specified with any precision. In any event, our task is not to join any particular wave of the future, but to make small pieces of scholarship beautiful.

Title: The Constitution of Organizational Legitimacy: A Narrative Perspective
Author-Name: Benjamin D. Golant
Author-Name: John A.A. Sillince
Abstract: This article recognizes a major dichotomy in the study of legitimacy construction at the organizational level. Scholars have either focused on agent-centred explanations of organizational legitimation, which favour its evaluative dimension, or on structural explanations, which highlight the isomorphic pressures imposed on individual organizations in order to become and remain intelligible to stakeholders. By applying a discursive methodology, we propose a new approach for the study of organizational legitimacy construction that incorporates both its evaluative and cognitive dimensions. Drawing on a structurational model of narrative recursivity, inspired by Greimas (1987), we argue that the construction of organizational legitimacy is dependent on both the persuasiveness of organizational storytelling and on the realization of a taken-for-granted narrative structure. We explicate the processes by which legitimacy is narratively constructed through empirical data associated with the founding of an HIV/AIDS...

Abstract: Our study builds on extant theory on embeddedness by concentrating on the process of preservation and dissolution of the target firm's embedded ties in acquisitions. We identify four critical areas (communication, idiosyncratic investments, interpersonal relations and personnel turnover) where managerial decisions taken during the acquisition process affect the components of the target firm's embedded ties — trust, joint problem-solving, conflict resolution and exchange of fine-grained information. The preservation or dissolution of an embedded tie depends ultimately on two specific tie contingencies, the balance of power between the target firm and the embedded relation and interpretive processes at the interface between the two. Our findings have implications for the study of the dissolution of market ties by pointing to different roles played by social and institutional forces, power asymmetries and competition in the dynamics of embedded ties. Finally, we encourage theory development in acquisition st...

Abstract: Strategic change is one of the most critical decisions that organizations make. We focus on the role of groups at the upper echelon of hierarchies and propose that concentrated power either in the CEO or the top management team is prone to be exercised, leading to a high rate of strategic change. We derive hypotheses on how formal and informal power concentration in top management teams have an effect on changes in corporate diversification. The findings suggest that power concentration strongly affects decision making.

Title: Multiplicity, Virtuality and Organization: The Contribution of Gilles Deleuze

Abstract: Formal organization is often seen as opposed or resistant to change, in theory as well as in practice. Drawing primarily on the philosophy of Gilles Deleuze we argue that the reverse is true — that organization is itself a dynamic quality and that change and organization are imbricated in each other. We expand several key concepts of this philosophy in relation to organization (the multiplicity of order and the multiplicity of organization, strata and meshworks, virtuality and multitude) all of which draw attention to the unstable but ever-present forces that subvert and disrupt, escape, exceed and change organization. This enables an understanding of organization as creatively autosubversive — not fixed, but in motion, never resting and constantly trembling.

Title: The Role of Finance and Corporate Governance in National Systems of Innovation
Author-Name: Andrew Tylecote
Abstract: Firms are central actors in innovation, and their actions are much affected by their corporate governance and the finance available. Thus a country's finance and corporate governance system is a key element of its national system of innovation. The technological regimes of sectors (and sub-sectors) vary in ways that affect the demands innovation makes on the financial and corporate governance system. Finance and corporate governance systems (FCGSs) vary among countries in their ability to meet these demands. By setting three dimensions of regime variation alongside the three corresponding dimensions of FCGS variation, patterns of relative and absolute technological advantage among economies can be largely explained — particularly when the focus is on nationality of firm rather than location of activity.

Abstract: This paper investigates when and how online practices (i.e. practices of management and use of web-based Information Technology) impact offline practices (i.e. regular work practices and communication patterns) within a bureaucratic environment. A case study of implementation and use of a Knowledge Management System by members of a network of practice within the bureaucratic environment of a public administration is interpreted through a situated learning perspective. This lens helps us to understand the process of emergence of continuity between online and offline practices. Findings indicate that the constructed continuity within the network of practice emerged from a combination of structural changes in the environment and of the involvement of key actors who actively encouraged others to integrate their online practices into their regular activities. The paper helps us to understand the processes of construction of continuity of online and offline practices and the bounded impacts of this continuity w...

Title: Backstage with the Knowledge Boys and Girls: Goffman and Distributed Agency in an Organic Online Community
Author-Name: Drew A.R. Ross
Abstract: An institutionally independent organic online learning community (OOLC) founded and populated by London cabbies-in-training, more commonly known to the world and to themselves as `Knowledge Boys and Girls', is described here. Qualitative discourse analysis of message board transcripts and interviews with members was undertaken in an effort to elucidate benefits that accrue to OOLC members. Goffman's theory of region behaviour is enlisted to explain why frank, collegial and sometimes confessional interactions with peers might take place in such an online venue. This article suggests that through such candid interactions among peers, learners create a back-region that allows participants to compare themselves with one another, cultivate friendships and practise for high-stakes assessments. OOLC members take advantage of the pseudonymity provided by their electronic social space to engage in behaviours that, if they occurred in a front-region, might invite damage to a learner's reputation as a pre-service ca...

Title: Contributing to Public Document Repositories: A Critical Mass Theory Perspective

Abstract: Public document repositories (PDRs) are valuable resources available on the Internet and are a component of the broader information commons freely accessible to the public. Instances of PDRs include the repository of reviews at Amazon.com and the online encyclopedia at Wikipedia. These repositories are created and sustained by the voluntary contributions of individuals who are not compensated for their inputs. This paper draws on and extends critical mass theory in the context of PDRs. Using data on the reviews written by prolific reviewers at Amazon.com and the text of their personal profiles, we find the critical mass of contributors at the PDR not only to be prolific and contributing high-quality reviews, but also to be among the earliest contributors of reviews on products. Reviewer profiles revealed the presence of multiple self-oriented motives (self expression, personal development, utilitarian motives, and enjoyment) and other-oriented motives (social affiliation, altruism, and reciprocity) for co...

Abstract: Firm-hosted commercial online communities, in which customers interact to solve each other's service problems, represent a fascinating context to study the motivations of collective action in the form of knowledge contribution to the community. We extend a model of social capital based on Wasko and Faraj (2005) to incorporate and contrast the direct impact of commitment to both the online community and the host firm, as well as reciprocity, on quality and quantity of knowledge contribution. In addition, we examine the moderating influence of three individual attributes that are particularly relevant to the firm-hosted community context: perceived informational value, sportsmanship, and online interaction propensity. We empirically test our framework using self-reported and objective data from 203 members of a firm-hosted technical support community. In addition to several interesting moderating effects, we find that a customer's online interaction propensity, commitment to the community, and the informati...

Title: Applying Common Identity and Bond Theory to Design of Online Communities
Author-Name:  Yuqing Ren
Author-Name: Robert Kraut

Abstract: Online communities depend upon the commitment and voluntary participation of their members. Community design — site navigation, community structure and features, and organizational policies — is critical in this regard. Community design affects how people can interact, the information they receive about one another and the community, and how they can participate in community activities. We argue that the constraints and opportunities inherent in online community design influence how people become attached to the community and whether they are willing to expend effort on its behalf. We examine two theories of group attachment and link these theories with design decisions for online communities. Common identity theory makes predictions about the causes and consequences of people's attachment to the group as a whole. Common bond theory makes predictions about the causes and consequences of people's attachment to individual group members. We review causes of common identity and common bond, and show how they ...

Title: Poweract and Organizational Work: Gérard Mendel's Socio-psychoanalysis
Author-Name: Gilles Arnaud
Abstract: One of the principal merits of Gérard Mendel's socio-psychoanalysis lies in the fact that it strives to understand how organizational reality influences individual psychic reality, including in its unconscious dimension. A collective practice, it aims to study how actors, in the framework of their daily professional activity, and organized into specific groups (homogeneous in terms of profession), reflect by themselves on the forces that impact their personality. The working hypothesis of socio-psychoanalysis is that the hold of organizations on individuals is such that the latter have very little power over their acts of work; whence the negative psychological effects with their harmful socio-economic consequences. For Mendel, it seems necessary to intervene right from the beginning of the socio-psychoanalytic process in the dimension of the organization of work. The intervention methodology adopted is that of an institutional system whose function is to counter, as much as possible, the pathogenic effec...

Title: A Fresh Look at How Professions Take Shape: Dual-directed Networking Dynamics and Social Boundaries
Author-Name: Kathleen Montgomery
Author-Name: Amalya L. Oliver
Abstract: Understanding boundary-spanning activities such as interorganizational alliances and professional/organizational integration requires clarity about what boundaries are being spanned and how they were constructed. We approach this goal by drawing on social identity theory and institutional theory to develop a process model, whereby inward- and outward-directed networking activities combine to build the social boundaries marking exclusive membership and proprietary domain. Four stages in the process are demonstrated, using two longitudinal case studies of emerging professions: the Jewish legal profession in Israel and physician executives in the USA. Despite the cases' contextual differences, analysis of networking activities supports propositions based on the model.

Title: Organizing at and Beyond the Limits
Author-Name: Moshe Farjoun
Author-Name: William H. Starbuck
Abstract: Surprises occur when organizations try to exceed the limits of their capabilities. The surprises include both serious accidents and remarkable discoveries. The idea that organizations have limits sheds light on a systemic source of organizational accidents and an important and increasingly prevalent aspect of organizational life. This article discusses various organizational limits and why they exist, it reviews factors that lead organizations to exceed their limits either intentionally or inadvertently, and it points out several reasons why limit violations may be growing more prevalent. Although some organizational limits arise from fundamental characteristics of people or technological systems, nearly all organizational limits result from rather arbitrary decisions about capacities, systems, and structures. In particular, limit violations often stem from uncertain and unintentional exploration. After examining potential consequences and symptoms of limit violation, the article proposes several reasons ...

Title: Understanding Governance: Ten Years On
Author-Name: R.A.W. Rhodes
Abstract: The paper reassesses the argument in Understanding Governance (1997). The first section summarizes where we are now in the study of governance, reviewing briefly the key concepts of policy networks, governance, core executive, hollowing out the state and the differentiated polity. The second section engages with my critics with the aim of opening new directions of research. I concentrate on the key issues of: the context of policy networks, explaining change and the role of ideas, the decline of the state, rescuing the core executive, and steering networks. Under each heading, I sketch a decentred answer to the question of where we go from here. I argue the analysis of governance should focus on beliefs, practices, traditions and dilemmas.

Title: Organs of Process: Rethinking Human Organization
Author-Name: Robert Cooper
Abstract: Human organization is discussed as a social body or collection of organs and senses that create and re-create the forms and objects that constitute the human world. Organs represent process as the continuous making and remaking of passages between the body and its environment. Organs express a pre-human, impersonal force that transmits itself through the human body and its products in a generic act of making as opposed to the making of specific forms and objects. Process is discussed as the ceaseless work of alternation between the making of presence and the unmaking of absence. The work of process is illustrated through the work of three examples of human organization: the supermarket, the art gallery and the Church.

Title: Ownership Traits and Downsizing Behaviour: Evidence for the Largest Spanish Firms, 1990—1998
Author-Name: José D. Vicente-Lorente
Author-Name: Isabel Suárez-González
Abstract: This paper explores and tests the differences in downsizing behaviour depending upon three ownership-based traits of the largest Spanish companies: stock versus privately held corporations, foreign versus domestic firms and state-owned versus private companies. From a theoretical standpoint, we develop an explanatory model of downsizing that accounts for techno-economic, institutional, and socio-cognitive explanations which serves as a conceptual basis for generating hypotheses on the role of ownership in downsizing decisions. Probit estimates using a sample of large Spanish firms (1990—1998) confirm that stock corporations and state-owned firms engaged in a privatization process are more likely to downsize than privately held domestic companies. We found less conclusive results about the downsizing behaviour of foreign firms. Finally, our findings corroborate the relevance of organizational decline and institutional factors for predicting the downsizing event.

Title: Reform without a Theory: Why Does it Work in China?
Author-Name: Zhichang Zhu
Abstract: The gradualism—radicalism debate on China's reform is misleading. The reform can alternatively be seen as one without a theory. The question is why a no-theory `strategy' was `selected' by the Chinese elite, `accepted' by the Chinese people and `worked' in the Chinese context. An investigation based on a Confucian conceptual framework suggests that reform-without-a-theory was facilitated by a set of historically specific structural factors, factors full of complementarities and tensions that skilled actors were able to exploit to pursue sectional interests. The implications of China's reform for organization studies are explored along three interrelated lines: structural plurality and strategic change, structural transformation and differential agency, and situated entrepreneurship and unintended consequences.

Title: Towards a Dialectic Perspective on Formalization in Interorganizational Relationships: How Alliance Managers Capitalize on the Duality Inherent in Contracts, Rules and Procedures
Author-Name: Paul W. L. Vlaar
Author-Name: Frans A. J. Van Den Bosch
Author-Name: Henk W. Volberda
Abstract: The mainstream literature on contracts, rules and procedures presumes that formalization is directed at coordination and control, and that its influence on performance is contingent upon firm, transaction and contextual characteristics. In response to recent calls for inquiries into dialectics in interorganizational relationships, and in an effort to provide managerial choice with a more prominent position in research on formalization, a complementary perspective is here being developed. We propose a framework in which formalization is presented as a duality, involving trade-offs between its functions and dysfunctions, and eventuating in dialectic tensions with which managers have to cope. In line with this, we argue that researchers should not only be preoccupied with assessing the `rightness' of governance solutions, but also with the trade-offs and tensions associated with them. Our framework is illustrated by a case study of an alliance between a major European financial services firm and one of the w...

Title: Beyond Words: Aesthetic Knowledge and Knowing in Organizations
Author-Name: Boris Ewenstein
Author-Name: Jennifer Whyte
Abstract: Aesthetic knowledge comes from practitioners understanding the look, feel, smell, taste and sound of things. It is vital to work in many organizational contexts. In this paper, we explore aesthetic knowledge and knowing in organizations through detailed observation of design work in the architectural practice Edward Cullinan Architects. Through our research, we explore aesthetic knowledge in the context of architectural work, we unpack what it is, how it is generated, and how it is applied in design projects, shared between practitioners and developed at the level of the organization. Our analysis suggests that aesthetic knowledge plays an important part in organizational practice, not only as the symbolic context for work, but as an integral part of the work that people do. It suggests that aesthetic reflexivity, which involves an opening up and questioning of what is known, is experienced as part of practice as well as a `time out' from practice.

Title: The Institutional Entrepreneur as Modern Prince: The Strategic Face of Power in Contested Fields
Author-Name: David Levy
Author-Name: Maureen Scully
Abstract: This paper develops a theoretical framework that situates institutional entrepreneurship by drawing from Gramsci's concept of hegemony to understand the contingent stabilization of organizational fields, and by employing his discussion of the Modern Prince as the collective agent who organizes and strategizes counter-hegemonic challenges. Our framework makes three contributions. First, we characterize the interlaced material, discursive, and organizational dimensions of field structure. Second, we argue that strategy must be examined more rigorously as the mode of action by which institutional entrepreneurs engage with field structures. Third, we argue that institutional entrepreneurship, in challenging the position of incumbent actors and stable fields, reveals a `strategic face of power', particularly useful for understanding the political nature of contestation in issue-based fields.

Title: New Practice Creation: An Institutional Perspective on Innovation
Author-Name: Michael Lounsbury
Author-Name: Ellen T. Crumley
Abstract: Neoinstitutionalists have developed a rich array of theoretical and empirical insights about how new practices become established via legitimacy and diffusion, but have paid scant attention to their origins. This blind spot has been reinforced by recent work on institutional entrepreneurship which has too often celebrated the actions of a single or small number of actors, and deflected attention away from the emergent, multilevel nature of how new kinds of activities emerge and provide a foundation for the creation of a new practice. In this paper, we examine the case of the creation of active money management practice in the US mutual fund industry, drawing on both institutional and practice scholarship, to develop a process model of new practice creation that redirects attention toward the multiplicity of actors that interactively produce change.

Title: Institutional Entrepreneurship in Building an Environmental Protection System for the People's Republic of China
Author-Name: John Child
Author-Name: Yuan Lu
Author-Name: Terence Tsai
Abstract: This paper examines institutional entrepreneurship in the development of China's environmental protection system (EPS) over a period of almost 30 years. China's EPS evolved in four main stages, the boundaries of which were marked by transition-critical events. Within each stage, institutional entrepreneurs conducted activities that supported trajectories of field development. These activities are analysed according to the way they contributed to the construction of regulative, normative and cognitive institutional system pillars. The formation of the EPS as an organizational field in China was characterized by a `made order' in which the regulative system came first and the state and its agencies dominated the process as the principal institutional entrepreneurs. In this respect it contrasts with the evolution of the same field in the USA.

Title: Stories and the Discursive Dynamics of Institutional Entrepreneurship: The Case of Israeli High-tech after the Bubble
Author-Name: Tammar B. Zilber
Abstract: Based on an in-depth analysis of a field-wide high-tech conference held in Israel after the dot-com crash of 2000, I examine the role and usage of stories in the discursive dynamics of institutional entrepreneurship. Actors who represented different groups in the field were engaged in constructing a shared story of the crisis that reflected and further strengthened the established institutional order. Concurrently, the same actors were also each telling a counter-story of indictment, blaming other groups for the crisis and calling for changes in the institutional order. Institutional entrepreneurship, then, centered on efforts of sense-making through the narration of stories. The three accounts of the high-tech 2000 fall reflected simultaneous efforts of both collaboration in maintaining the institutional order and contestation that could potentially disrupt it. The delicate balance between these contradictory orientations was carried out by the skillful manipulation of explicit and implicit meanings, whi...

Title: A Dark Side of Institutional Entrepreneurship: Soccer Balls, Child Labour and Postcolonial Impoverishment
Author-Name: Farzad R. Khan

Author-Name: Hugh Willmott
Abstract: Institutional entrepreneurship is typically portrayed in a positive light in the institutional theory literature, frequently symbolizing ideals of progress and innovation. In this paper, we explore a `darker' side of institutional entrepreneurship by considering how the long-standing institutional practice of child labour was eliminated from the world's largest soccer ball manufacturing cluster in Sialkot, Pakistan. Our focus is upon the operation of power rather than the agency of the coalition of entrepreneurs. We show how power operated hegemonically in solving and reporting the issue of child labour in a way that deflected attention from `darker' problematic aspects of this seemingly progressive and benign institutional reform. Consideration of these dynamics presents a challenge to conventional representations of institutional entrepreneurship and suggests the relevance of developing a more critical perspective when studying instances of institutional work.

Title: Overcoming Inaction through Collective Institutional Entrepreneurship: Insights from Regime Theory
Author-Name: Frank Wijen
Author-Name: Shahzad Ansari
Abstract: Studies on institutional change generally pertain to the agency-structure paradox or the ability of institutional entrepreneurs to spearhead change despite constraints. In many complex fields, however, change also needs cooperation from numerous dispersed actors with divergent interests. This presents the additional paradox of ensuring that these actors engage in collective action when individual interests favor lack of cooperation. We draw on complementary insights from institutional and regime theories to identify drivers of collective institutional entrepreneurship and develop an analytical framework. This is applied to the field of global climate policy to illustrate how collective inaction was overcome to realize a global regulatory institution, the Kyoto Protocol.

Author-Name: André Spicer
Abstract: We explore what institutional entrepreneurs do to propagate new organizational forms. Our findings are derived from a longitudinal study of the `Euroregion', an organizational form used by local authorities situated close to European borders for co-ordinating policies across borders. We find that the institutional entrepreneurs behind the Euroregion engaged in several types of institution-building projects, with a changing focus over time. While the initial emphasis was on interactional projects, this was followed by a focus on technical projects and finally cultural projects. The skills that the institutional entrepreneurs deployed changed accordingly. While in a first phase, predominantly political skills were used, later, analytical skills and finally cultural skills were added. Furthermore, the institutional entrepreneurs propagated the organizational form by switching their institution-building projects between different fields. We interpret these findings by outlining a process theory of institution...

Title: Reflexivity and the Institutional Entrepreneur: A Historical Exploration
Author-Name: Alistair Mutch
Abstract: This article sets the idea of the `institutional entrepreneur' in the context of the `autonomous reflexive' as developed in the work of Margaret Archer. It argues that the latter notion provides a helpful approach to the issue of agency that has bedevilled the new institutionalist project. A detailed account, using the lens supplied by the notion of the autonomous reflexive, is given of the formation of Sir Andrew Barclay Walker, a pioneer of directly managed public houses. The article suggests that Walker used taken-for-granted practice, transferred from elsewhere, to develop his managerial systems. The importance of aspects of Walker's Scottish background, such as education and church governance, is stressed. The account of agency supplied by Archer is seen to be a conception of agency that can inform the debate over the nature of institutional entrepreneurship.

Title: Hierarchical Forms of Outsourcing and the Creation of Dependency
Author-Name: Ulrike Muehlberger
Abstract: The focus of this paper is outsourcing activities, where the contracting worker is formally self-employed but the conditions of work are similar to those of employees. It is argued that the outsourced workers are dependent on or integrated into the firm for which they work. We investigate the mechanisms by which firms mix governance structures and give evidence of how these `hierarchical' forms of outsourcing create dependency. The key argument of this paper is that firms have established governance structures based on markets, hierarchies and self-enforcing relational contracts so that they are able to keep a substantial amount of control despite sourcing out of labour. Furthermore, we argue that such hierarchical forms of outsourcing produce dependency. Using empirical evidence of the Austrian insurance industry, it is demonstrated that dependency is created, firstly, by the contractual restriction of alternative uses of resources, secondly, by support measures that bind the worker closely to the outsou...

Title: Through the Looking Glass of Organizational Theatre: Analogically Mediated Inquiry in Organizations
Author-Name: Stefan Meisiek
Author-Name: Daved Barry
Abstract: Organizational theatre is now widely used as a platform for analogically mediated inquiry and change. Using an alternate template research strategy, we combined interview, visual, and survey methods to study the processes underlying an organizational theatre effort over a year, clarifying how theatre performances analogically affect employees' understanding of their workplace. We identified a `looking glass' effect, where analogies create shifting reflections over time that lead to unpredictably emergent changes in the way employees perceive their organization. Our study not only informs the organizational theatre literature, but addresses broader debates on analogical thinking in organization studies, suggesting that current explanations of analogical processes may be overly restricted both in their scope and their conclusions. Specifically, we propose that compound analogues such as organizational theatre, sculpture and film will not only work differently from more abstract and singular analogues, but c...

Title: Networking by Entrepreneurs: Patterns of Tie—Formation in Emerging Organizations
Author-Name: Tom Elfring
Author-Name: Willem Hulsink
Abstract: There are two conflicting patterns of network development of founding entrepreneurs that emerge from existing literature. One of them evolves from an identity-based network dominated by strong ties into an intentionally managed network rich in weak ties. The other involves the opposite, with weak ties dominating in the emergence phase and some of them developing into strong ties, the latter of which are characteristic of the early growth phase. The empirical part of this study focused on the development of the networks of 32 IT start-ups in The Netherlands, which we constructed on the basis of secondary data sources and in-depth interviews with the founders. We found three distinct patterns of network development. The conflicting patterns from the literature fitted two of our patterns and we were able to reconcile them by showing how initial founding conditions and post-founding entrepreneurial processes influence tie-formation processes. We propose that the simultaneous effect of these tie-formation proc...

Title: Toxicity and the Unconscious Experience of the Body at the Employee—Customer Interface
Author-Name: Mark Stein
Abstract: While the literature on front-line service work utilizes a variety of productive images, I argue that these images do not capture certain of the more problematic experiences of front-line service employees. Drawing on words used by these workers themselves, and using concepts from psychoanalysis and its application to organizational dynamics, I therefore propose a new image, that of toxicity. I argue that — especially when under severe pressure from customers — front-line workers may have the unconscious fantasy that they have been polluted by toxic substances. The unconscious experience of the entry of toxic material is likely to result in further contagion of relationships such as those among employees and between employees and customers. This may also result in workers retaliating against customers by exacting revenge on them. A downward spiralling of relationships may follow, with the result that large parts of the work environment are experienced as toxic. The implications for theory are explored. In...

Abstract: The concept of `new organizational forms' has been with us for over 20 years, but little attention has been given to the diverse assumptions underlying various researchers' use of this term. We identify five areas where different assumptions are in use, underpinned by a variety of theoretical perspectives. We urge scholars to engage in a generative dialogue about new organizational forms across theoretical perspectives. The aim of a generative dialogue is to identify where areas of agreement about new organizational forms can be achieved and where differences can be accepted and respected.

An analysis of the ways in which PowerPoint is used offers considerable insights into, first, the nature of educational technologies and their organizational implementations; second, the effect of these technologies on the construction and dissemination of organizational knowledge; and, third, the qualities and skills of a society of spectacle, where a great deal of organizational knowledge assumes the form of visual representations. Using illustrations from my personal experience, I examine some uses to which the software is put and some of its potential shortcomings. These include the parcelling of knowledge into bullet points, reliance on visual aids to support weak analysis, and the forced linearity of argumentation that limits improvisation, digression and in...

Title: Cross-national Reconstruction of Managerial Practices: TQM in Turkey
Author-Name: Şükrü Özen
Author-Name: Ümit Berkman
Abstract: Drawing on the discursive and translative perspectives, we examine the discourse produced by an elite group of corporate executives to legitimate TQM (total quality management) at the national level in Turkey. The findings indicate that the legitimating agencies largely used ethos justifications exploiting the macro-cultural discourses prevalent in the Turkish context. As such, they reconstructed TQM as a blueprint embracing solutions to the problems at societal, organizational, and individual levels. Based on the findings, we propose that reconstruction of imported practices in recipient contexts is more likely to involve ethos justification when compared to the construction of the original rhetoric because of the nature of cross-national translation. The strategy of ethos justification is even more likely when legitimating actors also strive to legitimate themselves as a social group, and/or to promote the practice to the public. Furthermore, the recipient discourse will be less coherent if legitimating...

Title: The Future of Critical Management Studies: A Paleo-Marxist Critique of Labour Process Theory
Author-Name: Paul S. Adler
Abstract: For many years, the core of critical management studies was labour process theory (LPT), building on Braverman's (1976) reading of Marx. Recently, LPT has been losing momentum in favour of post-structuralist approaches. This paper takes one step back with the hope of taking critical management studies two steps forward. Whereas post-structuralists have largely discarded the Marxist foundations of LPT, this paper argues that LPT has been hobbled by its insufficiently Marxist foundations. I argue that LPT ignores the fundamental contradiction Marx saw between the progressive `socialization' of the labour process and the persistence of capitalist `valorization' constraints. Understood in Marx's terms, socialization is the movement away from local isolation towards `universal interdependence', and it is a key trend both in the objective structure of industry and in subjective self-construals. I use this framework to develop a modified conception of skill, one that reveals how capitalist development drives a p...

Title: Explaining Conflicted Collaboration: A Critical Realist Approach to Hegemony
Author-Name: Rick Delbridge
Abstract: The evidence on current developments in work organization suggests that the outcome is often one of `conflicted collaboration', where there is simultaneous interdependence and disconnection resulting in both coercive and collaborative experiences for workers. It is argued here that analysis and explanation of these findings requires engagement with both the active role of agency and the social structures of capitalist development. These analyses must also locate the workplace in wider social contexts. A critical realist approach to understanding hegemony offers considerable potential in this endeavour.

Title: Adler's Theory of the Capitalist Labour Process: A Pale(o) Imitation
Author-Name: Paul Thompson
Abstract: Adler's paper raises a host of pertinent theoretical and empirical challenges for anyone interested in contemporary trends in work and organization. A version of `paleo' Marxism is invoked to correct the supposed anomalies of labour process theory and the limits of critical management studies. The theory relies on a notion of the progressive socialization of the productive forces in order to assert a positive conception of Taylorism and lean production, as well as a long-run upskilling trajectory. It is argued in this commentary that it is flawed theory and skewed empirics. Adler's perspectives result in a de-politicized workplace by removing any source of conflict over work relations between capital and labour. His evidence of skill upgrading relies overwhelmingly on a series of unreliable proxies that do not deal with actual work relations. In contrast, the commentary defends the record of labour process theory on issues of skill formation and the workplace as a contested terrain.

Title: Socialization, Yes. Skill Upgrading, Probably. Robust Theory of the Capitalist Labour Process, No
Author-Name: David Knights
Author-Name: Hugh Willmott
Abstract: This response welcomes and endorses a concern to recognize and restore labour process theory as central to the critical study of management. It accepts the importance attached by Marx to the socialization of labour and its implications for skill; and identifies other specific points of broad agreement with Adler's `paleo-Marxism'. At the same time, we point to a number of limitations of paleo-Marxism, not least of which is an absence of engagement with neo-Marxism. The capacity to appreciate the significance of forms of inequality and struggle other than class — among which may be included gender, sexuality, ethnicity, religion, ageism, ecology and anti-globalization — is conspicuously absent from paleo-Marxism. The importance of subjectivity is acknowledged by Adler, yet he concedes nothing to the so-called neo-Marxists who have sought to address its relevance in the development of labour processes.

Title: Paleo-Paralysis? Work, Organizations and the Labour Process Debate
Author-Name: Steven Vallas
Abstract: Paul Adler addresses the fall from grace of labour process theory by advocating a `paleo Marxist' perspective that would return the study of labour to its classical Marxist lineage. I find that Adler is right to emphasize the contradictions that often lie hidden within contemporary managerial regimes, yet utterly wrong to root them within the capitalist mode of production as such. So heavily deterministic and reductionist a view would, if generalized, deny us any ability to explain why managerial regimes vary across firms, industries and nation-states. Likewise, issues of organization culture, gender and racial inequalities, or worker subjectivity would all quickly vanish from sight. What Adler views as a weakness of the labour process approach — its emphasis on the negotiated nature of the wage-labour relation — in fact constitutes an enduring contribution to the study of work.

Title: Sociomaterial Practices: Exploring Technology at Work
Author-Name: Wanda J. Orlikowski
Abstract: In this essay, I begin with the premise that everyday organizing is inextricably bound up with materiality and contend that this relationship is inadequately reflected in organizational studies that tend to ignore it, take it for granted, or treat it as a special case. The result is an understanding of organizing and its conditions and consequences that is necessarily limited. I then argue for an alternative approach, one that posits the constitutive entanglement of the social and the material in everyday life. I draw on some empirical examples to help ground and illustrate this approach in practice and conclude by suggesting that a reconfiguration of our conventional assumptions and considerations of materiality will help us more effectively recognize and understand the multiple, emergent, and shifting sociomaterial assemblages entailed in contemporary organizing.

Title: Strategy Practice and Strategy Process: Family Differences and the Sociological Eye
Author-Name: Richard Whittington
Abstract: This Essai argues for the distinctive position of Strategy-as-Practice research outside the immediate family of Strategy Process. Strategy-as-Practice's fascination with the phenomenon of strategy itself takes it beyond traditional Process perspectives. Relying on the `sociological eye', Strategy-as-Practice treats strategy like any other practice in society, capable of being studied from many different angles. Under the four themes of praxis, practices, practitioners and the profession of strategy as an institutional field, the Essai demonstrates the potential range of research topics, performance notions and methodologies within Strategy-as-Practice. It concludes by proposing five implications of the sociological eye for the conduct of Strategy-as-Practice research, highlighting particularly social connections and relationships, embeddedness, irony, problematized notions of performance and a respect for continuity.

Title: Organizational Change and the Economics of Management Consulting: A Response to Sorge and van Witteloostuijn
Author-Name: Thomas Armbrüster
Author-Name: Johannes Glückler
Abstract: This essay responds to Sorge and van Witteloostuijn (2004) and argues that consulting firms play an important economic role in helping organizations trigger and deal with change. Sorge and van Witteloostuijn claim that management consultancy is a business in which clients buy into hype-driven and unsubstantiated advice, and they imply that consultants yield returns from short-term opportunism based on information asymmetries. We propose that clients have several sources for assessing consulting service quality, and word-of-mouth effects discourage short-term opportunism of consultants. We also question Sorge and van Witteloostuijn's view that the need for organizations to change is largely a myth. We present data on economic changes over the last three decades to which firms had to respond and continue to do so. Accordingly, we argue that the continuing demand for consultancy is genuine, rather than induced by hype.

Title: Is Actor Network Theory Critique?
Author-Name: Andrea Whittle
Author-Name: André Spicer
Abstract: In this essai we debate the extent to which Actor Network Theory (ANT) provides a meaningful contribution to the body of critical theories of organization. Critical approaches are commonly associated with a denaturalizing ontology, a reflexive epistemology and an anti-performative politics. In contrast, we suggest that ANT relies on a naturalizing ontology, an un-reflexive epistemology and a performative politics. This does not completely dismiss ANT as a useful approach to studying organizations. It does however question the contribution of ANT to developing a critical theory of organization.

Title: On Lacan and the `Becoming-ness' of Organizations/Selves
Author-Name: Nancy Harding
Abstract: Poststructuralist accounts of organizations understand them as flows, as verbs in process of always-becoming. Subjects who work `in' organizations are similarly always in a process of becoming. Organization and members are mutually constitutive, each enfolded within the other. The process by which each is enfolded within and constituted by the other is what is explored in this essai. Its aim is to analyse something of the becoming-ness of organizations/selves, in which the researcher-self is imbricated in this becoming-ness and must therefore be part of that which is studied. To achieve this aim I draw on Lacan's concepts: of the mirror stage, or how I am in an agonistic relationship with the other; Nachträglichkeit or the reliving of the past in the present (deferred action); and identification. I apply these concepts to an interview I, an academic, carried out with a manager, emphasizing the importance of these organizational identities in our encounter with each other. The conclusion I reach is that th...

Title: Strategy as Discourse in a Global Retailer: A Supplement to Rationalist and                 Interpretive Accounts
Author-Name: Mahmoud Ezzamel
Author-Name: Hugh Willmott
Abstract: The paper contributes to a developing interest in discourse in management and organization studies. Strategizing activity is studied as an example of organizing conceived as a discursive practice. Material drawn from an intensive case study of 'StitchCo', a global retailing and manufacturing company, is deployed to analyse how strategy activity was articulated, mobilized and enacted; and, in particular, to explore how accounting practices became discursively imbued with strategic significance in ways that contributed to what the strategy discourse contrived to invoke and prescribe. Grounded in a Foucauldian power/knowledge framework, this approach is seen to offer an innovative and challenging supplement to established analyses of (strategic) management.

Title: On the Way to Theory: A Processual Approach
Author-Name: Ajit Nayak
Abstract: Debates on theory have focused on the nature of good theories and the process of theorizing, but have failed to engage with the ontology of becoming emphasized by process philosophers such as Heraclitus, Bergson and James, and more recently by Cooper, Shotter and Chia. This paper argues that engaging with reality as becoming implies departing from any claims of `essence' in theories. Theories are not representations, better or worse, of a particular phenomenon, real or socially constructed. Instead, mobility, movement and creativity are the primordial qualities of theory. A becoming ontology also points to the non-sequential, imaginative and paradoxical `way' of theory-building. This paper argues that a processual approach which is reposed on introspective reality and the method of intuition is better suited to revealing a becoming reality.

Title: The Bread-Making Machine: Tacit Knowledge and Two Types of Action
Author-Name: Rodrigo Ribeiro
Author-Name: Harry Collins
Abstract: We analyse Nonaka and Takeuchi's (1995) claim that a master baker's tacit knowledge was made explicit and incorporated into a home bread-making machine and its manual — the `knowledge capture' thesis. In order to test the claim, bread was made without and with a breadmaker and we carried out an analysis of the bread-making actions before and after mechanization. Based on the theory of action morphicity (Collins and Kusch 1998) it is shown that the machine only mimics the mechanical counterpart of just a few of certain special kinds of human bread-making actions. The remaining success of the machine and its manual is due to what other human actors bring to the mechanical bread-making scene; this way the breadmaker can be an adequate social prosthesis. Action mimicking, action substitution, and the contributions of these other human actors, who are not needed in the case of the master baker, explain why the machine and its manual do work. It is not a matter of the explication or incorporation of tacit knowl...

Title: The Ubiquity of Organization
Author-Name: Brian J. Loasby
Abstract: Systems consist of selected elements which are connected in particular ways, and their properties depend both on the elements which they contain and on the organization of these elements. There are many kinds of systems; formal organizations serve to develop and use knowledge, especially complex knowledge, which is itself structured. The ubiquity of organization may be explained by economizing and evolutionary principles. The microfoundations of formal organizations, and of overall economic organization, are to be found in the cognitive capacities and motivations of humans, which lead to the differentiation and integration of knowledge. This theme is explored by bringing together the work of authors spread over two and a half centuries.

Title: Empirical Challenges in Organizational Aesthetics Research: Towards a Sensual                 Methodology
Author-Name: Samantha Warren
Abstract: Despite growing scholarly interest in aesthetic dimensions of organizational life, there is a lack of literature expressly engaging with the methodological mechanics of 'doing aesthetics research'. This article addresses that gap. It begins with an overview of the conceptual idiosyncrasies of 'aesthetics' as a facet of human existence and maps out the challenges these pose for empirical research methodology. A review of methodological approaches adopted to date in empirical studies of organizational aesthetics is then presented. The remainder of the article draws on the author's experiences and suggests methods and techniques to address both conceptual and practical challenges encountered during the execution of an organizational aesthetics research project. The article calls for a firmer focus on the aesthetic experiences of organizational members in addition to those of researchers and concludes with some suggestions as to the future of such 'sensual methodologies'

Author-Name: Jeanne M. Wilson

Author-Name: Quintus R. Jett
Abstract: One's colleagues can be situated in close physical proximity, yet seem quite distant. Conversely, one's colleagues can be quite far away in objective terms, yet seem quite close. In this paper, we explore this paradoxical phenomenon of feeling close to geographically distant colleagues and propose a model of perceived proximity (a dyadic and asymmetric construct which reflects one person's perception of how close or how far another person is). The model shows how communication and social identification processes, as well as certain individual and socio-organizational factors, affect feelings of proximity. The aim is to broaden organizational studies' theoretical understandings of proximity to include the subjective perception of it. By shifting the focus from objective to perceived proximity, we believe that scholars can resolve many conflicting findings regarding dispersed work. By understanding what leads to perceived proximity, we also believe that managers can achieve many of the benefits of co-locati...

Title: The Impact of Density Dependence, Sociopolitical Legitimation and Competitive Intensity on Self-Help/Mutual-Aid Formation
Author-Name: Matthew E. Archibald
Abstract: Density-dependent and density-independent legitimation and competition are used to explain the evolution of self-help/mutual-aid (1955—2000), a long-lived population of health movement organizations. While previous research suggests the importance of both kinds of measures, this paper shows that better specification of density-independent sociopolitical legitimation and competitive intensity improves understanding of organizational and institutional factors affecting organizational formation. Sociopolitical legitimation, for instance, has a beneficial impact on self-help/mutual-aid formation, but later depresses founding rates because identity enclosure hinders new entries. Implications for further studies of identity, legitimation and competition are discussed.

Title: Managing Meaning through Branding — the Case of a Consulting Firm
Author-Name: Dan Kärreman
Author-Name: Anna Rylander
Abstract: The current interest in organizational culture, identity, image and reputation and in organizational discourse points towards the pressure on contemporary organizations to focus attention on the symbolic dimensions of their activities. The phenomenon of branding, while originally portrayed as a marketing tool, can also be understood as an exercise in management of meaning. Branding does not only inform external stakeholders, such as customers and investors, about the values of the organization. It also potentially instructs and directs organizational members. In this sense, branding can be viewed as a management and leadership practice. Drawing on a longitudinal case study, this paper illustrates how these practices are played out in the particular context of a management consulting firm and explores the relationship between branding and organizational identity and identification. The study highlights the shortcomings of the strategic marketing perspective on brands and the need for further empirical stud...

Title: Exploring the Metaphor of Connectivity: Attributes, Dimensions and Duality
Author-Name: Darl G. Kolb
Abstract: The term `connectivity' has wide usage as a technical term describing connections between electronic devices. Increasingly, however, the concept of connectivity is being used as a metaphor for intra- and inter-organizational interactions. This article explores some of the attributes that make the metaphor of connectivity applicable to social phenomena, namely latent potentiality, temporal intermittency, actor agency and unknowable pervasiveness. Furthermore, it identifies how `connects' and `disconnects' suggest an underlying theoretical duality , which is illustrated across multiple dimensions of connectivity, including: geo-physical, technical, interpersonal, group, organizational, networks, economic, cultural, political and philosophical. Implications for management and research are discussed.

In fact, the flow of discussion from our essai to theirs shows the continuing topicality of our worries and propositions.

Abstract: The focus of this paper is on the `institutional work' (Lawrence and Suddaby 2006) of disrupting institutions, examining the rhetorical strategies employed to construct and justify meanings and interpretations. This work is explored in the context of the contemporary academic labour process; specifically, research approaches within the management discipline. A total of 45 individuals involved in funding, conducting, publishing and using qualitative management research were interviewed. From our analysis of their arguments, we focus specifically on the discursive positioning of quantitative research as illegitimate institutionalization of academic working practices and of qualitative research as legitimate resistance to this institutionalization.

Title: Understanding and Managing Conversations from a Knowledge Perspective: An Analysis of the Roles and Rules of Face-to-face Conversations in Organizations
Author-Name: Jeanne Mengis
Author-Name: Martin J. Eppler
Abstract: This article presents a discussion on the role of face-to-face conversations for social knowledge processes and sense making in organizations. Given the importance attributed to conversations in the literature, but also the many conversational routines that prevent knowledge creation and sharing, the question pursued is how conversations can be managed to foster developments in organizational knowing. We particularly focus on the role of explicit rules as one means to manage conversations from a knowledge perspective and analyse contributions from knowledge management, organizational learning, decision making and change management. In order to refine and systemize the discussion on the multitude of conversation rules, we propose a management framework by drawing on communication theory. Implications for management as well as future directions for research on conversation management conclude the article.

Title: Metaphor in Organizational Research: Context, Modalities and Implications for Research — Introduction
Author-Name: Joep P. Cornelissen
Author-Name: Cliff Oswick
Author-Name: Lars Thøger Christensen
Author-Name: Nelson Phillips
Abstract: We provide a general overview of previous work which has explored the use of metaphors in organizational research. Differences in focus and form of research on metaphors are noted. Work in organization theory (OT) and organizational communication (OC) generally features prescriptive metaphors that aid the practice of theorizing and research; research in organizational development (OD) tends to use metaphors for intervention in individual and group decision-making; while studies of organizational behaviour (OB) emphasize the metaphors-in-use within individuals' sensemaking accounts of critical events within their organization. Alongside these differences in focus, the form of metaphor analysis also differs across these contexts, ranging from text- and discourse-based analysis to the analysis of non-linguistic modalities such as pictorial signs, gestures and artefacts. Based on our overview of previous work, we call for greater attention to methodological issues around metaphor identification and analysis a...

Title: Methodology by Metaphor: Ways of Seeing in Painting and Research
Author-Name: Mary Jo Hatch
Author-Name: Dvora Yanow
Abstract: Scholars paint theoretical canvases, using words, without always making transparent the logic of inquiry embedded within their writing. This is especially so when writing for their own epistemic communities, whose members share a set of usually unspoken methodological presuppositions concerning the `reality status' of what they study and its `know-ability'. When research topics engage scholars across epistemic communities, as in organizational studies, arguments may be difficult to parse precisely because these presuppositions remain implicit, unnoted and, perhaps, unnoticed. By enabling new ways of seeing familiar things, metaphors can facilitate such encounters by making the implicit less so. We turn to painting to enable metaphoric understanding of methodological differences in organizational and other social science scholarship, drawing on examples from the organizational identity literature. Much as artists look at the world around them and render things on canvas using a range of techniques, so rese...

Title: Understanding Organizations through Embodied Metaphors
Author-Name: Loizos Heracleous
Author-Name: Claus D. Jacobs
Abstract: We outline the dominant, positivist approach to conceptualizing and researching organizations through multi-level research that views levels as independently existing, hierarchically nested entities, and problematize this view by offering an alternative approach based on embodied realism. We operationalize this approach through a study of three organization development workshops where organizational actors constructed artifacts we label embodied metaphors. We propose that analysis of embodied metaphors can enable access to actors' first-order conceptions of organizational levels and related organizational dimensions and reveals alternative qualities and interrelations among them; can support a clinical approach to organizations; provides a window to organizational, divisional or task identities; and poses substantial challenges to established conceptions of ontology and method in organization theory.

Title: On Social Interaction and the Communicative Construction of Personal                 Identity, Knowledge and Reality
Author-Name: Thomas Luckmann
Abstract: After a note on the main assumption of all science — the existence of a world — the implications of this ontological realism are pointed out. The subject of the social sciences is a human world — no doubt an evolutionary emergent one — that is built up, modified and sometimes partly destroyed by human social interaction over the generations. The constitution of meaning in experience and action is described (with a lengthy footnote on the phenomenological details of the matter) as the foundation of social, and most importantly, communicative interaction. This provides the basis for a formal analysis of the communicative formation and transmission of personal identity, knowledge and historical social words.

Title: Designing Organizations that Design Environments: Lessons from Entrepreneurial Expertise
Author-Name: Saras D. Sarasvathy
Author-Name: Nicholas Dew

Author-Name: Robert Wiltbank
Abstract: Human artifacts lie on the interface between their inner environments and their outer environments. Organizations, therefore, are apt subjects to be studied through a science of the artificial. Furthermore, organizational design happens at two interfaces: first, at the interface between organizational founder(s) and the firms they design, and second, between the firms and the environments in which they operate. We use recent developments in the study of entrepreneurial expertise to show why an effectual logic of design is necessary at the first interface, and what its consequences are for designing at the second. In particular, we use the exemplar case of Starbucks to codify three key characteristics of the design problem at the first interface — namely, Knightian uncertainty, goal ambiguity and environmental isotropy. We then use an `alternate histories' method to trace four strategic options — namely, planning, adaptation, vision and transformation — for designing at the second interface. In the final a...

Title: Incomplete by Design and Designing for Incompleteness
Author-Name: Raghu Garud

Abstract: The traditional scientific approach to design extols the virtues of completeness. However, in environments characterized by continual change, there are challenges in adopting such an approach. We examine Linux and Wikipedia as two exemplary cases to explore the nature of design in such a protean world. Our observations highlight a pragmatic approach to design in which incompleteness is harnessed in a generative manner. This suggests a change in the meaning of the word `design' itself — from one that separates the process of design from its outcome, to one that considers design as both the medium and outcome of action.

Title: Uncovering Design Attitude: Inside the Culture of Designers
Author-Name: Kamil Michlewski
Abstract: This paper empirically explores what constitutes design attitude. Previous studies have called on managers to adopt such an attitude in creating products, services and processes that are both profitable and humanly satisfying. However, what a design attitude actually is made of has not been researched. In this study I therefore investigate the nature of this attitude, as displayed by professional designers. Interview data from senior designers and managers from four internationally recognized, design-led organizations (IDEO, Nissan Design, Philips Design and Wolff Olins) are collected in order to characterize the likely shape of a work-based attitude promoted by designers themselves. The five theoretical categories characterizing design attitude that arise from the data are: 'Consolidating multidimensional meanings', 'Creating, bringing to life', 'Embracing discontinuity and open-endedness', 'Embracing personal and commercial empathy' and 'Engaging polysensorial aesthetics'. Finally, the implications of t...

Title: Developing Design Propositions through Research Synthesis
Author-Name: David Denyer

Author-Name: Joan Ernst van Aken
Abstract: The field of organization and management studies has a significant and ever increasing published research base, often criticized as fragmented and of limited relevance for practice. A design science approach to management has argued that more room for the development of solution-oriented or prescriptive knowledge would increase its relevance. In this article we discuss prescriptive knowledge cast in the form of design propositions following the so-called 'CIMO-logic', extending previous applications of the design proposition notion. This logic involves a combination of a problematic Context, for which the design proposition suggests a certain Intervention type, to produce, through specified generative Mechanisms, the intended Outcome(s). We discuss how design-oriented research synthesis provides a vehicle for addressing fragmentation and increasing the chances of application. Moreover, we explore how the development of design propositions can result from synthesizing previously published research and illu...

Title: Bridging Social Constraint and Social Action to Design Organizations for Innovation
Author-Name: Deborah Dougherty
Abstract: Organization studies offers conflicting design ideas to organize large firms in mature industries for sustained product innovation. These conflicts arise in part from the bifurcation in theory between social constraint and social action, even though structuration views emphasize that neither exists without the other. Designs based on social constraint emphasize boundaries, authority, and reward mechanisms, while designs based on social action emphasize emergence, knowledgeable action, and self-fulfillment. This analysis applies a design science framework to reveal the incommensurate construction principles in the bifurcated designs. Construction principles are imperative statements for action that bridge organization theory and organization design, and highlight deeper meanings behind design guidelines. The construction principles for innovation evoke different patterns of managerial work, emphasizing either direct managerial agency while constraining employees or indirect shaping and enabling.

Title: Toward a (Pragmatic) Science of Strategic Intervention: Design Propositions for Scenario Planning
Author-Name: Gerard P. Hodgkinson
Author-Name: Mark P. Healey
Abstract: An enduring problem confronting design science is the question of how to distil design principles and propositions in contexts where only limited evidence has accrued directly in connection with the design problem at hand. This article illustrates how researchers can address this challenge by recourse to well-established bodies of basic theory and research in the wider social and organizational sciences that suggest robust design options. Adopting this approach, we draw upon the insights of social identity theory, self/social categorization theory and the Five Factor Model of human personality from the field of personality and social psychology to distil a series of propositions to inform the design of scenario planning interventions, centred on team composition and the facilitation process. In so doing, our article exemplifies the benefits of adopting a pragmatic science approach to the design of processes that promote organizational change and development, thus adding to the growing design science movement.

Title: A Chemistry of Organization: Combinatory Analysis and Design
Author-Name: Anna Grandori
Author-Name: Santi Furnari
Abstract: This paper is a response to the call for models of organization design as a science revealing the inner composition of organization and specifying the laws to be respected when crafting it. It maintains that the needed science is a chemistry of organization, addressing the combination of 'organizational elements' playing a role analogous to that of chemical elements in composing a variety of substances. Drawing both on classic organization design theory and on configurational and complementarity-based approaches, the paper specifies a set of basic organizational elements and a set of combinatory laws regulating their effective combinations. Testable propositions are derived on the necessary and sufficient conditions that the composition of organizations should have respect for achieving high levels of efficiency and innovation. These propositions are tested empirically on a sample of firms, using an innovative application of Boolean algebra.

Title: Lords of the Dance: Professionals as Institutional Agents
Author-Name: W. Richard Scott
Abstract: More so than other types of social actors, the professions in modern society have assumed leading roles in the creation and tending of institutions. They are the preeminent institutional agents of our time. Different professions work in various ways: some attempt to create general cultural-cognitive frameworks; others to devise normative prescriptions to guide behavior; and still others to exercise coercive authority. Also, individual professionals assume varying roles within their professional community: some concentrate on devising and testing general principles, others transport these ideas to varying communities; and still others work to apply the principles to individual cases. Professions themselves adhere to an institutional model, but this model has undergone important changes over time.

Title: Varieties of Knowledge and Their Use in Business and Management Studies:                 Conditions and Institutions
Author-Name: Richard Whitley
Abstract: Many research fields combine practical goals with a search for fundamental mechanisms and make significant contributions to theoretical understanding. This is especially so in the social sciences, which are often concerned with policy issues and problems, albeit with varying degrees of directness. Business and management studies (BMS) may be more focused on practical problem solving than other social sciences, but they are equally capable of contributing major intellectual innovations. They produce a variety of kinds of knowledge that are practically useful in different conditions. At least eight types can be distinguished in terms of their horizontal and vertical isolation, and their identification of causal mechanisms. These can be expected to be more or less effective in producing desired outcomes according to three conditions: contextual independence, stability of internal causal processes, and similarity of circumstances. These conditions in turn are likely to be achieved to varying degrees in differ...

Title: Two Faces of Organizational Irony: Endemic and Pragmatic
Author-Name: Eric Hoyle
Author-Name: Mike Wallace
Abstract: This paper puts forward a perspective on organizational irony framed in terms of two reciprocal faces, as a contribution to the developing interest in irony as a tool for organizational analysis. Endemic irony explores theoretical approaches implying that irony is a characteristic of all organizations, extended by contingent manifestations in contemporary organizations. Pragmatic irony conceptualizes how organization members engage in ironic strategies and deploy verbal irony as modes of coping — with both endemic discrepancies between intention and outcome, and contingent contradictions generated through major change efforts. This perspective is offered as a heuristic for exploring organizations whose members are inherently confronted by irony. First, those philosophical, literary and organization theory approaches to irony are reviewed which relate most closely to organizational irony. Second, the endemic nature of organizational irony is elaborated. Third, distinctive manifestations of irony in contemp...

Abstract: One of the basic objectives in organization research is to examine how some organizational occurrence or outcome comes about or, even more fundamentally, to explain how things work. I argue that we can shed more light on these issues by examining the mechanisms driving the organizational processes. In this article I attempt to elucidate the nature of organizational mechanisms, thereby providing a coherent explanatory foundation for process research and processual research strategies. In order to illustrate the nature of mechanisms and explanations by mechanisms, a case study of the organizational decline and failure process of the Finnish conglomerate Tampella is reported.

Title: Re-searching Ethics: Towards a More Reflexive Critical Management Studies
Author-Name: Joanna Brewis
Author-Name: Edward Wray-Bliss
Abstract: Fournier and Grey (2000) suggest that those inhabiting the contested terrain of Critical Management Studies (CMS) share a commitment to identifying inequality and subordination in organizations and to the associated possibility of emancipation, however this is conceived. Despite their additional claim that one crucial distinction between critical and non-critical management studies is the `philosophical and methodological reflexivity' of the former (Fournier and Grey 2000: 19), our review indicates limits to this reflexivity in CMS's empirical practices — indeed, we argue these may even be counter-productive with regard to its political allegiances. To encourage wider discussion of these issues, we provide a tripartite framework of understandings of research ethics drawn from within and outside the management academy, and interrogate the opportunities and limitations of each for enriching CMS research.

Abstract: In this paper I develop the concept of necrocapitalism, defined as contemporary forms of organizational accumulation that involve dispossession and the subjugation of life to the power of death. I examine how different forms of power — institutional, material, and discursive — operate in the political economy and the violence and dispossession that result. I describe some contemporary forms of organizational accumulation that involve dispossession and death and could therefore be described as necrocapitalist practices — for example, the impact of the resources industry in developing countries and the privatization of war and the military. I conclude by discussing some possibilities of resistance and outlining directions for future research.

Abstract: This article examines the role of corporations in constructing the nature, meaning and implications of `consumer responsibility'. It draws on a theoretical framework that elaborates how objects, subjects and concepts are configured in organizational discourse. Using critical discourse analysis, it reveals how consumer responsibility is organized into meaningful cultural knowledge through corporate communications. The findings suggest that such communications rely on strategic juxtapositions that offer a morally unconflicting concept of consumer responsibility that is facilitative of market choice.

Title: Knowledge Practices in Design: The Role of Visual Representations as `Epistemic Objects'
Author-Name: Boris Ewenstein
Author-Name: Jennifer Whyte
Abstract: We use a detailed study of the knowledge work around visual representations to draw attention to the multidimensional nature of `objects'. Objects are variously described in the literatures as relatively stable or in flux; as abstract or concrete; and as used within or across practices. We clarify these dimensions, drawing on and extending the literature on boundary objects, and connecting it with work on epistemic and technical objects. In particular, we highlight the epistemic role of objects, using our observations of knowledge work on an architectural design project to show how, in this setting, visual representations are characterized by a `lack' or incompleteness that precipitates unfolding. The conceptual design of a building involves a wide range of technical, social and aesthetic forms of knowledge that need to be developed and aligned. We explore how visual representations are used, and how these are meaningful to different stakeholders, eliciting their distinct contributions. As the project evo...

Title: Introduction: Polyphony and Organization Studies: Mikhail Bakhtin and Beyond
Author-Name: Olga Belova
Author-Name: Ian King
Author-Name: Martyna Sliwa
Abstract: In this editorial we introduce the work of Mikhail Bakhtin and his concept of polyphony, and discuss ways in which polyphony has been interpreted and applied in organization studies. It is important to appreciate that two streams seem to emerge in this body of work: the use of polyphony as a textual strategy in writing research narratives and as a tool for analysing organizations as discursive spaces where heterogeneous and multiple voices engage in a contest for audibility and power. We conclude this editorial by briefly introducing each of the papers in this themed section.

Title: Managing To Learn: The Social Poetics of a Polyphonic 'Classroom'
Author-Name: Caroline Ramsey
Abstract: This paper draws on Bakhtin's use of polyphony and explores its potential for organizing processes within management education. In developing the concept of a polyphonic 'classroom', the interplay between tutor, manager-student and theory is related to Bakhtin's identification of the relationship between hero, other characters and idea within Dostoevsky's novels. In particular, a carnivalesque polyphonic relationship is argued to change tutor—student relations, extend the physical classroom into a wider polyphonic 'classroom' that includes the manager-student's work context and re-imagines learning as a changing, social poetic performance beyond common understanding of learning as cognitive processes of understanding or sense making.

Title: Dialogism and Polyphony in Organizing Theorizing in Organization Studies:                 Action Guiding Anticipations and the Continuous Creation of Novelty
Author-Name: John Shotter
Abstract: Bakhtin's ideas of polyphony and dialogism in language are explored as ways of organizing our thinking in organizational theorizing. Traditionally, language has been thought of as an already established, self-contained system of linguistic communication that sets out a set of rules or social conventions that people make use of in expressing themselves. In this account, what could be called the intellectualist, Cartesian account of language, people understand the linguistic representations contained or encoded in each other's sentences. However, another account—a relationally responsive, emotionalvolitional account articulated by Bakhtin (1981, 1984, 1986, 1993), along with a number of others, such as Wittgenstein, Merleau-Ponty, James, and Bergson—is of a much more dynamic, participatory, relational kind. In it, language and the world are intertwined in a dialogical or chiasmic relation with each other, in which we are shaped just as much, if not more, by the world, as the world by us. Indeed, in arguing ...

Title: Managing the Polyphonic Sounds of Organizational Truths
Author-Name: Paul Sullivan
Author-Name: John McCarthy
Abstract: This paper argues that polyphony is built on the transaction between voices and experiential truths, where voice and experience constitute each other. From this perspective voice is associated with the plural, transformational character of moment-to-moment experience. This view differs from the prevalent appropriation of polyphony where voice expresses a relatively stable identity (e.g. Hazen 1993) such that many voices (polyphony) may be reduced to many identities. The experiential understanding of polyphony is examined through close inspection of Bakhtin's contextualization of polyphony in carnival, a reading of his work that is largely missing from the organizational literature. This reading is further developed in the context of talk about teamwork in a large healthcare organization. Analysis of this talk reveals three different types of discursive truths that create different kinds of identities and different kinds of possibilities for organizational change: the public, teleological truths of epic di...

Title: Organizational Citizenship Behavior of Temporary Knowledge Employees
Author-Name: Ruth Blatt
Abstract: This study examines accounts of organizational citizenship behavior (OCB) by temporary knowledge employees. Most studies of OCB are based on the perspective of permanent employees and may not account for the unique perspective of temporary knowledge employees. This study finds that the most prominent themes in temporary knowledge employees' explanations for why they engaged in OCB are their perceived norms of professional behavior for their occupation and an experience of positive regard with and among their co-workers. This is in contrast with the themes of social exchange, organizational identification, and impression management that are currently invoked in explaining OCBs among permanent employees.

Title: From Networks to Hierarchies: The Construction of a Subcontracting Regime in the Irish Telecommunications Industry
Author-Name: Robert MacKenzie
Abstract: The perceived displacement of bureaucracy by external market relationships through the use of subcontracting has brought about an increase in interest in inter-organizational relations. The development of such relationships can be a protracted process, characterized by tensions and contradictions. The article traces the development of subcontracting within Eircom, the Irish telecommunications provider, from its relatively ad hoc origins in the mid-1990s to the development of a far more sophisticated contracting regime by 2003. The article explores the relationship between internal and external organizational changes associated with the construction of the subcontracting regime and the development of inter-organizational relationships. The subcontracting regime was transformed from a reliance on a series of decentralized local networks of suppliers to a highly centralized arrangement that bore increasing semblance to a unitary hierarchy. The transactions costs implications of such developments are consider...

Abstract: The present study aims to discern the ways whereby gender-role perceptions and women's perspectives on political conflict and peace processes inform the organizational development process, reflected in organizational structure and processes. In order to achieve this we studied CheckpointWatch, a women's voluntary organization devoted to monitoring and reporting human rights violations of Palestinians crossing Israeli military checkpoints. The research is a qualitative study. Data gathering was designed to collect information from two sources: (1) interviews with key informants in the organization, and (2) documents transmitted over the organization's internal communications network.The findings illustrate the complexities involved in the organizational development processes of a women's peace and human rights organization, its vacillation between transition into a more formalized NGO and its holding on to the social movement organization, grassroots stage. The study also demonstrates the significance of f...

Abstract: This paper outlines a case for bringing the work of three scholars — Garfinkel (ethnomethodology), Goffman (interaction order/dramaturgy), Sacks (conversation analysis) — into the management and/or organization studies field. It specifically attends to the ways their work adds to understandings of the foundations of organizing. Further, we argue for studies of naturally occurring interaction in ways forged by these scholars and substantiate this move through touching on a number of domains of study where a contribution would be forthcoming, indicated here through the conceptual terrain of practice, identity, power and process theorizing. It is an endeavour which also problematizes the interview `method'. Crucially too, as part of this discussion, we not only summarize elements from these three scholars' legacies for our field, but also introduce the four papers selected for this Symposium Issue. We highlight the ways they take up particular threads and offer empirical illustrations of fine-grained studies...

Title: `That Miracle of Familiar Organizational Things': Social and Moral Order in the MBA Classroom
Author-Name: Steve Fox
Abstract: Garfinkel's work over the last five decades has created an alternate view of organizational phenomena which has been understood only at the margins of organization studies. His approach is profoundly empirical yet it is not positivist. He does not deny the reality of things but argues that their appearance as objects on any particular occasion is socially constructed. He shows us familiar organizational things in an unfamiliar way: organized phenomena of order in practical detail. This paper specifically examines the moral dimension of Garfinkel's approach. When Garfinkel says that members make settings accountable, i.e. `observable and reportable', he means accountable rationally and morally. To explicate this point, the paper examines data from a study of an executive MBA classroom in a way that builds on Macbeth's (2003) ethnomethodological study and examines the way in which the social organization of vernacular talk and interaction in the classroom is simultaneously moral organization. Moral order an...

Title: Organization in Actual Episodes of Work: Harvey Sacks and Organization Studies
Author-Name: Nick Llewellyn
Abstract: This paper explores the relevance of Harvey Sacks' work for contemporary organization studies. Sacks encourages analysts to tether their studies to real-time workplace activities; ordinary scenes of work are recorded, slowed down and made the central object of study. Something of Sacks' analytic mentality and style are illustrated through the analysis of two data extracts: an emergency 999 call and a face-to-face sales encounter. A distinctive way of doing organizational analysis is discussed that foregrounds knowledgeability and agency via the examination of sequence and method. Sacks raises the possibility that organization might be recoverable from the fine-grained detail of actual episodes. The idea that order, intelligibility and the constitution of social scenes might have a basis aside from the more general notion of discourse is discussed.

Title: Harold Garfinkel, Ethnomethodology and Workplace Studies
Author-Name: Anne Warfield Rawls
Abstract: Known primarily as the author of a method for studying work, Harold Garfinkel — and ethnomethodological studies of work, or workplace studies — also offer an important alternative theory of work. First articulated in the late 1940s and early 1950s as a theory of communication, organization, and information, it has been Garfinkel's proposal that mutual understanding (orienting objects, meaning, and identities) in interactions, including technical situations of work, requires constant mutual orientation to situated constitutive expectancies — taken-for-granted methods of producing order that constitute sense — accompanied by displays of attention, competence, and trust. Based on this premise, researchers need to enter worksites to learn the order properties of work. Conventional theories, by contrast, treat social orders (including work) as resulting from individual interests, external constraint, and/or some conjunction between the two. For Garfinkel, however, individual motivation, power, and constraint m...

Title: Reframing Power in the Globalized World
Author-Name: Ulrich Beck
Abstract: This paper throws light on the global power games being played out between global business, nation-states and movements rooted in civil society. It offers an account of the changing nature of power in the global age and assesses the influence of the counter-powers. The thesis is that, in an age of global crises and risks, the creation of a dense network of transnational interdependencies is exactly what is needed to regain national autonomy, not least in relation to a highly mobile world economy. The author thereby argues that a paradigm shift of the social sciences is needed, from `methodological nationalism' to `methodological cosmopolitanism'.

Title: Strategic Human Resource Practices and Product Innovation
Author-Name: Sjoerd Beugelsdijk
Abstract: Using creativity theory as a heuristic device, I develop hypotheses on the relation between strategic human resource practices and a firm's capability to generate product innovations. My empirical tests in a sample of 988 Dutch firms indicate the importance of task autonomy, training and performance-based pay for generating incremental innovations. Regarding radical innovations, the results point to the importance of task autonomy and flexible working hours. The use of standby contracts is associated with significantly lower levels of innovativeness. We also find interaction effects between individual HR practices, between HR practices and firm size, and between HR practices and R&D intensity.

Title: Intermediary Services in the Markets for Technology: Organizational Antecedents and Performance Consequences
Author-Name: Ulrich Lichtenthaler
Author-Name: Holger Ernst
Abstract: The external commercialization of technology assets, e.g. by means of out-licensing, has recently gained in importance. Despite this increase in technology transactions, many industrial firms experience major managerial difficulties in outward technology transfer because of imperfections in the markets for technology. Drawing on a resource-based perspective, we therefore analyse whether firms can overcome market inefficiencies by relying on innovation intermediaries such as consulting companies and internet platforms. We test five hypotheses regarding organizational antecedents and performance consequences of intermediary services with data from 152 firms spanning multiple industries. The empirical findings show that industrial firms need to develop internal competencies of externally leveraging technology. External service providers are a complement rather than a substitute for internal activities. Accordingly, the role of technology intermediaries as general facilitators of interorganizational technolog...

Author-Name: Kent D. Miller
Abstract: Organizational researchers cite Simon and Polanyi without adequately acknowledging and dealing with the disparities in their perspectives on rationality and knowledge. This study explains the views of Simon and Polanyi and traces their disparities to differing underlying philosophical perspectives. Simon's research emphasized cognition over action, explicit knowledge over tacit knowledge, mechanistic information processing over human judgment, and means over ends. Polanyi provides counterbalancing emphases for each of these orientations in his explanation of skillful performance. The latter portion of this study draws conclusions about the perspectives of Simon and Polanyi and identifies implications for research on rationality and knowledge management.

Title: The Emergent Organization: Primary and Complex Metaphors in Theorizing about Organizations
Author-Name: Joep P. Cornelissen
Author-Name: Mario Kafouros
Abstract: We argue that complex metaphors in organization theory are made up of smaller primary metaphors or metaphorical parts that form the atomic components of the molecular structure of complex metaphorical thought. Using examples from organization theory, we demonstrate that (a) complex metaphors are made up of primary metaphors that are often grounded in our embodied experiences as human beings; and that (b) complex metaphors can be dynamically elaborated, extended and reinterpreted in novel ways. Metaphorical thought thus emerges from primary metaphors and evolves over time which is a perspective that is more alive to changes in the social construction of organizations than the traditional view of stable `root' categories of metaphorical thought that pervade organization theory.

Title: Embodied Generosity and an Ethics of Organization
Author-Name: Philip Hancock
Abstract: In this essai I address the subject of organization and ethics. In contrast to both the Kantian legislative tradition, and the idea of organizational virtue, both of which are predominant within contemporary accounts of business ethics, I argue for an ethics of organization based on the principles of recognition. Such an ethics would be both intersubjective and embodied, sensitive to what Diprose (2002) has described as corporeal generosity. In doing so, I lay claim to a set of ontologically a priori conditions in order to provide an alternative ethical foundation for modes of organizing, as well as a retort to more mundane assumptions about the ethical character of organizational life.

Title: Contractarian Business Ethics: Credentials and Design Criteria
Author-Name: Ben Wempe
Abstract: Contractarian business ethics (CBE) is in great vogue in the present study of corporate morality. Its stated ambition is to provide better practical guidance than the more general ethical theories of business ethics, such as Kantianism, pragmatism, utilitarianism, virtue ethics or the stakeholder model. But how good is this new trend in business ethics theorizing? This article aims to assess CBE's credentials as a social contract argument. For this purpose, it embarks on a comparative analysis of the use of the social contract model in two earlier domains: political authority and social justice. Building on this comparison, it then develops four criteria for any future CBE. To apply the social contract model properly to the domain of corporate morality, it should be: (1) self-disciplined, i.e. not aspire to results beyond what the contract model can realistically establish; (2) argumentative, i.e. provide principles that are demonstrative results of the contractarian method; (3) task-directed, i.e. it sho...

Abstract: Since the publication of Birger Wernerfelt's seminal article on the `Resource-based view of the firm' in 1984, the strategic management field has embraced the notion that firms are fundamentally heterogeneous in terms of their resources and internal capabilities. This paper assesses the development of the resource-based view (RBV) of the firm from Wernerfelt's own perspective. Given his limited engagement in the strategic management field over the previous decades, we asked Wernerfelt to revisit his work and to comment on the critical issues which have subsequently arisen as the RBV has developed into a dominant paradigm in strategic management.

Abstract: Exploiting the potential and tackling the problems of resource-based and competence-based research, this paper develops a proposal for a competence-based theory of the firm (CbTF). The CbTF is based on the fundamentals of market process theory and is independent of existing approaches to explaining the nature of the firm. The paper addresses the basics of the theory in terms of the philosophy of science by referring to the Lakatos model and the position of CbTF in organization theory. The fundamental question of the nature of the firm is approached by the notion of an organizational `ambiente' and by using findings of entrepreneurship research.

Title: Organizational Capabilities, Patterns of Knowledge Accumulation and                 Governance Structures in Business Firms: An Introduction
Author-Name: Giovanni Dosi
Author-Name: Marco Faillo
Author-Name: Luigi Marengo
Abstract: The capability-based view of the firm is based on the assumption that firms know how to do things. Assuming the existence of a thing called `organizational knowledge', in the first part of the paper we identify its main building blocks and we provide a description of its inner structure. This results in an analysis of the relationships among key concepts like organizational routines, organizational competencies and skills. In the second part, we consider some empirical implications of the adoption of a capability-based view of the firm in dealing with issues like horizontal and vertical boundaries of the firm, innovation and corporate performance. Some implications for strategic management are also discussed.

Title: Strategy as Evolution with Design: The Foundations of Dynamic Capabilities and the Role of Managers in the Economic System
Author-Name: Mie Augier
Author-Name: David J. Teece
Abstract: This paper discusses the intellectual roots of the dynamic capabilities framework. We draw on insights from Edith Penrose as well as others in order to help explain the essence of the business enterprise, and how it can escape the zero profit trap. We see the business enterprise as being in part a product of its own history, but not completely so. Managers can shape outcomes and are not completely trapped by prior decisions and investments. We call this `evolution with design', leaving room for both evolutionary processes as well as intentional design. This conclusion is consistent with Penrose's contributions to the theory of the firm.

Title: Reappraising the Nature of the Firm: The Role and Influence of Lexical and Structural Ambiguity
Author-Name: Neil Kay
Abstract: In this paper it is argued that lexical ambiguity (where a word can have two or more separate meanings) and structural ambiguity (where a phrase can have two or more separate meanings) have profoundly affected the development of the theory of the firm and the economics of organization. We focus particularly on Coase's agenda as to what constitutes the nature of the firm, and argue that intellectual resources have been misallocated in this field of inquiry because of endemic problems of lexical and structural ambiguity. We suggest how the agenda could be restated and redirected. It is concluded that resource-based economics, organizational decision theory and transaction cost analysis (in the broadest sense) should not be seen as potentially competing perspectives or frameworks in analysis of the nature of the firm, but instead as valuable and complementary tools for such analysis.

Title: A Communicative Theory of the Firm: Developing an Alternative Perspective on Intra-organizational Power and Stakeholder Relationships
Author-Name: Timothy Kuhn
Abstract: Existing theories of the firm exhibit significant shortcomings when questions turn to intra-organizational power and extra-organizational relationships — two issues central to understanding firm operations. Here I advance an alternative view, founded on the Montreal School of organizational communication's conception of conversation—text relations, yet extending it in several ways. In developing a communicative theory of the firm, I highlight the functions of, and relations between, `concrete' and `figurative' texts, paying particular attention to their participation in the construction of an authoritative (yet never monolithic) system for cooriented and distributed action. Using examples drawn from struggles over power, strategy, and organizational form at GM, I show that seeing the firm in textual terms presents a very different view of its operations. Doing so, portrays individuals and collectives as engaging in sophisticated games where firms marshal consent and attract capital through textually media...

Title: Game Theory: Can it Unify the Social Sciences?
Author-Name: Yanis Varoufakis
Abstract: Social theorists from many different fields have hailed Game Theory as a framework that can unify the social sciences on a bedrock of mathematical reasoning, which relegates all previous attempts to provide a unifying framework for economics, political science, anthropology, organization theory etc. to social science's prehistory. After discussing in detail the five crucial theorems on which such claims are based, this paper assesses critically: (a) Game Theory's main results, and (b) the extent to which Game Theory offers a common method that can, potentially, unify the social sciences.

Title: Peripheral Vision
Author-Name: Yannis Stavrakakis
Abstract: Psychoanalysis, and especially the work of Jacques Lacan, has not been adequately utilized within organization studies. This paper argues that Lacan's teaching has the potential to enrich discussions within this field and to suggest fruitful orientations for future research. Analysing some of the central concepts and theoretical logics introduced by Lacan (such as lack, desire, the symbolic, enjoyment and fantasy), it explores the desire behind identity construction (agency), the reliance of this desire on processes of subjection to the socio-symbolic order (structure), as well as the limits marking both these domains. It argues that Lacanian theory can illuminate the (negative) dialectic between subject and organized Other and account for obedience and attachment to organized frameworks of social life in two ways: first, by focusing on the symbolic presuppositions of authority and power; and, second, by exploring the role of fantasy and enjoyment in sustaining them and in neutralizing resistance.

Title: The Role of Meetings in the Social Practice of Strategy
Author-Name: Paula Jarzabkowski
Author-Name: David Seidl
Abstract: This article addresses the recent turn in strategy research to practice-based theorizing. Based on a data set of 51 meeting observations, the article examines how strategy meetings are involved in either stabilizing existing strategic orientations or proposing variations that cumulatively generate change in strategic orientations. Eleven significant structuring characteristics of strategy meetings are identified and examined with regard to their potential for stabilizing or destabilizing existing strategic orientations. Based on a taxonomy of meeting structures, we explain three typical evolutionary paths through which variations emerge, are maintained and developed, and are selected or de-selected. The findings make four main contributions. First, they contribute to the literature on strategy-as-practice by explaining how the practice of meetings is related to consequential strategic outcomes. Second, they contribute to the literature on organizational becoming by demonstrating the role of meetings in sh...

Abstract: This is an ethnographic study of the Mystic Krewe of Spermes, which does float construction and a parade for Mardis Gras in New Orleans. We compare spectacular and carnivalesque elements of the organization in its preparation for and enactment of the annual parade. We show that both system-maintaining spectacular theatrics and system-challenging carnivalesque protest govern the event, which at once leads to opposition and tension, as well as acceptance and renewal within the krewe and its local audience. We discuss implications for critical organization studies, and the importance of the krewe as an indigenous organizational form.

Title: Embedded Ethics: Discourse and Power in the New South Wales Police Service
Author-Name: Ray Gordon
Author-Name: Stewart Clegg
Author-Name: Martin Kornberger
Abstract: In this paper we report an ethnographic research study conducted in one of the world's largest police organizations, the New South Wales Police Service. Our research question was, `How do forms of power shape organizational members' ethical practices?' We look at existing theories that propose the deployment of two interrelated arguments: that ethics are embedded in organizational practices and discourse at a micro-level of everyday organizational life, which is contrasted with a focus on the macro-organizational, institutional forces that are seen to have an impact on ethics. Resisting this distinction between the `micro' and the `macro', we build on these two bodies of knowledge to explain ethical change as deeply embedded in power relations that traverse the scale of social action.

Title: Struggling with Lack: A Lacanian Perspective on Organizational Identity
Author-Name: Michaela Driver
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to contribute to research on organizational identity by developing a psychoanalytic perspective. In particular, the author draws on Lacanian theorizing to explore how organizational identity discourse is informed by imaginary constructions of subjectivity. It is proposed that the collective construction of coherent, unitary, and definably organizational identity discourse is validated by and validates conscious but illusory constructions of the self. The resulting discourse is inevitably disrupted by unconscious subjectivity and invariably fails. Therefore, the collective construction of fragmented, dynamic, and emergent organizational identity discourse is equally inevitable. While such discourse can be illusory, it also contains the opportunity for engaging in liberating struggles with identity as lack. The implications of this perspective for the theory and practice of organizational identity are discussed.

Title: Participatory Improvement at a Global Bank: The Diffusion of Quality Teams and the Demise of a Six Sigma Initiative
Author-Name: David Strang
Author-Name: Dong-Il Jung
Abstract: This paper traces the diffusion of cross-functional process improvement teams in a multinational bank's Six Sigma program. Rates of team formation were high where clerical workers received low wages relative to managers and professionals, experienced weak wage growth, were less likely to rise into supervisory positions, and formed a shrinking proportion of bank employment; and where managerial and professional wage gains and employment growth were strong. These conditions did not provide a stable basis for participatory improvement, however, and team formation faltered in more stratified work-places over time. We argue that team projects are most useful to managers where recent or ongoing workplace restructuring has marginalized the position of clerical staff. In the long run, quality teams prove ephemeral due to tension between their participatory ethos and the technocratic project they embody.

Title: All My Relations: Understanding Perceptions of Justice and Conflict between Companies and Indigenous Peoples
Author-Name: Gail Whiteman
Abstract: Research on organizational justice typically investigates how perceptions of justice affect encounters between internal organizational actors, with few studies analyzing perceptions between firms and external stakeholders. In addition to a narrow focus on employer—employee relations, the organizational justice literature is dominated by western and European cultural perspectives. My paper addresses these gaps by exploring how justice theory may be useful in understanding conflicts between local Indigenous Peoples and multinational firms from the natural resource sector. I argue that this applied research problem can make a number of conceptual contributions to organization studies of justice. I illustrate how organizational justice theory applies within this new context, and also how indigenous cultural visions of justice enrich and challenge our very notion of organizational justice.

Title: The Roles of Competence Trust, Formal Contract, and Time Horizon in Interorganizational Learning
Author-Name: Steven S. Lui
Abstract: This study examines the roles of competence trust, formal contract, and time horizon on interorganizational learning. Two types of learning — knowledge accessing and knowledge acquisition — are first identified. I then evaluate the relative roles of competence trust and contract on these two types of learning. I further investigate how time horizon moderates their roles. The hypotheses are tested with a sample of 126 buyer—supplier relationships between the Hong Kong toy traders and their suppliers. The results show that knowledge accessing and knowledge acquisition have very different requirements on the competence trust and contract of an exchange relationship. These requirements also change with the time horizon of the relationship.

Title: `Being Regimented': Aspiration, Discipline and Identity Work in the British Parachute Regiment
Author-Name: Thomas Thornborrow
Author-Name: Andrew D. Brown
Abstract: This paper analyses how the preferred self-conceptions of men in an elite military unit — the British Parachute Regiment — were disciplined by the organizationally based discursive resources on which they drew. The research contribution this paper makes is twofold. First, we argue that preferred self-conceptions (i.e. desired identities) are mechanisms for disciplining employees' identity work, and analyse how paratroopers were subject to, and constituted by, the discursive practices of the Regiment. Paratroopers' preferred conceptions of their selves were disciplined by understandings both of what it meant to be a paratrooper and of the institutional processes by which they were made. In talking about how the Regiment `manufactured' them, paratroopers provided insight on how the Regiment produced and reproduced the idealized identities to which they aspired. Second, to complement other understandings of identities, we suggest that people are often best characterized as `aspirants'. An aspirational identi...

Title: Taking off the Heat: Narrative Sensemaking in Post-crisis Inquiry Reports
Author-Name: Thierry Boudes
Author-Name: Hervé Laroche
Abstract: Crises represent moments when sensemaking fails. Official reports of post-crisis analyses re-establish patterns of sensemaking. Whereas scholars agree on the narrative basis of post-crisis sensemaking, the means by which meaning is recreated about the confusing events have not been fully investigated. To fill this gap, empirical data are drawn from the series of investigations that took place after the sudden and deadly heat wave that occurred in France during the summer of 2003. Introducing tools from narratology, this article analyses how these reports restore meaning by addressing the following questions: What happened? Was it foreseeable? and Who is responsible? The key narrative choices implied are mapped. A typology of crisis plots is proposed. Building on this typology, the article demonstrates that successive reports progressively built a focused, simplified story about the crisis. Methodological and practical implications for scholars and practitioners using inquiry reports for research and learn...

Using in-depth data gathered on the Columbia shuttle flight, we describe the sensemaking processes that unfolded and discuss the implications for organizations.

Abstract: Risk is an important but under-investigated feature of organizations in Late Modernity. This paper introduces the Special Issue on Organizations and Risk in Late Modernity. The rationale for the special issue is discussed. An overview of important approaches to risk research and organizations is provided to frame the special issue. These approaches include the cognitive science approach, which takes a positivist perspective and assumes that risks are objective and knowable. This view is contrasted with socio-cultural theories based in work by Mary Douglas, Ulrich Beck, Anthony Giddens and Michel Foucault. Charles Perrow's organizational theory of the production of risk and accidents due to interactive complexity, and Karl Weick's theory of risk sensemaking, are then discussed. The paper then reviews the contributions of papers in the special issue and outlines issues for future research on risk and organizations.

Title: Organizational Risk after Modernism
Author-Name: Kent D. Miller
Abstract: This study identifies the modernist assumptions in organizational risk research, along with their historical origin and limitations. Risk research from a modernist perspective focuses primarily on individuals, treats risk preferences as exogenously given, attempts to quantify risk, assumes that risk reflects a given probability distribution, omits ethical considerations, and neglects actions by focusing on decision making. This study proposes a contrasting postmodern perspective on organizational risk. By this view, risk is a social and multilevel phenomenon; risk preferences, perceptions, and responses are learned; risk is subjectively perceived and often unquantifiable; the environment is a complex, socially constructed system; ethical considerations are integral to risk assessment and management; and organizations respond to risk through their actions, not just by making decisions. These themes motivate new directions for organizational risk research.

Title: Making Good Sense: Assessing the Quality of Risky Decision-making
Author-Name: Graham M. Winch
Author-Name: Eunice Maytorena
Abstract: How good are managers at making risky decisions? Recent research has identified this gap in decision-making research; this paper attempts to address this question in the context of risky decision-making. Following a review of the behavioural decision-making and sensemaking schools of research on risky decision-making, a research methodology is presented which is derived from a critique of the former school to address limitations of the research of the latter school. A combination of active information search and cognitive mapping was deployed to assess the performance of 45 project managers in identifying project risks. The findings show that some managers perform better than others at this type of decision-making due to the differences in the ways in which they tackle the problem. The concluding discussion argues that the two schools are more complementary than antithetical.

Title: Risk, Control and Gender: Reconciling Production and Reproduction in the Risk Society
Author-Name: Romaine Malenfant
Abstract: In the risk society, managing health risks underlines a social tension between a logic of rationalization and a logic of subjectivation. In the former, techno-scientific thought dominates and induces a certain form of dependence on scientific experts while, in the latter, the individuals tend to be seen to make independent choices to protect their health. This article examines the logics of the actors in the risk management process from a constructivist perspective. According to Dubet's sociology of experience, social experience is structured around three logics: the logic of integration, i.e. the social world seen through the membership group, role and social relations; the strategic logic, i.e. the social world seen as a market; and the logic of subjectivation, i.e. the ability to be a subject, to distance oneself from the surrounding world and to give meaning to one's actions and decisions. Our qualitative research involved the analysis of the discourse of workers and employers in relation to the risk ...

Abstract: In this century society faces increasingly large-scale accidents and risks emerging from our own wondrous technologies. Two prominent organizational approaches to safety, Normal Accident Theory and High Reliability Organizations, have focused attention on a variety of industries that deal with hazardous situations, developed concepts to explicate organizational structure and culture, and debated whether accidents are inevitable in complex systems. We outline these approaches and identify some limitations, including narrow definitions, ambiguity about key concepts, confusion of reliability and safety, and overly pessimistic or optimistic conclusions. We believe that the debate between NAT and HRO can become a more productive three-way conversation by including a systems approach to safety emerging from engineering disciplines. The more comprehensive systems approach clarifies the strengths and weaknesses of NAT and HRO and offers a more powerful repertoire of analytic tools and intervention strategies to m...

Title: Managing the Threat of Terrorism in British Travel and Leisure Organizations
Author-Name: Bridgette Sullivan-Taylor
Author-Name: David C. Wilson
Abstract: This paper examines the perceived threats from terrorism in six organizations in the travel and leisure sector in the UK. These organizations are particularly exposed to such extreme threats. This paper examines how managers in organizations deal with uncertainty where probabilities are impossible or difficult to define and examines how they face the challenge of interpreting and acting upon these interpretations. Theoretically the paper draws upon two lenses: organizational resilience and institutional perspectives. The former assumes managers can act autonomously to increase organizational resilience. The latter argues that systemic features of organization are more accurate explanations of why managers and organizations fail to spot threats and impending disasters. The data indicate that perceptions of uncertainty and threats from terrorism and theories of action differ in and between organizations depending upon factors such as the accuracy and completeness of information; previous experience of terro...

Title: The Construction of General Public Interest: Risk, Legitimacy, and Power in a Public Hearing
Author-Name: Cagri Topal
Abstract: The decisions of the economic actors in late modern society produce risks in addition to products and services. Thus, the parties likely to be affected by those decisions — individuals, communities, and society at large — seek to influence them. Public hearings are a key forum in society where this influence occurs. This paper uses a case study of a hearing to show how public hearings use legitimating practices to enact institutional power although they are commonly portrayed as risk-minimizing democratic mechanisms. Public hearings enact participation that is formal not substantive, create `public good' that serves particular not general interests, and use evaluation which is normative or value-based and not rational. Public hearings thus legitimate government and corporate institutions through the demonstration of citizen participation, general interest, and rational evaluation. These processes enact ideological or image-based legitimation by constructing an image of the general public. This legitimatio...

Title: Reputational Risk as a Logic of Organizing in Late Modernity
Author-Name: Michael Power

Author-Name: Kerstin Sahlin
Abstract: This paper argues that it is useful to regard `reputational risk' as a pervasive logic of organizing and organizational attention. First, we suggest that the risk management agenda has expanded from its roots in technical analysis to become a cornerstone of good governance and responsible actorhood. We illustrate this claim in the context of English universities. Second, we suggest that this expansion in the reach and significance of risk management has increased organizational orientations to reputational risk and to more defensively and legalistically framed forms of asset management. Specifically, organizations are responding to the growth of external bodies which evaluate and rank, and thereby generate reputational risk. In the context of universities, we argue that this leads both to specific transformations in organizational practices in response to ranking systems, and also to an increased generalized concern with reputational risk, which is a symptom of late modern insecurity.

Title: Emerging Institutions: Pyramids or Anthills?
Author-Name: Barbara Czarniawska
Abstract: In the present text, an institution is understood to be an (observable) pattern of collective action, justified by a corresponding norm. By this definition, an institution emerges slowly, although it may be helped or hindered by various specific acts. From this perspective, an institutional entrepreneur is an oxymoron, at least in principle. In practice, however, there are and always have been people trying to create institutions. This article describes the emergence of the London School of Economics and Political Science as an institution and analyzes its founders and its supporters during crises as institutional entrepreneurs. A tentative theory of the phenomenon of institutional entrepreneurship is then constructed by combining elements of sociology of translation, actor-network theory and garbage can model. The article concludes with a suggestion that the way institutional enterprises are narrated may differ from the way they are built, and a genre analysis can be of further help in understanding this...

Title: Power and Organizational Transformation through Technology: Hybrids of Electronic Government
Author-Name: Brian P. Bloomfield
Author-Name: Niall Hayes
Abstract: This paper considers the UK Government's major modernization programme for local government and its aim to use technology to bring about a radical transformation in the delivery of public services by joining up hitherto separate service departments and focusing the organization of services around the citizen. Drawing upon empirical fieldwork in the North of England, the paper seeks to shed light on the realization and operation of modernization and considers the issues of power and hybridity involved in the emplacement of new organizational configurations (`front office' contact centres and `back office' service departments) to handle citizen inquiries.

Author-Name: Jerry D. Goodstein
Author-Name: S. Ramakrishna Velamuri
Abstract: Drawing directly on Stinchcombe (1968, 1983) we study the interdependence between power and legitimacy in state—organization contests for maintaining institutional control. We focus on postcolonial sub-Saharan Africa and the dynamics between the Zimbabwean state and Econet Wireless Zimbabwe, a start-up private firm that challenged the state's rights to monopoly control over the telecommunications sector during the period 1993—1998. Our findings show that in contexts such as postcolonial settings, states use their power to dominate institutional sectors and maintain institutional control. We find as well that states can attempt to reinforce the legitimacy of their use of power and coercion through (1) securing critical property rights and embedding these rights in the state bureaucracy, and (2) calling on other `centers of power'. Finally, our study highlights the ways in which states and challenging organizations engage in various strategies of institutional work to maintain and disrupt, respectively, exi...

Title: Professions and the Pursuit of Transparency in Healthcare: Two Cases of Soft Autonomy
Author-Name: Charlotta Levay
Author-Name: Caroline Waks
Abstract: Contemporary professions are increasingly challenged to open up to scrutiny from the outside. Earlier research is focused on two main types of responses and consequences: colonization by a managerial logic of self-monitoring and decoupling of auditing and professional practice. This paper describes a different type of response which implies that professionals get actively involved in monitoring their own activities, without losing their professional autonomy. Two cases from Swedish healthcare were investigated: accreditation at a hospital laboratory and the national quality registries. In both cases, professional involvement took the form of translation and negotiation in expert networks, restrained by a certain resistance towards external monitoring, but driven by an interest in legitimizing and developing professional work. The resulting situation is characterized as a `soft autonomy' which combines professional internalization of originally non-professional auditing ideas with maintained professional c...

Title: In Search of Social Capital in State-Activist Capitalism: Elite Networks in France and Korea
Author-Name: Taeyoung Yoo

Abstract: This paper argues that the absence of high trust social capital has not prevented firms from performing well in economies with the dirigiste tradition. Despite low general trust, France and Korea have recorded sound growth rates and innovation performance, thus contradicting the central argument of social capital theory. Drawing on the dirigiste tradition, we suggest that elite networks of France and Korea are an idiosyncratic form of social capital, nurtured through their institutional arrangements such as low trust, concentrated power relations and state-run elite education. The elite networks enhance the coordination efficiency of economic relations through state activism, constituting an alternative to high trust social capital.

Title: Agrarian Origins of Management Ideology: The Roman and Antebellum Cases
Author-Name: Martin Ruef
Author-Name: Alona Harness
Abstract: Drawing on archival materials from the Roman Republic and US antebellum South, this paper challenges the distinction between research on `modern' and `pre-modern' management thought, where the former commonly entails a critical analysis of management thinking within a social context and the latter offers documentation of past knowledge and practices. Contrary to this division, we offer a critical analysis of management discourse taking place in agrarian societies based on chattel slavery. In the late Roman Republic and early empire, the patrician elite confronted challenges to their large-scale land ownership, run by hired managers upon the landlord's absence. In the antebellum South, following the Nat Turner revolt, plantation owners staved off threats from abolitionism and Northern political activists. These challenges led to a considerable effort devoted to the elaboration of principles regarding the private management of unfree labor. Texts not only provided practical managerial advice, but also promo...

Title: Strategy and Structure in Context: Universalism versus Institutional Effects
Author-Name: Jose I. Galan
Author-Name: Maria J. Sanchez-Bueno
Abstract: This study analyses the evolution in large firms' strategy and structure in a new spatial and temporal context (Spain 1993—2003). The central question of this work is to determine whether transformations undergone in this country have led Spanish companies' strategies and structures to converge with those of other European countries, following the predictions of `universalistic' theories of strategy and organization; or whether cultural/institutional effects have remained strong, following a path-dependence/cultural-lag type logic. The Spanish experience is particularly significant for theory in general because its late development and very distinctive institutional origins allow us to test theories applied before in a new country and more recent time period. Our findings show that a changing context (e.g. liberalization) has led Spanish firms to converge with those of other European economies in the pattern of strategy and structure (increasing levels of diversification and divisionalization). Thus, the ...

Title: Managing the Rivalry of Competing Institutional Logics

Abstract: We investigated an organizational field where competing institutional logics existed for a lengthy period of time. We identified four mechanisms for managing the rivalry of competing logics that facilitated and strengthened the separate identities of key actors, thus providing a way for competing logics to co-exist and separately guide the behaviour of different actors. We contribute to the institutional literature by showing that competing logics can co-exist and rivalry between logics can be managed through the development of collaborative relationships.

Title: After Reflexivity: Ethics, Freedom and the Writing of Organization Studies
Author-Name: Carl Rhodes
Abstract: Building on existing considerations of reflexivity in research writing, this essai seeks to reappraise the concept of responsibility in relation to the ethics of post-representational research methodology in organization studies. Jacques Derrida's discussions of responsibility and undecidability and Emmanuel Lévinas' distinction between the saying and the said are brought to bear on the ethics of the discursive construction of organizational research as a form of representing the Other. The essai argues that responding to reflexivity extends beyond textual practice and self-accounting towards a responsibility for the exercise of academic freedom. This freedom entails a radical openness that is operationalized in an ongoing reinvention that resists the institutionalization of the field of inquiry through a form of transformative knowledge. It is the legacy and promise of reflexivity in organization studies that can invigorate the imagination in research — its poiesis — as an ongoing project of saying the e...

Title: `The One-Company Approach': Transnationalism in an Israeli—Palestinian Subsidiary of a Multinational Corporation
Author-Name: Galit Ailon
Author-Name: Gideon Kunda
Abstract: This paper presents an ethnographic study of the Israeli—Palestinian subsidiary of a multinational hi-tech corporation. Critiquing the tendency of globalization theorists to conceptualize multinational corporations (MNCs) solely in terms of their impact on their external environment, this paper looks inward and examines the ideological and practical constituents of the transnational regime of consciousness as expressed through what management titles `the one-company approach'. We argue that this regime lays foundations for a transnational `imagined community' which does not rival the national one, but internalizes it, creating an arena of discretionary power for managers: deciding when to activate and when to suppress nationality in the global organizational universe. This study analyzes the relationship between transnationalism and nationalism inside the organization, and its implications for understanding MNCs' role in globalization.

Title: Researching Strategy Practices: A Genealogical Social Theory Perspective
Author-Name: Andreas Rasche
Author-Name: Robert Chia
Abstract: This paper explores the meaning and significance of the term `social practice' and its relation to strategy-as-practice research from the perspective of social theory. Although our remarks are also applicable to other practice-based discussions in management, we discuss strategy practices as a case in point and thus contribute to the strategy-as-practice literature in three ways. First, instead of simply accepting the existence of a unified `practice theory', we outline a genealogical analysis revealing the historical-contingent conditions of its creation. This analysis shows that social practices in general and strategy practices in particular can be approached from either a neo-structuralist and/or neo-interpretative perspective. Second, based on this theoretical argument, we discuss different characteristics of strategy practices and emphasize those aspects not yet fully considered by strategy-as-practice research (e.g. the physical nature of practices). Third, we show that, when studying strategy prac...

Abstract: This paper addresses the concept of serendipity in entrepreneurship, defined as search leading to unintended discovery. It conceptually delineates serendipity, showing how it is related to the entrepreneurship literature on prior knowledge and systematic search. The paper also discusses how serendipitous entrepreneurship relates to some aspects of evolutionary theory, socio-economic institutions, and social psychology. It is suggested that serendipity may be a quite prevalent feature of entrepreneurship and thus has implications for both research and practice.

Title: Managing Expert Knowledge: Organizational Challenges and Managerial Futures for the UK Medical Profession
Author-Name: Justin Waring
Author-Name: Graeme Currie
Abstract: The blurring of managerial and professional jurisdictions remains a significant area of organizational research. This process is often described as involving `re-stratification', the drawing of professional elites into bureaucratic roles; or `bureaucratization', the standardization of work operating procedures. We examine these processes further through considering how professional work is reordered through the application of knowledge management techniques, focusing in particular on the management of knowledge around clinical risk. We suggest attempts by hospital risk managers to manage medical knowledge towards organizational learning represent a significant challenge to clinical freedom, given the centrality of expert knowledge to professional autonomy. In considering this challenge, we are attentive to the idea that change occurs not through the top-down challenge of management, nor the bottom-up resistance of professionals, but through the dynamic mediation of these influences within a wider institut...

Title: Representational Predicaments at Three Hong Kong Sites
Author-Name: Robin Stanley Snell
Author-Name: May Mei-ling Wong
Abstract: Representational predicaments arise when a job incumbent believes that attributions and images assumed by dominant authorities unfavourably ignore, or disproportionately and unfavourably emphasize, aspects of the incumbent's own work and social identity. This is likely to happen when the incumbent does not have a close relationship with a dominant authority, and when power asymmetries give the former relatively little control over which aspects of their work and social identity are made visible or invisible to the latter. We draw on critical incident interviews from three organizations to illustrate a typology of six types of representational predicament: invasive spotlighting, idiosyncratic spotlighting, embedded background work, paradoxical social visibility, standardization of work processes, and standardization of work outputs. We analyse responses to representational predicaments according to whether they entailed exit, voice, loyalty, or neglect. Incumbents tended to respond with loyalty if they fel...

Title: Market Shaping as an Answer to Ambiguities: The Case of Credit Derivatives
Author-Name: Isabelle Huault
Author-Name: Hélène Rainelli-Le Montagner
Abstract: Building on Smith (1989), we describe the social processes surrounding a new financial OTC derivatives market,3 the market for credit derivatives. We show that in contradiction to more traditional derivatives, credit derivatives generate ambiguities of a cognitive and political nature. By conducting an in-depth longitudinal qualitative study from 1996 to 2004, we document the efforts made by the promoters of the market to alleviate these ambiguities and show how the size of resources needed results in the leadership of the most powerful. We thus provide a socially based explanation for the concentration and lack of transparency of the market. Our research exemplifies the contradictions between the rhetorical justification of financial innovations provided by financial theory and the empirical realities of a modern derivative market. It suggests that the actual structure of the market might best be understood by paying attention to the way different cognitive and political communities react to these contra...

Author-Name: Zelinna Pablo
Author-Name: Cynthia Hardy
Abstract: We examine the role of metaphors in relation to Web-based phenomena through a comparative study of 29 Web portals, established under a World Bank project known as the Development Gateway. Our analysis suggests that three metaphors — expert, market and community — are particularly significant across these portals, either separately or in combination. The study indicates three particular ways in which these metaphors can combine — merging, masquerading and morphing. We conclude by discussing the implications of using metaphor to understand how practitioners design Web portals and how users engage with them.

Title: Metaphor Analysis as an Approach for Exploring Theoretical Concepts: The Case of Social Capital
Author-Name: Daniel Andriessen
Author-Name: Claire Gubbins
Abstract: In many fields within management and organizational literature there is considerable debate and controversy about key theoretical concepts and their definitions and meanings. Systematic metaphor analysis can be a useful approach to study the underlying conceptualizations that give rise to these controversies and putting them in perspective. It can help identify the different ways a theoretical concept is structured and given meaning, provide insight into the way these different conceptualizations relate to each other, and show how these conceptualizations impact further theorization about the concept. This article describes the procedure for a systematic analysis of the metaphors used to conceptualize key theoretical concepts. To examine its usefulness, the authors apply the approach to the field of social capital, and in particular to the concept of ‘relationships’ in organizations. In the metaphor analysis of three seminal articles on social capital, the authors identify seven metaphoric concepts for re...

Author-Name: Stefan Heusinkveld
Author-Name: Hajo A. Reijers
Abstract: In this article we seek to develop a better understanding of how design knowledge development (DKD) ventures may gain ‘good currency’. The reflective cycle is generally considered to be a key element in the accumulation of design knowledge and crucial to the interface of science and design. However, the elements that may encourage or inhibit the enactment of this cycle in development ventures have received scant attention in the literature on organizational design. In our analysis, we show how DKD ventures face important barriers related to the institutional context and institutional entrepreneurship. We argue that the current conceptualizations and practices of knowledge development in organizational design need to pay much more attention to building legitimacy.

Abstract: We augment social exchange theory with dialectical theory to build a framework to examine corporate—social enterprise collaborations. These cross-sector collaborations represent a novel form of political-economic arrangement seeking to reconcile the efficient functioning of markets with the welfare of communities. We propose that corporate—social enterprise collaborations are shaped by (1) the value that each member of the collaboration attributes to their partner’s inputs, (2) competing practices and priorities intrinsic to the corporation and the social enterprise, and (3) expected benefits of the collaboration to each partner. For a synthesized state of collaboration to emerge and the partnership to be sustained, we posit that the antithetical forces inherent within the relationship must be resolved.

Title: Trust, Calculation, and Interorganizational Learning of Tacit Knowledge: An Organizational Roles Perspective
Author-Name: Martyna Janowicz-Panjaitan
Author-Name: Niels G. Noorderhaven
Abstract: Learning of tacit knowledge in an interorganizational context is a process fraught with risks for the collaborating partners. Two conflicting perspectives on what motivates partners to cooperatively share tacit knowledge with each other emerge from extant literature: one based on calculative considerations and the other on trust-based considerations. This paper aims to show that the two perspectives can be reconciled if the unique learning-related roles of boundary spanners at the corporate and operating levels are taken into account. Operating-level boundary spanners are the primary agents of tacit knowledge learning across organizational borders, and we argue that trust is the primary determinant of knowledge sharing at that level. In contrast, the corporate-level boundary spanners shape the structures and systems of the collaboration and thus affect the extent of sharing that can take place between operating-level boundary spanners. In this role, we propose, their learning behavior is predominantly dri...

Title: Institutional Translation through Spectatorship: Collective Consumption and Editing of Symbolic Organizational Texts by Firms and their Audiences
Author-Name: Kai Lamertz
Author-Name: Pursey P. M. A. R. Heugens
Abstract: We develop and corroborate the latent aspect of institutional theory that institutional spectators observe and reproduce inter-organizational symbolism. Prior research has explored whether institutional norms produce symbolic similarity across organizations, but assessments of whether such symbolic imagery is in fact monitored by institutional audiences are rare. Nonetheless, this process of institutional spectatorship represents an important foundation of various strands of institutional theorizing. Also, a better understanding of the ceremonial interactions between organizations and their spectators would help the field of institutional theory reconnect itself to its phenomenological origins. To advance our grasp of institutional spectatorship, we report a study of the Canadian beer brewing industry that shows how the symbolic self-presentations of breweries are reproduced by a central spectator: the news media. The results suggest that institutional spectatorship is an important dramaturgical process t...

Title: The Transformational Potential of Public Policy Discourse
Author-Name: Judy Motion
Author-Name: Shirley Leitch
Abstract: In this paper we examine the relationship between public policy, legitimacy and organizational identity in the context of a societal controversy. Public policy is theorized as a mode for effecting discourse transformations which offer new possibilities and rules for organizational legitimacy and societal relations. Our study highlights the legitimating function of public policy formation processes and possible legitimacy-appreciating and-depreciating identity attributes for organizations at the centre of controversy. We develop a macro-level understanding of discursive legitimacy and organizational identity, examining the broader societal context and associated democratic implications of power/knowledge and truth claims.

Title: Preaching, Teaching and Researching at the Periphery:Academic Management Literature in Turkey, 1970—1999
Author-Name: Behlül Üsdiken
Author-Name: S. Arzu Wasti
Abstract: Internationally accessible academic literature in management has been dominated very largely by contributions originating from the USA. Although this state of imbalance has attracted some discussion, little systematic research exists on scholarly activity in a large majority of countries that have limited presence in international academic outlets. To this end, we investigated the academic literature produced in Turkey over the last three decades, as an example of a country located at the periphery of management scholarship and where the management discipline developed under strong US influence. Based on a content analysis of articles published in local and international academic journals, cluster-analytic results indicated that the predominant form of scholarly output comprised a practice-oriented, nonempirical, de-contextualized literature, which served to transport American theories and practices to domestic audiences. The limitedly adopted scientific model manifested marginally greater interest in the...

Title: Enacting Fit in Work Organization and Occupational Structure Design: The Case of Intermediary Occupations in a Dutch Hospital
Author-Name: Marjolein van Offenbeek
Author-Name: Arndt Sorge
Author-Name: Marrig Knip
Abstract: We report and interpret findings from an investigation of work redesign and the introduction of a new occupational position, nurse practitioner (NP), in four different subunits in a large Dutch university hospital. Full development of the new position and its contribution to performance crucially depend on the delegation of medical tasks to NPs. The motive for introducing the new occupation and redesigning the work processes was to improve treatment quality and patient-centredness, to reduce throughput times and to assure operating efficiency. However, the degree and modality of reaching such objectives depends on the local politics of management and medical practitioners, resting on interpretations of appropriate roles and task divisions. Thus, task environmental influences affect work structure redesign as the former were perceived and enacted by local practitioners. The overall process of redesign and the way it differed between departments is best explained by combining a modified contingency theory w...

Title: Computers, Customer Service Operatives and Cyborgs: Intra-actions in Call Centres
Author-Name: Daniel Nyberg
Abstract: Organizational practice theorists have convincingly argued that the social and material, subjects and objects, are inextricable and co-emerge as the outcomes of practices or networks. My article engages with the debate in this field by explaining how, within these assumptions, discrete categories or actors are brought into being. The ethnographic field-work from call centres initially shows how customer service operatives and computers are entangled and inseparable in carrying out the practice of customer service calls. The findings then show how meaningful boundaries around actors are established through temporal delineations, or cuts, within practices. My study thus exposes the multiplicity of how employees make sense of surrounding technology. This contributes to organization studies by explaining the dynamics and fluidity that underlie the categories and actors which are taken for granted in contemporary workplaces. This also contributes to our appreciation of a labour process beyond dualisms.

Title: Towards an Understanding of Cognitive Coordination: Theoretical Developments and Empirical Illustrations
Author-Name: Nicolai Foss
Author-Name: Mark Lorenzen
Abstract: The cognitive dimension of institutions has been comparatively neglected in social science research. In particular, economists have concentrated on how institutions provide incentives. However, institutions also influence behaviours by influencing beliefs and expectations that help agents to overcome coordination problems. We explore various aspects of how institutions may align agents’ beliefs, concentrating on the role of analogies in interactive decision making, and how analogies grow from experience. We illustrate our reasoning by an empirical example.

Title: Crosscultural Life of Social Values and Organizational Analysis: An Introduction to the Special Themed Section

Abstract: ‘Crosscultural Life of Social Values’, a conference organized by the Rotterdam School of Management, Department of Organization Studies and Human Resource Management (Erasmus University, May 18—19, 2007) and International Association for Crosscultural Competence and Management (IACCM) signaled major challenges to the dominant theories of national and organizational cultures. Growing criticism of quasi-paradigmatic model of national culture (the Hofstedian canon) manifested increasing awareness of the need for a sustainable, ‘culturally attentive’ perspective on cross-cultural comparative studies. Latest AoM publications confirm post-paradigmatic shifts in theories of national and organizational cultures and in professionalization of cross-cultural competence.

Title: Dynamic Diversity: Variety and Variation Within Countries
Author-Name: Brendan McSweeney
Abstract: National models of social action over-privilege continuity and uniformity. They discount change — which they lack the capacity to explain (other than through exogenous shocks) — and neglect diversity within countries. This paper focuses on the national culture model which it argues requires commitment to illogical arguments and to suppositions which are theoretically and empirically untenable. An evaluation of each, it is argued, points to the existence of, and possibilities for, considerable national diversity and change — not pervasive and enduring national uniformity. Reflecting on the model’s rise and fall in anthropology, the paper also provides an outline explanation of its retention within organization studies and speculates about its future within that discipline.

Title: Multiplicity Across Cultures: Multiple National Identities and Multiple Value Systems
Author-Name: Monika Stelzl
Author-Name: Clive Seligman
Abstract: When we ask ourselves the question ‘Who am I?’, we usually utilize various self-descriptions through which we defined ourselves in the past. Those self-definitions may depend on group memberships, roles and social categories such as culture or religion. We were interested in the question of whether people with dual national identities associate distinct national value systems with each of those identities. In particular, we had focused on first and second generation Asian-Canadians and tested the hypothesis that distinct value systems are linked to each of one’s two national identities. Participants of South-East and East Asian origin or descent completed Schwartz’s (1992) value survey, once as Asians and once as Canadians. The participants revealed discrepancies in how they ranked the value types when instructed to do so as Canadians and as Asians. Specifically, the value types of universalism, self-direction, hedonism and stimulation were rated as significantly more important when participants were resp...

Title: Through Western Eyes: Insights into the Intercultural Training Field
Author-Name: Betina Szkudlarek
Abstract: Intercultural corporate training is a growing branch of the coaching and consulting industries and it appears to be both theory and practice driven. The growth of the relevant academic literature reveals a focus on the successful adaptation to host cultures and organizations, but little attention to the ethical dimensions of newly learned rules and newly accepted values. This article introduces a number of concerns related to ethical principles within this growing industry. The issues of profit-maximization, knowledge-access inequalities, the authenticity dilemma and the in-built Western bias of cross-cultural research are presented. Triggered by the author’s experiences in the intercultural corporate training industry and inspired by participation in a number of field-specific training-for-trainers events, this essai is an opening statement in a long-overdue discussion on ethics in intercultural training.

Title: Collective Development in Open-Source Communities: An Activity Theoretical Perspective on Successful Online Collaboration
Author-Name: Andrea Hemetsberger
Author-Name: Christian Reinhardt
Abstract: Online collaboration is often organized without strong predetermined rules or central authority, which is why coordination and ways of organizing cooperation become crucial elements of collaboration. This article investigates how online projects can overcome problems of dispersed work, solve inherent contradictions and utilize tensions in the activity system to develop collaborative artefacts and practices. Empirical evidence is based on a detailed observation of a successful open-source project — the K Desktop Environment (KDE). Our findings show that successful collaboration is based on coat-tailing systems. Coat-tailing means to inextricably bind together individual action and collective activity through careful design of complexes of technological, mental and cultural artefacts.

Title: Angelic Organization: Hierarchy and the Tyranny of Heaven
Author-Name: Martin Parker
Abstract: This paper suggests that one of the first influential legitimations of hierarchy comes from the writings of Pseudo-Dionysius, about 1500 years ago. Despite the fact that he was ordering angels, he suggests both ontological and political reasons for accepting that organization must equal hierarchy. This is an assumption that is rarely contested even today, and the idea of hierarchy is central to theories of organization, and justifications of managerialism. However, angels have been mutable creatures, and I employ some of their various incarnations in order to open up this 5th century common sense. I conclude by suggesting that angelic obedience should be treated with suspicion, and that other sorts of angels, particularly the fallen ones, might lead us away from the tyranny of hierarchy.

Title: The Absence of Cooperation Is Not Necessarily Defection: Structural and Motivational Constraints of Knowledge Transfer in a Social Dilemma Situation
Author-Name: Uwe Wilkesmann

Author-Name: Alfredo Virgillito
Abstract: There is a wealth of literature about knowledge transfer in general, but only a small amount deals with cultural and motivational factors of knowledge transfer. The main question of this article is: How can knowledge transfer be supported? First, we present a theoretical underpinning of knowledge transfer as a social dilemma situation. Second, we analyze how a situation of social dilemma can be overcome by means of structural and motivational solutions. Third, we provide empirical evidence from our survey in hospitals. These findings support three of our five hypotheses: direct channels for interaction, organizational culture, and intrinsic motivation are relevant requirements for knowledge transfer. Team size is not a significant factor for transferring knowledge in hospitals. Furthermore, our empirical findings differentiate between providing and obtaining knowledge. The last finding leads back to a modification of the theoretical framework.

Author-Name: Daniel W. Greening
Abstract: We develop a new perspective on entrepreneurship as a dynamic, complex, subjective process of creative organizing. Our approach, which we call ‘dynamic creation’, synthesizes core ideas from Austrian ‘radical subjectivism’ with complementary ideas from psychology (empathy), strategy and organization theory (modularity), and complexity theory (self-organization). We articulate conjectures at multiple levels about how such dynamic creative processes as empathizing, modularizing, and self-organizing help organize subjectively imagined novel ideas in entrepreneurs’ minds, heterogeneous resources in their firms, and disequilibrium markets in their environments. In our most provocative claim, we argue that entrepreneurs, by imagining divergent futures and (re)combining heterogeneous resources to create novel products, drive far-from-equilibrium market processes to create not market anarchy but market order. We conclude our exposition of each dynamic creative process by offering one possible direction for future...

Title: Struggles Over Legitimacy in Global Organizational Restructuring: A Rhetorical Perspective on Legitimation Strategies and Dynamics in a Shutdown Case
Author-Name: Niina Erkama
Author-Name: Eero Vaara
Abstract: Critical organization scholars have focused increasing attention on industrial and organizational restructurings such as shutdown decisions. However, little is known about the rhetorical strategies used to legitimate or resist plant closures in organizational negotiations. In this article, we draw from New Rhetoric to analyze rhetorical struggles, strategies and dynamics in unfolding organizational negotiations. We focus on the shutdown of the bus body unit of the Sweden-based Volvo Bus Corporation in Finland. We distinguish five types of rhetorical legitimation strategies and dynamics. These include the three classical dynamics of logos (rational arguments), pathos (emotional moral arguments), and ethos (authority-based arguments), but also autopoiesis (autopoietic narratives), and cosmos (cosmological constructions). Our analysis contributes to previous studies on organizational restructuring by providing a more nuanced understanding of how contemporary industrial closures are legitimated and resisted i...

Title: The Co-Evolution of Organizational Value Capture, Value Creation and Sustainable Advantage
Author-Name: Christos N. Pitelis
Abstract: Despite much progress, scholarship on organizations and strategic management remains unduly reliant on economic models such as the industrial organization (IO) market structure-based analysis. The focus of such models is on price-output determination by firms and the economy-wide efficient allocation of scarce resources, under conditions of full knowledge and certainty. This limits their usefulness for students of organizations who have wider concerns and also focus on organizations, as opposed to just markets. In this article, we aim to provide a framework for analysing the most fundamental, even existential, issue of organization studies and strategic management scholarship. This is whether and how the pursuit of value capture from economic agents who perceive that they possess appropriable value creating advantages, capabilities and action potential, can motivate the emergence of organizations and their strategies and actions intended to capture socially co-created value in conditions of real life.

Title: Making Sense Through Face: Identity and Social Interaction in a Consultancy Task Force
Author-Name: Gerardo Patriotta
Author-Name: Simona Spedale
Abstract: In this article we investigate the dynamic connection between individual and social processes of sensemaking in the context of group-based interaction. Drawing on Goffman’s theory of face-to-face behaviour, we develop two main arguments. First, the grounding of identity underlying group-based interaction typically involves repeated face games during which participants attempt to influence the patterns of interaction while maintaining a coherent image of self. Second, face games generate an ‘interaction order’ that has structuring properties and is therefore central to the social construction of sense within a group setting. We illustrate our contribution through an empirical study of face games and sensemaking within a consultancy task force. The study shows that the co-presence of participants during group-based interaction is in itself an occasion for sensemaking as it enacts language-based controversies that require composition through shared construction of meaning. In addition, our findings highlight...

Title: Lachmannian Insights into Strategic Entrepreneurship: Resources, Activities and Routines in a Disequilibrium World
Author-Name: John A. Mathews
Abstract: Recent contributions to the organizational literature see the radical subjectivist and disequilibrium framework of Ludwig Lachmann as providing a suitable foundation for strategic entrepreneurial studies, in that his approach seeks independence from conventional equilibrium-based reasoning. In a Lachmannian spirit, this article suggests that strategizing can fruitfully be viewed as choices made by the entrepreneur in terms of the organization’s constituent resources, activities and routines together with their recombinations and complexifications. Cast in a general, disequilibrium setting, the strategic goals that guide the organizational entrepreneur’s strategizing can be formulated in terms of the construction and capture of resource complementarities, the pursuit of increasing returns through activities reconfiguration, and the generation of learning and dynamic capabilities through reconfiguration of routines. Once formulated in this way, the strategizing issues may be seen to make sense not just in t...

Author-Name: Raffi Duymedjian
Author-Name: Charles-Clemens Rüling
Abstract: This article provides a conceptual underpinning for the study of bricolage in organizations. Based on a review of Claude Lévi-Strauss’s original writing, we propose that bricolage involves an ideal-typical configuration of acting (practice), knowing (epistemology) and an underlying world view (metaphysics) and develop the opposed ideal-types of the bricoleur and the engineer. We then explore and propose to distinguish two forms of collective bricolage—familiar and convention-based—depending on the type of interaction and the nature of the conventions employed. Finally, we highlight the tension between ideal-typical bricolage and general organizational norms and standards, and discuss both the bricoleur’s legitimacy and how a bricolage-based arrangement might be embedded into an organizational context.

Abstract: How do organizational factors influence knowledge retention and storage within companies? In this study, we examine the influence of organizational structure on organizational memory. We are specifically interested in the effects of specialization and standardization—dimensions of the organizational structure—on organizational memory as conceptualized by Walsh and Ungson (1991) and Argote (2005). This study is based on recent survey data from 122 respondents of multi-unit organizations that are mainly from the consulting, financial, automotive, and electrical industries. The results suggest that structural organizational factors, i.e. specialization and standardization as well as organizational processes such as codification and personalization of information and electronic communication influence organizational memory. Furthermore, the results show that codification of information fully mediates the relationship between standardization and organizational memory and that electronic communication partially...

Title: The Sacred in Leadership: Separation, Sacrifice and Silence
Author-Name: Keith Grint
Abstract: In attempting to escape from the clutches of heroic leadership we now seem enthralled by its apparent opposite—distributed leadership: in this post-heroic era we will all be leaders so that none are. This essay suggests that we need to reconsider the nature of leadership if we are to assess alternatives and a critical aspect is its relationship to the sacred. I suggest that the sacred nature of leadership is not so much the elephant in the room but the room itself—the space that allows leadership to work. Leadership embodies three elements of the sacred: the separation between leaders and followers, the sacrifice of leaders and followers, and the way leaders silence the anxiety and resistance of followers. The essay concludes that non-sacred governance systems are plausible but that the effort and responsibility required would politicize the private sphere and render radical alternatives—non-sacred leadership—only viable for short-term, small scale organizations. We need therefore to find ways of engaging...

Title: Organizational Theory Development: Displacement of Ends?
Author-Name: William McKinley
Abstract: In this essay I argue that organization theory has witnessed a significant displacement of ends over the last 30 years. Whereas in the 1960s and 1970s the dominant goal of the discipline was achieving consensus on the validity status of theories, today the overriding goal appears to be development of new theory. Formerly new theory development was considered a means to the end of attaining consensus on theory validity, but was not the only activity deemed necessary to accomplish that goal. In addition, instrumental standardization and replication were viewed as important. The contemporary displacement of ends toward new theory development creates the paradox that organization theory today is both epistemologically simpler (in terms of the intellectual activity deemed desirable) and more complex theoretically than it was 30 years ago. I discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the displacement of ends toward new theory development in organization theory, and offer some possible remedies that are designe...

Author-Name: Stephen Procter
Abstract: Organizational Memory Studies (OMS) is limited by its managerialist, presentist preoccupation with the utility of memory for knowledge management. The dominant model of memory in OMS is that of a storage bin. But this model has been rejected by psychologists because it overlooks the distinctly human subjective experience of remembering, i.e. episodic memory. OMS also fails to take account of the specific social and historical contexts of organizational memory. The methodological individualism that is prevalent in OMS makes it difficult to engage with the rapidly expanding sociological and historical literature in social memory studies, where a more social constructionist approach to ‘collective memory’ is generally favoured. However, for its part social memory studies derived from Maurice Halbwachs neglects organizations, focusing primarily on the nation as a mnemonic community. From a critical perspective organizations can be seen as appropriating society’s memory through corporate sites of memory such a...

Title: The Undecided Space of Ethics in Organizational Surveillance
Author-Name: Rick Iedema
Author-Name: Carl Rhodes
Abstract: While much contemporary organizational research has highlighted how surveillance and self-surveillance are dominant modes of attempting subjective control in organizations, in this article we consider whether ‘being seen’ harbours the potential to also engender an ethics that motivates care for self and other. This ethics resides in an ‘undecided space’— one where individual conduct and subjectivity are not decided by surveillance-based discipline but performed by active subjects in interaction with each other in relation to that discipline. We draw on fieldwork conducted in the spinal unit of a major hospital to explore and demonstrate the instability of the association between discipline and surveillance in organizational life. The article provides an account of how a video-based intervention in the hospital led to alternative conducts and outcomes. We consider examples of in situ practice that show clinicians being dynamically attuned to one another in response to the video study. The contribution of t...

Abstract: The study of practices has a long theoretical history and draws on a wide range of methods. This introductory essay sets the stage for the five articles presented in this Special Issue by explaining its background and providing one narrative of the theoretical background on which both its editors and the authors of its articles, in one way or another, draw and to which the latter make explicit or implicit reference.

Title: Pragmatism, Mead and the Practice Turn
Author-Name: Barbara Simpson
Abstract: ‘Practice’ is a familiar term in everyday language but it also has a long history of scholarship. What then does it mean to ‘turn’ towards practice, and how would we know when a practice turn has occurred? To answer these questions, this article develops a theoretical view of practice as a transactional social process involving experience and action as mutually informing aspects of human conduct. This perspective is elaborated in detail by drawing on the ideas of the pragmatist philosophers, especially George Herbert Mead. In particular, it is asserted that ‘transactionality’ and ‘temporality’ , when taken together, offer a theoretical perspective on practice that is dynamic, emergent and socially agentic. The utility of this pragmatist approach is illustrated using a published study of a strategizing episode. The article concludes that a practice turn is indeed underway in organization studies, but there is still some distance to travel before the full potential of this turn is realized.

Title: Returning to Practice Anew: A Life-World Perspective
Author-Name: Jörgen Sandberg
Author-Name: Gloria Dall'Alba
Abstract: Our understanding of organizations is being advanced by a diverse range of practice-based approaches. Many of these approaches are inspired by what can be called a life-world perspective, although they do not necessarily adopt this perspective throughout the research. In this article, we propose that adopting a life-world perspective can bring us closer to how practice is constituted. We argue that the performance of organizational practices can be more closely examined by bringing to the fore the manner in which practice is constituted through our entwinement with others and things in our world. In order to discuss how a life-world perspective can be used as a basis for such empirical and theoretical investigations, we compare it with one of the more advanced frameworks for practice within strategy research.

Title: Reshaping Practice Across Media: Material Mediation, Medium Specificity and Practical Knowledge in Judicial Work
Author-Name: Giovan Francesco Lanzara
Abstract: Material mediation and medium specificity are constitutive dimensions of a practice, having critical implications for the constitution of practical knowledge and the forms of institutionalization. This article explores their critical importance in a bureaucratized professional setting. Based on research findings from an in-depth study of the introduction of video-recording technology in criminal courts, the article investigates what happens in a practice when practitioners migrate to a different medium to perform their work. The findings indicate that when the practice is characterized by high medium specificity, the new medium may cause disruption in the domain of expertise, affecting the familiar objects, tools, routines and representations of the practice. In their efforts to make sense of the new medium and integrate the new work tool, practitioners reshape their practice by directly engaging with the medium and questioning the grounds of their domain of expertise. The article discusses the phenomenol...

Title: Zooming In and Out: Studying Practices by Switching Theoretical Lenses and Trailing Connections
Author-Name: Davide Nicolini
Abstract: This article contributes to re-specifying a number of the phenomena of interest to organizational studies in terms of patterns of socio-material practices and their effects. It does so by outlining a vocabulary and strategy that make up a framework for theorizing work and organizational practices. The vocabulary is based on number of sensitizing concepts that connote practice as an open-ended, heterogeneous accomplishment which takes place within a specific horizon of sense and a set of concerns which the practice itself brings to bear. The strategy is based on the metaphorical movement of ‘zooming in’ and ‘zooming out of’ practice. The zooming in and out are obtained through switching theoretical lenses and re-positioning in the field, so that certain aspects of the practice are fore-grounded while others are bracketed. Building on the results of an extended study of telemedicine, the article discusses in detail the different elements of the framework and how it enhances our capacity to re-present practi...

Title: Practice as a Members’ Phenomenon
Author-Name: Nick Llewellyn
Author-Name: Laura Spence
Abstract: Drawing on ethnomethodology and conversation analysis, this article explores the relation between practice and activity; between recruitment practice and the ordinary activities of the job interview. Job interviews are recognizably and accountably different from other interview-formats, such as broadcast news or academic research interviews. Such differences are instantly hearable because ordinary activities are built systematically so as to reveal an orientation to ‘practice’, distinctive purposes, entitlements, presuppositions, identities and definitions of acceptable conduct. The article illustrates analytic procedures for recovering such orientations and thus for understanding how people embed and reveal practice, with and for one another, in interaction. It is argued that the practice-turn should not overlook the fact that practice is, in the first instance, a members’ phenomenon, something that members draw upon, monitor and orient to in real time interaction.

Title: Imitation without Interaction: How Firms Identify with Clusters
Author-Name: Udo Staber
Abstract: Although shared identity occupies a central place in theorizing about regional business clusters, there has been little research on the processes by which identity is constructed. In particular, little is known about the role of imitation and its relationship to social interaction in managers’ identification with the cluster in which the firm is located. Drawing on economic and socio-economic approaches, I develop hypotheses concerning the effect of frequency-based and trait-based imitation on the strength of identification with the cluster. Using data on 146 small business owners in five mature textile clusters in south-west Germany, I find that both imitation modes strengthen identification, though to varying degrees. Contrary to much research on clusters, the regression results indicate that identification can be sustained even in the absence of cooperative social interaction.

Title: Dominant Corporate Agents and the Power Elite in France and Britain
Author-Name: Mairi Maclean
Author-Name: Charles Harvey
Author-Name: Robert Chia
Abstract: Corporate elites are not a new phenomenon. However, the ways in which significant agents gain ascendancy to positions of power vary across nations and cultures. This paper analyses the ascension of a small minority of corporate agents to positions of dominance and the subsequent accession of a select few to the power elite. Our theoretical position builds upon the writings of Pierre Bourdieu on power and domination. These constructs are elaborated and made tangible through a cross-national comparative study of dominant corporate agents in France and Britain. Our results demonstrate the extent to which power remains concentrated in the French and British corporate sectors; highlighting equally pronounced similarities and differences between the two countries. It is suggested that power elites function through governance networks to promote institutional and organizational goals.

Title: Narrative Construction as Sensemaking: How a Central Bank Thinks
Author-Name: Mitchel Y. Abolafia
Abstract: How do elite policy-making groups make sense of complex and ambiguous environments while remaining consistent with the group’s institutionalized operating model? This paper identifies a sensemaking process based in shared narrative construction. It is a social process of pattern recognition involving abduction, the comparison of culturally approved models to the current conditions to establish relevant facts and events; plotting, the reordering of those facts and events into a plausible narrative; and selective retention, the collective negotiation of a policy choice that fits the emerging narrative. This paper uses verbatim transcripts of meetings at the Federal Reserve to explore how policy makers use a logic of appropriateness to identify relevant cues and integrate them with existing models by weaving sensible plots. These plots are designed to control the supply of money and credit and maintain the legitimacy of the central bank.

Title: Spaces that Matter: Gender Performativity and Organizational Space
Author-Name: Melissa Tyler
Author-Name: Laurie Cohen
Abstract: This paper examines the relationship between gender performativity and organizational space. Specifically, it focuses on some of the ways in which gender is materialized in and through workspace in accordance with the dominant gender norms shaping organizational life, a theme that has been relatively neglected within organization studies to date. Judith Butler’s (1988, 1993, 2000 [1990], 2004) performative analysis of gender draws critical attention to the body as a medium through which the gendered subject is brought into being, or made to ‘matter’, as she puts it. This paper seeks to extend Butler’s analysis of gender performativity, focusing on the evocation and materialization of these norms through the gendered inhabitation of organizational space. Inspired by a piece of work by contemporary video artist Sofia Hulten called Grey Area, it develops Butler’s analysis with reference to data generated in a series of focus groups and interviews with women working in diverse roles within a university settin...

Title: St Paul’s Conversion: The Aesthetic Organization of Labour
Author-Name: Bent M. Sørensen
Abstract: This paper compares the Italian Renaissance painter Caravaggio’s two versions of the Conversion of Saint Paul (1600/1601) with two modern models of organization. These comparisons show how organization is produced in art through ‘aesthetic landscaping’ (Gagliardi 2006), and in particular how these artistic reproductions convey certain images of the appropriate modern, entrepreneurial self and regimes of organization. The painting was originally commissioned by the Catholic Church, but it rejected the first and accepted the second version. The paper claims that this strategy strengthens the given organization of the Church and the Church’s strategic influence on the believers that adore the painting. But this all comes with a price, namely, the production of a number of strict divisions: in the accepted version, Paul becomes a pure transcendent spirit. Isolated from his surroundings, his servant and his horse, he is cut off from the very event of conversion. The rejected version harbours radically differen...

Title: The corporeality of practice-based learning
Author-Name: Ali Yakhlef
Abstract: Practice-based approaches to learning and knowing can be credited with their contribution to, among other things, establishing the social basis for human cognition, action and interaction. However, although they emphasise the (ontological) significance of practice, inter/action and activity as the basis of learning and knowing, little attention has been paid to the body — that which makes all doing and performs all action. The aim of the present study is to suggest a corporeal ground for a practice-based learning theory. The body is regarded as our link to the practical (social and material) world, and is thus the medium of learning and knowing. Drawing on Merleau-Ponty’s (1962; 1964; 1968) advanced phenomenology learning is viewed as a process of incorporating and absorbing new competencies and understandings into our body schema, which in turn transforms our ways of perceiving and acting. Learning is corporeal, pre-discursive and pre-social, stemming from the body’s perpetual need to cope with tensions ...

Title: Polyphony and its Other
Author-Name: Hugo Letiche
Abstract: A post-deconstruction ethics of honoring, respecting, and/or theorizing anOther via a concept of polyphony seems very attractive to organizational studies (De Cock and Jeanes 2006; Clegg et al. 2006). Many organizational studies intellectuals prefer ‘reasonableness’ and/or ‘historical meanings’ as an object of study to a more empirical one. This rhetorical strategy (amongst others) has claimed polyphony as a leading concept, celebrating dialogue, diversity, and intertextuality. But, as Gayatri Spivak has indicated, it is necessary to ask if anOther speaks at all in such practices. Spivak (1999) explores polyphony in terms of the subaltern and her (his) representation, making use of différance to clarify what a many-voiced perspective actually could imply. In this article, I deconstruct two organizational studies articles on polyphony, making use of Spivak’s insights.

Title: Marketing Identities: Shifting Circles of Identification in Inter-organizational Relationships
Author-Name: Nick Ellis
Author-Name: Sierk Ybema
Abstract: This study explores the discursive positioning of managers involved in inter-organizational relationships (IORs) within industrial supply chains. In closely examining a series of interviews, we find a number of interpretive repertoires of boundary construction used in IOR managers’ identity discourse. Our analysis of these repertoires suggests that, although the development of IORs apparently signals the emergence of ‘widening circles of identification’, distinction drawing and boundary setting is as much a part of managers’ IOR talk as boundary transcendence. IOR managers can thus be seen as ‘boundary bricoleurs’ who discursively mark different self/other boundaries that varyingly position themselves, and their colleagues, competitors, customers and suppliers, as ‘inside’ or ‘outside’ the organization, the market, the relationship or their field of expertise. In this tensile positioning, they forestall closure on their identity by constantly shifting identifications, sometimes within the same stretch of ...

Author-Name: Bob Kijkuit
Author-Name: Jan van den Ende
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the dynamics of networks of employees in the front end of the new product development process. So far, the literature has focused on network structure and has argued that sparse (low density) networks of weak ties are optimal for idea generation. In this paper we include both network structure and network content, and we emphasize the importance of strong ties, density, range, seniority and decision-maker involvement in specific phases of the front end in an environment of uncertainty, ambiguity and tacit knowledge. To test our assumptions, we mapped the full networks of 17 ideas for new product development projects over time in a longitudinal study in two research laboratories. For specific phases of the front end, we found confirmation of our expectations. In addition, it appeared that particularly strong ties between different units advance the adoption chances of ideas. The managerial implication of this latter finding is that communication with good acquaintances or frien...

Title: How Do Fields Change? The Interrelations of Institutions, Networks, and Cognition in the Dynamics of Markets
Author-Name: Jens Beckert
Abstract: Sociological approaches to the economy identify three types of social structures relevant for the explanation of economic outcomes: social networks, institutions, and cognitive frames. This article contributes to the development of a framework which aims at an integrated perspective on the social structuring of markets and their dynamics. Based on the field concept, the article discusses the interrelations between the three types of structures as a source of the dynamics of markets. Bringing the complex and possibly contradictory character of the different social structures to the center of attention highlights spaces for innovation which are anchored in the social organization of markets but remain obscure in approaches that focus on only one of the structures. The simultaneous inclusion of social networks, institutions, and cognitive frames makes it possible to address how actors employ resources gained from one of these structures in the field to reconfigure other parts of the social structure in a way...

Title: Effective Punishment Through Forgiveness: Rediscovering Kierkegaard’s Knight of Faith in the Abraham Story
Author-Name: Neil Remington Abramson
Author-Name: Yaroslav Senyshyn
Abstract: Scheler (1973) proposed a model of punishment intended to re-establish a reconciled relationship between a harm doer and the person(s) harmed. Punishment was followed by genuine forgiveness, seeking genuine repentance from the harm doer, leading to the reconciliation of the relationship. This paper proposed that only a punisher having the character of a Knight of Faith (Kierkegaard 1985) could effectively implement this punishment process. The Abraham story provided an illustration of how a Knight of Faith (God) rehabilitated his relationship with Abraham using punishment and forgiveness. This process is, at an individual level, similar to one applied by Nelson Mandela in the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission (Tutu 2000). It is argued that this process is more effective in achieving reconciliation and re-establishing effective relationships than traditional retributive approaches as typified by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, enacted in response to the Enron and WorldCom scandals.

Title: The Past in Play: Tradition in the Structures of Collaboration
Author-Name: Paul Hibbert
Author-Name: Chris Huxham
Abstract: Inter-organizational collaboration has been argued to present as many complex challenges as it tries to solve. In this paper, we explore the role of tradition in these challenging and problematic contexts. In particular, we are concerned with the ways in which traditions emerge, endure or change in relationship with (and in the context of) collaborative structures. Our research in three collaborative situations indicates that traditions can be found at work in collaboration at a range of temporal depths amongst overlapping groups, networks and societal structures. Through the characterization of the different temporal depths of traditions and their relationship to collaborative structures, this paper develops a theory of the role of tradition in collaboration. In particular, through drawing out the effects of the different forms of tradition in collaborative network structures, this study also yields insights for the theory and practice of interorganizational collaboration.

Title: Talk of change: Temporal contrasts and collective identities
Author-Name: Sierk Ybema
Abstract: While temporality is generally acknowledged as a critical ingredient in processes of identity formation, studies of identity talk usually assume collective identity is essentially about establishing or facilitating a sense of temporal self-continuity. These studies do not detail how organizational actors might recast their identity narratives and reflectively put together stories about a changing or changed identity. The ethnographic research presented in this article reports how the editors of a Dutch national newspaper constructed their newspaper’s identity in temporal discontinuity talk, discursively constructing a contrast between the ‘old’ and the ‘new’, between legacies from a common past and plans for the future. As the organizational identity literature is primarily focused on talk of temporal continuities, I draw on studies of organizational change and nostalgic and ‘postalgic’ narratives in order to develop an understanding of the temporal dimension of collective identity talk that does not rule...

Title: Resisting a corporate code of ethics and the reinforcement of management control
Author-Name: Sven Helin
Author-Name: Johan Sandström
Abstract: This study is about how a corporate code of ethics travels into a multinational corporation’s subsidiary, focusing on how members of the subsidiary recontextualize, relabel and explain the code (to themselves and others). What emerges is the story of a code that is disliked by its receivers, but yet signed by them all, avowing that they have ‘read, understood and accepted’ it, thereby reinforcing the parent’s control system. We argue that this seeming contradiction can be explained in terms of the receivers resisting the code by distancing themselves from it through the devaluation of (i) social referents, (ii) the code’s core ethical content and (iii) the expected outcome of implementing the code. These distancing practices enable the receivers to position themselves as outside of power, which, in turn, enable them to sign the code.

Title: Building an Institutional Field to Corral a Government: A Case to Set an Agenda for Organization Studies
Author-Name: Stephen R. Barley
Abstract: Although organizational theorists have given much attention to how environments shape organizations, they have given much less attention to how organizations mold their environments. This paper demonstrates what organizational scholars could contribute if they were to study how organizations shape environments. Specifically, the paper synthesizes work by historians, political scientists and students of corporate political action to document how corporations systematically built an institutional field during the 1970s and 1980s to exert greater influence on the US Federal government. The resulting network, composed of nine distinct populations of organizations and the relationships that bind them into a system, channels and amplifies corporate political influence, while simultaneously shielding corporations from appearing to directly influence Congress and the administration.

Title: The Circulation of Ideas across Academic Communities: When locals re-import exported ideas

Abstract: The circulation of ideas across academic communities is central to academic pursuits and has attracted much past scholarly attention. As North American-based scholars with European ties, we decided to examine the impact of Organization Studies in North American academia with the objective of understanding what, if anything, makes some Organization Studies articles more likely to have impact in North America than others. To set the stage for better understanding the role of Organization Studies in this academic community, we first present the key characteristics of North American academia. Secondly, relying on archival data spanning the first 29 years of Organization Studies (1980 to 2008, inclusive), we identify an apparent dynamic of select re-importation of exported ideas. Put otherwise, top North American journals tend to re-import ideas authored (and exported) by select North American scholars in Organizations Studies. Thirdly, we discuss the implications of this process on the field of organization s...

Title: Organization Studies: A Space for Ideas, Identities and Agonies
Author-Name: Yiannis Gabriel
Abstract: In this piece I argue that Organization Studies, like other academic journals, is not a sovereign subject able to chart its own path and make sovereign decisions on its strategy and direction. Instead, the journal is seen as embedded in complex networks of institutions and practices over which the editorial team has limited control; chief among them are the conventions of peer review, the proliferation of academic journals, the escalating pressures on academics to publish and the ceaseless struggle to improve ranking and citations. A useful way of looking at the journal is as a place where, following different institutional practices, ideas arrive, settle and meet each other, sometimes fight it out or, more often than not, decide to coexist in a civilized and polite way. Like the spaces of large cities, journals too become spaces crucial for the formation of individual and group identities, something that is accompanied by much agonizing about quality, acceptance, purity, contamination and even annihilati...

Title: Organizing Studies: Publications, Politics and Polemic
Author-Name: Christopher Grey
Abstract: This paper explores the relationship between European and North American publication in the organization studies field by means of a political analysis of the constitution of centres and margins. This analysis is rooted in the historical development of business schools and their search for academic status which, in turn, is refracted through the globalization of business schools and the emergence of ranking systems for journals and business schools. The consequences of these developments are critically assessed in terms of their tendency to be exclusionary and conservative to the detriment of intellectual innovation within organization studies.

Title: Thirty Years of Organization Studies: Enduring Themes in a Changing Institutional Field
Author-Name: C.R. Hinings
Abstract: Over its 30 years of existence, Organization Studies has embodied three enduring themes, namely: a desire and respect for diverse theoretical perspectives and methodological approaches; a concern with the study of organizations, organizing, and the organized in and between societies; sustaining an interdisciplinary range. These three interrelated themes constitute the core identity of Organization Studies and EGOS — indeed, constituting the idea of a distinctive European identity. The paper traces how these themes have survived as the field of academic scholarship and publishing in organization and management has changed, in particular: the emergence of international business school ranking systems; the development of the US Academy of Management into a more and more international body; and even greater influence or hegemony of the United States in organizational and management scholarship.

Abstract: We take the 30th birthday of Organization Studies, the publication outlet of the European Group of Organization Studies (EGOS), as an opportunity to reflect on what European-ness in organization research means at times of globalization where territory and geographic boundaries increasingly lose their relevance for scholarly identity. In particular, we explore the openness of scholars and journals for grand ideas from different linguistic communities and the distinct profile of Organization Studies in this respect. We confirm that research building on ‘grand’ thinkers represents a central feature of European organizational scholarship and Organization Studies in particular.

Title: Between Contending Perspectives and Logics: Organizational Studies in Europe
Author-Name: Behlül Üsdiken
Abstract: With early characterization of the 1970s in the background, this paper examines change and differentiation within organizational studies in Europe over the last three decades. In doing so, it draws upon theories on change in scientific fields and institutional ideas in organizational analysis. The two main questions asked are (a) whether there has been change in theoretical perspectives, research practices and societal contextualization and (b) whether these have been uniform across Europe. The empirical part of the study is based on a content analysis of the articles published by European authors in the journal Organization Studies over its 30-year life-span. Overall, results show an initial movement away from US-based ‘mainstream’ to UK-based ‘alternative’ perspectives, tempered more lately by a renewed influence of the former; a marked shift towards research practices shaped by a ‘subjectivist’ logic; and a decline in societal contextualization. Findings also demonstrate, however, that organization stu...

Abstract: Previous research showed that short initial interaction in dyads accurately predicts future relation development. The paper extends these results from dyads to teams and demonstrates that data collected from short initial contacts (reciprocal relational preferences) are a sound basis for designing effective teams. In the approach we propose, potential team members have short initial contacts (popularly known as ‘speed dating’) and we use the information on interpersonal evaluations to create teams by maximizing the number of reciprocal relational preferences within a team. In a sample of 76 teams (N = 378, 36 attribute-based teams and 40 team-dating teams), we show that teams formed based on relational data are more effective than teams formed by maximizing within team diversity (gender and nationality). Team-dating teams show a better teamwork quality and develop more complex collective knowledge structures compared with attribute-based teams.

Title: The Stretch of Strategic Management Discourse: A Critical Analysis

Abstract: This article investigates the stretch of strategic management discourse, accomplished through writing economic development into the umbrella of strategic management. Building on the notion of authors as institutional entrepreneurs, I use discourse analysis methodology to analyze selected texts by Michael Porter that accomplish this discursive stretch. Findings illustrate the reality produced by the stretch of strategic management discourse, the discursive mechanisms used to accomplish this stretch, and how these mechanisms are concealed. I conclude with implications for future research investigating instances of stretch of strategic management discourses and for critical approaches to strategic management and economic development.

Title: Work Group Effort and Rewards: The Roles of Organizational and Social Power as Context
Author-Name: Randy Hodson
Abstract: Self-managing teams have a history of mixed effects for the employees involved. Organizational contexts reflecting different constellations of power may be useful for understanding these different outcomes. We theorize two different organizational mandates (management-initiated versus craft) and three social contexts (union presence, abusive management, and minority concentration) that may be consequential for work group outcomes. Content analysis of the population of workplace ethnographies (N = 204) provides data with a combination of organizational variability and rich in-depth descriptions of work group outcomes useful for evaluating these expectations. Union environments are found to be essential for the most positive team outcomes. Minority concentrated work groups benefit especially from the craft organization of work. And management abuse dramatically undercuts any positive consequences of management-initiated teams for employees. We conclude with a discussion of the centrality of power for unders...

Abstract: Our study provides an analysis of role transition, examining how macro-level influences and micro-level practice interact in framing role transition, with a focus upon professional identity. Empirically, we examine the case of nurses in the English NHS, for whom government ‘modernization’ policy has opened up a new occupational position in the delivery of genetics services within a professional bureaucracy. We track the experiences of the nurses through their recruitment to, enactment of, and progress on from, the new genetics role over two years. Our qualitative interview-based study encompasses six comparative cases. Analysis draws upon two linked literatures — role and identity, and sociology of professions — to examine the tension between the identity expected by the profession and the role expected by government policy-makers. While policy encourages reconfiguration of roles and relationships to support the new, less-bounded role, concerns aligned to professional identity mean that inter-professional...

Title: Comparing Organizational Routines as Recurrent Patterns of Action
Author-Name: Brian T. Pentland

Abstract: This paper demonstrates that patterns of action are a fruitful basis for an empirical science of organizational routines by analyzing data from the invoice processing routines in four Norwegian organizations. Invoice processing is a highly institutionalized activity, governed by accounting rules and subject to audit. These four organizations use the same technology for the same task, yet the patterns of action generated by the routines are significantly different. We analyze the patterns in terms of individual events, pairs of events, and whole sequences of events, and at two different levels of abstraction. We discuss the implications of this approach for theories of routines as genes, and for an empirical science of organizational routines.

Author-Name: Mayer N. Zald
Author-Name: Michael Lounsbury
Abstract: Over the past half century, organizational studies scholarship has increasingly drifted away from addressing broader societal and political issues, as well as an interest in developing policy-relevant recommendations. In this paper, we argue that the time is ripe for a systematic re-engagement with how the dynamics of economy and society are fundamentally shaped by various elites, new forms of expertise, and their command posts — centers of societal power that regulate, oversee, and aim to maintain social order. Recalling early efforts by C. Wright Mills and his contemporaries, we call for the development of an institutional approach to the study of elites and command posts that draws on contemporary theories of power and culture to inform the creation of a new body of knowledge to inform our understanding of policy making and implementation. Drawing on a diverse array of sociological literatures and examples, the institutionalist agenda we lay out requires research that goes beyond a focus on any particu...

Author-Name: Paula Jarzabkowski

Author-Name: Andreas Georg Scherer
Abstract: The relationship between theory and practice has been discussed in the social sciences for generations. Academics from management and organization studies regularly lament the divide between theory and practice. They regret the insufficient academic knowledge of managerial problems and their solutions, and criticize the scholarly production of theories that are not relevant for organizational practice (Hambrick 1994). Despite the prevalence of this topic in academic discourse, we do not know much about what kind of academic knowledge would be useful to practice, how it would be produced and how the transfer of knowledge between theory and practice actually works. In short, we do not know how we can make academic work more relevant for practice or even whether this would be desirable. In this introduction to the Special Issue, we apply philosophical, theoretical and empirical perspectives to examine the challenges of studying the generation and use of academic knowledge. We then briefly describe the contri...

Title: Shaping a Constructivist View of Organizational Design Science
Author-Name: Marie-José Avenier
Abstract: The so-called rigor—relevance gap appears unbridgeable in the classical view of organization science, which is based on the physical sciences’ model. Constructivist scholars have also pointed out a certain inadequacy of this model of science for organization research, but they have not offered an explicit, alternative model of science. Responding to this lack, this paper brings together the two separate paradigmatic perspectives of constructivist epistemologies and of organizational design science, and shows how they could jointly constitute the ingredients of a constructivism-founded scientific paradigm for organization research. Further, the paper highlights that, in this constructivist view of organizational design science, knowledge can be generated and used in ways that are mutually enriching for academia and practice.

Abstract: In this paper we seek to show how aspects of the thinking underpinning the relevance debate can be self-defeating. We consider the relationship between academics and practitioners from a dialogic perspective and perform a textual analysis of the ways in which ‘pro-relevance’ academics write about research. We use role analysis techniques to highlight the potential for mismatched expectations between academics and practitioners, and then consider an illustrative dialogue between practitioners and academics to develop our view that relevance has its roots in generative dialogic encounters. We conceptualize a modified view of dialogue in the context of organizational research relationships, which we believe offers a useful starting point for co-production of knowledge and understanding.

Author-Name: David Knights

Abstract: This paper contributes to the current debate on the relevance of academic research to organizational practice but departs from the conventional view of perceiving the problem as one of improving the diffusion of knowledge from research to practice. Two theoretical lenses — Mode 2 and actor network theory — are drawn upon to examine case vignettes of the authors’ involvement in academic—practitioner collaborations. The resulting analysis assists us in understanding the production of knowledge relevant to practitioners and, by implication, has the potential to free industry—academic collaborations of unrealistic demands.

Title: Knowledge and Practice: Organization Studies within a Historical and Figurational Context
Author-Name: Tim Newton
Abstract: Drawing on the work of Norbert Elias, this paper argues that attention to the historical and ‘figurational’ context of organization studies is necessary in order to understand the impact of its scholarship on management practice and public policy. This perspective is used to question conventional wisdom about the ‘failings’ of the organization studies field. In particular, attention is paid to (1) questioning the argument that the impact of organization studies is limited by its pluralism; (2) related paradigm incommensurability debates; (3) challenging other supposed limitations of the field, such as a tendency toward ‘fads and fashions’. In addition, it is argued that high impact may be associated with fields that have low control, and that single overarching strategies may be ineffective in raising impact. In presenting such argument, emphasis is placed on the significance of the dominant logics of governance of particular historical eras. In so doing, the paper draws attention to the need to consider ...

Title: That’s Relevant! Different Forms of Practical Relevance in Management Science
Author-Name: Alexander Nicolai
Author-Name: David Seidl
Abstract: Recently there has been an intense debate amongst scholars on how to increase the practical relevance of research. Although the notion of ‘relevance’ is frequently mentioned in the literature, it is hardly ever defined and may have different, even contradictory, meanings in different contexts. This article presents a taxonomy of different forms of relevance, based on a textual analysis of the ‘relevance literature’ and of a set of 450 articles in three leading academic management journals that are renowned for their practical relevance. The main categories of this taxonomy are then discussed against the background of different aspects of the social dynamics of science in order to ascertain the forms of relevance that can justifiably be expected from management science.

Author-Name: Jacky Swan

Author-Name: Sue Newell
Author-Name: Sue Dopson
Abstract: Institutional change has been characterized as the outcome of a dialectical process whereby different constituent communities within an organizational field promote competing institutional logics (Seo and Creed 2002). However, the dynamics of this dialectical process are poorly understood. In this paper, we examine this dialectical process by drawing upon a longitudinal study of a policy intervention in the UK aimed at promoting a logic of knowledge production in genetics science (termed here as ‘Mode 2’; cf. Nowotny et al. 2001) that was co-present, and competing, with the dominant logic surrounding the production of academic science (‘Mode 1’). We highlight the tensions and interplays that occurred between these competing institutional logics by examining the rhetoric that was propounded, and the actions incurred, and their effects, amongst constituent communities of policy makers and scientists. Our findings demonstrate, first, that tensions can exist within as well as across constituent communities wi...

Title: Theorizing as Engaged Practice
Author-Name: Mike Zundel
Author-Name: Panagiotis Kokkalis
Abstract: This paper examines the relationship between theory and practice and suggests that organization studies remain largely preoccupied with a notion of ‘theory’ as an abstract, generalized concept. This preoccupation ignores the essentially engaged character of all practices, including those of academic theorizing. Drawing on the premises of practice theory, we outline a view of theorizing as engaged practice. In doing so, we are faced with two key implications. First, this view emphasizes the activities that make up the practice of ‘theorizing’, thus shifting the focus from reifying separations of distinct realms of ‘theory’ and ‘practice’ towards an appreciation of the myriad of overlaps between academic and organizational practices. Second, the practice perspective forwarded in this paper illuminates the problems experienced in attempts to transfer academic work to organizational practice. We suggest that this perspective invites us to more fundamentally revise our understanding of the possibilities of rel...

Title: Explaining Discontinuity in Organizational Learning: A Process Analysis
Author-Name: Hans Berends
Author-Name: Irene Lammers
Abstract: This paper offers a process analysis of organizational learning as it unfolds in a social and temporal context. Building upon the 4I framework (Crossan et al. 1999), we examine organizational learning processes in a longitudinal case study of an implementation of knowledge management in an international bank. This learning trajectory shows complex multilevel learning dynamics, in which we identify discontinuities where micro-processes of organizational learning are interrupted or do not progress from level to level. These discontinuities are explained by dynamics and tensions in the social and temporal structures enacted in the learning processes. Time is thereby revealed as a key dimension in the process and politics of organizational learning. The discontinuities in the micro-processes of learning render organizational learning fragmented and transient.

Abstract: This paper examines how context shapes team work within the public-service professional bureaucracy. We examine the effects of an interaction between both macro-institutional and local-organizational context upon the micro-negotiation of team work. Specifically, we consider how features of local context mediate professional-institutional effects. Drawing upon neo-institutionalism (Lawrence and Suddaby 2006; Powell and DiMaggio 1991), we view team members as ‘institutional agents’ (Scott 2008), shaping team work in ways that either reproduce or transform professional structures within particular local conditions. Exemplary of international government transformative efforts for public-service enhancement (Newman 2001; Osborne and Gaebler 1992), we focus upon a UK government initiative to reconfigure professional relationships through introducing team work in National Health Service genetic care. Findings from two qualitative, comparative case studies reveal contrasting outcomes: reproduction or transformati...

Title: Construing Organizational Identity: The Role of Embodied Cognition
Author-Name: Celia V. Harquail
Author-Name: Adelaide Wilcox King
Abstract: This paper presents a theory of organizational identity based on embodied cognition. Embodied cognitive science focuses on developing theories that reveal how humans’ capacities to process information and gain knowledge are functions of bodily experiences. What members come to know about an organization is a function of what they physically experience, as well as what is in their heads. We propose and examine four embodied capacities that members use to construe what they believe is central, distinctive, and enduring about their organizations. We suggest this approach reveals an important fourth dimension of OI: that an individual’s construal of organizational identity must also be ‘substantiated’ or verified by a member’s embodied experiences. We consider how an embodied construal of OI might add to three dominant perspectives on OI, and discuss how it might expand our understanding of six OI-related topics, ranging from individual organizational identification to large-scale organizational change. We cl...

Title: Performance Pinned Down: Studying Subjectivity and the Language of Performance
Author-Name: Casper Hoedemaekers
Author-Name: Anne Keegan
Abstract: We draw on Lacan’s notion of language to study employee subjectivity in a public sector organization (Publica) in the Netherlands. Our main contribution lies in using Lacan’s theorization of language and subjectivity as a basis for a detailed textual analysis of how local organizational discourses shape and inform the subjectivities of employees. We situate our approach within the literature on subjectivity, language and power in work organizations before describing how we carried out interviews to elicit interviewees’ accounts of performance management. The mechanisms of metonymy and punctuation, two central features of a Lacanian conceptualization of language, are analysed by means of a relational analysis of key performance signifiers that we identify in the interview texts. We show how the signification of performance in Publica is pinned down by a central empty signifier which can be understood as a ‘quilting point’ and serves as a site for employee desire and identification. Finally, we show how des...

Abstract: Despite the widespread use of strategy workshops in organizations, few empirical studie examine this phenomenon. The limited research that exists also lacks a theoretical basi for explaining why some workshops achieve their espoused purpose while others do not We offer a theoretical model of strategy workshop dynamics and outcomes by drawin on theories of ritual and ritualization. Our central argument is that variations in charac teristics of ritualization such as the degree of removal, the use of liturgy and the role o specialists influence behavioural dynamics within workshops and thereby the extent t which their purpose is achieved. This perspective extends research on the episodic natur of strategy development and contributes to a theoretically informed view of strategy practices

Title: Institutional, Industry and Power Effects on Integration in Cross-border Acquisitions
Author-Name: Monia Mtar
Abstract: Drawing on comparative institutional theory, this paper examines post-acquisition integration in international acquisitions, which has seldom been examined through this perspective. Based on a longitudinal and comparative study of three blue-chip French acquirers in the UK that shared similar integration intentions but realized those to varying degrees, this paper theorizes this variation in integration outcomes as a dynamic interplay of institutional distance, market structure and power dependencies. Whilst all important, those effects do not equally explain integration outcomes and can only be understood in conjunction with one another. Thus, contrary to a core assumption of institutional theory that institutional distance is consistently a dominant influence on multinational firms’ behaviour, the study shows that its effect is varied. It will only become extremely constraining when the market structure is highly localized, and both dynamics combine to make the acquirer largely dependent on the target f...

Title: The Knowledge Base of Products: Implications for Organizational Structures
Author-Name: Muge Ozman
Abstract: This paper investigates the impact of two dimensions of product knowledge bases on organizational structures. The first dimension, knowledge breadth, measures the complexity of a product. The second dimension, knowledge depth, measures the extent to which the knowledge embedded in the product can be used in different contexts. An agent-based simulation study is carried out to analyse the structural characteristics of organizations that emerge when self-interested agents select partners to combine their expertise and produce together. Agents learn from their interactions, which shapes their choice of partners in the future. The results reveal that multi-product companies with fewer inter-firm relationships emerge when products are complex and knowledge is highly reusable in different contexts. A network of specialized firms is a dominant organizational structure when products are complex and deep. The results are demonstrated through a brief case study of the history of the computer industry.

Title: Seeing More and Seeing Differently: Sensemaking, Mindfulness, and the Workarts
Author-Name: Daved Barry
Author-Name: Stefan Meisiek
Abstract: The past years have seen a marked rise in arts-based initiatives in organizations, a field we term the workarts. In this paper, we review the workarts in light of sensemaking theory, and especially the role of mindfulness within it. We propose that the workarts foster mindfulness by directing attention away from immediate work concerns and towards analogous artifacts. We identify three distinctive workarts movements — art collection, artist-led intervention, and artistic experimentation. In each movement, we find analogous artifacts that defamiliarize organizational members’ habitual ways of seeing and believing, enabling them to make new distinctions and to shift contexts: to see more and see differently. Our review raises a number of questions for the workarts in particular and research on analogical artifacts in general.

Abstract: This paper explores the underlying practices whereby rationality — as defined in rational choice theory — is achieved within organizations. The qualitative coding of 58 case study reports produced by decision analysts, working in a wide range of settings, highlights how organizational actors can make decisions in accord with the axioms of rational choice theory. Our findings describe the emergence of ‘decision-analysis’ as a field and reveal the complex and fragile socio-technical infrastructure underlying the craft of rationality, the central role of calculability, and the various forms of bricolage that decision analysts deploy to make rational decisions happen. Overall, this research explores the social construction of rationality and identifies the practices sustaining the performativity of rational choice theory within organizations.

Title: Building ‘Bonds’ and ‘Bridges’: Linking Tie Evolution and Network Identity in the Creative Industries
Author-Name: Maria Daskalaki
Abstract: This paper presents a discussion of network identity in relation to the processes of network transformation in the creative industries. Employing the case of semi-permanent work patterns prevalent in creative projects, the paper suggests that repeated collaborations across projects result in volatile cultural and structural relations among network members. Transformations in patterns of relating are linked with shifts in network identity and members’ perceived creative potential. Future work could empirically test whether an optimal mix or a pattern of affective bonding and anti-conformist bridging could be linked to creative potential in semi-permanent work teams.

Title: Cross-cultural Differences in Compensation Level and Inequality across Occupations: A Set-theoretic Analysis
Author-Name: Thomas Greckhamer
Abstract: Compensation level and compensation inequality, as central aspects of modern organizations, are vital for organization studies. Previous research has investigated various aspects of compensation systems, but few studies have taken a cross-cultural perspective. I address this need for cross-cultural research by studying compensation and culture utilizing a configurational approach, investigating combinations of cultural and macro-environmental attributes associated with differences in compensation level and compensation inequality. I apply fuzzy set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA) to analyze country-level data encompassing four occupational groups (cleaners, secretaries, mid-level managers, and senior managers) from 44 countries. Findings show configurations of cultural dimensions, development, and welfare state that are sufficient for high compensation level and compensation inequality among these four occupations. Implications for future cross-cultural research on compensation are discussed.

Title: Inter-epistemic Power and Transforming Knowledge Objects in a Biomedical Network
Author-Name: Gerry McGivern

Abstract: We examine a multidisciplinary network established to translate genetics science into practice in the British NHS. Drawing on theory about epistemic communities and objects, we describe three stages in their lifecycle (vision/formation, transformation and reincarnation) and epistemic clashes over knowledge objects. Medical academics captured jurisdiction over the network at formation, through their superior knowledge of the nascent genetics discipline, producing epistemic objects reflecting their interests. A governmental community challenged medical academics for jurisdiction but, unable to transform objects by changing their space of representation in performance reporting, ceased funding the network, which then closed. Afterwards, however, a NHS community successfully ‘reincarnated’ a discarded epistemic object into a technical object in NHS practice. We make a theoretical contribution by developing a processual framework for understanding biomedical innovation, focusing on transforming objects situate...

Title: Foucault’s Care of the Self: A Case from Mental Health Work
Author-Name: Julian Randall
Author-Name: Iain Munro
Abstract: This research concerns mental health workers who treat the victims of sexual abuse. The health workers were all part of a forum composed of doctors, counsellors and a community psychiatric nurse, who met to discuss issues of best practice in their everyday work. The research examined how these workers make sense of their work, particularly in terms of how they understand the concept of care and the kinds of knowledge that they use in their work, professional and otherwise. A great deal of scepticism was expressed concerning the traditional medical approaches to caring for the victims of abuse, and as a consequence these practitioners developed pragmatic and exploratory approaches to caring in order to help their clients. Many important similarities exist between the accounts given by the medical and voluntary practitioners of this forum and the insights of Michel Foucault’s genealogical studies of medicine, particularly his analysis of processes of normalization and his later work on the care of the self....

Predicted relationships were drawn from prior theory that identified cognitive and motivational mechanisms through which culture manifests its influence. The dominant forms of psychological contracts were evaluated against predictions based on the national-level cultural values of vertical and horizontal individualism and collectivism in four countries. Results of interviews with 57 participants indicated that French interviewees (vertical individualist) described their psychological contracts as primarily exploitive, Canadians (horizontal individualist) as primarily instrumental, Chinese (vertical collectivist) as primarily custodial and Norwegians (horizontal collectivist) as primarily communitarian. Exploration of the conditions under which patterns deviated from those predicted by the theory indicates potential areas for future theoretical development.

Title: Transparency in Academic Recruitment: A Problematic Tool for Gender Equality?
Author-Name: Marieke van den Brink
Author-Name: Yvonne Benschop
Author-Name: Willy Jansen
Abstract: Gender research has made a call for more transparency and accountability in academic recruitment and selection in order to overcome the inequality practices that have led to an underrepresentation of women among full professors. This paper provides insight into the multiple ways in which the notions of transparency and accountability are put into practice in academic recruitment and selection, and how this has enhanced — or hindered — gender equality. The methods employed consist of a qualitative content analysis of seven recruitment and selection protocols, interviews with 64 committee members, and an analysis of 971 appointment reports of full professors in the Netherlands. Our analysis contributes to the study of organizations in three respects. First, it shows that recruitment and selection processes are characterized by bounded transparency and limited accountability at best. Second, it explains that the protocols that should ensure transparency and accountability remain paper tigresses, because of t...

Title: Temporary Derailment or the End of the Line? Managers Coping with Unemployment at 50
Author-Name: Yiannis Gabriel
Author-Name: David E. Gray
Author-Name: Harshita Goregaokar
Abstract: Based on fieldwork conducted at the outset of the 2008 economic downturn, this paper examines the experiences of a group of unemployed managers and professionals in their fifties. Following a review of existing literature, the authors use a narrative methodology to explore how these people incorporate the experience of job loss into their self-images and identities. They identify certain core similarities in the experiences of unemployed professionals and then discern three narrative strategies through which unemployed professionals tried to make sense of their dismissal and sustain their sense of selfhood. The term ‘narrative coping’ is proposed as a way of describing each unemployed professional’s struggle to construct a story that offers both meaning and consolation. The study reveals that individuals expressing the most profound despair (those for whom job loss was the ‘end of the line’) were those whose stories had achieved ‘closure’. By contrast, most of those who maintained more open-ended narrativ...

Title: Essai: From Iron Cages to Liquid Modernity in Organization Analysis
Author-Name: Stewart Clegg
Author-Name: Carmen Baumeler
Abstract: Historically, the metaphor of the iron cage, as a key component of Weber’s sociological imagination, has played a central role in organization studies. It did so both in its initial role in the sociology of bureaucracy and in its reinterpretation in institutional terms. More recently, there have been claims that the metaphors should change. The implications of this for the analysis of organization are the subject of this paper. To address these changes, we draw on debates that have been current in the sociology of consumption, where there is an emergent consensus that there has been a shift to an increasingly liquid modernity. We ask, what are the implications of liquid modernity when viewed not solely in the sphere of consumption but when we shift focus back to the sphere of production — to organizations?

Title: Death and Organization: Heidegger’s Thought on Death and Life in Organizations
Author-Name: Patrick Reedy
Author-Name: Mark Learmonth
Abstract: Mortality has not been given the attention it deserves within organization studies. Even when it has been considered, it is not usually in terms of its implications for own lives and ethical choices. In particular, Heidegger’s writing on death has been almost entirely ignored both in writing on death and writing on organizational ethics, despite his insights into how our mortality and the ethics of existence are linked. In this paper, we seek to address this omission by arguing that a consideration of death may yield important insights about the ethics of organizational life. Most important of these is that a Heideggerian approach to death brings us up against fundamental ethical questions such as what our lives are for, how they should be lived and how we relate to others. Heideggerarian thought also reconnects ethics and politics, as it is closely concerned with how we can collectively make institutions that support our life projects rather than thwart or diminish them.

Title: Where Constructionism and Critical Realism Converge: Interrogating the Domain of Epistemological Relativism
Author-Name: Ismael Al-Amoudi
Author-Name: Hugh Willmott
Abstract: The paper interrogates the status, nature and significance of epistemological relativism as a key element of constructionism and critical realism. It finds that epistemological relativism is espoused by authorities in critical realism and marginalized or displaced in the field of management and organization studies, resulting in forms of analysis that are empirically, but not fully critically, realist. This evaluation prompts reflection on the question of whether, how and with what implications epistemological relativism might be recast at the heart of critical realist studies of management and organization.

Title: Telling Tales of Relations: Appreciating Relational Constructionism
Author-Name: Dian Marie Hosking
Abstract: The terms social constructionism and (social) constructivism are employed in the context of different problematics and different philosophical assumptions. This article presents ‘relational constructionism’ as a social science perspective. The perspective centres language-based relational processes as they (re)construct more or less local relational realities. The latter includes western individualism and its construction of the bounded, separately existing individual relating to a separately existing other where ‘other’ is everything which is not self; this has been called ‘hard’ self-other differentiation. The perspective of relational constructionism allows that ‘soft’ self-other differentiation also is possible — for example, in the practice of relationally engaged inquiry and change work. Relational constructionism, as outlined here, has a number of distinctive features: it clearly speaks about ontology and power (unlike many other constructionisms); it centres and gives ontology to construction proc...

Title: Wittgenstein, Heidegger and Drawing Lines in Organization Studies
Author-Name: Robin Holt
Author-Name: Frank Mueller
Abstract: We argue that when considering questions of ontology in organization studies, much can be gained by issuing reminders of the normative conditions by which meanings are fixed. In attempting to fix meaning and the conditions of meaning epistemologically, however, critical realist and social constructionist positions tend to eschew such normative considerations and assert instead how the fixity of meaning is related to causal powers on the one hand, or to discursive habit on the other. In both cases there is an urge to extend from, and somehow complete, organizational experience by drawing what we call general lines. The critical realists do this by distinguishing the necessary from the contingent, the social constructionists by arguing language goes all the way through making such a distinction impossible. Enlisting arguments and concepts from Heidegger and Wittgenstein, as well as discussing the illustrative case of the rights and wrongs of cigarette production, we suggest an alternative normative framing ...

Title: The Value of Intra-organizational Social Capital: How it Fosters Knowledge Transfer, Innovation Performance, and Growth
Author-Name: Indre Maurer
Author-Name: Vera Bartsch
Author-Name: Mark Ebers
Abstract: While most literature promotes a positive impact of social capital on various organizational performance outcomes, empirical results on the social capital—organizational performance link are not conclusive. We propose that one reason for the discordant findings is that research has largely not accounted for the mediating process steps that translate social capital into organizational performance outcomes. We suggest that organizational performance outcomes of organization members’ social capital hinge on the mediating processes of resource mobilization, assimilation, and use. An empirical study of 218 projects in the German engineering industry supports our theoretical model. Findings show that knowledge transfer (conceptualized as the mobilization, assimilation, and use of knowledge resources) mediates between organization members’ intra-organizational social capital and organizational performance outcomes of growth and innovation performance. The present study thus contributes to a deeper understanding ...

Author-Name: Frank Mueller

Abstract: This paper puts forward a discursive devices approach to analysing the linguistic practices involved in the translation of management ideas. The paper draws on empirical data from a study of a quality improvement initiative in a UK public—private partnership. To illustrate our argument, we examine the discursive devices skilfully employed by two change champions during a training session to introduce staff to the new quality regime. Drawing insights from the field of discursive psychology, we analyse how a variety of discursive devices, such as footing, are employed to translate the idea during dialogue between sellers and recipients. We suggest that skilful variation can play a relevant role in the translation of management ideas.

Title: Power as Practice: A Micro-sociological Analysis of the Dynamics of Emancipatory Entrepreneurship
Author-Name: David Goss
Author-Name: Robert Jones
Author-Name: Michela Betta
Author-Name: James Latham
Abstract: This paper contributes to a recent movement to reframe entrepreneurship theory into a more critical and reflexive mode. It builds on the processual notion of entrepreneuring-as-emancipation to theorize a balanced conception of agency and active constraint rooted in the notion of power rituals. We develop a micro-sociological analysis of power rituals that conceives power reproduction and entrenchment as a ‘practice-based’ activity that focuses on what power holders and subordinates concretely do, think and feel. This makes emotion a key dimension of entrepreneurial agency and redefines constraining barriers to agency in terms of a social process of ‘barring’. This novel approach is illustrated using an autobiographical account of a social entrepreneurship project. On the basis of this analysis, a number of insights are provided into the ways in which the power-as-practice approach can inform wider debates in organization studies where the notions of agency and constraint are linked to issues of power and ...

Author-Name: Nicolette van Gestel
Author-Name: Bas Hillebrand
Abstract: Based on an in-depth, longitudinal case study involving the public employment services in the Netherlands, we provide a novel conceptual imagery of how pluralistic fields may evolve over time. Our study shows how multiple institutional logics remain in play after a dominant logic is settled in an organizational field. We uncover several factors that explain the process of temporary stability and change and focus especially on two factors — negative choice and deliberate ambiguity — that explain ongoing change. These factors solve the struggle between competing logics, but simultaneously sow the seeds for further subsequent change. This study contributes to the institutional logics perspective beyond competing logics to the study of how fields with plural logics evolve.

Title: Rage against Self-replicating Machines: Framing Science and Fiction in the US Nanotechnology Field
Author-Name: Nina Granqvist
Author-Name: Juha Laurila
Abstract: Research in the sociology of science has increasingly begun to acknowledge the role that external influences play in shaping the boundaries and content of science. However, a scarce understanding still prevails with regard to the role of peripheral, popular movements in the emergence of scientific fields, and of professional fields in general.Through their attention to boundary work, scientific fields also provide a fruitful yet neglected context to study how actors engage in efforts to alter frames in order to adjust and negotiate community boundaries. This qualitative study of the emergence of the US nanotechnology field from 1986 to 2005 makes several contributions to knowledge about these issues. First, our study shows that peripheral, popular movements open up avenues for scientific fields by generating understanding and receptivity for novel ideas through story-telling, which gives rise to their cultural embeddedness. Second, we find that by capitalizing on such culturally embedded concepts, scienti...

Abstract: This paper deals with the role of institutions in the development of trust in relationships between organizations. We review various strands of literature on organizational trust and examine the assumptions made about how trust building processes are influenced by institutional arrangements. Following this conceptual analysis, we discuss four mechanisms that are pivotal in the development of institutional-based trust. We also examine four situations where the influence of institutions can be particularly conducive to building trust. Finally, we argue that each of the situations calls for specific mechanisms to be predominantly employed in order to effectively create trust in inter-organizational relationships.

Abstract: Orthodoxy holds the emergence of the Human Relations ‘school’ in interwar America as a response to the alleged inhumanity and simplistic innovation the Scientific Management tradition was striving to develop within the workplace. This paper challenges this orthodoxy and argues that the Human Relations school was in fact a right-wing and decidedly undemocratic innovation that was developed in response to the demand from organized labour that workers be ceded an active and significant part in management decision making. Invoking actor-network theory and specifically Callon and Latour’s sociology of ‘translation’ to organize our historical data, our primary objective is to explain how Mayo and the Human Relations school were able to translate the prevailing context and in so doing create a forum in which powerful actors came to agree that the Human Relations school was an innovation worth building and defending. Our central argument is that Human Relations school presented conservative business leaders such ...

Abstract: This paper studies the responses of a traditional Brazilian firm to recession and increasing foreign competition as expressed in its subcultural dynamics. A strong association was found between involuntary turnover in the top management team and affiliation with certain clusters of subcultural and even personal values. Although many of the effects found are expressive of themes in the literature on organizational adaptation to adversity, results also suggest unexpected challenges and extensions to current thinking.

Abstract: Corporate mission statements are ubiquitous, but their relationship to organizational practices, especially those noted for their high quality, remains a subject of debate. We use the case of work—life practices in publicly traded financial services firms to illustrate an innovative method for studying this issue. Overall, we find variation in the mission statements of firms in the same organizational field. We also find relationships between these statements and high-quality investment in work—life practices, as recognized by Working Mother magazine and Kinder, Lydenberg, and Domini. The mission statements of firms recognized for their work—life initiatives were more likely than those of competitors to emphasize the value of employees and less likely to stress shareholder value. We identified four types of mission statements, a pattern which may reflect the dual influences of distinctive organizational commitments and pressure from institutional actors. We discuss the implications of our findings for the...

Title: Organizational Path Dependence: A Process View
Author-Name: Georg Schreyögg
Author-Name: Jörg Sydow
Abstract: The structuring and behaviour of organizations is increasingly explained with the help of process theories, taking into account that history and sequencing matter. Among them, the notion of path dependence has gained prominence, in particular when an explanation for the rigidification of organizational routines and strategies is at stake. The distinguishing feature of this concept is its emphasis on self-reinforcing mechanisms when explaining the dynamics of narrowing down the scope of alternative actions in and among organizations. After having presented and discussed the theory of organizational path dependence, the paper highlights commonalities and contrasts between related concepts. Thereafter, the papers of this Special Themed Section will be introduced.

Title: The Path of Most Persistence: An Evolutionary Perspective on Path Dependence and Dynamic Capabilities
Author-Name: Jean-Philippe Vergne
Author-Name: Rodolphe Durand
Abstract: This paper extends the dynamic capability view and research on organizational path dependence by arguing that path dependence can be a property of capabilities when a contingently-triggered capability path is subject to self-reinforcement (i.e. a set of positive and negative mechanisms that increases the attractiveness of a path relative to others). The paper introduces an evolutionary perspective, which specifies the underlying selection mechanisms of the property of path dependence in internal and external firm environments. This theorization sheds new light on three paradoxes that currently blur the theoretical contribution of path dependence to research at the managerial, organizational, and industry levels: (1) the problematic coexistence of path irreversibility and managerial intentionality; (2) the ambivalent strategic value of lock-in with regard to competitive advantage; and (3) the relative homogeneity in observed dynamic capabilities, despite their (possible) path dependence that should lead to...

Title: Inscribed Strategies: Exploring the Organizational Nature of Strategic Lock-in
Author-Name: Jochen Koch
Abstract: An organization’s ability to act strategically under conditions of path dependence relies not only on the particular form of a strategic path but also on how this path is inscribed in an organization. To achieve a better understanding of this process, we shall introduce the concept of strategic path inscription and distinguish between mechanism inscription and pattern inscription. By referring to power, and formal and informal structures, the paper explores dimensions of the organizational context and its relation to strategic path inscription. The paper draws on an empirical study contrasting two established newspaper publishing organizations based in Germany. The comparative analysis of these cases reveals that in both organizations there are different forms of strategic pattern inscription but very similar forms of mechanism inscription. It is argued that the analysis of pattern inscription reveals much about the organizational nature of strategic lock-ins and, consequently, the range of variety that r...

Title: Controls of Knowledge Production, Sharing and Use in Bureaucratized Professional Service Firms
Author-Name: Marion Brivot
Abstract: One of the main obstacles to the current bureaucratization trend in large professional service firms (PSFs) is the organic nature of professional knowledge production, sharing and use. Centralized knowledge management (KM) systems aimed at codifying ‘best practice’ solutions to recurrent client questions for large-scale reuse are a common strategy increasingly employed to overcome this obstacle. Using a socio-ethnographic case study of a business law firm in Paris, this research examines whether the use of centralized KM systems in bureaucratized PSFs contributes to a shift in power from professionals to managers. More specifically, are administrative controls over knowledge resources increasing, or do professionals retain power (i.e. some level of social and self-control) over knowledge production, sharing and use? The results of this study indicate that, far from losing ground, professionals’ social and self-controls have been reinvented and reformed in a bureaucratized context.

Title: Stakeholder Theory and Globalization: The Challenges of Power and Responsibility
Author-Name: Tommy Jensen
Author-Name: Johan Sandström
Abstract: Globalization is a blind spot in stakeholder theory and this undermines its explanatory power and usefulness to managers in global corporations. In this paper we build on Edward Freeman and colleagues’ attempts to construct divergent stories about how to create value for the corporation and its stakeholders when developing a stakeholder theory that is more sensitive to globalization. We achieve this by highlighting two particular challenges that globalization brings to stakeholder theory. The first challenge is to acknowledge new power relations (sub-political movements, new forms of bureaucracy and hierarchy) and the second is to acknowledge new dimensions of responsibility (a political responsibility). In the paper we relate our developments of stakeholder theory to two previously published case studies.

Title: Psychological Regimes of Truth and Father Identity: Challenges for Work/Life Integration

Author-Name: Johanna Moisander
Abstract: Based on a case study, this paper elaborates on the psychological regimes of truth that organize and regulate male parenting and partly constitute the conditions of possibility for male identity and subjectivity both as fathers and employees. The aim is to contribute to a better understanding of the discursive-cultural constraints that Western managers and employees — males in particular — may face when trying to pursue a better work/life balance. Based on an empirical analysis of expert literature on male parenting, the paper argues that prevalent psychological regimes of truth about fathers and fathering do not necessarily render enactable the sorts of identities that enable both men and women to achieve a better work/life balance.

Title: Organizing the Circus: The Engineering of Miracles
Author-Name: Martin Parker
Abstract: This paper defines the circus as an institutionalized questioning of forms of stability and classification, and then enquires as to how such effects are produced. I begin with the cultural representations of the circus, and then move through sections on community, movement and economic organization. This order is intended to illustrate that the production of mystery is a complex affair, and that cultural and economic descriptions of this particular form of organization are necessarily entangled. Focusing on one at the expense of the other leads to either a culturalism which lacks an understanding of production, or a business model which is incapable of understanding miracles.

Title: Exploring and Explaining Patterns of Adaptation and Selection in Corporate Environmental Strategy in the USA
Author-Name: Frederik Dahlmann
Author-Name: Stephen Brammer
Abstract: While the societal salience of environmental issues appears to have risen substantially in recent years, relatively little is known regarding how environmental responsiveness has evolved over time within business in general, or within particular private sector organizations. In this study we seek to address this deficit by exploring the evolving pattern of environmental strategy within a large sample of US companies over the period 1997 to 2006. Based on evolutionary theories of selection and adaptation as well as Burgelman’s strategic change processes, we characterize the pattern of evolving responses to natural environmental issues, distinguish between changes in the overall attention paid to environmental issues that are attributable to the forces of adaptation and selection, and examine the distinctive characteristics of those organizations that have exhibited the most dramatic improvements in their environmental strategy. Our findings indicate that while there is widespread inertia in respect of envi...

Title: Originality through Imitation: The Rationality of Fashion
Author-Name: Elena Esposito
Abstract: Fashion, apparently irrational and whimsical, presents on the contrary a non-random way of managing the limits of rationality in the relations between individuals. Fashion is an inherently paradoxical phenomenon, as was observed at the beginning of its diffusion in the 17th century, a time that discovered, like the recent theory of organization, the necessity and the strategic role of disorder. Fashion relies on the stability of transition (everything changes, and this is the only thing we can rely on) and on the conformity with deviance (everyone wants to be original, and in this desire is like everyone else). Fashion works combining these paradoxes and neutralizing them in the form of banality. What can the theory of organization learn from the trivial mystery of fashion, that prevails on everyone just because nobody takes it seriously?

Title: The Iron Cage: Ugly, Uncool, and Unfashionable
Author-Name: Eric Abrahamson
Abstract: Historical studies reveal how organizational markets supplied artifacts that became fashionable because they met not only consumers’ cultural tastes, but also their technological preferences. This article calls such artifacts cultural-technological fusions. The digital mode of production tends to generate more types of fashionable fusions, which replace each other at a growing rate, and travel increasingly swiftly across consumers globally. These changes in fashion markets mandate a revised theory of fashion bearing on the organizational production of digital culture-technology fusions and on the characteristics of fusions so produced. This article’s theory describes digital production processes enabling fusion’s rapid visualization, creation, and awareness among global consumers, production processes that create or reinforce three types of fusions: ‘beautiful technologies’, that is technologies rendered aesthetic; ‘efficient beauties’, that is aesthetic artifacts rendered technologically efficient; ‘conc...

Title: From Fashion to Virus: An Alternative Theory of Organizations’ Handling of Management Ideas
Author-Name: Kjell Arne Røvik
Abstract: In contrast to management fashion theory, I develop an alternative theory of organizations’ handling of management ideas. Drawn from a virus metaphor, it offers a more complex and sophisticated concept of organizational idea-handling processes and outcomes than does fashion theory. Thus, reframing the phenomenon with a virus-inspired theory pushes analysis beyond the adoption-rejection dichotomy and bridges observations which, viewed from the fashion perspective, are either overlooked or may be interpreted as inconsistent.

Title: Fashion in Organization Theory: An Empirical Analysis of the Diffusion of Theoretical Concepts
Author-Name: Suleika Bort
Author-Name: Alfred Kieser
Abstract: We discuss whether organization theory is susceptible to fashion. Theories of scientific progress often assert that scientists’ research is guided exclusively by the need to solve problems that are left unexplained by existing theories. In contrast, we argue that scientists, to some extent, create and follow fashions. We formulate a number of hypotheses on fashion in scientific communication and test them with a sample of 44 concepts that were published and discussed in 1784 articles in organization studies journals from the year 1960 until 2005. We suggest that conditions such as reputation of authors and of the outlets in which concepts are published, or the provision of a methodology for empirical analyses, increase the attractiveness of academic publications and eventually set off a fashion. Overall, our results show that fashion is present in communication within organization studies while demonstrating that the field is characterized by trends toward positivistic empirical studies and economic reaso...

Abstract: Organization and management scholars have long advocated that efficient use of information is critical for firms to compete successfully in the modern marketplace. This study examines whether the use of managerial cross-unit involvement in an organization enhances managers’ propensity to use useful information provided by a functionally related unit in the organization. Senior line managers in a major global bank participated in our study in which they provided information related to their information processing and assessments of the usefulness of corporate audit information. We analyse the effect of line managers’ prior involvement with Corporate Audit using Throughput Modeling. This model allows us to understand how line managers’ cross-unit involvement influenced the way they process information received from Corporate Audit. Our results show that managers’ cross-unit involvement positively influences their assessment of information from Corporate Audit in a way that influences their propensity to use...

Title: Identities, Discipline and Routines
Author-Name: Andrew D. Brown
Author-Name: Michael A. Lewis
Abstract: This paper analyses how people’s subjectively construed identities are disciplined by, and appropriated from, their talk about organizational routines. Identity work, we argue, is not just an expression of agency but also of power. Based on a study of a UK regional law firm, our research counter-balances understandings of professional lawyers as autonomous knowledge-workers, and emphasizes instead the extent of their subjection to disciplinary processes. It shows that power is intrinsic to discursive constructions of routine processes of organizing. We examine lawyers’ accounts of their time-keeping and billing routine, and how these both fabricated their identities, and how individuals said that they confronted, shifted and perverted organizationally sanctioned systems of meaning. The research contribution of this paper is to examine empirically and to theorize how discourse about routines both disciplines and is a resource for identity work.

Title: Exercising Social Responsibility in Downsizing: Enrolling and Mobilizing Actors at a Swedish High-Tech Company
Author-Name: Ola Bergström
Author-Name: Andreas Diedrich
Abstract: This paper critically examines the claim made by previous research that companies exercise corporate social responsibility (CSR) by responding to stakeholder interests. It is based on a field study of the events following the announcement of collective redundancies at a Swedish high-tech company. Although more than 10,000 workers were dismissed, the company was accepted as being socially responsible. The study reveals that this outcome was the result of a process whereby corporate representatives managed to enrol and mobilize a network of actors into being faithful to, and defending, their definition of social responsibility. This indicates that a company can assume an active role in the construction of the same network of actors that it is asked to respond to and impose upon other actors its own definition of what it means to be socially responsible. As a result, the translation of CSR within the network of actors may reinforce the powerful position of the company, rather than curb it.

Title: The Emergence of an Influential Practice: Food for Thought
Author-Name: Marie-Léandre Gomez
Author-Name: Isabelle Bouty
Abstract: How do influential practices initially emerge? Bourdieu’s work offers an approach to answering this question and connecting local micro and field-level macro phenomena. We empirically build on this framework to analyse how the practice of using vegetables as gastronomic ingredients emerged in the field of haute cuisine at three-star chef Alain Passard’s Arpège restaurant. Based on multilevel and longitudinal data, we describe the practice and account for its emergence based on Passard’s habitus and his position in the field of haute cuisine. Our research contributes to the practice-based literature by highlighting the complicity between the agent and the field, and it contributes to institutional theory-based studies by accounting for the genesis of a new influential practice initiated by an individual insider.

Title: Research Methods for Non-Representational Approaches to Organizational Complexity: The Dialogical Mediated Inquiry
Author-Name: Philippe Lorino
Author-Name: Benoît Tricard
Author-Name: Yves Clot
Abstract: This paper explores the methodological implications of non-representational approaches to organizational complexity. Representational theories focus on the syntactic complexity of systems, whereas organizing processes are predominantly characterized by semantic and pragmatic forms of complexity. After underlining the contribution of non-representational approaches to the study of organizations, the paper warns against the risk of confining the critique of representational frameworks to paradoxical dichotomies such as intuition versus reflexive thought, or theorizing versus experimenting. To counter this difficulty, we suggest the use of a triadic theory of interpretation, and more particularly the concepts of semiotic mediation, inquiry and dialogism. Semiotic mediation dynamically links situated experience and generic classes of meanings. Inquiry articulates logical thinking, narrative thinking and experimenting. Dialogism conceptualizes the production of meaning through the situated interactions of acto...

Abstract: Innovation processes are complex. It is through local interactions among people and technologies that diverse and novel outcomes emerge. Even when governed by simple rules, such interactions can generate nonlinear temporal dynamics. Given such complexities, how might an organization sustain innovation for continued growth and vitality? Drawing on an in-depth study of innovation practices and journeys at 3M Corporation, we identify how combinations of practices — which we conceptualize as complexity arrangements — afford multiple agentic orientations simultaneously for the actors involved and thereby facilitate sustained innovation.

Title: A Fractal Approach to Industry Dynamism
Author-Name: Moshe Farjoun
Author-Name: Moshe Levin
Abstract: The concept of industry dynamism claims a central role in models of organizational adaptation. However, the development of new ways to study it has waned. Building on the literatures on nonlinear dynamical systems and information complexity, we introduce a fractal approach as a useful lens to industry dynamism and a fresh alternative and complement to prevailing approaches. This differs conceptually from existing methods in highlighting nonlinearity and recognizing endogenous and stable sources of apparent unpredictability. Further, it uses the fractal dimension, a measure of the jaggedness in a time series, which offers several advantages over existing dispersion-based measures of unpredictability. We apply the fractal approach in an exploratory longitudinal study of the turbulent US network television industry and demonstrate its ability to uncover distinct aspects of industry dynamism.

Title: How Organizations Engage with External Complexity: A Political Action Perspective
Author-Name: John Child
Author-Name: Suzana B. Rodrigues
Abstract: This paper offers a new insight into how organizations engage with external complexity. It applies a political action perspective that draws attention to the hitherto neglected question of how the relative power organizational leaders enjoy within their environments is significant for the actions they can take on behalf of their organizations when faced with external complexity. It identifies cognitive and relational complexity as two dimensions of the environment with which organizations have to engage. It proposes three modes whereby organizations may engage with environmental complexity that are conditioned by an organization’s power within its environment. It also considers the intention associated with each mode, as well as the implications of these modes of engagement for how an organization can learn about its environment and for the use of rationality and intuition in its strategic decision-making. The closing discussion considers how this analysis integrates complexity and political action perspe...

Title: Forms of Inattentiveness: The Production of Blindness in the Development of a Technology for the Observation of Quality in Health Services
Author-Name: Morten Knudsen
Abstract: Research dealing with governmental and managerial ideals and tools for transparency has observed how these tools co-create new types of blindness. It has documented the existence of three different types of blindness: blindness caused by power games, by cognitive limitations and blindness as a side effect of the categories applied. This paper puts forward a fourth type of organizational blindness in addition to the already documented ones, namely self-imposed blindness to potentially destructive information. This paper studies how relevant - but problematic - information is actively ignored and kept out of sight in the decision processes by looking at a specific case study involving the construction of a model intended to control, and render transparent, the quality of health services in Denmark. This paper outlines the forms of inattentiveness which make communication blind to information that could question the quality model. Five forms of inattentiveness are identified that function as answers to the q...

Title: Constant Connectivity: Rethinking Interruptions at Work
Author-Name: Judy Wajcman
Author-Name: Emily Rose
Abstract: While the subject of interruptions has received considerable attention among organizational researchers, the pervasive presence of information and communication technologies has not been adequately conceptualized. Here we consider the way knowledge workers interact with these technologies. We present fine-grained data that reveal the crucial role of mediated communication in the fragmentation of the working day. These mediated interactions, which are both frequent and short, have been commonly viewed as interruptions — as if the issue is the frequency of these single, isolated events. In contrast, we argue that knowledge workers inhabit an environment where communication technologies are ubiquitous, presenting simultaneous, multiple and ever-present calls on their attention. Such a framing employs a sociomaterial approach which reveals how contemporary knowledge work is itself a complex entanglement of social practices and the materiality of technical artefacts. Our findings show that employees engage in ...

Title: Improvisation in Product Innovation: The Contingent Role of Market Information Sources and Memory Types
Author-Name: Kyriakos Kyriakopoulos
Abstract: Though improvisation has emerged as a crucial organizational competence, research wrestles with a key question – how can organizations benefit from improvisation? To advance research, I build a richer conceptualization of the role of knowledge resources – market information sources and memory types – in improvisation. I argue that as (a) internal and external sources of market information differ in speed and novelty and (b) procedural and declarative memory differ in articulation and abstractness, they shape the impact of improvisation on new product outcomes in a distinct way. A longitudinal survey of new products in the Dutch food industry uncovers that, contrary to prior thinking, improvisation increases cost efficiency when new product teams rely on internal market information and declarative memory and they minimize external market information. Though both sources of market information and low procedural memory weaken the negative impact of improvisation on market effectiveness, these conditions were...

Author-Name: Maura Soekijad

Author-Name: Marleen Huysman
Abstract: This paper outlines two leadership strategies to support organizational learning through networks of practice (NOPs). An in-depth case study in a development organization reveals that network leaders cope with a learning tension between management involvement and emergent learning processes by enacting two strategies: brokering and buffering (B&B), or conducting and controlling (C&C). The latter strategy implies a one-sided emphasis on institutionalization, whereas a B&B strategy implies mediating and shielding the network from too much management intervention. The B&B strategy appears more useful for achieving multilevel organizational learning through NOPs; this study thereby contributes to theory about learning and NOPs.

Abstract: This paper provides an overview of previous work that has explored the processes and mechanisms by which communication constitutes organizing (as ongoing efforts at coordination and control of activity and knowledge) and organizations (as collective actors that are ‘talked’ into existence). We highlight differences between existing theories and analyses grounded in communication-as-constitutive (CCO) perspectives and describe six overarching premises for such perspectives; in so doing, we sharpen and bound the explanatory power of CCO perspectives for organization studies more generally. Building on these premises, we develop an agenda for further research, call for greater cross-fertilization between the communication and organization literatures, and illustrate ways in which communication-informed analyses have complemented and strengthened theories of the firm, organizational identity, sensemaking, and strategy as practice.

Title: Strategy as Practice and the Narrative Turn
Author-Name: Christopher Fenton
Author-Name: Ann Langley
Abstract: This paper argues that organizational communication research, and in particular a perspective that focuses on narrative, can contribute in important ways to understanding the practices of strategy. Narrative is believed to be critical to sensemaking in organizations, and multiple levels and forms of narrative are inherent to strategic practices. For example, narrative can be found in the micro-stories told by managers and others as they interact and go about their daily work, in the formalized techniques for strategy-making whether or not the techniques are explicitly story-based, in the accounts people give of their work as strategy practitioners, and in the artefacts produced by strategizing activity. After exploring applications of narrative approaches to strategy praxis, practices, practitioners and text, we review two concepts that might serve to integrate micro and macro levels of analysis. Overall, narrative is seen as a way of giving meaning to the practice that emerges from sensemaking activities...

Title: Secret Agencies: The Communicative Constitution of a Clandestine Organization

Abstract: This special issue challenges scholars to consider the theoretical, methodological, and practical implications of viewing organizations as ‘constituted in and through human communication.’ Interrogating the work of one of the most influential approaches to the study of the constitutive nature of organizing, the oeuvre of James Taylor and his colleagues or what has become known as the Montreal School, we identify an implicit assumption of organizational transparency. We suggest that unpacking ‘the transparency principle’ helps build a richer framework that builds upon the foundations of the Montreal School, facilitates empirical inquiry, and highlights several aspects of the social context which are typically taken for granted within organizational studies. Expanding Taylor et al.’s orientation to clandestine organizations, we address the question posed by the editors in the call for papers: ‘How does a communication-as-constitutive of organization’s perspective shape understandings of the organization’s e...

Title: Strategic planning as communicative process
Author-Name: A. Paul Spee
Author-Name: Paula Jarzabkowski
Abstract: This paper examines the construction of a strategic plan as a communicative process. Drawing on Ricoeur’s concepts of decontextualization and recontextualization, we conceptualize strategic planning activities as being constituted through the iterative and recursive relationship of talk and text. Based on an in-depth case study, our findings show how multiple actors engage in a formal strategic planning process which is manifested in a written strategy document. This document is thus central in the iterative talk to text cycles. As individuals express their interpretations of the current strategic plan in talk, they are able to make amendments to the text, which then shape future textual versions of the plan. This cycle is repeated in a recursive process, in which the meanings attributed to talk and text increasingly converge within a final agreed plan. We develop our findings into a process model of the communication process that explains how texts become more authoritative over time and, in doing so, ho...

Title: Organizations as Discursive Constructions: A Foucauldian Approach
Author-Name: Aurélie Leclercq-Vandelannoitte
Abstract: A growing body of literature suggests that communication constitutes organizations, but this argument requires refinement to address its remaining flaws. This essay suggests the tremendous potential of using Michel Foucault’s work to grasp the underlying meaning of this argument and to respond to its shortcomings. The proposed Foucauldian-based process model highlights links across Foucault’s main lines of thought, applied to the relationships among technology, discourse, discipline, control, subject, and identity in an organization. By reframing the concept of technology as a discursive and nondiscursive practice that constrains and enables everyday life, this approach offers better understanding of the argument that communication constitutes organizations. The conceptual model also serves as a backdrop for exploring a problematic field situation with a case study. Technology appears part of processes by which technology, organizations, and subjects get redefined. The organization is dynamically constitu...

Title: Organization as an (Imbricated) Configuring of Transactions
Author-Name: James R. Taylor
Abstract: This paper argues that taking communication as a primary focus of theory and research leads to new insights on the nature of organization, as currently displayed in studies of strategy, institutionalization, boundary objects, discourse and materiality. Communicatively, an organization is both a configuring of practices, each with its own interactive modes of exchange, and a corporate legal person whose ‘voice’ becomes, paradoxically, a component of that same discursive geography. The ‘paradox’ dissolves, however, in a communicative theory, which argues that organizational identity, and its personhood, are established in the same way as those of individuals. The article then presents an original vision of organization as an ‘imbrication’ of domains of discourse out of which layers of identity emerge. The primary mechanism responsible for coherence of purpose and identity is authority, in that the persons of both organization and members must be continually “authored” for them to exist. The article conclude...

Title: Managerial Organization and Professional Autonomy: A Discourse-Based Conceptualization
Author-Name: Pete Thomas
Author-Name: Jan Hewitt
Abstract: The conceptualization of professions and professionalization is once again a significant theme in the social sciences. The position of professions seems increasingly complex as relations with other occupational groups develop in ways that seem uncertain, ambiguous and complex. We present a discourse-based framework for the analysis of professional change, drawing on Chouliaraki and Fairclough’s critical discourse analysis (CDA), and their adaptations of the work of Laclau and Mouffe, and Bhabha. The model focuses on the articulation process within conjunctures of social practice, and in particular how social actors endeavour to make advantageous articulations which achieve a degree of permanence in an inherently changeable world. It also considers how discourses are articulated together to create hybrid forms of professional discourse. We apply the framework to recent changes in the role and autonomy of general medical practitioners in the United Kingdom following the implementation of the clinical govern...

Title: Transparency Reforms in the Public Sector: Beyond the New Economics of Organization
Author-Name: David Arellano-Gault
Author-Name: Walter Lepore
Abstract: This article challenges the arguments of the new economics of organization (NEO) on the phenomenon of transparency in the public sector. This is achieved by conducting an empirical study of 16 federal agencies in Mexico, which analyzes the implementation of the federal transparency law. Our findings indicate that some organizations are developing internal dynamics well beyond those anticipated by the law, while others are just complying with the minimum legal requirements. We suggest that there is a dynamic of transparency ‘internalization’ in these organizations that the NEO has been neglecting, and also a basic contradiction in the construction of the NEO theory, which affects the design and implementation of transparency laws. Solving this problem would demand a change of the underlying paradigm that sustains transparency reforms. Instead of taking opportunism, selfishness, and a profound distrust attitude toward public servants as departure points, effective transparency reforms require trustworthy pu...

Title: The Grit in the Oyster: Professionalism, Managerialism and Leaderism as Discourses of UK Public Services Modernization
Author-Name: Dermot O’Reilly
Author-Name: Mike Reed
Abstract: The representation of organizational agency in UK policy discourse on public service modernization is analysed in order to disclose the legitimation of elite organizational centres and the structuring of organizational peripheries and their potential for resistance. Three discourses are identified and explored: the residual, but still potent, discourse of professionalism; the dominant discourse of managerialism; and the emergent discourse of leaderism. The emergent discourse of leaderism is shown to be linked to an imaginary of neo-bureaucratic organizing, which represents an evolution of New Public Management. As such, the analysis of leaderism, a new form of privileged agency, contributes an insight into the dynamics of public service modernization. This is developed through exploring leaderism’s tension between its strong affinity with unitarist managerialism and its weaker linkages to quasi-pluralist stakeholder networks which create potentialities for new forms of active resistance.

Abstract: In this article we examine the innovative culture and activity of 121 Norwegian and Flemish state agencies, based on an analysis of survey data. We examine variations in innovative culture and activity from a structural-instrumental perspective, a cultural-institutional perspective, a task-related perspective and an environmental-institutional perspective. We use regression analyses to reveal the effect of managerial autonomy, result control, agency size, agency age, organizational performance culture, individual incentive culture, service delivery tasks, source of income and geographical location on innovative culture and activity. The main findings are that the level of innovation is fairly high in state agencies. Secondly, an organizational culture oriented towards organizational performance and individual incentives has a significant impact on both innovative culture and activity. Having service delivery as a main task and a large budget also makes a difference. Although NPM doctrine assumes that mana...

Author-Name: Uschi Backes-Gellner

Author-Name: Stephan Veen
Abstract: Field studies linking workforce age to performance treat performance as one-dimensional and often focus on individual not organizational performance. To analyze the effects of workforce age on organizational performance, we suggest treating performance as multi-dimensional with at least two output dimensions: quantity and quality. We provide a novel conceptual framework that borrows insights from multiple disciplines to better understand ageing phenomena in organizations. In particular, we build on psychological and medical studies showing that individual age has different effects on different cognitive capabilities. As a result, we argue that workforce ageing may affect various performance dimensions, such as quantity and quality, in different, often opposite ways. In our empirical part we examine a unique dataset containing detailed court data over a time span of 19 years. We find that average workforce age is linked negatively to quantitative organizational performance but positively to qualitative org...

Title: Risky Business: How Professionals and Professional Fields (Must) Deal with Organizational Issues
Author-Name: Mirko Noordegraaf
Abstract: As professionals belong to occupational systems but also increasingly work inside organizations, new linkages between occupational and organizational domains are required, but they are difficult to develop. Occupational principles and professional standards are usually considered to be at odds with managerial and organizational control principles. This generates academic and practical dualisms. Either a return to professionalism is advocated in order to protect occupational spaces and ‘rescue’ professional work, or there is a move beyond professionalism in order to restrict autonomies and discipline professional work. This article argues that both stances are unsatisfactory and that new forms of organized professionalism are called for. Changing circumstances force professional services to respond to external changes that call for organizational capacities, also inside professional domains: (a) professionals develop new work preferences and seek organized work conditions; (b) professionals face new cases,...

Title: Back to the Future: Career Transitions at the Dawn of Capitalism: The immigration of merchants from the Southern Netherlands to Amsterdam, 1578–1602
Author-Name: Gianluca Carnabuci
Author-Name: Filippo Carlo Wezel
Abstract: This paper investigates the conditions facilitating career transitions across dissimilar cultural contexts. Particular attention is devoted to two critical obstacles faced by transitioners during cross-cultural role reorientations. First, transitioners must make sense of the unspoken demands and requirements ascribed to their work role in the new cultural context. Second, they must find ways to access and mobilize context-specific resources and information in a context alien to them. Empirically, the histories of 452 merchants emigrated from the southern provinces to Amsterdam during the period 1578–1602 are analyzed. The difference between Amsterdam’s merchant culture (based on open competition, speculative and “depersonalized” financial investments) and that of the southern provinces (a well-protected economic environment based on the guild system) required a reorientation from the role of pre-modern merchants to that of capitalist entrepreneurs. A set of hypotheses predicting why some immigrant merchan...

Results from empirical analyses based on the German Life History Study (N = 5453) show only a small increase in the complexity of work careers over the last decades, but there was a shift in the prevalence of different career patterns. This suggests that effects of globalization might be counteracted or modified by other social changes that affected work careers in Germany during the last 60 years. In particular, we consider the possible impact of educational expansion, labor market restructuring, and women’s increased employment. We find no evidence that industry-specific economic globalization impacts the complexity of work careers, but we find a U-shaped relationship between industry growth and ca...

Title: Career Development and Knowledge Appropriation: A Genealogical Critique
Author-Name: Ken Kamoche
Author-Name: Mary Pang
Author-Name: Amy L. Y. Wong
Abstract: In the fast-changing and globally competitive business environment, organizations’ efforts to appropriate knowledge from their workers will be increasingly resisted by those employees forced into more fragmented and uncertain careers. We interpret this contested scenario in terms of the apparently diametrically opposed ways in which knowledge is conceptualized. The organization sees knowledge as an asset which it seeks to appropriate through mechanisms designed to achieve employment flexibility. However, this process is not unidirectional, as we posit that the individual conceives of their knowledge as ‘career capital’ and, in building it up as a response to the uncertainties of reconstituted careers, pursues a strategy of employability. With reference to Foucault’s genealogical approach, we argue that the above contest not only reflects the shifting employment relationship and economic turbulence, but is in fact a social phenomenon rooted in the knowledge−power dialectic and one which sheds light on indi...

Title: Cross-Level Dynamics between Changing Organizations and Career Patterns of Reduced-Load Professionals
Author-Name: Jean-Baptiste Litrico

Author-Name: Ellen Ernst Kossek
Abstract: Integrating research on careers, flexible work arrangements, and open systems views of organizational change, we investigate how evolution in the broader organizational context interacts with professional career trajectories over time. Interviews were conducted six years apart (1997 and 2003) with 17 major employers in North America and 36 managers and professionals in those firms who were working on a reduced-load basis by choice in 1997. Overall, we found that career patterns are impacted by the dynamic combination of individual-level and contextual factors. Specifically, while changes in core business/client base, internal structure changes, and industry turbulence were associated with higher proportions of returns to full-time work, financial threat was associated with lower levels of return to full-time work. We identified four cross-level dynamics (co-optation, synergy, decoupling, and tug of war) that capture different patterns of interaction between individual work arrangement trajectories and lar...

Title: A Market for Weather Risk? Conflicting Metrics, Attempts at Compromise, and Limits to Commensuration
Author-Name: Isabelle Huault
Author-Name: Hélène Rainelli-Weiss
Abstract: In this paper, we examine the process of risk commodification involved in the creation of a market for weather derivatives in Europe. We approach this issue through an in-depth qualitative study in which we focus on the commensuration process by which promoters try to draw weather risk into the financial world. By offering a concrete description of a derivatives market as a meeting place between different metrics, our results highlight the failure of a process of commensuration – a phenomenon rarely studied empirically in the literature – and its unexpected results. Compared to existing research, we use the theoretical framework provided by Boltanski and Thévenot (2006) to enrich the literature on commensuration specifically as regards the different forms of agreement to which commensuration attempts can lead. Our results highlight the crucial role of a common interest for commensuration to succeed, and the conditions necessary for this common interest to occur. We conclude that there are limits to the th...

Title: Taking Teams Seriously in the Co-creation of Firms and Economic Agency
Author-Name: Peer Hull Kristensen
Author-Name: Maja Lotz
Abstract: In this paper it is suggested that it is time to take the agency of teams seriously. Whereas the debate has previously focused on how firms may function more effectively by using team-based work organization, our aim here is to discuss and understand how teams affect the evolutionary dynamic of companies. Fieldwork in four Danish manufacturing companies helped us discover that firms as ‘communities of teams’ are highly dynamic entities with complex layers of different team forms that operate, innovate and improve by constantly recombining, collaborating across organizational divisions and redistributing authority, thereby challenging some of the existing ‘idioms’ of team research and theories of the firm. Building on these findings, we rethink research on teams by re-describing the evolutionary dynamics of firms and call for new comparative research.

Abstract: Institutional theory emphasizes the institutional constraints that render radical innovations illegitimate, but fails to explain how such innovations might succeed. Adopting a micro-institutional perspective, this paper addresses why and how embedded agency may overcome legitimacy crises within established systems. Drawing on a sample of 20 legitimacy problems identified in five radical innovation trajectories at two mature companies, we develop an empirically grounded theory of the institutional work through which proponents legitimize radical innovations within established firms. This theory describes a variety of micro-institutional affordances that enable different strategic responses to legitimacy crises. We thus extend institutional theory by explaining embedded agents’ use of a range of options to pursue radical innovation, providing a robust explanation of both institutional stability and radical change.

Title: Formal and Informal Hierarchy in Different Types of Organization
Author-Name: Thomas Diefenbach
Author-Name: John A.A. Sillince
Abstract: This paper addresses the paradox that despite all organizational change towards flatter and postmodern organizations, hierarchical order is quite persistent. We develop a differentiated understanding of hierarchy as either formal or informal and apply this analytical framework to several types of organization. The analysis reveals that hierarchy is much more widespread than thought; in particular, postmodern, representative democratic and network organizations are much less ‘alternative’ and ‘hierarchy-free’ than their labels and common understanding may suggest. The main argument is that the persistence of hierarchy in different types of organization can be explained by different dynamic relationships between formal and informal hierarchy.

Title: Traditions and Transitions in Quantitative Societal Culture Research in Organization Studies
Author-Name: Mark F. Peterson
Author-Name: Mikael Søndergaard
Abstract: Quantitative societal culture research (QSCR) in organization studies crystallizes a configuration of social science perspectives and methods that became prominent in the 1970s. We consider the qualities of and boundaries around cultural groups that this tradition emphasizes, and other characteristics of cultural groups that it does not emphasize. Current debates surrounding this tradition reflect both recent social science innovations and rediscoveries of early social science perspectives. Our analysis of quantitative cross-cultural societal research in organization studies considers this process of crystallization, innovation and rediscovery. We suggest ways to address current controversies and promote conversations with other research approaches.

Title: The Dialectical Sense of Humour: Routine Joking in a Taylorized Factory
Author-Name: Marek Korczynski
Abstract: Starting from the premise that context is central to understanding humour, the paper examines humour in three key contexts of the workplace – the labour process, control relations and peer relations. The paper argues that there have been important studies which have shown humour embedded in control relations and peer relations, but the way in which humour may be embedded in the labour process has not received the same sustained attention. The paper reports on a participant-observation ethnography in a Taylorized blinds factory in which humour embedded in the labour process was the central form of humour. Particularly important were forms of humour categorized as ‘routine humour’ and ‘routine absurdity’ in which workers played with the routine labour process. Overall, the humour in this factory primarily had resistive meanings, and contributed to an autonomous shopfloor culture which informed acts of informal collective resistance. At the same time, much of the humour lubricated the enactment of the labour...

Title: Hail the Snail: Hegemonic Struggles in the Slow Food Movement
Author-Name: Koen van Bommel
Author-Name: André Spicer
Abstract: This paper explores how new institutional fields are established and extended. We argue that they are created by social movements engaging in hegemonic struggles and which develop social movement strategies, articulate discourses and construct nodal points. We examine how this process played out during the creation and development of the Slow Food movement. We argue that the positioning of Slow Food as a new field was based particularly on using multiple strategies, increasing the stock of floating signifiers, and abstracting the nodal points used. This mobilized new actors and enabled a more extensive collective identity which allowed the movement to progress, extend, and elevate the field of Slow Food. The field of Slow Food was transformed from appealing only to gastronomes to becoming a broader field that encompassed social justice activists and environmentalists. This study contributes to the existing literature on field formation, the role of social movements in this process, and political dynamics ...

Title: Institutional Continuity and the Dutch Construction Industry Fiddle
Author-Name: Harry Sminia
Abstract: The article deals with the question of how institutional continuity is realized. It presents an analysis of the continuation of the institution of pre-consultation in the Dutch construction industry over a period of nine years, after this was declared illegal as a consequence of European Union regulations. The analysis utilizes a structuration-based practice approach to institutionalization. The findings suggest that institutional continuity is a matter of a social mechanism which emerges as a consequence of the particular way in which practices are enacted, and which has the effect of repairing and/or concealing contradiction so that change is not initiated.

Title: The Role of Analogy and Metaphor in the Framing and Legitimization of Strategic Change
Author-Name: Joep P. Cornelissen

Author-Name: Mike Zundel
Abstract: Strategic change initiatives disrupt established categories of stakeholder understanding and typically present a problem of justifying and legitimizing the change to stakeholders in order to gain their buy-in and support. While it has been suggested that the analogical or metaphorical framing of strategic changes is crucial in that it fosters understanding and creates legitimacy for the change, we set out to specify the conditions and uses of analogical and metaphorical framing in effecting support for strategic changes. Specifically, we argue that (a) analogies are more effective in the context of additive changes, whereas metaphors are more apt for substitutive changes, and that (b) relational analogies and metaphors are generally more effective in securing support for strategic changes, as opposed to analogies or metaphors that highlight common attributes. We also argue that the overall effectiveness of analogies and metaphors in the framing of a change is furthermore dependent on (c) the degree to whi...

Title: A Tropological Theory of Institutionalization
Author-Name: Professor John A.A. Sillince
Author-Name: Professor James R. Barker
Abstract: We address the co-evolution of language and material practices during institutionalization by proposing a tropological model of institutionalization that integrates linguistic and practice-oriented approaches into a four-stage sequence: Metaphor enables members to inaugurate institutional change by inspiring and energizing initial movement. Members use metonymy to operationalize the emerging institution by demonstrating how it can become expected practice. Synecdoche is used to facilitate diffusion, standardizing the institution across time and space. When material practice is noticeably contrary to linguistic claims, however, members use irony to bring about deinstitutionalization and generate another inaugurating metaphor. The model further proposes that ritualized actions dramatize each trope, highlighting its symbolic meaning and embedding distinct material practices that serve both to institutionalize the practice and to facilitate boundary crossing to the next trope. The paper goes beyond current li...

Abstract: In this paper we study the development and implementation of a technology over a long period of time, with a particular focus on how its disciplinary effects interplay with and change organizational routines and actors’ capacities, thus producing new patterns of action. To identify these processes of change and emergence of practices, we propose a combinative theoretical analysis at the interface between institutional and practice-based approaches. Drawing on a rich ethnographic case study, we show how the fact of considering technologies as the combination of three dimensions (technical substrate, managerial philosophy and organizational model) furthers our understanding of institutional change and the creation of new practices. In particular, we examine the internal dynamics between the three dimensions of these technologies and the duality of organizational routines (their ostensive and performative aspects). This enables us to reintroduce practices and agency analysis into an institutional approach to...

Title: Masters of the Universe: Power and Elites in Organization Studies
Author-Name: Michael I. Reed
Abstract: Elite analysis has re-emerged as a central theme in contemporary organization studies. This paper builds on recent contributions to this revitalized field by developing a distinctive theoretical approach and substantive agenda for the study of power relations and elite ruling in organization studies. By drawing on a realist/materialist ontology and a neo-Weberian analytical framework, the paper identifies the idea of ‘command situations’ as the key concept for identifying changing mechanisms and forms of elite domination and control in contemporary socio-political orders. Three case histories are subsequently discussed in order to provide illustrative examples of the way in which this analytical framework can enhance our understanding of the complex interplay between ‘institutional’ and ‘interstitial’ power as it shapes the emergence of hybrid governance regimes through which contemporary regimes of elite domination and rule become organized.

Title: Committed to a Failing Strategy: Celebrity CEO, Intermediaries, Media and Stakeholders in a Co-created Drama
Author-Name: Paresha N. Sinha

Author-Name: James R. Barker
Abstract: The apparent status of having a “celebrity CEO” heading a large organization creates a strong impression that the organization will be successful and forms an almost irresistible force compelling stakeholder commitment. However, a newly appointed celebrity CEO and the celebrity’s co-creators run the risk of becoming over-confident, over-optimistic and over-committed to what may be a failing strategy. We explore a case in which this risk became reality. We use a dramaturgical perspective to analyse Air New Zealand’s failed acquisition of Ansett Australia in 2001 and describe how the CEO, financial intermediaries, media and stakeholders co-created an unfolding drama marked by the CEO escalating the firm’s commitment to the failing acquisition as a way of maintaining an illusion of control, which helped preserve the CEO’s celebrity identity. We consider the implications for the various types of stakeholders in organizations and for the study of organizational leadership.

Title: From Symbolic Violence to Economic Violence: The Globalizing of the Scottish Banking Elite
Author-Name: Ron Kerr
Author-Name: Sarah Robinson
Abstract: The financial crisis has raised questions about the role of corporate elites in contemporary organizations. This article follows recent work on organizational elites that argues for critical sociological approaches to the study of such elites, using, for example, Bourdieu’s concept of field, and for studies of elites in contexts outside North America. Applying Bourdieusian concepts such as forms of violence, we look at the particular case of the Scottish banking elite, focusing on changing enactments of violence within that field, from symbolic violence to economic violence. We trace the movement of the Scottish banking elite from the national-traditional to the global and modernized and demonstrate how members of an elite field can operate in the field of power within their own organization and at the same time within a transorganizational field of peer competitors, thus illustrating how a specific national elite has been affected by neoliberal globalization and its crisis.

Title: Using Organization Structure to Buffer Political Ties in Emerging Markets: A Case Study
Author-Name: Marleen Dieleman
Author-Name: Jean J. Boddewyn
Abstract: We use and extend resource-dependence theory by analyzing how loosely-coupled organizational structures facilitate the management of political ties by business groups in emerging economies. This topic is particularly salient because business groups are a prevalent organizational form in these countries where they face both a high dependence on governments to secure key resources and a unique set of risks associated with political ties. We identify and analyze four buffering mechanisms that enable loosely-coupled business groups to protect themselves against the adverse effects of such ties. We ground and contextualize these mechanisms by relying on a longitudinal case study of the Salim Group – a very large and well-connected Indonesian business group under the Suharto regime. This study is particularly relevant in the context of the renewed interest in the study of firms’ organizational structure.

Abstract: This paper focuses on what happens when accountability regimes, represented in calculative planning processes, migrate onto situated, sociomaterial practices. Specifically, the article investigates what happens when the practices of results-based accountability (RBA) are translated into the social justice practices of locally-based community organizations. Based on the tenets of contemporary practice theory and a three-year participatory action research project with community organizations in Australia, the study illustrates that performance measurement and accountability frameworks such as RBA are not technologies that peer and measure innocently and disinterestedly from a distance. Rather, RBA, as a bundle of material-discursive practices, is part of the performance measuring apparatus creating differences that include some things and exclude others. We articulate some of the organizing practices of social justice in a locally-based community organization, follow their translation into RBA planning prac...

Abstract: While studies on international management have focused on cultural differences and examined institutional specificities in various national business systems, conceptions of international relations have been left relatively underexplored. We argue that representations of international relations are relevant to international M&As and contend that intertextuality offers a novel approach to examine these relational features of international management. Our analysis focuses on Sino–US relations in the context of the acquisition of American IBM’s Personal Computer Division (PCD) by the Chinese company, Lenovo. We demonstrate the ways in which facets of international relations are produced in media accounts of this acquisition, and analyse the intertextual dynamics entwined with their production. The analysis consists of three sections: constitutive intertextuality, manifest intertextuality and intertextual ideological undercurrents. These illustrate the variation in producing international relations through dis...

Title: States of Connectivity: New Questions and New Directions
Author-Name: Darl G. Kolb
Author-Name: Arran Caza
Author-Name: Paul D. Collins
Abstract: A recent article in Organization Studies used in its title the term ‘constant connectivity’. Though we commonly think of connectivity as ‘constant’, temporal intermittency and actor agency make connectivity seldom, if ever, constant. Reflecting on studies of connectivity highlights the growing importance of recognizing and defining ‘states’ of connectivity. Several states of connectivity are reviewed, namely: hypo-connectivity, hyper-connectivity, requisite and optimal connectivity (‘flow’). As an organizational resource, understanding various states of connectivity is critical to future research. More empirical work is needed to determine how the volume of connectivity makes a difference to performance and other outcomes.

Title: Sense-Making in Compensation Committees: A Cultural Theory Perspective
Author-Name: Bertrand Malsch

Author-Name: Yves Gendron
Abstract: Drawing on Mary Douglas’s cultural theory, our research analyzes the cultural schemes or biases mobilized by compensation committee (CC) members, in the context of public companies, when making sense of their committee’s work. Relying on semi-structured interviews mostly conducted with CC members in Canada, our analysis brings to the fore the production of moral and rational comfort within the boundaries of the individualistic and hierarchical culture. Under an individualistic bias, the compensation market is seen as natural, providing conditions of possibility that serve to establish fair compensation through the creation and enforcement of contracts. Under a hierarchic bias which emphasizes principles of objectivity and measurability, members of CCs tend to conceive the design of compensation policies as an act of expertise, relying extensively on consultants and measurement techniques to determine acceptable reward boundaries. Not only does our paper contribute to corporate governance literature by pro...

Title: The Institutionalization of Stewardship: Theory, Propositions, and Insights from Change in the Edmonton Public Schools
Author-Name: Lydia Segal
Author-Name: Mark Lehrer
Abstract: Prior scholarship on stewardship as a principle of administration largely portrays stewardship as too idealistic and dependent upon situational factors to be institutionalized in large-scale organizations. Through a case study of the Edmonton Public Schools, this study explores the extent to which stewardship can be institutionalized as a central organizing principle, thereby ensuring performance and checking corruption in ways that are consistent with the primacy of intrinsic motivation. The study deepens our understanding of the challenges that managers face in reconciling stewardship with a bureaucratic context, documents practices that have been used to deal with these challenges, and more broadly discusses how it might be possible for islands of stewardship to emerge in a world governed by assumptions of human opportunism. To this end the paper develops a model of the choice that organization members face in deciding to elect a principal-agent or a stewardship posture within large-scale organizations...

Title: Knowledge Beyond the Individual? Making Sense of a Notion of Collective Knowledge in Organization Theory
Author-Name: Achim Hecker
Abstract: Although the notion of ‘collective knowledge’ has become a building block of many knowledge-based studies on the organization, there is little clarity about the precise meaning of the term. This paper aims at closing this explanatory gap by investigating the question of what it can mean for knowledge to be collective. In drawing on relevant literatures it analytically distinguishes three types of collective knowledge and elaborates on their nature. Through analysis of their interrelationship and interaction within the organization, these types are integrated into an overarching framework forming a pluralistic epistemology of collective knowledge. Finally, some implications of the proposed epistemological framework for our understanding of higher-order knowledge-related constructs (such as routines and capabilities) as well as for the architecture of firms and industries are outlined.

Abstract: This paper argues that learning in cross-race interactions is critical for work teams to realize performance benefits from racial diversity but that diversity is a liability when society’s negative stereotypes about racial minorities’ competence inhibit such interactions. We analyze two years of data from 496 retail bank branches to investigate racial asymmetries in the dynamics of team learning and their impact on the link between diversity and bottom-line performance. As expected, minorities’ negative assessments of their team’s learning environment precipitate a negative relationship between diversity and performance, irrespective of White teammates’ assessments; only when both groups view the team’s learning environment as supportive—implying that the team has successfully countered the negative effects of societal stereotypes on cross-race learning—is the relationship positive. We conclude that acknowledging the impact of societal asymmetries between racial groups, especially in regard to learning, c...

Title: The Rhetoric of Institutional Change
Author-Name: Andrew D. Brown
Author-Name: Susan Ainsworth
Author-Name: David Grant
Abstract: This paper analyses how a case for institutional change is made through rhetoric in an individual text. Drawing on Aristotle’s three types of rhetorical justification, logos, pathos and ethos, we make three contributions. First, we show that the multiple competing logics which often dominate a field can become incorporated into key texts. As a result, the notionally rational argumentation repertoires which underpin each logic exist in tension, and are prone to contradict each other, making it difficult for a text to support convincingly one logic rather than another on the basis of logos appeals. In such instances, the authors of a text may favour one logic over another through the strategic use of ethos (moralizing) and pathos (emotion-evoking) rhetoric. Second, we demonstrate how ethos and pathos function to construct social categories (identities) and draw on dominant cultural myths. Third, we theorize these textual strategies as acts aimed at reconfiguring relations of power/knowledge.

Title: Virtue in Business: Alliance Boots and an Empirical Exploration of MacIntyre’s Conceptual Framework
Author-Name: Geoff Moore
Abstract: This paper contextualizes before summarizing a conceptual framework for virtue ethics in organizations that has been developed by drawing upon the work of the moral philosopher Alasdair MacIntyre. Conducting empirical work with this framework is at an embryonic stage and so, having discussed methodological issues, the paper reports on findings from a longitudinal case study-based research project into the private equity-owned organization Alliance Boots. It demonstrates the applicability of the conceptual approach and hence the presence of practices and virtues even within capitalist business organizations. It makes theoretical advances particularly in the relationship between internal and external goods. It proposes a mapping for virtue in organizations and uses this to conduct an organizational analysis of Alliance Boots and its predecessor organizations. The paper thus makes both theoretical and empirical contributions to our knowledge in the area of applied virtue ethics.

Title: Boundaryless Careers: Bringing Back Boundaries

Abstract: Boundaryless career theories are increasingly prominent in career studies and management studies, and provide a new ‘status quo’ concerning modern careers. This paper contextualizes the boundaryless careers literature within management studies, and evaluates its contributions, including broadening concepts of career and focusing interorganizational career phenomena. It acknowledges the considerable stimulus given to career studies by this literature, but also offers a critique based on five issues: inaccurate labelling; loose definitions; overemphasis on personal agency; the normalization of boundaryless careers; and poor empirical support for the claimed dominance of boundaryless careers. Because these problems render the boundaryless career concept increasingly obsolete as a ‘leading edge’ construct in career studies, we offer new directions for theory and research. In particular we re-examine the role of career boundaries, and suggest the development of new, boundary-focused careers scholarship based o...

Title: Constructing Global Firms? National, Transnational and Neocolonial Effects in International Management Consultancies
Author-Name: Mehdi Boussebaa
Author-Name: Glenn Morgan
Author-Name: Andrew Sturdy
Abstract: Drawing on an empirical study of four major international management consultancies, this article examines managerial efforts to construct ‘global’ organizations. We show how these efforts are undermined by inter-office conflicts over the staffing of client projects. We argue that such constraints cannot be adequately understood as an outcome of inappropriate organizational structures and incentives since this explanation ignores the important role of institutional contexts. In this vein, we outline and develop four different institutionalist lenses and apply them to the empirical findings. In so doing, we reveal the need to adopt a multi-dimensional institutionalist approach to the study of ‘global’ firms, one that can account for not only national effects but also transnational and neocolonial influences on these organizations.

Title: Theorizing Firm Adoption of Sustaincentrism
Author-Name: Mike Valente
Abstract: In the midst of a fundamental gap between theoretical assertions of a sustaincentric business paradigm and any rigorous empirical examination of its adoption at the firm level, I set out to answer the following two interrelated research questions: (1) How can we identify firms that adopt a sustaincentric paradigm and (2) What explains firm adoption of this paradigm? Based on cross-case comparisons of 12 African firms adopting a reactive, proactive, or sustaincentric orientation to sustainability, I develop a conceptual framework comprised of three interrelated constructs informed by descriptive observations across individual, organizational and interorganizational levels of analysis. Unlike their reactive and proactive counterparts, sustaincentric firms exhibited critical multilevel characteristics that demonstrated capacity for cognitive complexity and linked them closely to a highly interconnected network of external actors, the combination of which enabled the achievement of competitive advantage based...

Title: Work Organizational Outcomes of the Use of Temporary Agency Workers
Author-Name: Kristina Håkansson

Abstract: This article examines work organizational dynamics in workplaces using temporary agency workers. Previous research has principally either emphasized one effect, the division into core and periphery, or criticized this effect. This article contributes to a more nuanced analysis of how the work organization of user firms is affected by the use of temporary agency workers. Crucial factors influencing the outcome include: how agency workers are integrated into the work organization; the skills required for the work performed by agency workers; the duration of assignments; the induction time; and the access to competence development. Based on ten Swedish cases, our analysis shows that the use of temporary agency workers has three different outcomes: (1) The Core and Periphery outcome is in line with previous research on ‘the flexible firm’ whereby temporary agency workers are assigned simple work tasks and user firm employees perform advanced work tasks; (2) the All Core outcome entails using agency workers fo...

Title: The Supremacy of the Sequence: Key Elements and Dimensions in the Process of Change
Author-Name: Mariannunziata Liguori
Abstract: How single organizations manage the process of change and why only some of them are able to actually reach radical change are central questions in today’s theoretical debate. The role played by the process of change and its dimensions (namely, pace, sequence and linearity), however, has been poorly investigated. Drawing on archetype theory, this paper explores: (i) whether a specific pace of radical change exists; (ii) whether different outcomes of change are characterized by different sequences of change in key-structures and systems (iii) how the three dimensions of the process of change possibly interact. As an example of organizational change the study takes into consideration processes of accounting change in three departments of two Canadian and two Italian municipalities. The results suggest the supremacy of the sequence of implemented changes over the other two dimensions of the process in order to achieve a radical outcome of change.

Author-Name: Richard Godfrey
Author-Name: Simon Lilley
Author-Name: Joanna Brewis
Abstract: This paper explores the relationship between masculinity, the body and the military through a close reading of the film Jarhead. Drawing on a Foucauldian frame of analysis, we consider three performances of the masculine military body that form key aspects of the film’s representational economy: the disciplined body, an outcome of the processes of basic training; the gendered body, realized through deployment of metaphors of the feminine to strengthen the masculine conception of the military body; and the cyborgian body, the result of the man-machine interface which is rapidly developing in many militaries around the world, and which poses significant questions for performances of military masculinity. We conclude by suggesting that the film’s rendering of the material and discursive body reveals an unexpected tension between the expectations of military bodies and the lived experience of their labour. As well as augmenting empirical explorations of male-worker-bodies and analysing the occupation of soldi...

Title: Organizations as Networks of Communication Episodes: Turning the Network Perspective Inside Out
Author-Name: Steffen Blaschke
Author-Name: Dennis Schoeneborn
Author-Name: David Seidl
Abstract: Over the last decades, the idea that communication constitutes organizations (CCO) has been gaining considerable momentum in organization studies. The CCO perspective provides new insights into key organizational issues, such as the relation between stability and change, between micro-level and macro-level phenomena, or between emergence and control. However, despite various theoretical advancements, the CCO perspective’s range of methodologies is still limited to analyzing local communication episodes, rather than studying organizations as broader networks of communication episodes. In this paper, we present a new methodological approach to the study of the relation between organization and communication, based on network analysis. Following a discussion of existing network approaches, we incorporate the fundamental assumptions of the CCO perspective into a methodology that places communication at the center of network analysis by turning the prevalent network perspective inside out, so that the vertices...

Title: ISO Certificates as Organizational Degrees? Beyond the Rational Myths of the Certification Process
Author-Name: Olivier Boiral
Abstract: This paper explores both the concrete and symbolic aspects of how ISO 9000 certification audits are prepared for and passed. Based on interviews with 60 respondents employed in certified organizations, this study analyzes the process of preparing for and passing an ISO certification audit through the lens of the degree-purchasing syndrome (DPS) in education, which refers to the disconnect between the acquisition of academic degrees and the learning process they should entail. This perspective makes it possible to go beyond the neo-institutional approach to shed light on the scholastic, ethical and contradictory aspects of the ISO certification process, which remain largely unexplored in the literature. The findings debunk the rhetoric of impartiality, objectivity and rigor surrounding the ISO certification process. They also reveal the tendency to acquire ISO certification as a sort of “organizational degree” after passing a quite predictable exam, with all the pitfalls that entails, such as rote preparat...

Title: Making Standards Stick: A Theory of Coupled vs. Decoupled Compliance
Author-Name: Kurt W. Sandholtz
Abstract: This paper presents an inductive account of how two divisions of the same corporation sought to standardize their engineering work. Although both groups achieved ISO 9000 certification, each was guided by historical antecedents and internal processes that left different legacies: a culture of cynicism and chaotic work practices in one division vis-a-vis a system of standardized work practices that are voluntarily (and often enthusiastically) followed in the other. The contrasting cases shed light on what happens when an external standard is adopted by an organization, converted into a formal directive, and then confronted by the norms and practices of an existing occupational community. More generally, the paper articulates how three common modes of social regulation—standards, directives, and norms—are interconnected in the process of implementing a standard in an organization, and the conditions under which institutional exigencies are either decoupled from or tightly coupled to technical work.

Abstract: A central idea in the theory of technology cycles is that social and political mechanisms are most important during the selection of a dominant design, and that eras of incremental change are socially uninteresting periods in which innovation is driven by technological momentum and elaboration of the dominant design. In this essay, we overturn the ontological assumption that social order is inherently stable, drawing on Anselm Strauss’s concept of negotiated order to analyze the persistence of a dominant design as a social accomplishment: an outcome of ongoing processes that reinforce or challenge a socially negotiated order. Thus, we shift focus from battles over standards to periods of normal innovation. We extend the technology cycles model to explain social dynamics in periods of incremental change, and to make predictions specifying how contextual conditions in standards-setting organizations affect social interaction, leading to reinforcement or challenge to a socio-technical order.

Title: The Paradox of Standard Flexibility: The Effects of Co-evolution between Standard and Interorganizational Network
Author-Name: Jan van den Ende

Author-Name: Henk J. de Vries
Abstract: The literature has dedicated significant attention to the effects of standard-supporting, interorganizational networks on the content of standards and standard survival. However, minimal attention has been paid to the effects of the standard’s characteristics and dynamics on these networks. This paper contributes to closing this gap. We introduce the paradoxical concept of ‘standard flexibility’ and study the interaction between the characteristics of a standard-supporting network and the development of the standard itself, including the effect of the interaction on standard success. More specifically, we show how a standard’s flexibility can serve to attract new network members, facilitating growth and diversity of the network, which in turn has implications for further adaptations of the standard. We study this co-evolutionary process in three standards battles: Blu-ray versus HD-DVD, USB versus Firewire, and WiFi versus HomeRF. Our findings suggest that those participating in standardization can persua...

Title: Standardization Cycles: A Process Perspective on the Formation and Diffusion of Transnational Standards
Author-Name: Sebastian Botzem
Author-Name: Leonhard Dobusch
Abstract: Standards are receiving increasing attention, especially at the transnational level where standardization aims at coherence and social ordering beyond the nation-state. However, many attempts to bring about uniformity via formalized standards fail. To understand better how such rules successfully span national and organizational boundaries over time, we compare two cases of standardization in international business. Both Windows desktop software and International Accounting Standards demonstrate the need for a process perspective to understand and explain social ordering through standards. Long-lasting standardization processes require conceptualizing how different sequences of transnational standardization relate to each other. We find that at the core of such recursive cycles is the interplay of input and output legitimacy.

Title: Standardization as Institutional Work: The Regulatory Power of a Responsible Investment Standard
Author-Name: Rieneke Slager
Author-Name: Jean-Pascal Gond
Author-Name: Jeremy Moon
Abstract: This paper conceptualizes standardization as institutional work to study the emergence of a standard and the deployment of its regulatory power. We rely on unique access to longitudinal archival data for exploring how the FTSE4Good index, a responsible investment index, emerged as a standard for socially responsible corporate behavior. Our results show how three types of standardization work – calculative framing, engaging and valorizing – support the design, legitimation and monitoring processes whereby a standard acquires its regulatory power. Our findings reveal new facets in the dynamics of standardization by approaching standardization as a product of institutional work and in showing how unintended consequences of that work can be recaptured to strengthen the regulatory power of the standard.

Title: The Emergence of a Standards Market: Multiplicity of Sustainability Standards in the Global Coffee Industry
Author-Name: Juliane Reinecke
Author-Name: Stephan Manning
Author-Name: Oliver von Hagen
Abstract: The growing number of voluntary standards for governing transnational arenas is presenting standards organizations with a problem. While claiming that they are pursuing shared, overarching objectives, at the same time they are promoting their own respective standards that are increasingly similar. By developing the notion of ‘standards markets’, this paper examines this tension and studies how different social movement and industry-driven standards organizations compete as well as collaborate over governance in transnational arenas. Based on an in-depth case study of sustainability standards in the global coffee industry, we find that the ongoing co-existence of multiple standards is being promoted by the interplay between two countervailing mechanisms: convergence and differentiation. In conjunction, these mechanisms are enabling the emergence and persistence of a market for standards through what we describe as meta-standardization of sustainable practices. Meta-standardization leads to convergence at t...

Author-Name: Patrick Haack

Author-Name: Christopher Wickert
Abstract: This paper examines the type and temporal development of language in the process of corporate responsibility (CR) standardization. Previous research on CR standardization has addressed the proliferation and organizational embedding of material practices but neglected the analysis of underlying ideational dynamics. Departing from this practice, we introduce a narrative perspective that illuminates the trajectory a CR standard follows, from being formally adopted to becoming collectively accepted as a valid solution to a problem of societal concern. We argue that this perspective helps scholars explore the dynamic interplay between symbolic and material aspects of standardization and understand better the discursive antecedents of coupling processes in organizations. Drawing on the case of the Equator Principles standard in international project finance, we empirically study how narratives create meaning shared by both business firms and their societal observers, thereby exemplifying the analytical merit of...

Abstract: The creation of new roles commonly threatens the power and status of elite professionals through the substitution of their labour. In this paper we examine the institutional work carried out by elite professionals to maintain their professional dominance when threatened. Drawing on 11 case sites from the English National Health Service (NHS) where new nursing or medical roles have been introduced, threatening the power and status of specialist doctors, we observed the following. First, the professional elite respond through institutional work to supplant threat of substitution with the opportunity for them to delegate routine tasks to other actors and maintain existing resource and control arrangements over the delivery of services in a way that enhances elite professionals’ status. Second, other professionals outside the professional elite, but relatively powerful within their own professional group, are co-opted by the professional elite to engage in institutional work to maintain existing arrangements....

Title: Tertius Iungens Brokerage and Transnational Intersectoral Cooperation

Abstract: Tertius iungens brokerage is unique within the dominant brokerage conceptualizations in sociology. While most brokerage research finds that brokers reap rewards from mediating relationships in ways that keep actors apart, iungens research finds that brokers can have an interest in joining previously disconnected actors and sustaining these relationships. This paper expands the explanatory potential of iungens brokerage by building a multidimensional theoretical framework that explains transnational connecting processes, generating insights beyond the traditional focus on network structures into the under-researched area of brokerage across institutions. The paper synthesizes streams of brokerage research that have developed in relative isolation from each other to elucidate how organizational brokers and their staffs create transnational structural and cognitive connections that draw actors together into intersectoral networks that cross two or more nationally organized regulatory regimes and cultural sys...

Abstract: This paper explores the potential for morally sustainable leadership, i.e., leadership with an awareness of both light and dark sides contained in the role of the leader, as symbolized by the archetype of the king. A narrative enquiry aiming at the study of fictive stories authored by management theorists and practitioners from different contexts, interweaving collective individual elements, brings to light how issues of leadership goodness are related to each other and to other themes. The stories are presented as archetypical tales, that is, stories that touch profound aspects of culture and the psyche. They reveal what happens when people are asked to imagine a good manager, and how this results in tragic ironic representations, rather than tales of straightforward goodness.

Title: The Visible Colleges of Management and Organization Studies: A Bibliometric Analysis of Academic Journals
Author-Name: Rick Vogel
Abstract: Informal groups play a pivotal role in the socio-cognitive structuring and development of all scientific fields. While most social studies on such groups present a static view, taking a snapshot of them at a certain moment in time, this study sheds a dynamic perspective on invisible colleges and examines empirically how they evolve in the course of time. Drawing on the neo-Kuhnian sociology of science, it defines invisible colleges as communication networks and considers how their emergence and evolution is affected by the organizational features of fragmented adhocracies. The empirical aspect focuses on formal scholarly communication through publication in a sample of seven leading journals in the field of management and organization studies over three decades. The methodology is rooted in bibliometrics and combines co-citation analysis with network visualization. The resulting networks, which reflect the community structure of the field, map 40 different colleges. Seven patterns of how this nested struc...

Abstract: Taking issue with the classical theory of path dependence, we capture the active agency involved in collective efforts aimed at extending a current technological path and, in parallel, at creating a new path in the field of leading-edge international semiconductor manufacturing. We apply structuration theory in order to analyse the practices of path constitution that traditional evolutionary views of lock-in and irreversibility in path processes have neglected. Drawing on 96 interviews since 2003 and extensive secondary sources in the field of semiconductor manufacturing in Europe, Japan and the United States, we perform a qualitative, longitudinal and multi-level case analysis; in this analysis we trace, in particular, the strategic development of a path-extending technological option besides a potentially path-breaking new generation of lithography for chip manufacturing systems. Our results provide deep insights into the collective and collaborative dimension of organizing R&D in processes of technolog...

Title: Clandestine Organizations, al Qaeda, and the Paradox of (In)Visibility: A Response to Stohl and Stohl
Author-Name: Dennis Schoeneborn
Author-Name: Andreas Georg Scherer
Abstract: In a recent article published in this journal, Stohl and Stohl (2011) examine the phenomenon of clandestine organizations from a communication-centered perspective. The authors draw primarily on the work of the ‘Montreal School’ of organizational communication, which stresses the constitutive role of communication for organizations. In this response, we argue that the Stohls’ paper does not make full use of the paradigmatic turn that the Montreal School offers to organization studies. In our view, the authors overemphasize the role of communication among organizational members in the constitution of organizations. In contrast, we argue that organizations can also be ‘talked into existence’ by the communicative acts of third parties (e.g., the media), a view that is consistent with the Montreal School’s work. Moreover, drawing on the Stohls’ central example of the terrorist organization al Qaeda, we suggest that the attribute ‘clandestine’ does not capture the essence of that organization because it is cha...

Abstract: The introductory paper to the Special Issue discusses psychoanalytic contributions to the study of contemporary organizations. The aim is to draw attention to psychoanalysis as a critical theory with wide explanatory power and a potential for thinking about organizational practice in new ways. It does so firstly, by reviewing the impact it had so far on illuminating group dynamics, leadership dysfunctions and the sanctioned socially institutional defences. Secondly, it contests the limited impact of psychoanalysis on mainstream organization and management theory as an unfortunate outcome since it represents arguably the most advanced and compelling conception of human subjectivity that any theoretical approach has to offer. By way of example, seven papers comprising this Special Issue are introduced. Lastly the paper outlines future developments in the psychoanalytic studies of organizations that might be about: (i) greater conceptual inclusivity and crossing the boundaries between the humanities and scie...

Title: The Contribution of Psychoanalysis to Organization Studies and Management: An Overview
Author-Name: Gilles Arnaud
Abstract: A prolific current of research focusing on the psychodynamics of work, leadership and organizations has taken form over approximately the last 60 years. The richness of this current remains in full evidence today and shows the interest of applying psychoanalysis to research work on management. First, psychoanalysis can aid researchers to develop a more profound comprehension of organizational functioning by taking into account the effects of the unconscious. Second, it can guide them in different fields of intervention by transposing aspects of the analytical treatment and integrating transference. Last, it can allow them to re-question managerial ends from a slightly ‘askew’ point of view informed by psychoanalytic ethics and recognition of the ‘subject’. This review article aims at examining these issues and offering psychoanalytic theory as a paradigm for the study of management.

Title: Organizations in a State of Darkness: Towards a Theory of Organizational Miasma
Author-Name: Yiannis Gabriel
Abstract: This paper uses psychoanalytic ideas to develop a theory of organizational miasma, a concept that describes a contagious state of pollution – material, psychological and spiritual – that afflicts all who work in certain organizations that undergo sudden and traumatic transformations. Miasma is offered not as another organizational metaphor, a prism through which to view particular organizations. Instead, I delineate the fundamental psychodynamics of organizational miasma as a theoretical concept that accounts for and explains numerous processes in these organizations. These include a paralysis of resistance, an experience of pollution and uncleanliness, and feelings of disgust, worthlessness and corruption. Miasma may occur in organizations that undergo a sudden transformation involving the discarding and loss of many of their valued members through downsizing or retrenchment, without either separation rituals or psychological mourning. The ‘old’ organization is frequently presented as corrupt, indulgent ...

Title: Organizational Turbulence, Trouble and Trauma: Theorizing the Collapse of a Mental Health Setting
Author-Name: Michael D. Fischer
Abstract: Turbulence is usually considered a negative property of an organization’s environment. Yet turbulence is also a feature of an organization’s internal dynamics and may be useful for productivity. This article argues that interactions between the formal and informal management of trouble produce relational turbulence that may mobilize resources and collective action, or conversely lead to dysfunction and crisis. The author links relational psychoanalytic theory with social constructionist perspectives in exploring intersubjective dynamics of trouble and its repercussions of turbulence. Based on a longitudinal interorganizational ethnography, an atypical mental healthcare organization is described – a democratic therapeutic community – in which turbulence plays a central function, but in two very different ways. In a restorative mode, turbulence generates formative spaces that are creative and have a regulating function, useful for organizational productivity. Conversely, a perverse mode is destructive and m...

Title: ‘Someone Big and Important’: Identification and Affect in an International Development Organization
Author-Name: Kate Kenny
Abstract: Psychoanalysis has been widely used to develop our understanding of power in organizations. In this paper, I draw on a case study of a non-profit organization in the field of international development, in order to explore in depth how people engage with powerful discourses at play in this context. I use an ethnographic approach to do so, and find Lacan’s ideas on identification and affect to be useful in the analysis of the case. I show how, at first glance, people appeared to readily alter their activities and goals in response to the wishes of an important donor. However, moving deeper to examine identifications on the part of people themselves reveals complex forms of recognition that were inscribed by affective relations. I discuss the implications of these findings for the study of organizations, including the contribution of the concept of affect for studies of identification and subjection in organizations, and the value of ethnographic research approaches that draw upon Lacan’s work on recognition.

Title: ‘The Return of the Primal Father’ in Postmodernity? A Lacanian Analysis of Authentic Leadership
Author-Name: Jana Costas
Author-Name: Alireza Taheri
Abstract: A significant stream of research taking a psychoanalytic perspective has focused on leadership in organizations. Studies have investigated, from a Freudian perspective, leader–follower relations where the leader represents a domineering and authoritarian father figure. We contribute to this research by introducing Lacanian theory to explore the increasingly influential ‘authentic leadership’ approach. In contrast to traditional leadership, this approach advocates, in line with postmodern trends, a post-heroic, non-authoritarian and even self-effacing leader figure. In analysing academic and practitioner-oriented authentic leadership texts we ask, drawing on Lacanian insights, whether authentic leadership enables subjects to separate from the master discourse of traditional leadership through promoting something like the analyst discourse, or whether it entails the return of a phantasmagorical Freudian primal father figure, leading to heightened dependency. In so doing, we discuss the political significanc...

Title: The Unwanted Self: Projective Identification in Leaders’ Identity Work
Author-Name: Gianpiero Petriglieri
Author-Name: Mark Stein
Abstract: This paper employs a psychodynamic perspective to examine the development and maintenance of a leader’s identity, building on the premise that such identity work involves both conscious and unconscious processes. We focus on the latter by suggesting that those in coveted leadership roles may engage in projective identification to shape and sustain an identity befitting those roles. Projective identification is the unconscious projection of unwanted aspects of one’s self into others, leading to the bolstering of a conscious self-view concordant with one’s role requirements. Recipients of a leader’s projections may manage these by projecting them back into the leader or into third parties, which may lead to ongoing conflict and the creation of a toxic culture. We use examples from the Gucci family business to illustrate this process.

Title: The Subordination of the Feminine? Developing a Critical Feminist Approach to the Psychoanalysis of Organizations
Author-Name: Sheena J. Vachhani
Abstract: This paper investigates the intersections between psychoanalysis and feminist thinking as they may be applied to organization studies by problematizing sexual difference. By critically engaging with the influence of (primarily Lacanian) psychoanalysis, I explore feminist psychoanalytic approaches with their close attention to patriarchy and phallocentrism. More specifically, I engage with the work of Luce Irigaray, whose influential role in French feminist philosophy has occupied what could be termed a difficult or sacrificial position in Lacanian psychoanalysis. I argue that the focus of psychoanalysis on the Phallus as a primary signifier may be fruitfully problematized through a feminist lens (Grosz, 1990), conceived here through Irigaray, and that its usefulness for organizational analysis depends on an ability to recognize, invite and attend to its gendered core. It is argued that Irigaray brings fruitful resources to this debate. Irigaray is concerned with the significant political and ethical dilem...

Title: The Dynamics of Standardization: Three Perspectives on Standards in Organization Studies
Author-Name: Nils Brunsson
Author-Name: Andreas Rasche
Author-Name: David Seidl
Abstract: This paper suggests that when the phenomenon of standards and standardization is examined from the perspective of organization studies, three aspects stand out: the standardization of organizations, standardization by organizations and standardization as (a form of) organization. Following a comprehensive overview of existing research in these three areas, we argue that the dynamic aspects of standardization are under-represented in the scholarly discourse. Furthermore, we identify the main types of tension associated with standardization and the dynamics they generate in each of those three areas, and show that, while standards and standardization are typically associated with stability and sameness, they are essentially a dynamic phenomenon. The paper highlights the contributions of this special issue to the topic of standards as a dynamic phenomenon in organization studies and makes suggestions for future research.

Abstract: Social capital has been hailed as a means of virtuous, effective and enjoyable productivity through which firms can flourish. But it also confines advantage to network members and discriminates against non-members. This paper, drawing on detailed qualitative research into work in the UK film and TV industry, reveals the advantages and the disadvantages of social capital. Social capital aided recruitment, policed quality standards and ensured behavioural norms with the sort of speed and flexibility it would be hard to identify in other forms of organizing. However, it also advantaged white, middle-class men and ensured that middle-class signals came to be proxies for the most sought-after jobs. Professionals who were women, members of ethnic minorities or working class were less likely to secure jobs and were often restricted in the type of jobs they held. Significantly, the members of disadvantaged groups who succeeded did so after long periods employed by the terrestrial broadcasters or after extended ap...

Title: Object-Control: A Study of Technologically Dense Knowledge Work
Author-Name: Jens Rennstam
Abstract: Drawing on the literature on active objects and combining it with an ethnographic study of engineering work, this paper offers an alternative and complementary understanding of the problem of control in knowledge-intensive work. This problem largely concerns the question of how creative processes of knowing are enabled on behalf of the organization. The dominant response to this question revolves around the idea that when work becomes complex, managers attempt to control the norms and identifications of employees, rather than their behaviours. Through the concept of object-control, the idea is introduced that organizational objects participate on behalf of the organization in processes of knowledge control by interpellating organizational members; that is, organizational members are invited to interact with the objects and to creatively develop knowledge in order to solve organizational problems. The study covers ground that the established notions of normative control and identity regulation have neglect...

Title: Metaphors of Failure and the Failures of Metaphor: A Critical Study of Root Metaphors used by Bankers in Explaining the Banking Crisis
Author-Name: Dennis Tourish
Author-Name: Owen Hargie
Abstract: This paper analyses the testimony of four banking CEOs to the Banking Crisis Inquiry of the Treasury Committee of the UK House of Commons in 2009. We explore the root metaphors they employed as they sought to explain the banking failures that had occurred. Our analysis identifies four such metaphors. First, ‘the wisdom of the crowd’, in that bankers were influenced by the behaviour of significant others. Second, the bankers depict themselves as at times being forced to be passive observers of events. Third, they characterize themselves as victims of the crisis, sharing in the widespread pain it produced. Fourth, they are penitent learners, able and willing to improve. The main intent seems to be to frame public discussion of the crisis in terms which diminishes their responsibility for what happened. We also argue that the bankers’ discourse had limited impact in terms of framing public debate, while the metaphors they employed have the potential to minimize learning from failure. The study of the metapho...

Title: Control and Dignity in Professional, Manual and Service-Sector Employment
Author-Name: Martha Crowley
Abstract: This study investigates implications of complex control combinations applied in manual, service and professional occupations for expressive, behavioral and emotional aspects of workplace dignity. Qualitative comparative analyses of 154 content-coded workplace ethnographies suggest that professionals encounter persuasive ‘bundles’ of control that enhance expressive and behavioral manifestations of dignity as well as pride. However, these benefits come at the expense of high levels of stress associated with internal drives and externally driven normative orientations and behaviors. Workers in manual and service occupations confront a broader array of approaches, including coercive control combinations that erode pride and effort by dehumanizing workers and inviting abuse. Furthermore, the benefits of persuasive control combinations in these settings are mitigated by supplementary constraints, which promote maintenance of a protective distance from employers that may also help to limit stress.

Title: Rhythm and Entrainment of Acquisition and Alliance Initiatives and Firm Performance: A Temporal Perspective
Author-Name: Weilei (Stone) Shi
Author-Name: John E. Prescott
Abstract: A temporal perspective, focusing on when and under what conditions firms should accelerate or slow down their acquisition and alliance initiatives, is gaining momentum in strategy research. We explore the temporal relationships between rhythm, entrainment and firm performance. Firms that temporally structure the rhythm of repetitive acquisitions in an even-event pace achieve superior performance as compared to an even or event pace. We also find that intraentrainment—the internal synchronization between acquisition and alliance initiatives—enhances performance and the extraentrainment of alliances—the synchronization with competitors’ alliance rhythm—enhances performance. Our findings have important implications for the organizational improvisation, dynamic fit and alliance/acquisition experience literatures which further opens the window to understanding the creation of competitive advantage by managing rhythm-type strategic actions over time.

Title: Beneath the Radar? A Critical Realist Analysis of ‘The Knowledge Economy’ and ‘Shareholder Value’ as Competing Discourses
Author-Name: Paul Thompson
Author-Name: Bill Harley
Abstract: This paper seeks to apply a critical realist lens to the analysis of discourse. Our central argument is that the most fruitful way to make sense of discourse is to treat it as an empirical object of inquiry alongside extra-discursive phenomena. In making this argument, we consider two recent discourses, the ‘knowledge-based economy’ (KBE) and ‘shareholder value’ (SV) and demonstrate that, while the KBE discourse gained much more attention, SV discourse had much more significant material outcomes. We suggest that research on the potential causal powers of discourse should move away from an exclusive focus on the discursive and pay attention to actors and institutions and to extra-discursive conditions and constraints.

Title: ‘You Need to be Healthy to be Ill’: Constructing Sickness and Framing the Body in Swedish Healthcare
Author-Name: Daniel Nyberg
Abstract: Recent trends have seen a move from ‘welfare’ to ‘workfare’ in Europe to increase labour flexibility and reduce state expenditure on sickness absence. This shift in healthcare logics has meant an increasing role for individuals to take an active part in the political process of managing their health and sickness absence. This paper draws upon empirical cases of observations of status meetings, in which the employee’s medical situation and work capacity are evaluated, as well as interviews with participating actors. The study finds that governmental standards are, at times, incompatible with each other and this complexity allows for local strategies in managing the sickness absence process. These findings are discussed in relation to employment and it is concluded that local actors’ translations of policies have important material consequences for employees’ health, rehabilitation opportunities and access to sickness benefits. This contributes to our understanding of how political interventions to govern t...

Title: Subjects of Inquiry: Statistics, Stories, and the Production of Knowledge
Author-Name: Susan Ainsworth
Author-Name: Cynthia Hardy
Abstract: Statistics and stories are often equated with different types of knowledge in contemporary western societies: statistics are associated more with the authority of objective, disinterested experts while stories are able to encapsulate subjective, personal experience. In this paper, we explore how both genres were used to produce knowledge in the context of a public inquiry on the problems facing older workers in securing and maintaining employment. Drawing on the concept of power/knowledge relations we examine how statistics and stories were used in different inquiry texts and trace their use across texts over time. Our findings show that to establish their authority as a valid form of knowledge representing the subject of inquiry, statistics and stories both had to be embedded in the appropriate discursive conventions. In the case of statistics, knowledge had to be expressed through discursive conventions that conveyed distance from the subject of inquiry, i.e. independent, objective research. In contrast...

Title: Inter-professional Barriers and Knowledge Brokering in an Organizational Context: The Case of Healthcare
Author-Name: Graeme Currie
Author-Name: Leroy White
Abstract: Our study examines brokering of situated knowledge within an organizational context, characterized by professional hierarchy. We examine how professional affiliation and associated power differentials impact upon knowledge brokering at the individual and group levels within an organization. Our empirical case, which combines social network analysis and qualitative fieldwork, is set in healthcare with a focus upon integration of management, psychosocial and clinical component knowledge domains deemed necessary for treatment of a long-term condition. Our study shows that peer-to-peer knowledge brokering, which is framed by professional hierarchy, remains pervasive with respect to medical knowledge brokering. However, social structures might be mediated through developing architectural knowledge, reflected in both formal and informal organizational routines and schema, which engenders community tendencies that transcend professional hierarchy, so that knowledge brokering is more widely distributed to benefit...

Title: The Lack of Power or the Power of Lack in Leadership as a Discursively Constructed Identity
Author-Name: Michaela Driver
Abstract: The study uses a psychoanalytic framework to explore how leadership identities are constructed. It advances the idea that leadership identities are imaginary constructions that invariable fail, reiterating a lack of being. Empirical material consisting of interviews with 15 leaders is used to explore the productive role this lack plays. The study suggests that leadership identities are always already subverted by unconscious desire and therefore less powerful than we might think with regard to imposing structures on others, but also much more powerful than we might think as liberating struggles with leaders’ imaginary selves.

Title: “Hippies on the third floor”: Climate Change, Narrative Identity and the Micro-Politics of Corporate Environmentalism
Author-Name: Christopher Wright
Author-Name: Daniel Nyberg
Author-Name: David Grant
Abstract: Climate change discourse permeates political and popular consciousness, challenging the ecological sustainability of our economic system and the business models that underpin it. Not surprisingly climate change has become an increasingly divisive and partisan political issue. While a growing literature has sought to address how business organizations are responding to climate change, the subjective perceptions of managers on this issue have received less attention. In this article we contribute to an understanding of the dynamic interaction between identities and organizations, by showing how sustainability managers and consultants balance tensions and contradictions between their own sense of self and the various work and non-work contexts in which they find themselves. Based on a qualitative, social constructivist method, we examine how these individuals develop different identities in negotiating between conflicting discourses and their sense of self. We explore how these different identities arise, in...

Title: Science or Science Fiction? Professionals’ Discursive Construction of Climate Change
Author-Name: Lianne M. Lefsrud
Author-Name: Renate E. Meyer
Abstract: This paper examines the framings and identity work associated with professionals’ discursive construction of climate change science, their legitimation of themselves as experts on ‘the truth’, and their attitudes towards regulatory measures. Drawing from survey responses of 1077 professional engineers and geoscientists, we reconstruct their framings of the issue and knowledge claims to position themselves within their organizational and their professional institutions. In understanding the struggle over what constitutes and legitimizes expertise, we make apparent the heterogeneity of claims, legitimation strategies, and use of emotionality and metaphor. By linking notions of the science or science fiction of climate change to the assessment of the adequacy of global and local policies and of potential organizational responses, we contribute to the understanding of ‘defensive institutional work’ by professionals within petroleum companies, related industries, government regulators, and their professional a...

Title: Information Warfare and New Organizational Landscapes: An Inquiry into the ExxonMobil–Greenpeace Dispute over Climate Change
Author-Name: Brad MacKay
Author-Name: Iain Munro
Abstract: A defining characteristic of the emergence of new organizational landscapes is that information is not just being used as a tool by organizations, as it is more usually understood, but also as a weapon in a ‘war of position’. As organizations seek to influence public perception over emotive issues such as climate change, conflict at the ideational level can give rise to information warfare campaigns. This concerns the creation and deployment of often ideologically infused ideas through information networks to promote an organization’s interests over those of its adversaries. In this article, we analyse the ways in which ExxonMobil and Greenpeace employ distinctive informational tactics against a range of diverse targets in their dispute over the climate change debate. The purpose of this article is to advance the neo-Gramscian perspective on social movement organizations as a framework for understanding such behaviour. We argue that information warfare is likely to become common as corporations and non-go...

Title: A Matter of Time: The Temporal Perspectives of Organizational Responses to Climate Change
Author-Name: Natalie Slawinski
Author-Name: Pratima Bansal
Abstract: Prior research often categorizes corporate environmental responses on a spectrum that ranges from reactive to proactive. Such research subordinates the role of time, yet time is central to organizational responses to environmental issues such as climate change. In this paper, we study five oil and gas firms and inductively develop a framework of corporate responses to climate change that explicitly acknowledges the role of time. The framework identifies two categories of corporate responses grounded in different temporal perspectives: focused and integrated. We discuss the implications of this categorization for research on corporate environmentalism and time in organizational theory.

Title: The Inclusion of Aviation in the EU Emissions Trading Scheme: Temporal Conditions for Institutional Entrepreneurship
Author-Name: Katarina Buhr
Abstract: Recent literature on institutional entrepreneurship has examined the enabling conditions under which actors may influence institutional arrangements. Whereas conditions at field level and among actors have been highlighted, scholars have paid little attention to how and why the field is amenable to change at certain times and how actors act upon these conditions in a timely fashion. This paper examines the temporal conditions for institutional entrepreneurship. I propose that a collective of time-aware institutional entrepreneurs opens a window of opportunity for policy breakthrough by relating its activities to temporally favorable conditions of the multidimensional institutional process. These theoretical propositions are illustrated through an empirical case study of how aviation was targeted for its climate change impact by inclusion in the EU Emissions Trading Scheme.

Title: Market-Based Responses to Climate Change: CO2 Market Design versus Operation
Author-Name: Gareth Veal
Author-Name: Stefanos Mouzas
Abstract: This study highlights significant discrepancies between CO2 market design and the actual operation of CO2 markets. Our findings are based upon an empirical investigation undertaken in the context of the European Emissions Trading Scheme between January 2009 and May 2010. CO2 markets are examined from a practice-based perspective in which actors are engaged in exchange, representational and normalizing practices. Discrepancies between the actual and intended CO2 market practices are explained using the concepts of framing, overflowing and regulatory capture. We argue that the design of the European Emissions Trading Scheme has been influenced in such a way that it does not actually challenge market participants to reduce their CO2 emissions. In this way, the study challenges the near universal reliance upon CO2 markets as the primary policy mechanism for mitigating climate change.

Title: Greening Capitalism? A Marxist Critique of Carbon Markets
Author-Name: Steffen Böhm
Author-Name: Maria Ceci Misoczky
Author-Name: Sandra Moog
Abstract: Climate change is increasingly being recognized as a serious threat to dominant modes of social organization, inspiring suggestions that capitalism itself needs to be transformed if we are to ‘decarbonize’ the global economy. Since the Kyoto Protocol in 1997, carbon markets have emerged as the main politico-economic tools in global efforts to address climate change. Newell and Paterson (2010) have recently claimed that the embrace of carbon markets by financial and political elites constitutes a possible first step towards the transformation of current modes of capitalist organization into a new form of greener, more sustainable ‘climate capitalism.’ In this paper, we argue that the institutionalization of carbon markets does not, in fact, represent a move towards the radical transformation of capitalism, but is better understood as the most recent expression of ongoing trends of ecological commodification and expropriation, driving familiar processes of uneven and crisis-prone development. In this paper,...

Title: A Climate for Change? Critical Reflections on the Durban United Nations Climate Change Conference
Author-Name: Subhabrata Bobby Banerjee
Abstract: Despite more than fifteen years of high level efforts led by the United Nations to broker a binding agreement on emissions reduction, negotiations at every annual meeting have failed to establish a global agreement, mainly due to significant disagreements between industrialized and developing countries over differentiated responsibilities in reducing emissions. In this paper I describe my experiences as a participant-observer at the 17th United Nations Climate Change summit held in Durban, South Africa, during December 2011. I provide a critical analysis of the political economy of climate change and discuss power dynamics between market, state and civil society actors as well as the shifting geopolitics that mark the emergence of China and India as major players in the climate change arena.

Abstract: Genocide has been a constant presence in the history of humanity throughout the ages. Recently, calls to study the organization of genocide and genocidal organizations have been increasing. In this paper we study the functioning of the S-21 extermination camp, an instrument of Ângkar, ‘The Organization’, which imposed genocide on the Cambodian people in the 1970s. We analyse the conditions that enable the organization of genocide, showing that three pillars seem to play essential roles: a utopian vision; support of this vision by total institutional spaces, and the control commitments of the people caught in the utopian vortex. Genocide appears as a potential outcome of the particular type of organization combining these three processes.

Abstract: There is general agreement across the world that human-made climate change is a serious global problem, although there are still some sceptics who challenge this view. Research in organization studies on the topic is relatively new. Much of this research, however, is instrumental and managerialist in its focus on ‘win-win’ opportunities for business or its treatment of climate change as just another corporate social responsibility (CSR) exercise. In this paper, we suggest that climate change is not just an environmental problem requiring technical and managerial solutions; it is a political issue where a variety of organizations – state agencies, firms, industry associations, NGOs and multilateral organizations – engage in contestation as well as collaboration over the issue. We discuss the strategic, institutional and political economy dimensions of climate change and develop a socioeconomic regimes approach as a synthesis of these different theoretical perspectives. Given the urgency of the problem and ...

Title: Stretching Concepts: The Role of Competing Pressures and Decoupling in the Evolution of Organization Concepts
Author-Name: Stefan Heusinkveld
Author-Name: Jos Benders
Author-Name: Bas Hillebrand
Abstract: To contribute to the understanding of the evolution of organization concepts, this article focuses on how consultants respond to competing pressures during the maturity and decline phases of an initially popular concept. Management consultants are important fashion setters, but the actual strategies they use to deal with the pressures to remain legitimate, increase efficiency and differentiate themselves from competitors remain unclear. Such supply-side dynamics likely influence how organization concepts evolve and are relevant for understanding how management knowledge may survive a fashion boom and bust. Using interview and print media data from 32 consultants from 14 consultancies, we identify seven response strategies, and show how these are associated with multiple pressures, and comprise different implications for the evolution of a concept. We argue that this variety of responses is essential to better understand the evolution of organization concepts and opens several fruitful research directions.

Abstract: Would organizations function better if managers did not use buzzwords? This paper traces a history of buzzwords and highlights three ways they help managers. First, managers use buzzwords to claim authority. Second, managers use buzzwords to facilitate action. Third, managers use buzzwords to displace responsibility for hard decisions. The paper concludes that there are benefits to using buzzwords and managers should be conscious of them.

Title: Things Seen and Unseen: Investigating Experience-Based Qualities of Attention in a Dynamic Work Setting
Author-Name: Erik Dane
Abstract: While interest in the topic of attention has a long history in organizational studies, little research has investigated what qualities of attention are most pertinent to working professionals—and how these qualities may be attained. Through the study reported here, I elaborate theory concerning the qualities of attention in a dynamic work setting (trial law). Specifically, I identify the importance of two qualities of attention—attentional breadth and attentional integration—and examine how these qualities connect to the experiences individuals accrue within the focal context. My findings indicate that, through the acquisition of experience, individuals become attentive to a wide range of events surrounding them (via attentional breadth) and attuned to the opportunities that reside within these events (via attentional integration). Therefore, in achieving these two qualities of attention, individuals are able to see not only more events but also more possibilities.

Abstract: Firms can be conceived as political entities in which various stakeholders struggle against each other to reach goals. From this standpoint, the organizational structure of a firm, together with the power relations and strategies deployed by stakeholders, constitute a governance regime. It is understood that the economic performance of a firm is impacted by the type of governance regime which is at play among its different stakeholders, but little is known on the effects of governance regimes on organizational creative performance. Adopting a center/periphery perspective, we look at business groups, a well-known type of business firm in creative settings. A salient question is thus to know how firms affiliated to various types of business groups perform vis-a-vis unaffiliated firms, and what are the underlying political processes. We define three different regimes of governance—empires, federated arrangements, and kingdoms—each characterized by specific regulation and integration features. Regulation refe...

Title: Institutionalization in the Context of Institutional Pluralism: Politics as a Generative Process
Author-Name: Kyoung-Hee Yu
Abstract: Institutionalizing a new organizational template in a pluralistic environment where multiple institutional logics coexist entails unique challenges where actors must negotiate conflict and carry out integrative and adaptive work. This paper examines how organizational actors in a large service sector trade union managed to craft integrative processes out of contentious processes in institutionalizing a new organizational template. Recently, renewed attention has focused on politics as a means through which integration is achieved in organizations under multiple institutional pressures. However, we know relatively little about how politics achieves organizational integration in pluralistic contexts. This paper sheds light on how successful institutionalization processes actually unfold in organizations. While extant literature on intra-organizational political processes has depicted politics mainly as a zero-sum game, findings in this study suggest that politics can be a generative process through which or...

Title: ‘Walls or Boxes’: The Effects of Professional Identity, Power and Rationality on Strategies for Cross-Functional Integration
Author-Name: Vibeke Vad Baunsgaard
Author-Name: Stewart Clegg
Abstract: Small- to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are recognized as drivers of economic growth, yet commonly face low innovation and organizational success due to insufficient cross-functional integration. We pose the simple question: what factors hinder cross-functional integration from occurring? We analyse cross-functional integration at management level by developing the framework of dominant ideological modes of rationality, composing professional identity, power relations and rationalities and through the construct of ‘members’ categorization devices’ (MCDs). The article builds theory from a longitudinal in-depth empirical investigation of ‘everyday’ micro-political processes involved in cross-functional integration by drawing on political and ethnomethodological perspectives. It provides novel findings on the dynamics between power relations and cross-functional integration, the influence of ‘thought worlds’ of different functions involved in the innovation process, and contributes empirical evidence that ...

Title: How Employee Selection Decisions are Made in Practice
Author-Name: Pernilla Bolander
Author-Name: Jörgen Sandberg
Abstract: Existing literature on employee selection contains an abundance of knowledge of how selection should take place but almost nothing about how it occurs in practice. This paper presents an ethnomethodological-discourse analytical real-time study of how selection decisions are made in situ. The main findings suggest that selection decision making is characterized by ongoing practical deliberation involving four interrelated discursive processes: assembling versions of the candidates; establishing the versions of the candidates as factual; reaching selection decisions; and using selection tools as sensemaking devices. In addition, this paper identifies two basic forms of selection decision making: one characterized by initial agreement and one characterized by initial disagreement. In each basic form of decision making, selectors reason through the four discursive processes in a methodical, situated and practical manner in order to construct local versions of the candidates and make ‘reasonable’ selection dec...

Author-Name: Jan Feller
Author-Name: Annaleena Parhankangas
Author-Name: Riitta Smeds
Author-Name: Miia Jaatinen
Abstract: Previous research has maintained that the capacity to manage alliances is a distinct capability, defined as the ability to identify, negotiate, manage, monitor and terminate collaborations. This paper focuses on an important but hitherto neglected aspect of alliance capability by investigating how partnering firms may learn how to better manage their dyadic R&D collaborations. In particular, we seek to test the Nonaka and Takeuchi (1995) model of dynamic knowledge creation by establishing a link between the facilitation of four knowledge conversion processes – socialization, externalization, combination and internalization – and an improved capability to manage inter-organizational R&D processes. We specify and extend the model by identifying and testing several critical interactions between these knowledge conversion processes. Relying on data from 105 R&D partnerships in the global telecommunications industry, we suggest that the failure to support one of these knowledge conversion processes has the pot...

Title: Could a Subaltern Manage? Identity Work and Habitus in a Colonial Workplace
Author-Name: Nidhi Srinivas
Abstract: How did historically marginalized groups learn to become professional managers? This paper studies the identity work of a manager in a colonial work setting, focusing specifically on the aspirational quality of professional identity, and on the forms of subordination enmeshed in organizational work, through a close reading of an autobiography. Beyond Punjab describes the career of Prakash Tandon in the multinational Lever Brothers India. He eventually became its first Indian Chief Executive and a respected public figure. Studies of such colonial work settings can seem indebted to existing research within postcolonial studies in management. But I argue that the dominant attention of postcolonial studies in management has not been on identity work and practices, but the historical enduring force of representations. Therefore this paper offers a complementary engagement, developing Bourdieu’s concept of the habitus for a fuller understanding of how managerial identity was constituted in colonial work setting...

Title: A Process Model of Internal and External Legitimacy
Author-Name: Israel Drori

Abstract: We report the results of a longitudinal case study depicting the relationship between internal and external legitimacy at Orion, an emergent creative professional firm. We address the following questions: How do different types of legitimacy emerge, and how do they interact to shape organizational evolution? Introducing a staged process model, we demonstrate that organizational legitimacy is a product of action, which is continually reproduced and reconstructed by members of an organization in concert with external legitimation activities. Internal and external legitimacy evolve through a process of emergence, validation, diffusion and consensus, sometimes recursively repeating the cycle when imbalances result in conflict and friction.

Author-Name: Jacky F. L. Hong
Author-Name: Robin Stanley Snell
Abstract: Our nested case study shows how a China-based focal subsidiary of a Japanese MNC used various power bases to orchestrate a co-opetitive and diverse supplier ecosystem, and to drive cumulative cycles of collaborative capability development involving successive phases of capability gap articulation, evolution and institutionalization. All phases of capability development required the crossing of cognitive boundaries, which was facilitated by mutual engagement with boundary objects, and by common possession of generic background knowledge disseminated by the focal firm. The capability evolution phase also required the crossing of social and governance boundaries, which was supported and legitimized by shared framing assumptions about mutual benefit and continuous development, while the capability institutionalization phase also required the crossing of governance boundaries. Although the focal firm was open to suggestions for mutual benefit, it exercised unilateral control over design decisions, thereby pres...

Title: Organizational Values: A Dynamic Perspective

Abstract: We make the case that there are four distinct forms of organizational values – espoused, attributed, shared and aspirational. These partial, but related, forms encompass variation in temporal orientation and levels of analysis. We use these forms to reveal the dynamic nature of organizational values by delineating the evolution of gaps and overlaps between them. We set out a series of propositions, originating from institutional, organizational and managerial sources to explain the nature of movement between these distinct forms of values and the potential implications for organizational behaviour and performance. Finally, we consider the possibilities of this fine-grained analysis of the organizational values concept for future research.

Author-Name: Gerardo Patriotta
Abstract: Learning from errors is essential to ensuring organizational safety and improving levels of performance. We consider the interaction between cognition, emotions, and safety culture in the context of a field study on learning from errors in the Italian Air Force. We find that errors often stem from sequential action chains that are concealed in habitual behavior and that become visible only when unforeseen circumstances occur. Furthermore, cognitive appraisal of risky situations triggers emotions of variable intensity that, when rationalized retrospectively, promote the internalization of lessons learned. Finally, cognitive and emotional experiences of errors are grounded in the broader safety culture of an organization, which provides a supportive context for error reporting and encourages the sharing of information and knowledge about error experiences. The analysis further suggests that cognition, emotion, and safety culture interact through sensemaking processes that inform the construction of errors a...

Abstract: We analyse the relationships between identity work and internal legitimacy. Based on an in-depth case study of prisoners in Helsinki Prison, we focus on how their identity work affirmed and contested three kinds of institutional legitimacy – pragmatic, moral and cognitive. The research contribution we make is to show that some forms of identity work are also a form of internal legitimacy work, and how this identity talk constructs organizations as more (or less) legitimate. This is important because it demonstrates that identity work is an intrinsic (though often overlooked) aspect of processes of organizing.

Title: Boundary Objects, Zones of Indeterminacy, and the Formation of Irish and Jewish Transnational Socio-Financial Networks
Author-Name: Dan Lainer-Vos
Abstract: The concept of boundary object helps in understanding how members of different communities of practice can cooperate without sharing a consensus on their goals or even on precisely what they are doing. Sometimes, however, scholars treat boundary objects as a shorthand explanation for successful cooperation across boundaries. Instead of tracing the network of associations within which boundary objects are nestled, it is assumed that some properties inherent to particular objects secure cooperation. To offset this tendency, this article examines the Irish and Israeli governments’ attempts to raise funds in the United States through the sale of quasi-philanthropic bonds in the 1920s and 1950s, respectively. In the Israeli case, the bond served as a boundary object. In the Irish case, in contrast, a similar bond intensified disagreements between the Irish government and key Irish American organizations. The analysis highlights the importance of the entire socio-technical network within which boundary objects ...

Title: Performing Sales: Material Scripts and the Social Organization of Obligation
Author-Name: Asaf Darr
Author-Name: Trevor Pinch
Abstract: Can a dramaturgical analysis of sales encounters further our understanding of the social organization of selling and buying in contemporary markets? The main argument of this paper is that limiting economic action in markets to the formal and often stylized and abstract properties of the exchange, as economists suggest, misses the material and social organization of this endeavor. Employing ethnographic methods, we apply our dramaturgical approach to three research sites in three different countries. We show how an often overlooked fundamental ingredient of economic transactions, the situated constitution of social obligation, is achieved locally on the sales floor. Social obligation allows the sellers and the buyers to move from one stage of the sales encounter to the next, and enables the closing of deals. As part of the constitution of obligation, market actors appeal to scripts which are observable, recurrent activities and patterns of interaction characteristic of a particular setting. Scripts are pr...

Abstract: Advice-seeking is one of the most basic practices in making real-life decisions and has been shown to be a predominant mode of knowledge acquisition at the upper echelons level. Chief Executive Officers (CEOs) in particular seek advice to obtain formulated judgments, opinions, and suggestions about current strategic directions and recommended alternatives for future courses of action. In this study we distinguish between intra-organizational and extra-organizational sources of advice and examine how factors at the environmental, firm, and top management team (TMT) level relate to patterns of CEO advice-seeking. We develop and test hypotheses linking perceived environmental dynamism, relative competitive firm performance, and TMT heterogeneity to CEO advice-seeking from internal and external sources and uncover asymmetric patterns. We discuss implications for upper echelons theory and strategic decision-making research.

Title: Blind Dates and Arranged Marriages: Longitudinal Processes of Network Orchestration
Author-Name: Raymond L Paquin
Author-Name: Jennifer Howard-Grenville
Abstract: Using longitudinal qualitative and network data capturing five years of evolution of an interorganizational network, this paper explores network orchestration – the process of assembling and developing an interorganizational network. In particular, we analyze shifts in the network orchestrator’s actions and the network’s structure and composition. We find that an orchestrator builds the capacity to assemble a network over time through the accumulation of resources and specialized expertise. However, as the network develops, an orchestrator faces an evolving set of dilemmas arising from the need to demonstrate value for various members and audiences. To resolve these dilemmas, orchestrators may shift their actions, moving from initially encouraging serendipitous encounters between network members (“blind dates”) to increasingly selecting members and more closely influencing their interactions (“arranging marriages”). We discuss implications of our findings for a processual understanding of orchestrated net...

Title: How our Frames Direct Us: A Poker Experiment
Author-Name: Danny Miller
Author-Name: Cyrille Sardais
Abstract: We adapt Erving Goffman’s (1974) frame analysis to discover how frames shape individuals’ decisions in a poker-based experiment. The frames that surfaced in our subjects’ verbalizations suggest the ways in which they form very different impressions of “what is going on” in an identical situation. Our findings revealed that people’s frames drive the information they attend to in a situation, the interpretation they put on that information, and the way they synthesize the information to make a decision. The thematic frames that emerged differed dramatically across groups of individuals; they also were cohesive, multifaceted, and relatively few in number. As a result they were predictive: one could foretell a person’s behavior across multiple situations given the consistency in the frame adopted. In most cases, frames also revealed a significant mismatch with the requirements of the situation. Management scholars and practitioners would be wise to be more alert to frames which can do as much to derail effect...

Title: The Global Professional Service Firm: ‘One Firm’ Models versus (Italian) Distant Institutionalized Practices
Author-Name: Daniel Muzio
Author-Name: James Faulconbridge
Abstract: Through a historical case study of the internationalization of large English law firms into Italy, this paper uses Scott’s (2005) three pillars approach to look at how local institutions constrain and mediate the strategies and practices of global professional services firms. In doing so, it corrects the economic bias in the growing body of literature on the internationalization of PSFs by stressing how local regulations, norms and cultural frameworks affect the reproduction of home country practices, such as the one firm model pursued by large English law firms, in host-country jurisdictions. The paper also extends existing work on institutional duality (Kostova, 1999, Kostova & Roth, 2002) by developing a fine-grained, micro-level analysis which emphasizes the connections between institutions and practices. This is crucial, we contend, since the difficulties encountered by PSFs (and multinationals more generally) in their internationalization do not result from collisions between home- and host-country ...

Abstract: This paper contributes to the emerging literature on inhabited institutions. It argues that institutional entrepreneurship, as most social action, is not an individual-bounded endeavor, at the hands of isolated individuals, but a group-bounded one, at the hands of social individuals inhabiting groups which motivate, inspire, and enable their engagement. The inhabited group-bounded conceptualization offered helps to overcome voluntaristic biases and atemporalism plaguing much micro research on institutional entrepreneurship. The paper builds on a qualitative case study of the emergence of commercial microfinance in Bolivia.

Abstract: This paper contributes to the development of a practice-based understanding of ethics. Ethics is here conceived as a critical practice of questioning and problematizing moral orders and moral rules-in-use in which subjects (re)define their relations to self and others. Situating this conception of ethics in the context of practice theory, we draw upon ideas of responsible decision-making (Derrida) and truth-telling (Foucault) to examine Daniel Ellsberg’s leaking of the “Pentagon Papers” as illustrative of ethics as critical practice.

Based on the sixth Organization Studies summer workshop, this introductory paper suggests a diagnosis of such a decline as well as a research agenda. It lists some fundamental issues still to be explored such as publicness and governance. It also considers how social science-based organizational knowledge might be extended to various empirical objects and fields in public domains and set-ups such as inter-organizational arrangements, hybrid organizations, multi-stakeholder arenas, hybrid organizing, and transnationalization processes, that usually are covered by scholars – economists, historians, anthropologists, management academics, etc. – who are not using organizational theory lenses.

Title: What Organization Theorists and Public Policy Researchers Can Learn from One Another: Publicness Theory as a Case-in-Point
Author-Name: Barry Bozeman
Abstract: I argue that organization theory and public policy studies, two field that share many common origins, have had surprisingly little cross-fertilization and that this state of affairs is both injurious and correctable. This paper (1) considers the costs and the foregone opportunities resulting from this mutual intellectual disregard, (2) presents an illustrative case to show the possibility of cross-fertilizing public policy and organization studies, and (3) suggests some general strategies to promote cross-fertilization between these two apparently related fields of inquiry. I provide a detailed illustration of the cross-fertilization of public policy and organization studies by recounting the history of “dimensional publicness theory,” a theory lens that, uncommonly, has been employed by both organization theorists and public policy scholars. I conclude with suggestions for promoting cross-fertilization between public policy studies and organization theory.

Abstract: Quality judgements in terms of academic standards of excellence required by external stakeholders such as labour markets and steering hierarchies obviously exert strong pressure on universities. Do they generate an ‘iron cage’ effect, imposing a passive and uniform conformity on global standards? The paper examines the organization of higher education and research set-ups with a strong lens. What does academic quality actually mean when observed in the field? How do universities and their subunits – professional schools, colleges, etc. – actually achieve what they call quality? A methodological and analytical framework is tested. Three sociological concepts – diversity, recognition and local order – make it possible to build four ideal types applicable to comparative inquiry. Such a typology identifies the interdependencies existing between how they position themselves with respect to quality dimensions and internal organizational measures. The paper contributes to a broader organizational study agenda: h...

Title: Bringing International Organization In: Global Institutions as Adaptive Hybrids
Author-Name: Yves Schemeil
Abstract: How can an international organization be made adaptable? Having been designed to fulfil a specific mandate, international organizations should disappear from the world stage once .the initial conditions that led to their establishment no longer exist: their constituents (governments or activists) will not support them when their mandate becomes obsolete or their added value is reduced. Nonetheless, they survive external shocks, resource traps, and even the growing indifference of their founding fathers. The explanation lies in their successful resistance to constituents’ control; counter-intuitive adaptation to external change; unplanned expansion through mandate enlargement; and a snowballing albeit unintentional trend to build up networks. Overall, the relative success of international organizations can be measured as a global balance between performance and resilience, exploitation and exploration, autonomy and cooperation. To reach that balanced stage they must be altogether dualistic (coupling the te...

Abstract: Leadership in public policy making is challenging. There is tension in gaining commitment from competing stakeholder groups, in sustaining public engagement in technically complex areas and securing broad-based support. Our paper illuminates these challenges through a case study of health policy development in the UK. We go beyond individual roles and leader–follower exchange relationships to develop the concept of distributed leadership using a sociomaterial approach to reveal how and why leadership is distributed across sociomaterial practices which together (re)configure policy coalitions and context. In so doing we also show how legitimacy and trust are sociomaterially enacted and shape leadership in public policy.

Title: Forms of Intervention in Public Sector Organizations: Generic Traits in Public Sector Reforms
Author-Name: Eva Bejerot
Author-Name: Hans Hasselbladh
Abstract: The present paper argues that recent research on public sector reforms offers few contributions to the body of knowledge on this topic because it adds little to the conclusions drawn during the first generation of research in this area. Although these later studies have often been context-specific and have explored the details of the process of change in some depth, it is rather difficult to compare their results or to make reasoned judgements of the comprehensiveness and centrality of the analysed change. Although most public sector reforms that affect hospitals, schools or social services are initiated and designed by national governments, individual case studies of local administrations often fail to capture the generic traits of nationwide reforms. However, public sector change cannot be approached as if it comprises collections of nominally independent local events. The present paper argues for two new approaches to the study of public sector change: (i) the systematic categorization of the different...

Title: States of Abjection
Author-Name: Rosemary Rizq
Abstract: This paper draws on Kristeva’s (1982) notion of abjection to conceptualize the nature of organizational defences against anxiety. The abject is that aspect of the self which lies outside the symbolic order, evoking feelings of anxiety, disgust, repulsion and fear. These feelings index the attempt by the individual to distance the self from what is felt to be improper or unclean in order to establish subjectivity and identity. Located within UK public mental health services which have recently been subject to New Public Management restructuring, the paper explores how contemporary preoccupations with regulation, surveillance and governance in public mental health institutions may be characterized as a symbolic attempt to gain mastery over feelings unconsciously deemed to be abject reminders of the body. A short case example drawn from my work as psychotherapist and supervisor in a primary care mental health service is offered to illustrate how feelings of psychological distress come to be abjected within t...

Title: Social Movements, Civil Society and Corporations: Taking Stock and Looking Ahead

Author-Name: Klaus Weber
Abstract: The relationships between social movements and civil society on the one hand, and the corporate world on the other hand, are often shaped by conflict over the domination of economic, cultural and social life. How this conflict plays out, in current as well as in historical times and places, is the central question that unites the papers in this special issue. In this essay, we review the differences and points of contact between the study of social movements, civil society and corporations, and offer an agenda for future research at this intersection that also frames the papers in the special issue. We suggest that three research areas are becoming increasingly important: the blurring of the three empirical domains and corresponding opportunities for theoretical integration, the institutional and cultural embeddedness of strategic interaction processes between agents, and the consequences of contestation and collaboration. The papers in this special issue are introduced in how they speak to these questions.

Title: When Limited Liability was (Still) an Issue: Mobilization and Politics of Signification in 19th-Century England
Author-Name: Marie-Laure Djelic
Abstract: The corporation is a constitutive element of modern capitalism. In its contemporary form, the corporation comes with a striking legal feature: ownership is associated with limited liability. Today, we take for granted both the principle of limited liability and its association with the corporate form. Not so long ago, though, in the mid-19th century, the principle of limited liability was highly contentious, generating heated discussions and debates. This article explores the social movement dynamics that crystallized around the principle of limited liability in 19th-century England – intense framing strategies and politics of signification, collective articulation of resources and mobilization tactics as well as opportunistic use of dynamic opportunities. Interestingly, social movement dynamics did not imply in this case the structuration of a unitary social movement but involved instead a stunning ‘coalition of the unlikely’. Two strikingly different groups championed limited liability on distinct groun...

Title: Paradise Sold: Resource Partitioning and the Organic Movement in the US Farming Industry
Author-Name: Katarina Sikavica
Author-Name: Jo-Ellen Pozner
Abstract: Resource partitioning theory maintains that in markets in which anti-mass-production cultural sentiments make producer identity relevant, there should be no direct competition between generalists and specialists. Nevertheless, anecdotal evidence suggests that after initial partitioning, such competition, and hence de-partitioning, is in some cases possible. We refine received insights of resource partitioning theory regarding the stability of niche markets, particularly those driven by identity movements, by introducing the notion that partitioning is a dynamic and even reversible process. Previous research has offered an answer to the question of why identity movements create partitioning: because they increase the dimensionality of the resource space and engender sanctioning of visible violations of the specialists’ organizational form identity. In contrast, we offer an answer to the question of how and when markets may partition in a stable way: by generating sharply defined specialist form identities ...

Title: Movements as Political Conditions for Diffusion: Anti-Corporate Movements and the Spread of Cooperative Forms in American Capitalism
Author-Name: Marc Schneiberg
Abstract: Addressing the spread of cooperatives in the early 20th-century US economy, this study analyzes the role of anti-corporate movements in the diffusion of politically contested organizational innovations. It finds that institutional change can rest fundamentally on the combination of standard diffusion processes and collective mobilization in support of new practices. Specifically, it finds that the Grange, a leading anti-corporate social movement, was a political condition for the diffusion of cooperative alternatives to corporations in American capitalism. Cooperatives evoked fierce opposition by corporate forces, suppressing the diffusion of cooperative forms. When the Grange was weak or absent, cooperative organization in states or sectors had weak or no effects on cooperative organization in other states or sectors. But when the Grange was present and increased in strength, it amplified and even made possible the diffusion of cooperatives across states and industries. These findings shed new light on t...

Title: A Market Mediation Strategy: How Social Movements Seek to Change Firms’ Practices by Promoting New Principles of Product Valuation
Author-Name: Sophie Dubuisson-Quellier
Abstract: Social movement theory has recently paid a lot of attention to the diversity of strategies used by social movements to pressurize companies, and has spawned an abundant literature on the combined perspective of social movement studies and market organization studies. This paper adopts a rather different perspective, drawing on market theories from the economic sociology of evaluation to assess a specific strategy developed by a number of groups within the environmental social movement, which relies on the market’s capacity to mediate their claims. The literature has widely considered why some environmental social movement organizations (SMOs) choose to address consumers, even though it is not in their tradition to do so and even though their objective is not directly related to consumption issues. I seek to contribute to this debate by analysing the ‘how’ rather than the ‘why’, by highlighting a specific social movement strategy which is mediated by market mechanisms. The paper provides an in-depth analys...

Title: Organizing Spaces: Meeting Arenas as a Social Movement Infrastructure between Organization, Network, and Institution
Author-Name: Christoph Haug
Abstract: In recent years, social movement scholars have shown increasing interest in the internal lives of social movements, but this turn from “social movements as actors” to “social movements as spaces” has not yet led to a conceptual apparatus that addresses the key role of face-to-face meetings, especially in the inter-organizational domain of mesomobilization. Building on the concept of “partial organization”, the paper develops the concept of “meeting arena” as a hybrid of three forms of social order: organization, institution, and network. It is argued that the complex figuration of meeting arenas in a social movement or protest mobilization constitutes an infrastructure that synchronizes the dispersed activities of movement actors in time and space. This infrastructure is not an entirely emergent phenomenon but is also the result of conscious decisions by organizers. Heuristic, methodological, and theoretical implications of this novel perspective on social movements are discussed, highlighting especially ...

Title: Democracy’s New Discipline: Public Deliberation as Organizational Strategy
Author-Name: Caroline W. Lee
Author-Name: Zachary Romano
Abstract: Scholars of politics have studied deliberative events as political processes aimed at empowering citizens, a perspective that frames organizational subsidies of public deliberation as civil society sponsorship. Based on multi-method fieldwork, this article investigates deliberation as a strategic tool marketed by an emerging industry of professional consultants to contemporary organizations facing resistance to retrenchment, redevelopment, and reorganization. This field-level organizational perspective reveals that deliberative solutions are sold to public, private, and third-sector managers in terms of their potential to cultivate stakeholder empathy for decision-makers, downsize public expectations for administrative problem-solving, and produce behavioral alignment and positive attitudes toward austerity measures. The simultaneous framing of deliberation as civic renewal and as a preemptive strategy for reducing contention demonstrates how sponsors have leveraged the ambiguities enabled by the reconfig...

Title: The Role of Ideological Radicalism and Resource Homogeneity in Social Movement Organization Campaigns against Corporations
Author-Name: Michael Yaziji
Author-Name: Jonathan P. Doh
Abstract: There is growing interest in the interactions among different sectors of civil society and the distinct organizational forms—both formal and informal—that occupy and transcend them. At the same time, the complementary nature of social movement theory and institutionalism is increasingly recognized by scholars seeking to understand these interactions, particularly the relational exchanges between social movements and organizations, including business corporations. In this study, we seek to contribute to this emergent literature by proposing a more complete theoretical and practical understanding of how the radicalism of social movement organizations influences the nature of the resource providers upon which they depend and, as a consequence, their overall strategy and tactics. Specifically, we draw on a survey of social movement organizations to explore the notion that ideological radicalism leads to more homogenous resource providers for SMOs in their campaigns against corporations, and that this, in turn...

Title: Turning Point Mechanisms in a Dualistic Process Model of Institutional Emergence: The Case of the Diesel Particulate Filter in Germany
Author-Name: Stéphane Guérard

Author-Name: Robin Gustafsson
Abstract: Based on an in-depth case study investigating the emergence of a normative institution, namely the diesel particulate filter (DPF) as a de facto standard for diesel cars in Germany, this paper develops a dualistic process model of institutional emergence which reflects the fundamental oppositional character of institutional actors involved in a series of framing contests. The proposed model features distinct phases punctuated by turning point mechanisms that shape the process leading to institutional emergence. Three specific turning point mechanisms were identified: local objectification, movement legitimacy and critical actors taking action. This model provides a novel perspective on institutional emergence in that it explains shifts in contestation and the emergence of an institution as a temporal resolution reached through coercion rather than out of a consensus as several institutionalization models assume. The results also suggest that the industry under attack from a social movement tends to deploy...

Abstract: Traditional models of transnational advocacy networks (TANs) and stakeholder management do not capture the nuance and dynamics of (counter-)organizing processes around anti-corporate mobilization. Based on the case of a resistance movement against a planned bauxite mine on tribal land in India, we develop a process theory of interactions between local, national and international actors within transnational advocacy networks. These encounters are not always friendly and are often characterized by conflict between actors with disparate goals and interests. We highlight the importance of national advocacy networks (NANs) in anti-corporate social movements and describe the conflicts and disruptions that result from ignoring them. Our findings also point to the role of corporate counter-mobilization strategies in shaping resistance movements. Our narrative revolves around a particular focal actor in the anti-mining campaign: a young tribal man who emerged as a passionate spokesperson for the movement, but late...

Abstract: Under certain conditions, output related performance measurement and pay-for-performance produce negative outcomes. We argue that in public service, these negative effects are stronger than in the private sector. We combine Behavioural Economics and Management Control Theory to determine under which conditions this is the case. We suggest as alternatives to the dominant output related pay-for-performance systems selection and socialization, exploratory use of output performance measures, and awards.

Title: Writing Organization as Gendered Practice: Interrupting the Libidinal Economy

Abstract: While gender very much holds a place in organization studies, this is primarily in relation to being an object of study. Still largely silent and inexplicit is the gendered nature of what organization studies researchers themselves do when they research and write. Our overarching project in this essai is to render the gendered character of organization studies writing open for discussion, to disturb the taken-for-granted gender neutrality of the ways that organization studies is written, as well as to outline how it might be otherwise. The specific contribution we are led to is the setting out of the possibilities for, following Hélène Cixous, a bisexual writing of organization studies. We suggest that organization studies has been dominated by a participation in what Cixous calls a ‘masculine libidinal economy’. This is a system of exchange where science, mastery and rigour are not so much an effort in inquiry, but more a form of (rough) trade through which to appease the fear of castration; the fear of ...

Title: No Woman is Like a Man (in Academia): The Masculine Symbolic Order and the Unwanted Female Body
Author-Name: Marianna Fotaki
Abstract: Women continue to be under-represented in senior positions in universities and their relative absence from the top jobs in management and business schools remains a cause for concern. The aim of this study is to extend understanding of this situation by drawing on the feminist psychoanalytical post-structuralist theories of Luce Irigaray and Julia Kristeva. The theoretical frame proposed engages with debates over language, discourse and the body and allows development of a theory of the disembodied symbolic order explaining women’s continued marginalization and devaluation in academe. This is achieved through analysis of empirical findings of the experiences of women faculty in nine management and business schools in England. The study demonstrates how male norms and woman’s absence from symbolic representations disables their participation in equivalent terms in the institutions studied, and how women often both collude with and resist their own marginalization in academia.

Abstract: This paper builds on recent contributions to understanding conditions of institutional complexity by developing a theoretical framework to elaborate the interdependencies between actions, contexts and institutional logics. Our aim is to refine existing explanations of how actors inhabit complex institutional settings. Drawing on a critical realist ontology, we treat agency and structure as analytically distinct phenomena to advance our understanding of conditioned action. This is subject to relational analysis in order to explain the structural conditioning that shapes particular socio-historical contexts, the potential ‘action options’ contained within these contexts and the processes through which actors draw upon these. This reading of institutional reproduction and transformation allows us to reassess the ‘paradox of embedded agency’ by advancing understanding of the historically grounded and multilevel nature of structures and agency in institutional processes. Our approach offers conceptual refineme...

Abstract: This study sought to explain the puzzle of firm noncompliance under conditions of highly salient and coercive institutional pressures from stakeholders. Based on a qualitative study of the Canadian banking industry’s responses to institutional pressures from government, clients, and the media for higher-quality banking service to small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs), results revealed that oligopoly power could not account exclusively for firms’ dismissiveness of salient stakeholder expectations. We introduce the concept of industry identity to explain how market power interacted with industry identity to predict firms’ nonconformity to institutional pressures and their willingness to maintain identity–image misalignment. Our study contributes new insights into theories of institutional conformity, identity, and oligopoly behavior.

Title: Rogue Resistance: Sidestepping Isomorphic Pressures in a Patchy Institutional Field
Author-Name: Linda Quirke
Abstract: My research suggests that organizational fields are patchy and uneven. This patchiness allows organizations at the margins of fields to sidestep pressures for conformity. As a case study, this paper examines the private school field in Toronto, Canada. Data come from interviews and site visits at 60 Toronto private schools. My findings suggest that Toronto’s private school field is segmented, incorporating diverse private school forms, including elite, religious, and ‘rogue’ (non-elite, non-religious) schools. Within one subfield – small rogue private schools – a high degree of heterogeneity exists. These findings suggest a nuanced conception of institutional fields, with more attention to organizational agency, multiple field logics and diversity among organizational forms. This paper examines how organizations at the margins of fields are able to evade pressures for conformity, and how a heterogeneous organizational field can also be comprised of clusters of homogeneity.

Title: The Pervasive Power of PowerPoint: How a Genre of Professional Communication Permeates Organizational Communication
Author-Name: Dennis Schoeneborn
Abstract: This paper examines the pervasive role of Microsoft’s presentation software PowerPoint as a genre of professional and organizational communication. Frequently, PowerPoint is not only used for the primary function it was initially designed for, i.e., facilitating live presentations, but also for alternative purposes such as project documentation. Its application in a neighboring domain, however, poses a functional dilemma: does the PowerPoint genre preserve the features of its primary function, i.e., presentation, or rather adapt to the new function, i.e., documentation? By drawing on a communication-centered perspective, this paper examines PowerPoint’s role in the domain of project documentation as a clash between the constitutive affordances of professional and of organizational communication. To investigate this issue empirically, I conducted a case study at a multinational business consulting firm. The study allows identification of three distinct PowerPoint subgenres, which differ in how they adapt t...

Abstract: How can organizations spanning institutionalized categories mitigate against the possibility of reduced attention by audiences? While there has been a good deal of research on the illegitimacy discount of category spanning, scant attention has been paid to how organizations might strategically address this potential problem. In this paper, we explore how the strategic naming of products might enhance audience attention despite the liabilities associated with category spanning. Drawing on a sample of films released in the United States market between 1982 and 2007, we analyze different naming strategies and show that names that simply signal familiarity are not potent enough to offset the illegitimacy discount, while names imbued with known reputations serve as a symbolic device that enhances audience attention to genre-spanning films.

Abstract: Searching for knowledge to solve non-routine problems allows middle managers not only to design new solutions but also to develop organizational capabilities. We focus on knowledge search to develop our understanding of how individuals engage with organizational knowledge in practice, how they acquire and use knowledge, and the implications for organizational knowledge development. Investigating middle managers’ knowledge search practices in response to non-routine events, we uncover four practices: isolating; overcoming knowledge distribution challenges; socializing; and mastering solution development. From these, we identify two aspects of knowledge search: not only can it produce new solutions but it can also have different effects in terms of developing organizational capabilities, either modifying existing routines or creating new ones. We argue that organizations with a knowledge use advantage, namely, an ability to mobilize accessible knowledge by organizing for knowledge circulation and a socializ...

Title: Understanding Organizational Evolution: Toward a Research Agenda using Generalized Darwinism
Author-Name: Geoffrey M. Hodgson
Abstract: The terms ‘evolution’ and ‘coevolution’ are widely used in organization studies but rarely defined. Often it is unclear whether they refer to single entities or populations. When specific evolutionary processes are suggested, the labelling is often misleading. For example, in the debate over the roles of individual adaptation and competitive selection, the ‘selectionist’ position of Michael Hannan and John Freeman, which emphasizes the role of selection and stress the limits of individual firm adaptability, is often described as ‘Darwinian’ whereas opposing views that emphasize adaptability are described as ‘Lamarckian’. But these labels are not strictly dichotomous. Scholars have shown that core Darwinian principles, resulting from abstract ontological communality rather than analogy, apply to social evolution. This opens up a research agenda using the principles of generalized Darwinism and the replicator–interactor framework to help understand the evolution of organizations. Some illustrations of the c...

Title: On the Explanatory Power of Generalized Darwinism: Missing Items on the Research Agenda
Author-Name: Markus Scholz
Author-Name: Thomas A. C. Reydon
Abstract: In a recent article in this journal, Geoffrey Hodgson points out that the notion of ‘evolution’ is widely used in organization science without authors being sufficiently clear on what exactly they mean by this term. In his article, Hodgson cleans up the terminological and conceptual confusion on evolution in organization science and positions so-called ‘generalized Darwinism’ as the only well-elaborated evolutionary framework available in social science. We doubt, however, whether in its present form generalized Darwinism itself constitutes a viable approach. In this article we argue that Hodgson and collaborators so far have failed to show that generalized Darwinism is actually capable of serving as a basis for the construction of evolutionary explanations of social and organizational phenomena. We suggest a few items that should be put on generalized Darwinism’s research agenda in order to develop it towards a viable option.

Title: Clarifying Generalized Darwinism: A Reply to Scholz and Reydon
Author-Name: Geoffrey M. Hodgson
Abstract: Markus Scholz and Thomas A. C. Reydon discuss the approach known as generalized Darwinism and make a number of comments and criticisms. This reply demonstrates that a number of their statements are inaccurate and misleading. It is important to examine the accounts of generalized Darwinism carefully, including what its proponents say about its explanatory limitations. Scholz and Reydon raise an important question concerning the definition of populations or species, but overlook the additional persistence of this problem in biology. This definitional problem is important but it does not invalidate generalized Darwinism.

Title: Institutional Work as Logics Shift: The Case of Intel’s Transformation to Platform Leader
Author-Name: Annabelle Gawer
Author-Name: Nelson Phillips
Abstract: In this article, we explore some of the forms of institutional work that organizations perform as they participate externally in the processes that drive change in the institutional logic that characterizes their field, and as they respond internally to the shift as it occurs. More specifically, we present the results of an in-depth case study of Intel Corporation, a firm that was implicated in a fundamental shift in the institutional logic of its field in the late 1980s and 1990s as the field moved from a traditional supply chain logic dominated by computer assemblers to a new platform logic following very different organizing principles. Through the qualitative analysis of 72 interviews with Intel employees, complemented by extensive archival data from 1980 to 2000, we identify two forms of institutional work that Intel performed externally – external practice work and legitimacy work – and two forms of work that they carried out internally – internal practice work and identity work – as the organizatio...

Title: Negotiating as Institutional Work: The Case of Labour Standards and International Framework Agreements
Author-Name: Markus Helfen
Author-Name: Jörg Sydow
Abstract: Although institutional work has recently attracted considerable attention from organization research, there is a surprising neglect of inter-organizational negotiations as a form of institutional work. This neglect is astonishing, since negotiations provide a unique opportunity both to study institutional change in settings characterized by diverging institutional logics and to illustrate how institutional constraints and strategic agency are linked in interaction processes. Based on a combination of the literature on institutional work and the theory of strategic negotiations, we examine in detail three illuminating negotiation processes taking place around International Framework Agreements on global labour standards. This examination reveals three types of (proto-)institutional outcomes produced by these processes: institutional creation, modification and stagnation. Whereas institutional creation and modification, albeit differing in quality, show how integrative negotiation practices of global unions...

Title: From Novel Practice to Consecrated Exemplar: Unity Temple as a Case of Institutional Evangelizing
Author-Name: Candace Jones
Author-Name: Felipe G. Massa
Abstract: Institutional theorists focus on practices that spread because they conform with and build on established cultural assumptions and resources. Novel practices, however, not only fail to conform to, but also challenge the dominant institutional order. We seek to understand the process by which novel practices move from entrepreneurial anomaly to consecrated exemplar within a field. We contrast Unity Temple by Frank Lloyd Wright—a building that challenged the accepted practices of ecclesiastical design in the architectural profession—with the most prominent churches during the same period. We find two distinct legitimation processes—institutional evangelism where creators express their identity and generate novel practices versus adaptive emulation where adopters focus on prestigious others and emulate their established practices. We reveal that actors engaged in institutional evangelism and adaptive emulation, employing institutional work and leveraging ideas, materials and identities to effect, transform, ...

Title: Institutions and Maintenance: The Repair Work of Italian Professions
Author-Name: Evelyn R. Micelotta
Author-Name: Marvin Washington
Abstract: This paper contributes to extending institutional theory by theorizing institutional maintenance as a process of repair and empirically examining repair work in a professional setting. Our in-depth, longitudinal case study illustrates how Italian professions—led by two professional associations—rebuffed the decisive intervention of the Italian Government to coercively reform the professional service sector and reconstituted institutional arrangements that had been severely disrupted. The paper advances theory on the resilience of institutions by showing that maintenance repair work enables powerful incumbents to reverse change and re-establish the status quo.

Title: Bringing Technology and Meaning into Institutional Work: Making News at an Italian Business Newspaper
Author-Name: Elena Raviola
Author-Name: Maria Norbäck
Abstract: In this article we investigate the role of technology and meaning in the institutional work of newsmakers. By analysing ethnographic data from an Italian business newspaper undertaking a project integrating the print and online newsrooms, we show how technology makes certain actions possible – and even proposes action – for the journalists, in their enactment of the institution of business news. Drawing on Callon’s notion of agencement and Battilana and D’Aunno’s conceptualization of human agency in institutional work, our analysis shows that action is taken in the interaction between humans and non-humans, and changes in technology might trigger institutional work. The institutional work of journalists is performed by means of both old and new technologies; if new technologies trigger institutional work by proposing new actions that need to be made meaningful by the journalists, old technology functions as a ‘law book’, where the institution of business news is inscribed. The journalists then use this ‘l...

Title: The Institutional Work of Oppression and Resistance: Learning from the Holocaust
Author-Name: Ignasi Martí
Author-Name: Pablo Fernández
Abstract: In recent years there has been an outburst of studies aiming to advance our understanding of how actors do work to create, maintain and disrupt institutions. Drawing on work on the Holocaust, a largely neglected event in organization theory, we explore types of institutional work through which actors first maintain domination and grant acquiescence to oppression and, second, target oppressive systems through acts of resistance. This approach offers an opportunity to study a familiar set of processes and phenomena on fresh terms and to focus on key elements that existing studies on institutional work have neglected.

Author-Name: Pamela Sloan
Author-Name: David Oliver
Abstract: This paper explores trust-building in multi-stakeholder partnerships. Through an analysis of the development of one multi-stakeholder partnership between a multinational corporation, two levels of government, and local indigenous peoples, we found that trust-building is a dynamic process in which emotionality plays a key role. Critical emotional incidents can unexpectedly punctuate the partnership process, serving as turning points in the development of trust. We also found that the practices used by the partners to navigate these incidents transformed negative emotions into positive ones. We theorize on the role that critical emotional incidents and emotional engagement practices play in multi-stakeholder partnerships.

Title: Can Sociological Paradigms Still Inform Organizational Analysis? A Paradigm Model for Post-Paradigm Times
Author-Name: John Hassard
Author-Name: Julie Wolfram Cox
Abstract: The Burrell and Morgan model for classifying organization theory is revisited through meta-theoretical analysis of the major intellectual movement to emerge in recent decades, post-structuralism and more broadly postmodernism. Proposing a retrospective paradigm for this movement, we suggest that its research can be characterized as ontologically relativist, epistemologically relationist and methodologically reflexive; this also represents research that can be termed deconstructionist in its view of human nature. When this paradigm is explored further, in terms of Burrell and Morgan’s assumptions for the ‘nature of society’, two analytical domains emerge – normative post-structural and critical post-structural. Assessing the types of research developed within them, and focusing on actor-network theory in particular, we describe how post-structural and postmodern thinking can be classified within, rather than outside, or after, the Burrell and Morgan model. Consequently we demonstrate not only that organiza...

Title: Strangely Familiar: The Uncanny and Unsiting Organizational Analysis
Author-Name: Timon Beyes
Author-Name: Chris Steyaert
Abstract: This paper focuses on the aesthetics of the uncanny to inquire into and perform affective sites of organizing that are imbued with feelings of uncertainty and uneasiness. We argue that the uncanny forms an ‘unconcept’ that allows us to think and apprehend ‘white spaces’ of organization not as new or other spaces but through a process of relating intensively with the conventional places, streets and squares that form the backdrop to everyday life. We also make use of the notion of ‘unsiting’ to show how organizational research is able to enhance our appreciation of the aesthetic dimension of organization in ways that expose and undermine that which has become familiar and taken-for-granted. Based on an artistic intervention by the theatre collective Rimini Protokoll, we encounter and analyse such processes of unsiting through the affective and spatial doublings at work in the organization of urban space. Theorizing the organizational uncanny opens up new sites/sights in organization by forging an interconn...

Title: Problematizing Mobility: A Metaphor of Stickiness, Non-Places and the Kinetic Elite
Author-Name: Jana Costas
Abstract: A ‘mobilities turn’ has taken place in the social sciences, which is finding its way into organization studies. As research highlights how work and organization are mobile and spatially dispersed, metaphors of liquidity, flows, fluidity and nomads have become significant. This article seeks to contribute to the mobilities turn by introducing the Sartrean metaphor of stickiness. In contrast to the currently dominant movement metaphors, this metaphor brings into focus ambiguities and frictions and overcomes problematic connotations of nomadism and sedentarism. The paper draws on the metaphor of stickiness to reveal the kinetic elite’s – the group of highly mobile elite workers – experiences of ‘non-places’ (Augé, 1995), which are ephemeral, interchangeable and monotonous spaces of mobility. Qualitative data gathered at two management consultancy firms show how the stickiness of being on the move can give rise to experiences of ambiguity, disorientation and loss: the lures of glamour, escape and liberation f...

Title: Children: Their Place in Organization Studies
Author-Name: Donncha Kavanagh
Abstract: This paper argues that children and childhood constitute a ‘white space’ in organization studies, which should now be explored, mapped and analysed. Rather than being separate, children and organization are deeply implicated in one another, which provides a rich basis for theoretical inquiry. The paper draws on Spivak’s concept of the subaltern and on actor-network theory to articulate how and where organization studies might critically engage with, and find a place for, children and childhood. It frames such an inquiry around six potential research trajectories: epistemological, methodological, ontological, temporal, political and reflexive.

Title: Putting Power in its Place: The Centrality of Edgelands
Author-Name: Alison Hirst
Author-Name: Michael Humphreys
Abstract: Many organizations use spatial reconfiguration as an attempt to transform and modernize their work practices and external image. While most studies have focused on the way high status new offices are used to showcase putatively changed organizational practices, less attention has been paid to the peripheral sites which service them. Drawing on a longitudinal ethnographic study of an initiative to modernize a UK local authority via spatial redesign, we analyse the relationship between a new strategic centre office building and a paper storage unit situated in an ‘edgeland’. Edgelands are interfacial areas between town and country and are sites where essential but despised functions are located (Shoard, 1992). Based on an understanding of power as something that is created through relationships with nonhuman actors, we foreground the spatial and temporal agency of buildings, artefacts and places. We show how ‘modernization’ involves attempts to create a purified space constructed only from human and materia...

Title: The Psychic Life of White: Power and Space
Author-Name: Kathleen Connellan
Abstract: This paper casts a net across spaces that are designed to be bland and identity-less. It posits that white is more than just a colour in design and that it is appropriated by organizations to spread sameness across public spaces. In this way, the article draws upon Foucauldian theories of power and organizational aesthetics in an effort to show that people become caught up in an institutionalization of space. White spaces become infused with an energy that is also derived from plain surfaces and which then offers up an illusion of spatial order. The article uses examples of the church, the parliament building, the prison, the hospital and the university to discuss ways in which whiteness transcends the limits of temporal colour and enters the psyche as an agent of power in the control of spaces and subjects.

Title: Putting The Body Shop in its Place: A Studio-based Investigation into the New Sites and Sights of Organization as Experience
Author-Name: Ann Rippin
Abstract: Locating organizations is a difficult task, making it difficult to study them and difficult to represent that study. There is no single phenomenon of organization. We identify them through their buildings, brands, products, employees, customers, marketing materials, legal status and so on, but it is hard to identity a single unified entity. This research note argues that organization lies in our encounters with it, that is, our experience of organization which constitutes its existence. In order for scholars of organization to be able to say anything about these experiences we need a methodology designed to capture experience. The work of John Dewey is useful here with his insistence on art as experience. This note takes Dewey’s work on art and applies it to a particular case example – The Body Shop International – and demonstrates how organization studies can be enhanced through an arts or studio-based approach. Indeed, it argues, along with Dewey, that any civilized community of practice might be expect...

Title: Responding to Institutional Complexity: The Role of Identity
Author-Name: Farah Kodeih
Author-Name: Royston Greenwood
Abstract: How organizations cope with multiple and sometimes conflicting institutional demands is an increasingly familiar yet little understood question. This paper examines how four French business schools responded to demands that they internationalize their management education whilst retaining their traditional identities. We trace the role played by field-level actors in pushing and articulating competing logics and the importance of institutional and organizational identity in how organizations respond. By highlighting the role of identity aspirations we show that what matters is not how an organization sees itself—i.e., what it is—but how it wants to see itself—i.e., what it wishes to become. Finally, we unpack and explain why status differences across organizations affect the nature of the opportunities that are perceived and the scale and format of the responses that are implemented.

Title: Mediating the Paradoxes of Organizational Governance through Numbers
Author-Name: Valérie Michaud
Abstract: Despite abundant prescriptions regarding what boards should do, we know little about what they actually do, especially in the face of the paradoxical goals of both ensuring control (as expressed in agency theory) and fostering collaboration (as expressed in stewardship theory) simultaneously. Drawing from the study of a co-operative over a 10-year period (including ethnographic data collection spanning 3 years), this paper shows the role of numbers in mediating paradoxes of governance. We show that numbers from very different spheres support different models of governance, prompt their change, but also their coexistence. Paradoxical control–collaboration dynamics are embraced, fed by two number-supported micro-practices: personalizing/professionalizing issues and creating new calculable spaces. These practices enable board members to both “act at a distance” and control, while they are also “kept at a distance” from the general manager, who ensures the board’s collaboration.

Title: Bringing Back the Bank: Local Renewal and Agency through Community Banking
Author-Name: Leanne Cutcher
Abstract: This paper presents findings from an in-depth case study of a bank that has drawn on an anti-globalization discourse and the idea of the “local in opposition to the global” to create a niche for itself in the highly consolidated Australian retail banking market. The paper explores why, despite the contradiction inherent in its discourse, the bank has been able to garner the funds and volunteer effort of locals to establish and extend its branch network. In exploring what motivated the volunteers involved in the establishment of the local bank the paper shows how seemingly impersonal abstract processes of globalization are embedded in local places and worked out through localized practices of agency. These agentic practices were experienced as being connected, authentic, and in control. Yet as always the paradox of agency came into play and throughout the case study we see how these practices of agency are both enabled and constrained by “being local”. By highlighting processes of globalization at the loca...

Title: Archetypes of Inter-firm Relations in the Implementation of Management Innovation: A Set-theoretic Study in China’s Biopharmaceutical Industry
Author-Name: Johannes Meuer
Abstract: Innovation research increasingly focuses on understanding why and how firms implement new management practices, processes or structures. Emerging in the shadow of research on technological innovation, growing evidence points towards the inter-firm relation as an important locus of innovation. Yet although organizational theory suggests discrete alternative inter-firm coordination mechanisms, the literature on management innovation has thus far treated the inter-firm relation as one broad mode of organizing. This study takes a configurational perspective to identify archetypes of inter-firm relations leading to the implementation of management innovation. Using fuzzy set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA) to analyse 56 firm partnerships in China’s biopharmaceutical industry, the empirical evidence identifies four such discrete inter-firm archetypes: organic coalitions, bureaucratic foundations, coalitions of intense interdependency and reciprocal foundations. The results suggest that the type of inte...

Title: Emergent Identity Work and Institutional Change: The ‘Quiet’ Revolution of Japanese Middle-Class Housewives
Author-Name: Aegean Leung
Author-Name: Charlene Zietsma
Author-Name: Ana Maria Peredo
Abstract: How do relatively low-power, role-constrained actors break through their constraints in a highly institutionalized environment? Examining the experience of Japanese middle-class housewives involved in a social enterprise, we developed a model of emergent identity work which outlines how actors who enacted their role values in new domains triggered a process of learning and sensemaking which led to spiralling cycles of role boundary expansion. In this process, facilitated by an enabling collective, actors not only changed their own self-concept (internal identity work) but also, through external identity work, changed others’ conceptions of their institutionally prescribed roles.

Title: Seeking Assurances When Taking Action: Legal Systems, Social Trust, and Starting Businesses in Emerging Economies
Author-Name: Phillip H. Kim
Author-Name: Mingxiang Li
Abstract: This study examines how institutional conditions provide assurances founders seek when creating businesses. Classical theories predict legal institutions promote supportive conditions that foster business creation. We develop an alternative theory for why this relationship is not as straightforward in emerging economies. In these regions, people may be discouraged from taking entrepreneurial action because of the difficulties in accessing legal protections efficiently. We also introduce theory regarding the moderating role of generalized social trust because of its normative influences on business creation. We argue that generalized trust in strangers exerts positive moderating effects on the direct relationship between legal protections and entrepreneurship. The findings from our multilevel analysis of 30 emerging economies are consistent with our theory. Our work advances a new framework for how entrepreneurs cope with uncertain business conditions in emerging economies where informal, normative social ...

Author-Name: Karen Lee Ashcraft
Abstract: Contemporary organization is increasingly understood as contingent and improvisational - and immersed in complex and shadowy realities where customary assumptions about the space and time of organization no longer hold. This Special Issue invites organization studies into an ambivalent space of sites/sights in organization, the double-play of this modest conceptual proposal necessary in order to open up the complex folding of the epistemological and the ontological in organization today. In this introduction we seek to establish and position a distinctive approach to what we claim to be ‘white spaces’ in organization. We show that any adequate treatment of these white spaces compels a significant breaching of the disciplinary norms of organization studies. Our argument derives from a consideration of a range of recently emerging concepts and analyses in the study of organization, all of which are suggestive of crisis and of emerging (anti-)forms of organization. This edition of Organization Studies publis...

Title: Rethinking Hybridity in Postcolonial Contexts: What Changes and What Persists? The Tunisian case of Poulina’s managers
Author-Name: Hèla Yousfi
Abstract: Drawing on postcolonial studies of management, this article highlights the importance of adopting a contextualized approach to hybridization processes that, first, takes into account the importance of the historical and cultural contexts from which hybridity emerges and, second, helps to identify the elements that change as well as those that persist when western management practices are imported into developing countries. Using a discursive analysis, this article shows the ambivalent nature of the accounts given by managers (trained in western traditions) of the Tunisian company Poulina as they explain how they modernized their company through the implementation of a US management model. The managers’ ambivalence takes on two distinct forms. First, while they seem to have internalized the rhetoric of modernization in insisting on how they used the US management model to overcome the ‘dysfunctional’ family-based organizational system, they simultaneously express resistance by detaching themselves from the...

Title: Fashioning an Industry: Socio-cognitive Processes in the Construction of Worth of a New Industry
Author-Name: Mukti Khaire
Abstract: This study of the high-end fashion industry in India examines the process of construction of the worth of a new industry. Analyses of data from multiple sources revealed that framing by early entrepreneurs and the socio-cognitive processes that resulted from the transactions of field-constituents with the new industry constructed the worth of the industry. These socio-cognitive processes—curation and certification, commentary and critique, co-presentation, comparison and commensuration—enabled broader audiences to make sense of the industry and comprehend its worth. The findings form the basis of a general model of the social construction of worth through a process of distributed sanctification, contributing to the growing literature on social construction of value.

Title: From Typology to Taxonomy: A Configurational Analysis of National Business Systems and their Explanatory Power
Author-Name: Jasper J. Hotho
Abstract: The business systems approach holds considerable promise for improving our understanding of the relations between societal institutions and technological and economic outcomes. Nonetheless, there have been surprisingly few attempts to validate its proposed typology of business system types. In this paper, I take up this issue and conduct a large-scale empirical assessment of the national business systems typology. I use data on 30 OECD countries from 2000 and 2011 to assess the validity of the typology, and explore its value for comparative institutional analysis through a fuzzy-set analysis of innovation specialization patterns. The findings illustrate that while the national business systems typology needs to be extended, it remains relevant for describing variety in national institutional frameworks. In addition, the detail it adds may provide the nuance needed for exploring more complex relations between institutions and technological and economic outcomes.

Title: The Temporality of Power and the Power of Temporality: Imaginary Future Selves in Professional Service Firms
Author-Name: Jana Costas
Author-Name: Christopher Grey
Abstract: This paper extends existing understandings of power, resistance and subjectivity in professional service organizations by developing an analysis of how these relate to temporality. Drawing in particular on Hoy’s reading of the Foucauldian account of temporality, we conceive of disciplinary power regimes and resistance as inherently future-oriented, or, to use Ybema’s term, postalgic. In moving beyond the extant research focus on self-disciplined and/or counter-resistant professional selves, we draw attention to the imaginary future self as an employee response to disciplinary power. In contrast to the future orientation of disciplinary power, this response envisages the future as a discontinuous break with the present which we examine as a form of resistant postalgia. Building on in-depth qualitative data gathered at two professional service firms, we explain how imaginary future selves can shed new light on the interplay of power, resistance and subjectivity.

Title: It’s a Bittersweet Symphony, this Life: Fragile Academic Selves and Insecure Identities at Work
Author-Name: David Knights
Author-Name: Caroline A. Clarke
Abstract: This article demonstrates the importance of studying insecurity in relation to identities at work. Drawing upon empirical research with business school academics in the context of the proliferation of managerialist controls of audit, accountability, monitoring and performativity, we illustrate how insecurities in the form of fragile and insecure academic selves are variously manifested. Emerging from our data were three forms of insecurity—imposters, aspirants and those preoccupied with existential concerns, and we analyse these in the context of psychoanalytic, sociological and philosophical frameworks. In so doing, we make a three-fold contribution to the organization studies literature: first, we develop an understanding of identities whereby they are treated as a topic and not merely a resource for studying something else; second, we demonstrate how insecurity and identity are more nuanced and less monolithic concepts than has sometimes been deployed in the literature; and third, we theorize the conce...

Title: One of Us or One of My Friends: How Social Identity and Tie Strength Shape the Creative Generativity of Boundary-Spanning Ties
Author-Name: Gina Dokko
Author-Name: Aimée A. Kane
Author-Name: Marco Tortoriello
Abstract: Social ties to colleagues on other work teams can spur creative ideas and workplace innovation by exposing an individual to diverse knowledge. However, for external knowledge to be recombined into innovation, the knowledge must first be recognized as potentially valuable. Going beyond traditional structural explanations, we predict that the use of diverse knowledge to generate creative ideas and solutions will depend in part on employees’ psychological attachment to the organizational groups to which they belong, i.e., their social identity, and the strength of their social ties. We test our hypotheses in an R&D division of a global high-technology firm, finding that social identity influences the creative generativity of boundary-spanning ties. Specifically, stronger team identity renders interactions with colleagues on other work teams less generative of creative ideas, while identification with an overarching, superordinate group (e.g., a division) enhances creative generativity. We also hypothesize an...

Title: Political Contestation at the Top: Politics of Outsider Succession at U.S. Corporations
Author-Name: Jiwook Jung
Abstract: One important trend in recent leadership transitions in major U.S. corporations has been the prevalence of outsider succession, where an executive from outside the firm is appointed CEO. Building on and extending the insights from political theories of organizations, this paper explores how the historical shift from managerial to investor capitalism has reshaped firm-level power dynamics over executive succession, contributing to the rise of outsider succession. Three developments were particularly crucial—the growth of institutional ownership, the strengthening of internal monitoring by the board, and the rise of shareholder activism. Using data on the complete histories of CEO succession at 686 large U.S. corporations between 1981 and 2005, this article shows how these new developments have pluralized firm-level power struggles over executive succession and thus have further politicized the process. The importance of firm-level power dynamics in the process suggests that a shift in the dominant institut...

Title: Rethinking Global Leadership Development Programmes: The Interrelated Significance of Power, Context and Identity
Author-Name: Suzanne Gagnon
Author-Name: David Collinson
Abstract: Organization studies scholars have examined leadership development processes on only a handful of occasions. This paper argues that an organizational lens, rather than individualized and decontextualized research, can significantly advance this under-theorized field. A critical organizational framing, in particular, assists not only in problematizing the ‘leader’ identities produced within contemporary leadership development programmes (LDPs), but also in surfacing the ways in which power, context and identity can be inextricably linked within specific practices. The article contributes to critical leadership and organization studies in three main ways. First, it theorizes through a critical identity lens the regulatory practices that constitute an idealized leader self in two separate global LDPs, and which create tensions and paradoxes rarely examined in studies of LDPs and organizations more generally. Second, it examines participants’ considerable resistance to the prevailing models of global leader p...

Title: In the Loop: A Realist Approach to Structure and Agency in the Practice of Strategy
Author-Name: Andrea Herepath
Abstract: This paper introduces and illustrates a critical realist approach to the practice of strategy, combining Archer’s stratified ontology for structure, culture and agency with her work on reflexivity, to provide strategy-as-practice with an innovative theoretical lens. By maintaining the ontic differentiation between structure and agency this approach renders the conditions of action analytically separable from the action itself, thereby facilitating the examination of their interplay, one upon the other, at variance through time, in strategy formation and strategizing. It therefore offers the field a fruitful methodological means of exploring the increasingly complex empirical implications of some practice theoretical claims.

Title: Pathways to Power: Class, Hyper-Agency and the French Corporate Elite
Author-Name: Mairi Maclean

Author-Name: Gerhard Kling
Abstract: This paper explores pathways to power from the perspective of the French corporate elite. It compares those who enter the ‘field of power’ with those who fail to reach this final tier. Adopting an innovative econometric approach, we develop and test three hypotheses. These underline the pivotal role of external networks and the strategic advantage of hyper-agency in maintaining power; and indicate that social origin remains a powerful driver in determining success. Birthright and meritocracy emerge as two competing institutional logics which influence life chances. Higher-status agents benefit from mutual recognition which enhances their likelihood of co-option to the extra-corporate networks that facilitate hyper-agency. The objectification of class-based differences conceals their arbitrary nature while institutionalizing the principles informing stratification. We re-connect class analysis with organizational theory, arguing that social origin exerts an enduring influence on selection dynamics which in...

Title: Emergence of Market Orders: Audience Interaction and Vanguard Influence
Author-Name: Özgecan Koçak
Author-Name: Michael T. Hannan
Author-Name: Greta Hsu
Abstract: Research in the sociology of markets finds that shared meanings facilitate valuation and exchange by providing frameworks for perceiving and evaluating products and producers. Whereas studies of local sensemaking explain how meanings emerge in market interaction, and macro sociological accounts explain how meanings embodied in conventions, structures, and institutions are used in markets, understanding of the links between these two levels of analysis remains underdeveloped. In this paper, we propose a theory of how engagement and influence at the micro level gives rise to conventional labels and categories. Our theory proposes three processes through which audiences in markets come to share meanings: (i) through interaction among the audience; (ii) through influence of vanguard audience members on lay audiences; and (iii) through vanguard influence on authorities. We investigate some of the propositions on label use and category differentiation in 23 product categories on eBay.

Abstract: The aim of this article is to inform a shift from the idea that we need to have “better leaders” towards a better appreciation of emotions and power relations that make leadership possible and impossible in practice. The article makes two inter-connected contributions to knowledge. First, “violent innocence” is introduced as a construct that is helpful in understanding inter-personal and organizational processes of projection and denial connected to leadership. Second, the construct is used to comprehend a “structure of innocence” in organizations arising from symbolic violence and connected to destructive relations of power that are accepted as normal. Three illustrations of violent innocence are discussed and linked with contradictions that are integral to leadership in practice. These contradictions emerge from particular dynamics: that leadership is often undertaken in a hostile environment covered up with positivity; that it is informed by strategies that create relations of dependence and domination...

Abstract: Research on the dark side of organizations has usually focused on atrocities committed by organizations or specific persons within them. Less attention has been paid to how organizations can utilize atrocities they had no part in creating. In this article, the manner in which atrocities can be utilized, managed and narrated in corporate image-work is discussed through two empirical illustrations: The Body Shop’s campaign against trafficking, and a campaign by a social movement organization to curb violence towards women in Congo. The article argues that analyzing differences in how organizations choose and position external atrocities in their branding can benefit our understanding of both organizational image-work and the dark side of organization.

Title: Rogue Logics: Organization in the Grey Zone
Author-Name: Christopher Land
Author-Name: Scott Loren
Author-Name: Jörg Metelmann
Abstract: This paper explores the concept of the ‘rogue’ through an examination of how the figure appears in business ethics and as the rogue trader. Reading the rogue trader through institutional logics and Jacques Derrida’s book Rogues, we suggest that the rogue is not on the dark side of organization so much as in an indeterminate grey zone, where the boundary between acceptable behaviour and misconduct is unclear. We further argue that this boundary is necessarily unclear as it is in the nature of organization, at least within capitalist trading systems, to push the boundaries of what is possible and acceptable. The rogue thus helps produce the boundaries of ethically acceptable organizational behaviour in the very act of transgressing them. The location-bound specificity of the rogue, as well as the symbolic process of naming an individual or a state a rogue, finds a relevant correlate in the villain, as Derrida suggests. But what we call ‘rogue organization’ may be constitutive of organization per se. As such...

Title: Light in the Darkness? Managers in the Back Office of a Kafkaesque Bank
Author-Name: Darren McCabe
Abstract: The ‘dark side’ of organizations has been represented in the literature as dysfunctional or abnormal, while more critical scholars regard it a condition of the ‘normal’ way in which organizations operate within a capitalist system. Drawing on the work of Franz Kafka, this paper develops a critique of both approaches. It is argued that we can learn much from Kafka because his representations challenge a top-down view of power and, therefore, suggest that there is light in the darkness. These insights are applied to a case study of a United Kingdom bank, to explore how managers, who are often neglected in critical accounts, are constituted through power relations, and how in the process of enrolling and controlling others, they discipline themselves. In taking this approach, the paper makes four main contributions. First, it elucidates how the ‘dark side’ has become an integral feature of everyday life in a contemporary organization and, second, it indicates limitations to the power that managers are able t...

Title: Changing the Memory of Suffering: An Organizational Aesthetics of the Dark Side
Author-Name: Bent Meier Sørensen
Abstract: This paper addresses processes of subjection and abjection as expressed in organizational and collective memory. It complements recent developments in organizational memory studies by demonstrating how the dark side of organization has been subjected to what Susan Sontag calls a ‘collective instruction’ process that normalizes how this dark side is understood, or marginalized. The paper argues that history today is often represented as kitsch and offers a method of aesthetic ‘juxtaposition’ of visual artefacts that together with a detailed reading enables researchers to critically challenge this organization of memory and reintegrate abjected material. The method is exemplified by juxtaposing the iconic World War II photo of a little Jewish boy leaving his home with his hands in the air during the Nazi clearances of the Warsaw Ghetto and Paul Klee’s iconic painting of an angel in terror, Angelus Novus, painted in 1920 just after World War I. The analysis demonstrates how history tends to be organized by a...

Title: Theorizing and Researching the Dark Side of Organization
Author-Name: Stephen Linstead

Abstract: The paper offers an introduction to research that concerns itself with the ‘dark side’ of organization and attempts to bring theoretical resources from a range of disciplines to bear upon the problem. This stream of research has emerged most visibly since the 1990s, although its concerns can be found in much earlier research. Frustrations with the tendencies of mainstream work to overlook, ignore or suppress difficult ethical, political and ideological issues, which may well mean life or death to some people, has in recent years led to a research that self-identifies its concerns as being with the dark side. We structure our review around key contributions on the dark side of organizational behaviour, mainly in psychology but also including the concept of organizational misbehaviour; the sociology of the dark side, with particular reference to mistakes, misconduct and disaster; and a wider range of critical approaches to the dark side including Marxist, post-Marxist and postcolonial perspectives.

Abstract: This paper brings into focus the concept of organizational secrecy, defined as the ongoing formal and informal social processes of intentional concealment of information from actors by actors in organizations. It is argued that existing literature on the topic is fragmented and predominantly focused on informational rather than social aspects of secrecy. The paper distinguishes between formal and informal secrecy and theorizes the social processes of these in terms of identity and control. It is proposed that organizational secrecy be added to the analytical repertoire of organization studies.

Abstract: While cartels can be highly detrimental to society and create important economic and social costs for different stakeholders, the literature on organization studies has focused very little on cartels to date. In particular, we still do not know much about firms’ reasons for taking part in cartels. In this study, we build on the rational choice perspective in organizational misconduct to investigate the conditions supporting firms’ collusive behavior. We organize our theoretical arguments around the factors related to motivation and opportunity. Using a sample of cartels in the European Union, our empirical analysis gives evidence for our main arguments: the propensity to participate to a cartel is supported not only by the characteristics of the firm, but also by internal factors interacting with the attributes of the environment in which the firm is embedded. Implications for firms and policy makers are discussed.

Abstract: This Vita Contemplativa has been written in recognition of Max Boisot, who died in 2011. It reflects on his work and its contributions to organization studies and beyond. Boisot created a knowledge-based lens for studying complex organizational phenomena. He argued that the ways in which agents process information have fundamental implications for our understanding of groups and organizations within the emerging knowledge society. He articulated this argument with a set of elegant conceptual frameworks that have been widely used by scholars and practitioners to address the dynamics of information, knowledge and learning and the organization of social and scientific activity. We provide an overview of Boisot’s conceptual frameworks before reviewing the impact of his work in the organizational field, which included contemporary developments in China, the role of information in organizations, and more recently organizational complexity and the management of Big Science at CERN. Boisot’s analysis opens up a n...

Title: The Extensiveness of Corporate Social and Environmental Commitment across Firms over Time
Author-Name: Pratima Bansal
Author-Name: Jijun Gao
Author-Name: Israr Qureshi
Abstract: Corporate social commitment (CSC) and corporate environmental commitment (CEC) are often combined under the general rubric of corporate social responsibility. Although the two sets of activities are similar, they are also very different. Both CSC and CEC respond to issues raised by stakeholders, but CEC tends to be more “technical”. This characteristic demands that CEC fit with the organization, which exposes greater economic opportunities than CSC. As a result, we argue that the extent to which these practices are implemented differs across firms over time. We analyze the extensiveness of implementation of CSC and CEC across 266 firms from 1991 to 2003, using latent growth curve modeling and one-way ANOVA. We find that firms moved towards at least a moderate level of CSC over time, but tended to bifurcate in the extent to which they implemented CEC practices, towards either the high or low end of the scale, over time. In this paper, we contribute to the institutional analysis of practice diffusion by exa...

Title: From Intrapsychic Moral Awareness to the Role of Social Disruptions, Labeling, and Actions in the Emergence of Moral Issues
Author-Name: Bidhan Parmar
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to elaborate and extend a sensemaking view of how ethics issues emerge in and around organizations. Current research in ethical decision making relies predominantly on a definition of ethics that distinguishes moral decision-making processes from amoral or non-moral decision-making processes through the intrapsychic use of explicit moral concepts. I recognize the strengths and weaknesses of the current approach and propose a model which builds on previous empirical work to explain how morality emerges in organizations through social interaction. This sensemaking model illustrates the role of disruptions, labeling, and action in the emergence of moral issues, and recasts the emergence of ethical issues, not as the individual recognition of objective moral content, but as more or less reliable interrelating. The model developed in this paper contributes to theory about ethical decision making by: (1) moving beyond the categorization of construals as moral or amoral to examining ...

Title: Organizational Ingenuity in Nascent Innovations: Gaining Resources and Legitimacy through Unconventional Actions
Author-Name: Rangapriya (Priya) Kannan-Narasimhan
Abstract: How do innovators in large organizations acquire resources for their early-stage, untested, unproven innovations? Multiple established projects compete for scarce resources in large organizations. Innovators pursuing early-stage, untested innovations face considerable constraints in accessing scarce resources. Literature enumerates various sanctioned and unsanctioned methods by which innovators acquire resources, such as borrowing, begging, scavenging, amplifying, bootlegging, and finagling – defined as obtaining resources through deceitful or underhanded methods. However, few theories explain how innovators act unconventionally, elude constraints to acquire resources, and yet gain acceptance for their innovations. To address this question, this study uses field data from nine organizations based primarily in Silicon Valley. Successful innovators employ organizational ingenuity or creative solutions to gain resources in the face of constraints. They employ two types of ingenuity: material ingenuity, creat...

Title: Constraint-Shattering Practices and Creative Action in Organizations

Author-Name: Ragnhild Kvålshaugen
Abstract: This study contributes insights on how actors cope with constraints in ill-structured problem-solving situations, and what implications this coping has for creative action. To date, most research on constraint handling has treated constraints, regardless of their nature, origin, or role, as external factors that enable or hinder creativity. In contrast, we consider constraints to be inextricably intertwined with all creative action. We focus our study on one specific practice for constraint handling: namely, shattering. Empirical data were collected for 12 projects in two engineering consulting firms, and four shattering practices were identified: protesting, proposing, betraying, and sabotaging. We discuss their enactment in various parts of the problem space and their implications for the management of creative action in organizations.

Author-Name: A. Georges L. Romme
Abstract: Previous studies of the effects of resource slack and constraints on creativity and performance offer contradictory findings. To resolve this debate, some authors operationalize resource slack and constraints in ways that actually may have concealed their underlying complexity and dynamics. This study seeks to demonstrate how perceived resource positions influence entrepreneurial decision making and creativity by drawing on in-depth case studies of three high-tech start-ups. The authors show that resource positions are perceived, relative, transient and multidimensional; that is, they reflect the entrepreneur’s perception of available resources relative to demand. Moreover, perceived resource positions are not static but change over time, and entrepreneurs can experience different types of resource constraints and slack simultaneously. The influence of perceived resource positions on decision making in turn depends on individual, temporal and resource position dynamics. These findings link perceptions of ...

Abstract: We examine organizational ingenuity within the paradox of embedded agency where organizational stakeholders are constrained in their behaviors by institutions, yet also influence and change these institutions. In this study organizational ingenuity represents the agency component and institutional constraints the embedded component. We build theory about ingenuity from a four-year case study of the embryonic Ontario solar industry. There were two major institutional constraints, limited grid access and political uncertainty. These led to four ingenuity strategies that emerged at different times and levels of analysis that challenged, complied with, or escaped the constraints. We combine these findings to develop a process model of the emergence of ingenuity in this embryonic industry. Lastly, we find that extending legitimacy to an ingenuity strategy is necessary for its success.

Title: Creativity and Constraints: Exploring the Role of Constraints in the Creative Processes of Research and Development Teams
Author-Name: Brent D. Rosso
Abstract: Research on creativity in organizations has revealed a variety of important paradoxes that seem fundamental to the nature of creativity itself. One such paradox is the tension between freedom and constraint in the creative process. Where some theorists have described the ideal creative process as unstructured, open-ended, and free of external limitations, others have found that creative individuals and teams can benefit from constraints. The purpose of this study is to make sense of this tension in the literature by investigating the ways in which constraints both inhibit and enhance work team creativity. Based on inductive field research with four research and development teams in a multinational corporation known for innovation, this study addresses the research questions: (a) What are the key constraints experienced by R&D teams and what impact do these have on team creativity?, and (b) Under what conditions do constraints inhibit or enhance R&D team creativity? This research uncovered a variety of sal...

Title: The Varied Work of Challenger Movements: Identifying Challenger Roles in the US Environmental Movement
Author-Name: Stephanie Bertels

Abstract: Organizations within challenger movements often exhibit differences in what they do, with whom they interact, and how they understand or present themselves. This article attempts to understand what underlies such heterogeneity in challenger movements. Adopting a mixed method approach, we explore the heterogeneous nature of the work undertaken by institutional challengers in the US environmental movement. Drawing on the tools of social network analysis, we develop a method to identify a set of distinct social positions. Next, drawing upon qualitative data on identity and work from websites and interviews with senior managers in environmental non-governmental organizations, we identify configurations of social position, identity, and work that result in a distinct set of challenger roles. Our analysis reveals how identity and social position can both enable and constrain individual organizations within a challenger movement in terms of their ability to undertake different types of institutional work.

Title: The Ecological Fallacy in National Culture Research
Author-Name: Paul Brewer
Author-Name: Sunil Venaik
Abstract: This article challenges the understanding and use of the Hofstede and GLOBE national culture models in much extant culture-related theory development. Both the Hofstede and GLOBE culture dimensions are derived from individual-level survey data aggregated to, and analysed at, the national level. But their culture scales that are correlated at the national (ecological) level are not correlated in the same manner at the individual or organizational level. To presume they are is a form of ‘ecological fallacy’ that, despite warnings, has often been overlooked by culture researchers. We analyse five research articles in top journals in organizational behaviour, general management, international business, marketing and accounting and show how the articles commit an ecological fallacy by projecting national-level culture characteristics onto individuals or organizations. The implications of this ecological fallacy include the development of invalid culture-related theory and the persistence of erroneous practitio...

Abstract: In this introduction to the special issue we explore the main features of ‘organizational ingenuity’, defined as ‘the ability to create innovative solutions within structural constraints using limited resources and imaginative problem solving’. We begin by looking at the changing views of the importance of ingenuity for economic and social development. We next analyse the nature of ingenious solutions. This is followed by a discussion of structural, resource and temporal constraints that face problem solvers. We next turn our attention to creative problem solving under constraints. We contrast ‘induced’ and ‘autonomous’ problem solving. The first arises when external stakeholders or top managers impose tasks that define problems for the individuals and groups that must solve them; the second arises when these individuals and groups recognize and define the problems for themselves. We argue that in both induced and autonomous problem solving, individuals and groups that wish to act creatively confront two ...

Title: Registering ‘the Ethical’ in Organization Theory Formation: Towards the Disclosure of an ‘Invisible Force’
Author-Name: Mahmoud Ezzamel
Author-Name: Hugh Willmott
Abstract: Theory building is conditioned by three registers – the ontological (reality), the epistemological (knowledge) and the ethical (values). The significance of the first two is widely acknowledged. But the third register tends to be overlooked, especially where a positive/normative dichotomy is assumed. Post-positivist thinking problematizes this dichotomy but leaves the ethical register unthematized. The paper addresses this neglect and illustrates the role of the ethical register in processes of theory formation. Attentiveness to the ethical register is seen to invite radical reflection on a dominant, anthropocentric value-orientation, and thereby problematize the institutionalized estrangement of researchers from the ‘objects’ of their analysis and the abstraction of organizations from their embeddedness in the biosphere.

Title: Knowledge-Sharing, Control, Compliance and Symbolic Violence
Author-Name: Ken Kamoche

Abstract: Recent developments in control hold that professionals are best managed through normative and concertive as opposed to bureaucratic and coercive mechanisms. This post-structuralist approach appeals to the notion of congruent values and norms and acknowledges the role of individuals’ subjectivity in sustaining professional autonomy. Yet, there remains a risk of over-simplifying the manifestations of such control initiatives. By means of an in-depth case study, this article considers the challenge of implementing a knowledge-sharing portal for a community of R&D scientists through management control initiatives that relied on a blend of presumed ‘peer pressure’ and the rhetoric of ‘facilitation’. Arguing that traditional approaches such as normative/concertive control and soft bureaucracy only partially explain this phenomenon, we draw from Pierre Bourdieu’s concept of ‘symbolic violence’ to interpret a managerial initiative to appropriate knowledge and affirm the structure of social relations through the c...

Abstract: The conventional negative understanding of the scientific management movement has been challenged in recent decades by heterodox scholars who hold that the movement supported the democratization of the management process and in so doing worked closely with unions and with progressives within and around Roosevelt’s New Deal administration. This paper seeks to strengthen this challenge to orthodoxy by documenting how the leadership of the Taylor Society, a body established by Frederick Taylor’s inner circle as a vehicle to develop and promote their mentor’s ideas, strove to internationalize the diffusion of participatory management in tandem with the International Labour Organization, a body whose core purpose was and is to promote codetermination both in workplaces and in wider society.

The concept of organizational ghosts is not offered as yet another metaphor, a lens through which to analyse particular organizations. Rather, I offer my discussion of ghosts as a theoretical concept that explains how inheritances of the past haunt the relations and struggles of the present. I tell a ghostly tale of the everyday leadership and learning practices of UK local government chief executives, and provide an exploration of organizational ghosts as a contribution to the growing interest in the action in the shadows, atmospheres, margins and boundaries of organizations. Drawing upon an ethnographic study of UK local councils, and embracing the multiplicity and heterogeneity of organizational ghosts, the paper considers the theoretical, political and ethical stakes involved in taking ghosts seriously. Its contribution is to ...

Title: Managing Unstable Institutional Contradictions: The Work of Becoming
Author-Name: Toke Bjerregaard
Author-Name: Charlotte Jonasson
Abstract: An institution is often considered to be a stable, taken-for-granted ‘being’. The consequence is that agency is primarily associated with the rather exceptional creation or disruption of a relatively stable structure. In this article, we suggest an alternative ontology for understanding an institution as something unstable and always ‘becoming’. This opens a range of new and distinct opportunities for theorizing and researching institutional work involved in the everyday practice of managing institutional complexity. It allows us, in this study, to contribute with a new form of agency in terms of the continuous, active work of managing novel contradictions. Further, it induces us to take a more fine-grained look at the accompanying dynamics of work, in addition to work itself, whereby we provide a novel way of accounting for whether work effort is amplifying or subsiding, and whether it is likely to result in greater or lesser volatility within – on the surface – an otherwise seemingly stable institution....

Author-Name: Marcos Barros
Abstract: In this paper we explore how organizations are using new social technologies as tools in the discursive struggle over legitimacy. Using critical discourse analysis, we investigate one such struggle between the corporate blog published by Petrobras, Brazil’s state-owned oil company, and traditional local newspapers. In this particular battle, Petrobras used several discursive strategies to challenge the media’s legitimacy and build its own credibility. Furthermore, we suggest that Petrobras, to underline and to support these strategies, employed a meta-discursive strategy based on a discourse of e-democracy that gave it legitimacy as a discourse producer. In addition, this article contributes to the literature on organizational discourse by uncovering the new social media’s characteristic of hyper-intertextuality that was central in transforming the dynamics of power and resistance and the nature of discursive strategies. Our work analyses how organizations can actively and effectively engage these new too...

Title: Organizational Ethics and Foucault’s ‘Art of Living’: Lessons from Social Movement Organizations
Author-Name: Iain Munro
Abstract: This article develops Foucault’s later work on ethics and his concept of ethical askesis in the transformation of the self as a new approach to understanding organizational ethics. Scholars within the field of management and organization studies have already proposed the development of a Foucauldian approach to ethics, but the precise nature of such an ‘art of living’ has yet to be clarified. To address this gap in the literature this article builds on Foucault’s theoretical and practical interest in the work of historical and contemporary social movement organizations. The article investigates the role that social movement organizations play as crucibles for the creation of new forms of organizational subjectivity and novel ethical practices. In this way the article develops a synthesis between the Foucauldian scholarship and social movement organization theory. The contribution of the article shows how social movement organizations act as sites for the creation of novel organizational subjectivities and...

Title: Habitat and Habitus: Boxed-in versus Box-Breaking Research
Author-Name: Mats Alvesson
Author-Name: Jörgen Sandberg
Abstract: This paper argues that scholarly work is increasingly situated in narrowly circumscribed areas of study, which are encouraging specialization, incremental adding-to-the-literature contributions and a blinkered mindset. Researchers invest considerable time and energy in these specialized areas in order to maximize their productivity and career prospects. We refer to this way of doing research and structuring careers as boxed-in research. While such research is normally portrayed as a template for good scholarship, it gives rise to significant problems in management and organization studies, as it tends to generate a shortage of novel and influential ideas. We propose box-breaking research as a strategy for how researchers and institutions can move away from the prevalence of boxed-in research and, thus, be able to generate more imaginative and influential research results. We suggest three versions: box changing, box jumping and, more ambitiously, box transcendence.

Title: Knowledge Appropriation and Identity: Toward a Multi-Discourse Analysis
Author-Name: Ken Kamoche

Abstract: Knowledge appropriation has been underpinned by an assumption of the organization’s ‘entitlement’ to appropriate knowledge and the outcomes of its utilization. Given the complexity of knowledge and the potentially conflicting views held about it, this assumption is revealed to be theoretically imprecise in the way it marginalizes alternative voices through the pursuit of competitive advantage and ‘value capture’. We attribute this approach to the functionalist analytical lens which sees knowledge as an asset appropriable almost exclusively by the organization in the form of financial/economic ‘rents’. In order to advance understanding of the multi-faceted nature of the organization-individual appropriation regime, we make the case for an expansion of the discursive space for talking about the phenomenon, and posit the concept of ‘property in knowledge’ which we tie to the way individuals construct their identities.

Title: Performing Modularity: Competing Rules, Performative Struggles and the Effect of Organizational Theories on the Organization
Author-Name: Luciana D’Adderio
Author-Name: Neil Pollock
Abstract: We address the effect of organizational theories on the organization by focusing on how modularity, a widespread and influential organizational theory, performs a modular organization. While scholars have offered opposing arguments for the influence of this theory—i.e. that it either succeeds or fails to “produce” modular organizations—we show just how and how far modularity is enacted and shapes the organization, and how it may be shaped in turn. Drawing on recent advances in performativity theory we thus contribute to modularity by showing how the modular organization emerges over time as the outcome of performative struggles among competing and complementary theories and how these struggles contribute to modifying the theory and “designing” organizations. We also add to performativity by theorizing the competition between multiple theories, the emergence of unexpected consequences or “errors”, and their implications for organizational practices and boundaries.

Title: The Constitutive Role of Conventions in Accomplishing Coordination: Insights from a Complex Contract Award Project
Author-Name: Emmanouil Gkeredakis
Abstract: This article advances understanding of how coordination is accomplished in organizations. It builds on and extends recent research, which suggests that coordination is an emergent process of situated interaction aiming to realize a collective performance. In particular, the paper focuses on deliberate efforts to coordinate and contribute to objectives of large-scale integration in practice (e.g., orchestrated, year-long delivery of a megaproject). Such efforts give rise to a novel form of interdependencies, which organizational actors experience as “external” to local activities and group interactions. Drawing on recent developments in social theory, the paper proposes a framework to study coordinative action in situations where organizational actors are faced with a multitude of task-specific and “external” interdependencies. Further, through an in-depth study of a contract award project, it sheds light on the ways ongoing project coordination was adjusted to address interdependencies arising from the de...

Title: How are Practices Made to Vary? Managing Practice Adaptation in a Multinational Corporation
Author-Name: Shahzad (Shaz) Ansari
Author-Name: Juliane Reinecke
Author-Name: Amy Spaan
Abstract: Research has shown that management practices are adapted and ‘made to fit’ the specific context into which they are adopted. Less attention has been paid to how organizations anticipate and purposefully influence the adaptation process. How do organizations manage the tension between allowing local adaptation of a management practice and retaining control over the practice? By studying the adaptation of a specialized quality management practice – ACE (Achieving Competitive Excellence) – in a multinational corporation in the aerospace industry, we examine how the organization manages the adaptation process at the corporate and subsidiary levels. We identified three strategies through which an organization balances the tension between standardization and variation – preserving the ‘core’ practice while allowing local adaptation at the subsidiary level: creating and certifying progressive achievement levels; setting discretionary and mandatory adaptation parameters; and differentially adapting to context-spe...

Author-Name: Silvia Massini
Author-Name: Arie Y. Lewin
Abstract: Drawing on two in-depth case studies, this paper develops a conceptual model of how absorptive capacity routines and their underlying processes of evolution influence the efficiency of management innovation adaptation processes. The model highlights three important relations. First, although different configurations of absorptive capacity routines can lead to the successful implementation of the same management innovation – namely the reconfiguration of firms’ value chains through sourcing of business services from offshore countries – the sequence of developing routines, their adequacy, and the interdependencies fit between routines partly explain how rapidly and seamlessly a firm is able to implement a management innovation. Second, we identify managerial attention and organizational legitimacy as two critical and interrelated sources of variation of the efficiency in the process of adopting and adapting management innovations. Finally, attention direction by a top-level internal change agent is more ef...

Title: Footnotes to Research on Management Innovation
Author-Name: Fariborz Damanpour
Abstract: Management innovations, also called organizational, administrative, and managerial innovations, are nontechnological innovations that have been conceptualized in contrast to technology-based product and process innovations and pertain to new organizational structures, administrative systems, and management practices. This paper provides a perspective on the state of research on this innovation type. It asks why research on management innovation lags that of technological innovation and compiles five footnotes, each addressing an important aspect of studying innovation in organizations, and, together, they explain conceptual ambiguity and methodological challenges that have hindered research on management innovation. The footnotes also highlight the opportunities that research on management innovation could provide for a better understanding of the influence of innovation on organizational conduct and outcome.

Title: The Role of External Involvement in the Creation of Management Innovations
Author-Name: Michael J. Mol
Author-Name: Julian Birkinshaw
Abstract: There has recently been renewed scholarly interest in management innovating, the creation of new organizational practices, structures, processes and techniques. We suggest that external involvement in the process of management innovating can transpire in three different ways: direct input from external change agents; prior external experience of internal change agents; and the use of external knowledge sources by internal change agents. We ask whether the type of innovation created (radical or not; systemic or not) depends on the use of these three forms of involvement and whether the forms are substitutes or complements. We empirically investigate this through an archival study of 23 major historical innovations, using in-depth data from a large number of sources in the academic literature. We use three complementary methods of analysis: unstructured qualitative observations, correlational analysis and crisp-set qualitative comparative analysis. We find that the presence of external change agents is asso...

Title: Framing the Change: Switching and Blending Frames and their Role in Instigating Institutional Change
Author-Name: Mirjam D. Werner
Author-Name: Joep P. Cornelissen
Abstract: Taken-for-granted cognitive schemas form a core aspect of institutions. Whilst much is known about their effects, past research has not yet detailed and formalized how individual actors are able to initiate changes to such institutionalized schemas, reframe their circumstances and how, in turn, such a provisional reframing may itself evolve into a taken-for-granted schema. In this article, we argue that changes to existing institutions come about when actors engage in discursive processes of frame shifting or frame blending by which they articulate alternative or combined schematizations and succeed in building up common ground around the novel cognitive template. We elaborate a set of propositional arguments for when and how actors are more likely to initiate and realize institutional change by either discursively marking the contrast with prior cognitive schemas or by scaling these up into a broader understanding.

Title: Postfeminism, Femininities and Organization Studies: Exploring a New Agenda
Author-Name: Patricia Lewis
Abstract: The purpose of this article is to mobilize postfeminism as a critical concept for exploring women’s contemporary organizational experience. Specifically, it is argued that rather than interpreting women’s position in organizations solely in terms of exclusion connected to a dominant masculine norm, critically deploying the concept of postfeminism facilitates a critique of how women and a reconfigured femininity are now being included in the contemporary workplace. As the focus of the paper is the connection between postfeminism as a cultural phenomenon and the emergence of feminine organizational subjectivities, the construction of feminine subjectivities in the entrepreneurial arena (referred to as entrepreneurial femininities) is presented through a reading of the gender and entrepreneurship literature. Four entrepreneurial femininities are depicted—individualized, maternal, relational, excessive—with one key characteristic being the way in which they are all constituted through the doing of both mascul...

Title: Enlarging the Strategy-as-Practice Research Agenda: Towards Taller and Flatter Ontologies
Author-Name: David Seidl
Author-Name: Richard Whittington
Abstract: Taking perspectives from papers published previously in Organization Studies, we argue for progress in strategy-as-practice research through more effective linking of ‘local’ strategizing activity with ‘larger’ social phenomena. We introduce a range of theoretical approaches capable of incorporating larger-scale phenomena and countering what we term ‘micro-isolationism’, the tendency to explain local activities in their own terms. Organizing the theories according to how far they lean towards either tall or flat ontologies, we outline their respective strengths and weaknesses. Against this background, we develop three broad guidelines that can help protect against empirical micro-isolationism and thereby extend the scope of strategy-as-practice research.

Title: Back in the USSR: Introducing Recursive Contingency Into Institutional Theory
Author-Name: Xavier Deroy
Author-Name: Stewart Clegg
Abstract: Institutional theory’s understanding of unplanned change in fragmented and complex environments has made the connection between institutional work at the micro level and institutional logics at the macro level a central issue. Change that is not planned is contingent on events. In practice an event, as a single occurrence of an unexpected, unanticipated or unacknowledged process, connects these levels, as the event is selected for attention, enacted in meaning, and organizationally coded. Not all events are selected, enacted and coded, of course. The recognition, attributes and potential of events depend on selections made from and meaning given to past events and those conceived as coming into being in the future perfect. The concept of recursive contingency describes how unique occurrences become connected in an evolving process over time; in doing so, it stresses the important role of the unexpected in regard to institutional change. Using a theoretical framework derived from Luhmann’s work, in which i...

Abstract: Markets have sometimes been described as vastly different from and even opposite to formal organizations. But markets and organizations share a similarity as well. Both are organized – by the use of decisions on membership, rules, monitoring, sanctions or hierarchy. Market organization creates differences among markets, and specific dynamics, which can be explained by the actions and interactions of market organizers: profiteers, ‘others’, sellers and buyers. The concept of market organization is an analytical tool, which can be used for analysing why and how markets are created, why they get their specific form and how they change.

Title: Institutional Dynamics in International Organizations: Lessons from the Recruitment Procedures of the European External Action Service
Author-Name: Zuzana Murdoch
Author-Name: Benny Geys
Abstract: This article examines how organizational designs develop by proposing a novel theoretical framework that views organizational change as resulting from a dialectic process between interpretive agents. The key claim is that existing formal procedures (such as recruitment processes, our empirical focal point) are subject to involved actors’ interpretive efforts. This results in a bargaining situation based on the interpretations of the principal actors, which may induce a feedback loop whereby the original procedures are amended. The empirical relevance of the theoretical argument is illustrated via a case study of the hiring procedures in the European External Action Service.

Abstract: In this paper we combine work on rhetorical strategies with that of organizational identity theory. We highlight the relationship between organizational identity and the deployment of discursive resources at the societal level by organizations seeking to influence such identities. We analyse the way in which an extreme right political organization, the Vlaams Belang, has used rhetorical framing and strategies to construct a collective identity. This framing is aimed at persuading potential supporters of the organization to identify themselves with it. We argue that these frames derive their characteristic form and power from broader social and political processes that are given insufficient attention in published work on identity in organizations. We discuss the implications of our study for organizational theory, particularly the political and ethical questions raised by the use of potentially manipulative strategies. We conclude with a discussion of the ethical problems that arise when an organization’s...

Title: Foucault beyond Fairclough: From Transcendental to Immanent Critique in Organization Studies
Author-Name: Rowland Curtis
Abstract: This article presents the case that while Foucault’s ideas have been the subject of much debate, the distinctive transformative potentials of his immanent thought have tended to have been overlooked in the field to date. In making this case, critical realism provides an important counter-example, as a transcendental orientation to critical practice with significant influence in contemporary organization studies. In drawing out the difference between these contrasting orientations to critique, Norman Fairclough’s critical discourse analytic (CDA) framework is evaluated here as an approach to organization studies that took early inspiration from Foucault’s work, while having looked towards critical realist ideas in recent years. Fairclough’s writings on discourse and university ‘marketization’ provide a useful empirical focus to explore the distinctive styles of problem-posing that follow from these different critical orientations; contrasting the distanced normativity of critical realist-informed transcend...

Title: ‘He probably thought we were students’: Age norms and the exercise of visual judgement in service work
Author-Name: Nick Llewellyn
Abstract: This paper analyses how organisational actors draw upon, perhaps without conscious acknowledgement, assumptions about age as they engage in organisational activities. Drawing on video-recordings of naturalistic interaction, the paper analyses how customers are positioned with respect to age-based norms, often following visual assessments of their physical appearance. Through detailed rhetorical and sequential analysis, the paper describes artful practices, through which participants make age-based norms relevant for the composition of ordinary organisational actions. The paper is amongst the first micro-sociological studies to analyse how people engage age-based norms in this way. It shows the positioning of age identities to be substantially an interactional phenomenon, as well as a discursive and reflexive one.

Title: Cultivating Follower Trust: Are All Leader Behaviors Equally Influential?
Author-Name: Morela Hernandez

Author-Name: Sim B. Sitkin
Abstract: We draw on the relevant extant literatures to examine the pathways to building trust through leader behaviors with three distinct emphases: the leader (personal leadership), the leader-follower relationship (relational leadership), and the situation (contextual leadership). We test this model using experimental data collected from experienced managers (Study 1) and field data collected from the peers and direct reports of business executives (Study 2). The results from these two studies both build on and challenge current views in the trust and leadership literatures about how leaders influence trust. Consistent with past literature, our findings indicate that various leadership behaviors appear to directly promote follower trust when analyzed independently. However, when these behaviors are analyzed jointly, relational leadership behaviors were found to mediate the effects of personal and contextual leadership behaviors on follower trust. The implications for theory and practice are discussed.

Title: Group Cultures and the Everyday Life of Organizations: Interaction Orders and Meso-Analysis
Author-Name: Gary Alan Fine
Author-Name: Tim Hallett
Abstract: Drawing on sociological conceptions of interaction, small groups, and group cultures, we argue that organizational studies benefits from a meso-analysis of everyday life. Small group cultures are a means through which colleagues and co-workers share embedded and powerful self-referential meanings that shape ongoing organizational activity. Through this perspective we argue for a group-level approach to organizations that emphasizes the local production of knowledge and structure. Drawing upon ethnographic research on field offices of the US National Weather Service, we emphasize the importance of shared awareness and memory, performance, and differentiation, building on a vibrant group culture in which workers collaborate and challenge each other. In conclusion we examine connections and differences among the group culture approach, and related approaches that emphasize inhabited institutions, institutional logics, institutional work, and organizational culture.

Author-Name: Jerzy Kociatkiewicz
Author-Name: Monika Kostera
Abstract: Labyrinths and mazes have constituted significant spaces for tales of transformation, from prehistoric designs through the myth of the Minotaur and the pilgrimage design in Chartres cathedral to contemporary novels and pictorial representations. Labyrinths and labyrinthine designs can also commonly be found in present-day organizations. This text, based on an ethnographic study as well as on an analysis of academic discourse, explores their significance as symbol and as physical structure. Drawing upon the notion of transitional space, it presents labyrinths as an indelible part of human experience, an archetype, and a sensemaking tool for understanding and explaining organizational complexity. The unavoidable presence of labyrinthine structures is presented as a counterpoise to the reductionist tendency towards simplification, streamlining and staying on-message, allowing or demanding space for reflection, doubt and uncertainty.

Abstract: Despite the mounting evidence that innovation in management can fuel competitive advantage, we still know relatively little about how firms introduce new ways of managing. The goal of this introductory essay—and the Themed Section it introduces—is to advance this knowledge. To this end, we first synthesize the main developments in the field of management innovation and show that the field has branched into four main theoretical perspectives (rational, institutional, international business, and theory development perspectives). We then address the fragmentation issue that emerges from our review by proposing a co-evolutionary framework of management innovation that takes into account the dynamic and multilevel nature of the concept; we thus integrate the generation, diffusion, adoption, and adaptation phases of the management innovation process at the organizational, inter-organizational and macro level. Our integrative framework also addresses the role of human agency (managerial intentionality of interna...

Abstract: This article explores the role of calculative technologies, such as taxation, accounting and actuarial practices, in constructing ‘age’ in contemporary society. It argues that retirement income programs built on these technologies attempt to construct specific relations not just between the individual and other generations, but between the individual and herself at other stages of life. Retracing the series of Canadian attempts to secure income for the elderly over the course of the 20th century, the paper shows how calculative technologies have been used to connect responsibility for the elderly to the political rationalities of the day. This genealogy allows us to recognize how the present Canadian retirement income system, with its public and private programs addressing different subsets of the population, is contingent on neoliberal rationalities of governance. These demand the alignment of the individual with the goals of the capital markets, and seek to achieve this through a distributed agency that...

Title: Un/doing Chrononormativity: Negotiating Ageing, Gender and Sexuality in Organizational Life
Author-Name: Kathleen Riach
Author-Name: Nicholas Rumens
Author-Name: Melissa Tyler
Abstract: This paper is based on a series of ‘anti-narrative’ interviews designed to explore the ways in which lived experiences of age, gender and sexuality are negotiated and narrated within organizations in later life. It draws on Judith Butler’s performative ontology of gender, particularly her account of the ways in which the desire for recognition is shaped by heteronormativity, considering its implications for how we study ageing and organizations. In doing so, the paper develops a critique of the impact of heteronormative life course expectations on the negotiation of viable subjectivity within organizational settings. Focusing on the ways in which ‘chrononormativity’ shapes the lived experiences of ageing within organizations, at the same time as constituting an organizing process in itself, the paper draws on Butler’s concept of ‘un/doing’ in its analysis of the simultaneously affirming and negating organizational experiences of older self-identifying LGBT people. The paper concludes by emphasizing the th...

Title: Baby Boomers and the Lost Generation: On the Discursive Construction of Generations at Work
Author-Name: Katrina Pritchard
Author-Name: Rebecca Whiting
Abstract: Generations, and generational categories, offer a means of organizing our understandings of age and age-related issues. Particularly within practitioner-orientated debates, differences between generations are highlighted as creating tensions which organizations must address. In contrast, we offer a critical interrogation of generations and unpack the implications of particular constructions. Specifically we examine the discursive construction of generational issues in United Kingdom online news about age at work, focusing on baby boomers and the lost generation. We highlight the discursive work involved in constructing each generation as entitled to work and how responsibility for employment issues is variously positioned. These interrelated concerns develop into a debate about consequences, as different versions of the future are constructed. In contrast to essentialized understandings, our study shows how generations and generational categories are constructed and organize understandings of age at work....

Title: Gendered Ageism and Organizational Routines at Work: The Case of Day-Parting in Television Broadcasting
Author-Name: Simona Spedale
Author-Name: Christine Coupland
Author-Name: Sue Tempest
Abstract: This article contributes to the study of gendered ageism in the workplace by investigating how the routine of day-parting in broadcasting participates in the social construction of an ideology of ‘youthfulness’ that contributes to inequality. Critical discourse analysis is applied to the final judgment of an Employment Tribunal court case where the British public service broadcaster, the BBC, faced accusations of discrimination on the basis of both age and gender. Three interrelated findings are highlighted. First, the ideology of youthfulness was constituted through discursive strategies of nomination and predication that relied on an inherently ageist and sexist lexical register of ‘brand refreshment and rejuvenation’. Second, the ideology of youthfulness was reproduced through a pervasive discursive strategy of combined de-agentialization, abstraction and generalization that maintained power inequality in the workplace by obscuring the agency of the more powerful organizational actors while further mar...

Title: Negotiating the Self Between Past and Present: Narratives of Older Women Moving Towards Self-Employment
Author-Name: Frances Tomlinson
Author-Name: Fiona Colgan
Abstract: Older people are encouraged into self-employment as a means to extend their working lives; however, both age and gender are thought to constrain the capacity of individuals to take on an enterprising identity. This paper explores the narrative identity work of women over 50 contemplating a move into self-employment. It reveals how they negotiated a provisional self-employed identity in relation to an aged identity, an enterprising identity and an identity as organizational outsider. It discusses the implications of contrasting forms of engagement with these identities for the subsequent enactment of participants’ business plans. The paper briefly considers the implications of its findings for the following areas: enacting and realizing provisional identities; the relationship of self-employment to enterprise; and a process-based conceptualization of age.

Title: Colonizing the Aged Body and the Organization of Later Life
Author-Name: Paula Hyde

Author-Name: John Hassard
Author-Name: Anne Killett
Abstract: Based on fieldwork in residential homes, arrangements for the care of older people are examined with reference, primarily, to Deetz’s theory of ‘corporate colonization’. Extending this theory, it is argued that grouping such people in care homes can result in a form of social segregation, one that reflects the management of the aged body in relation to normative constructions of dependence. Focusing on the experiences of residents, the everyday effects of narratives of decline on disciplining the lives of older people are assessed, with this analysis taking recourse to the work of Foucault (1979). The result is the identification of three related concepts at work in the colonizing process of the aged body: (i) appropriation of the body – the physical and social practices involved in placing older people in care homes; (ii) separation from previous identities – how a range of new subjectivities are produced in the process of becoming a ‘resident’; and (iii) contesting colonized identities – the ways in whi...

Abstract: Brand scholarship traditionally resides within the marketing literature and focuses on organizations’ external relationships with customers. However, increasing critical attention in organization studies has focused on the brand in order to understand its impact on the internal dynamics of employment relations in contemporary organizations. Drawing on an ethnography of frontline service work in an IT consultancy call centre, we explore the brand as an internal organizational resource sustaining the process of employee meaning-making activities. Documenting the ‘work of the brand’, we outline what the brand offers both employees and employers and, in doing so, we theorize the brand at work as a connecting mechanism between processes of identity formation/re-formation and regulation. While employees are encouraged to internalize particular brand meanings (in this case prestige, success and quality), we found that they often willingly buy into these intended brand meanings as a palliative to ‘cope’ with mund...

Title: What’s Age Got to Do With It? On the Critical Analysis of Age and Organizations
Author-Name: Robyn Thomas
Author-Name: Cynthia Hardy

Author-Name: Susan Ainsworth
Abstract: Age, as an embodied identity and as an organizing principle, has received scant attention in organization studies. There is a lack of critical appreciation of how age plays out in organizational settings, the material and discursive dynamics of age practices, how age discourses impact on the body, and how age and ageing intersect with other identity categories. This is curious since age works as a master signifier in contemporary society and is something that affects us all. In this introductory essay, we show how the papers in this special issue redress this lacuna by enhancing and challenging what we know about age and organizations. We also set out an agenda for stimulating research conversations to bring an age-sensitive lens to organizational analysis. We structure our analysis around two focal points: age as an embodied identity, and the symbolic meanings of age within organizing practices. In doing so, we aim to provide a catalyst not only for research on age in organizations but also about the age...

Title: Performing the Responsive and Committed Employee through the Sociomaterial Mangle of Connection
Author-Name: Gillian Symon
Author-Name: Katrina Pritchard
Abstract: In the light of increasingly mobile and flexible work, maintaining connections to work is presented as vital. Various studies have sought to understand how these connections are experienced and managed, particularly through the use of smartphones. We take a new perspective on this practice by bringing together the conceptual fields of sociomateriality and identity work. Through the analysis of narratives produced by smartphone users in an engineering firm we argue that connection can be viewed as a sociomaterial assemblage that performs particular identities: being contactable and responsive; being involved and committed; and being in-demand and authoritative. Through this analysis we both elaborate the concept of connectivity at work and indicate how the material is implicated in identity performances.

Title: The Impact of Emotionally Important Social Identities on the Construction of a Managerial Leader Identity: A Challenge for Nurses in the English National Health Service
Author-Name: Charlotte Croft

Author-Name: Andy Lockett
Abstract: The ability of individuals to accommodate the emotional transition into roles requiring the construction of a leader identity is an under-researched phenomenon. To address this research gap we consider the experience of 32 nurse managers undergoing a leadership development programme, exploring how an emotional attachment to their professional group identity may cause identity conflict during the construction of a managerial leader identity. We consider how competing desired identities can result in negative emotional experiences, calling into question existing work, which assumes that desired group identities are congruent with leader identities. Our work suggests that identity work can mitigate identity conflict at the individual level, enabling nurse managers to function in their role, but emotional distress will continue due to a perceived loss of professional identity and group influence. We contend it is only by eschewing an emotional attachment to a professional group identity that nurse managers wi...

Title: Collective Action Without Organization: The Material Constitution of Bike Commuters as Collective
Author-Name: Elizabeth D. Wilhoit
Author-Name: Lorraine G. Kisselburgh
Abstract: This study uses a novel situation of organizing, bicycle commuting, to develop an argument regarding the requirements for collective action and increased autonomy for the material in constituting organizations. We found that through individual material and spatial practices, bike commuters constitute themselves as a collective, making their presence known and creating possibility for change. However, bike commuters’ discourses indicate that they do not experience a collective identity or sense of community of practice. We use this study to extend two areas of theory. First, we suggest that collective action can take place without organization or organizing: individual activities can aggregate to have an effect even if they are not officially coordinated or members do not acknowledge membership in a collective. Second, we suggest that this example moves beyond previous work on the communicative constitution of organizations to suggest that the material can constitute a collective, even without human, discu...

Title: Social Networks and Inter-professional Knowledge Transfer: The Case of Healthcare Professionals
Author-Name: Stefano Tasselli
Abstract: This study examines the relationship between the structure of professional networks and patterns of inter-professional knowledge transfer in the healthcare setting. Collecting survey data and qualitative evidence from 118 professionals in a hospital department, we used theory on the sociology of professions and social networks to investigate patterns of knowledge transfer between doctors and nurses. First we found that members of different professions tend to be embedded in distinctive professional cliques, which in turn inhibit effective inter-professional knowledge transfer. Network structure, however, combines with individual characteristics in predicting knowledge transfer patterns. By occupying central positions in closely knit networks, clinical directors can facilitate knowledge transfer patterns between doctors and nurses. And actors who are legitimated both intra-professionally and inter-professionally to occupy brokerage positions in social networks, namely junior doctors and nurse managers, are...

Abstract: Seeking to enhance our understanding of organizational knowledge creation in multimodal polysynchronous contexts, this paper empirically explores a project team, within a UK-based international company, concerned with the development of new software. Our aim is to extend current dialogical approaches to organizational knowledge creation, largely developed in the context of face-to-face communication, into virtual contexts of communication. Through close analysis of the ICT-mediated dialogical interactions between the members of a project team and the occasional face-to-face interactions between certain members of the project team and other organizational members, we show how knowledge creation emerges via three core dialogical processes: dialogues with real others, quasi-dialogues with invisible others, and quasi-dialogues with virtual artifacts. Exploring these processes in more depth, we further argue that the dialogical processes at hand are crucially shaped by team members actively working with the ma...

Title: Developing the Governance Space: A Study of the Role and Potential of the Company Secretary in and around the Board of Directors
Author-Name: Terry McNulty

Abstract: This study brings together developments in corporate governance and organization studies to examine the work of the company secretary, a mandatory legal officer in UK listed corporations, typically positioned close to the board of directors, but hitherto largely ignored in governance and organizational research. Regulation continues to use distinctions between inside executive and outside independent non-executives on boards, opening up organizational space between what one director actually does vis-a-vis another. This study combines a socio-spatial perspective of organization with theories of board behaviour to identify the potential for company secretaries to engage in a vibrant role performance in and around the boardroom. Findings show the potential for company secretaries to act as boundary spanners, ‘walking the lines and working the spaces’ that connect executive and non-executive directors, so developing the governance space in ways that enable board effectiveness.

Title: Overcoming the Help-Seeker’s Dilemma: How Computer-Mediated Systems Encourage Employee Help-Seeking Initiation
Author-Name: Dean J. Cleavenger
Author-Name: Timothy P. Munyon
Abstract: Helping processes are critical for organizations. Yet, research suggests that there are strong disincentives for employees to seek help from others. Drawing on self-presentation theory, this paper tested how computer-mediated communication may be used to stimulate a help-seeking response from workers. Subjects were placed in an induced-failure work scenario and provided with a computer-mediated channel with which to request help. By experimentally manipulating feedback, anonymity, and interdependence features of the work context, we then measured the length of time before subjects requested help. Eighty three percent of subjects initiated a request for help within the work period, and these help-seeking requests were made more quickly under strong helping norms, high goal interdependence, and high anonymity conditions rather than weak helping norms, low goal interdependence, and low anonymity conditions. The results provide new insights into the design of official communication channels intended to encour...

Title: Agent-Based Modeling and Organization Studies: A critical realist perspective
Author-Name: Kent D. Miller
Abstract: The method of agent-based modeling raises philosophy of science issues that modelers have yet to resolve in a way that reconciles their work with that of other management and organization researchers. As a result, agent-based modelers have made only modest contributions to advancing organization theory and empirical research. In response, this study proposes critical realism as a philosophical perspective to understand and orient agent-based modeling research. A critical realist perspective clarifies the nature and purpose of agent-based modeling and indicates the potential complementarity between agent-based modeling and other approaches to theory building and testing in the field of management and organization studies. Key emphases within critical realism on mechanismic explanations, emergence, simplifying assumptions, and abductive reasoning support agent-based modelers’ practices. Critical realism carries implications for specifying models, clarifying ontology, evaluating model outcomes, validating mo...

Abstract: The article argues that the organization of destruction requires the same level of attention that organization studies have typically accorded to the organization of production. Taking as its starting point recent debates in the field concerning the embodied character of organizational ethics, the present paper sets out to explore what we might call the contemporary ‘automation of warfare’ by focusing on the proposed deployment of autonomous robots capable of exercising lethal force while governed by the ‘ethical constraints’ dictated by the Laws of War. Acknowledging the ‘technical’ challenges inherent in the development of ‘ethical warrior robots’, we propose that the importance of such technological fixes for the management of human conflict primarily lies not in their status as (potentially) functional artefacts but rather in their role as material expressions of the moral and philosophical conflicts haunting Atlantic (post?)modernity.

Title: Developing a Relational View of the Organizing Role of Objects: A study of the innovation process in computer games
Author-Name: Harry Scarbrough
Author-Name: Nikiforos S. Panourgias
Author-Name: Joe Nandhakumar
Abstract: Innovation processes create distinctive challenges for coordination. Objects are seen as supporting coordination in such settings by enabling the emergent action needed to deal with a dynamic and uncertain process. Thus, previous work has highlighted the role of different types of objects in coordinating the collaborative tasks undertaken by expert groups, either by motivating the creation of new knowledge or through the translation of understanding. Through an empirical study of innovation processes in the computer games sector, our paper adds to this previous work by finding that the relations between objects, and not the objects alone, help to orchestrate multiple collaborative tasks towards a final outcome within temporal and resource constraints. The relational view which emerges from this study shows how such a ‘system of objects’ is able to stabilize coordination of the process while preserving the emergence and autonomy of games developer practices needed to achieve innovation.

Title: Fallible Inquiry with Ethical Ends-in-View: A Pragmatist Philosophy of Science for Organizational Research
Author-Name: Frank Martela
Abstract: The clash between positivist and constructivist research methodologies in organization studies has sent many researchers to look for a ‘third way’ in critical realism and more recently in pragmatism. Building on John Dewey’s work, this article develops a position where the fallible nature of all knowledge is acknowledged and the value of science is anchored to its ability to resolve genuine human problems. It is argued that this kind of ontological experientialism and epistemological fallibilistic instrumentalism offers the most original and defensible version of pragmatism as a philosophy of science. In it, science is seen as an outgrowth of ordinary inquiry, and thus it starts and ends in experiencing, is always constrained by fallibilism, proceeds utilizing abduction, and instead of ‘knowledge’ it produces warranted assertions. However, as pragmatist inquiry is always done with ends-in-view, pragmatism retains the possibility to evaluate the value of different theories and propositions, and thus sees s...

Title: A Theory of Imagination for Organization Studies Using the Work of Cornelius Castoriadis
Author-Name: Aris Komporozos-Athanasiou
Author-Name: Marianna Fotaki
Abstract: At a time when organizations are asked to imagine themselves anew in order to survive, organizational treatments of ‘imagination’ lack engagement with its profound political and generative nature. To address this gap, the paper draws on the works of Cornelius Castoriadis (1922–1997) and proposes a politically situated theory of imagination for organization studies. We build on Castoriadis’s core ideas of representation, signification and affect to develop a radical proposition: imagination is ‘where it all begins’, an inexhaustible psychosocial force driving organizations and organizing, and setting the institutionalization process in motion. To illustrate the great potential contributions of this proposition for organization studies, we discuss how three key persisting dualisms in organizational thinking, those between ‘representational’ and ‘non-representational’ inquiry, ‘body’ and ‘mind’, and between the ‘private’ and ‘public’, begin to dissolve when considered under our suggested framework. We then d...

Abstract: ‘Sensemaking’ is an extraordinarily influential perspective with a substantial following among management and organization scholars interested in how people appropriate and enact their ‘realities’. Organization Studies has been and remains one of the principal outlets for work that seeks either to draw on or to extend our understanding of sensemaking practices in and around organizations. The contribution of this paper is fourfold. First, we review briefly what we understand by sensemaking and some key debates which fracture the field. Second, we attend critically to eight papers published previously in Organization Studies which we discuss in terms of five broad themes: (i) how sense is made through discourse; (ii) the politics from which social forms of sensemaking emerge and the power that is inherent in it; (iii) the intertwined and recursive nature of micro-macro sensemaking processes; (iv) the strong ties which bind sensemaking and identities; and (v) the role of sensemaking processes in decision ma...

Author-Name: Giuliano Maielli
Abstract: By analysing the Fiat case, we contextualize path-dependence processes within the relations of production and propose a neo-Gramscian interpretation of the agency-structure interplay within path-dependent phenomena based on the distinction between structural hegemony and hegemonic projects. Building upon recent developments in understanding institutional complexity, we treat agency as embedded within, yet separated from, self-reinforcements that are generated by multiple competing logics. The aim is to deepen our understanding of the relationship between collective agency and the emergence of meta-routines in the pre-formation phase of the path-dependence process, and their interaction with self-reinforcements in the formation and lock-in phases.

Title: Community and Innovation: From Tönnies to Marx
Author-Name: Paul S. Adler
Abstract: The idea of community has lurked in various forms in organization studies since the field’s inception, but its recent prominence as a critical precondition for innovation makes urgent the resolution of two theoretical puzzles. Both puzzles can be stated in the terms suggested by Tönnies’ classic contrast of Gemeinschaft and Gesellschaft, community and association. First, it is difficult to reconcile the idea that community is critical to innovation with the traditionalistic character of Gemeinschaft. Second, it is difficult to reconcile any idea of community in work organizations with the conflictual character of the capitalist employment relation and the instrumental Gesellschaft character of the economic sphere. I argue that the resolution of the second puzzle via Marxist theory leads us to a resolution of the first. My thesis, in summary, is that community is a critical component of the capitalist labour-process, and that where this labour-process is oriented toward innovation, community is taking an h...

Title: Organizational Learning: Bringing the Forces of Production Back In
Author-Name: Jonas A. Ingvaldsen
Abstract: Under the influence of the ‘communities of practice’ perspective, research on organizational learning has lost sight of the role of science and technology. As a result, theory development in this field too often takes archaic work forms as its starting point. Based on a structural and materialist interpretation of Marx, this paper proposes an alternative approach that theorizes organizational learning as an outcome of contradictory processes in which the productive forces are progressively socialized, albeit unevenly. This approach leads to a very different perspective on tacit/explicit knowledge, work formalization, identify formation and the roles of managers and engineers. This structural-Marxist theory of organizational learning offers a more fruitful account of learning in technologically advanced, competitive sectors such as the manufacturing and process industries. Increasingly, it also applies to private and public service provision.

Title: Free Labour, Social Media, Management: Challenging Marxist Organization Studies
Author-Name: Armin Beverungen
Author-Name: Steffen Böhm
Author-Name: Chris Land
Abstract: In this paper we explore how so-called ‘social media’ such as Facebook challenge Marxist organization studies. We argue that understanding the role of user activity in web 2.0 business models requires a focus on ‘work’, understood as value productive activity, that takes place beyond waged labour in the firm. A reading of Marx on the socialization of labour highlights the emerging figure of ‘free labour’, which is both unpaid and uncoerced. Marxist work on the production of the ‘audience commodity’ provides one avenue for understanding the production of content and data by users as free labour, but this raises questions concerning the distinction between productive and unproductive labour, which is central to Marx’s labour theory of value. The Marxist literature on ‘the becoming rent of profit’ allows for a partial understanding of how the value produced by free labour is captured, thereby developing the understanding of the economic dimension of ‘free labour’ as unpaid. It overstates, however, the ‘uncon...

Title: Personal Branding and Identity Norms in the Popular Business Press: Enterprise Culture in an Age of Precarity
Author-Name: Steven P. Vallas
Author-Name: Emily R. Cummins
Abstract: The theory of enterprise culture (du Gay, 1996) has provoked one of the more enduring strands of research on organizations and identities. Yet, after a decade and half of debate, the validity of this theory remains mired in ambiguity. In this article we revisit the theory of enterprise culture by exploring shifts in the popular business press and employee responses to them, in an effort to track the identity norms that have impinged on job seekers over time. Scrutinizing career-advice texts published between 1980 and 2010, we do indeed find partial support for the theory of enterprise culture, as the most popular renderings of work and employment have exhibited a marked yet complex turn toward entrepreneurial rhetoric. Interviews with 53 employees and job seekers suggest that a discourse of personal branding is indeed pervasive, and is often uncritically incorporated into the conceptions that job seekers bring to bear on their career horizons. Yet we also find that enterprise discourse has evolved beyond ...

Title: Tackling Grand Challenges Pragmatically: Robust Action Revisited
Author-Name: Fabrizio Ferraro
Author-Name: Dror Etzion
Author-Name: Joel Gehman
Abstract: In this article, we theorize a novel approach to addressing the world’s grand challenges based on the philosophical tradition of American pragmatism and the sociological concept of robust action. Grounded in prior empirical organizational research, we identify three robust strategies that organizations can employ in tackling issues such as climate change and poverty alleviation: participatory architecture, multivocal inscriptions and distributed experimentation. We demonstrate how these strategies operate, the manner in which they are linked, the outcomes they generate, and why they are applicable for resolving grand challenges. We conclude by discussing our contributions to research on robust action and grand challenges, as well as some implications for research on stakeholder theory, institutional theory and theories of valuation.

Title: Brokerage as Catalysis: How Diaghilev’s Ballets Russes Escalated Modernism
Author-Name: Stoyan V. Sgourev
Abstract: The analysis elaborates and illustrates a proposition on brokerage that is implicit in existing research—that through self-assembling their ties, brokers may trigger chains of events with systemic consequences that they can only partly control or benefit from. By relaxing the assumption of strategic control, the analysis contributes to reducing the discrepancy between micro and macro levels of analysis. This approach is illustrated with the case of the Ballets Russes (1909–1929) and its founder Sergei Diaghilev, who revolutionized the arts in the early 20th century by aggregating developments in dance, music, design and literature. The role of a catalyst emerges in connecting artists on the supply side and in matching supply and demand for novelty. Catalysis was triggered by the interaction between identity and field-level fragmentation when the personal network of an unusually multifaceted broker became a platform for the interpenetration of heretofore disconnected social networks. However, in escalating...

Title: Temporal and Spatial Dimensions of Strategizing
Author-Name: Katja Maria Hydle
Abstract: This paper extends existing research on time and space in strategizing by combining the understanding of temporal-spatial activities from practice theory with the strategy-as-practice perspective. In practice theory, temporal dimensions incorporate the past, present, and future of temporality and objective time, while spatial dimensions involve the places and paths of spatiality and objective space. These dimensions are used to uncover patterns of everyday activities in service provision and the related deliberate and non-deliberate strategizing in a transnational professional service firm. Three overall patterns of practices are identified as a result, and a framework of the temporal and spatial dimensions of strategizing is developed. The contribution of this study is to identify how strategy is realized, modified and developed, simultaneously, through distributed agency. Attention to the temporal-spatial dimensions helps explain the enabling and limiting factors in strategizing.

Author-Name: Maria Joutsenvirta
Author-Name: Eero Vaara
Abstract: This paper examines the discursive legitimation of controversial investment projects to provide a better understanding of the ways in which corporate social responsibility is constructed in international settings. On the basis of a discursive analysis of an intense dispute between Finnish, Uruguayan and Argentinean actors over a pulp mill project in Uruguay, we develop a framework that elucidates four legitimating discourses: technocratic, societal, national-political, and global-capitalist. With this framework, our analysis helps to better understand how CSR involves discourse-ideological struggles, how CSR is embedded in international relations, and how CSR is mediatized in contemporary globalizing society. By so doing, our analysis contributes to critical studies of CSR as well as research on legitimation more generally.

Title: An Exploratory Study of Organizational Governance in Publicly-Quoted Professional Service Firms
Author-Name: Mark E. Pickering
Abstract: There has been a trend of large professional service firms (PSFs) to move from the partnership form of ownership to alternative ownership forms. As part of this trend large, publicly-quoted accounting companies have emerged in Australia, the US and the UK. Research on how publicly-owned PSFs, including accounting companies, are governed, whether aspects of the governance of partnership persist, why particular governance interpretive schemes and associated structures and systems are implemented and implications for performance is sparse. This study explores the interpretive scheme of governance in two Australian publicly-quoted accounting companies and finds one of the companies to have mimicked the major attributes of the partnership interpretive scheme while the other company moved to a corporate form of governance eliminating all vestiges of the partnership interpretive scheme. Governance was found to have significant implications for the performance of the companies with moving from a partnership inter...

Abstract: Organizational control and environmental influences on organizational behavior are central themes in organization studies, yet little effort has been made to bring them together. In this paper we seek to contribute to filling this gap by investigating and conceptualizing environmental influences on organizational control. The paper examines patterns of organizational control and their environmental couplings through three parallel case studies of public universities in three European countries. We provide a systematic characterization of the space of configurations of control in professional knowledge-intensive organizations along the two axes of centralization of power and formalization of social relationships. We show that environmental characteristics do matter for the contestation and selection of control models. Finally, we unpack and conceptualize the synergetic influence of three environmental characteristics (institutional pressures, resource environment, and external social relationships) as prov...

Title: If You Can’t Take the Heat: Cultural Beliefs about Questionable Conduct, Stigma, Punishment, and Withdrawal among Mexican Police Officers
Author-Name: Jorge A. Gonzalez
Author-Name: Lorena R. Pérez-Floriano
Abstract: We introduce the concept of cultural beliefs about questionable conduct, and examine how these beliefs interact with stigma consciousness to influence punishment and two withdrawal behaviors: turnover and absenteeism. We used a sample of Mexican police officers in a border city and implemented a mixed method design, paying attention to the national, occupational, and organizational context of this setting. We conducted a qualitative phase to explore the prevalence and meaning of occupational stigma and four cultural beliefs about questionable conduct: greed, toughness, wariness, and savvy. The results of this phase helped us develop a context-relevant measure of cultural beliefs about questionable conduct using Mexican proverbs. The results of the quantitative phase indicated that, contingent upon stigma consciousness, beliefs about questionable conduct affected received punishment, turnover, and absenteeism. We discuss the theoretical and behavioral implications of our findings for socialization, identit...

Title: How Entrepreneurs Become Skilled Cultural Operators
Author-Name: Florian Überbacher

Author-Name: Joep P. Cornelissen
Abstract: Cultural entrepreneurship and symbolic management perspectives portray entrepreneurs as skilled cultural operators and often assume them to be capable from the outset to purposefully use ‘cultural resources’ in order to motivate resource-holding audiences to support their new ventures. We problematize this premise and develop a model of how entrepreneurs become skilful cultural operators and develop the cultural competences necessary for creating and growing their ventures. The model is grounded in a case study of an entrepreneur who set up shop and sought to acquire resources in a culturally unfamiliar setting. Our model proposes that two adaptive sensemaking processes – approval-driven sensemaking and autonomy-driven sensemaking – jointly facilitate the gradual development of cultural competences. These processes jointly enable entrepreneurs to gain cultural awareness and calibrate their symbolic enactments. Specifically, while approval-driven sensemaking facilitates recognizing cultural resources to sy...

Title: From Rational Myth to Self-Fulfilling Prophecy? Understanding the Persistence of Means–ends Decoupling as a Consequence of the Latent Functions of Policy Enactment
Author-Name: Penny Dick
Abstract: Organizations operating in pluralistic institutional environments are facing ever greater pressures to adopt and implement policies and practices that have few if any benefits for their core functions. This situation is characterized by Bromley and Powell as reflective of means–ends decoupling. Current theory suggests that this form of decoupling can be difficult to sustain unless the logic of confidence in the policy/practice is maintained, i.e. actors believe that it is useful, relevant and important. In this study, I argue that part-time working in the UK police service illustrates a sustained case of means–ends decoupling in that its official purpose (to retain the skills and experience of (mainly female) police officers) not only appears to have few benefits for the subunits in which it is implemented, but the practice itself is seen to interfere with the achievement of operational goals, generating efficiency gaps. Despite this situation, the logic of confidence in this practice is maintained. Using...

Title: When Organization Studies Turns to Societal Problems: The Contribution of Marxist Grand Theory
Author-Name: Matt Vidal

Author-Name: Rick Delbridge
Abstract: Marxist theory, we argue, can be a valuable resource as organization studies turns to the urgent societal problems of our times. In order to address these problems, organizational studies needs greater historical depth and interdisciplinarity. We argue that these imperatives necessitate a return to grand theory. Grand theories provide the frameworks needed for integrating in a systematic as opposed to an ad hoc manner both scholarship across disciplines and middle-range theories within disciplines. We show that marxism offers a particularly fruitful grand theory for organization studies and for the social sciences more broadly, because it affords a platform for integrating various social sciences and because it offers penetrating insight into both the longue durée of history and the political-economic dynamics of capitalism. In making our case, we present and defend the core ideas of marxism, including its theory of modes of production, its distinctive theory of “soft” technological and economic determini...

Title: Studying Hybrids: Sectors and Mechanisms
Author-Name: Wolfgang Seibel
Abstract: The present paper introduces and compares two alternative perspectives on hybridity. One is the perspective of hybrids being located at the interface of dominant ‘sectors’ such as the private for-profit sector, the public sector and the civil society or nonprofit sector. The alternative perspective focuses on a combination of sector-specific governance mechanisms. The paper discusses the characteristics as well as the advantages and disadvantages of those two perspectives and what a combination of both implies for further research with an emphasis on the analysis of organizational pathologies and managerial coping.

Title: Navigating Institutional Plurality: Organizational Governance in Hybrid Organizations
Author-Name: Johanna Mair

Author-Name: Eva Lutz
Abstract: Hybrid organizations operate in a context of institutional plurality and enact elements of multiple, often conflicting institutional logics. Governance is highly relevant in navigating such an environment. This study examines how hybrid organizations set up their governance structures and practices. Building on survey data from 70 social enterprises, a subset of hybrid organizations, we identify two types of hybrid organization: conforming hybrids rely on the prioritization of a single institutional logic and dissenting hybrids use defiance, selective coupling and innovation as mechanisms to combine and balance the prescriptions of several institutional logics. We illustrate these mechanisms by drawing on the qualitative analysis of selected cases. This study refines current debates on social enterprises as hybrid organizations. Based on our findings, we speculate that some social enterprises might assume hybridity for symbolic reasons while others – genuine hybrids – do so for substantive reasons.

Title: Caring Leadership: A Heideggerian Perspective
Author-Name: Leah Tomkins
Author-Name: Peter Simpson
Abstract: This paper develops the idea of caring leadership based on Heidegger’s philosophy of care. From this perspective, caring leadership is grounded in the practices of ‘leaping-in’ and ‘leaping-ahead’ as modes of intervention in the affairs of the world and the efforts of others. This involves gauging and taking responsibility for the ramifications of intervention, balancing the urge for certainty of outcome and visibility of contribution with the desire to encourage and enable others. Our analysis suggests several twists to contemporary leadership debates. We argue that the popular models of transactional and transformational leadership are to be critiqued not for their over-reliance but, rather, their under-reliance on agency. This is a different kind of agency to that of heroic or charismatic models. It involves tolerance of complexity and ambivalence; a rich sense of temporal trajectory; concern for one’s presence in the world; and crucially, the ability to resist the soothing normativity of ‘best practic...

Abstract: We investigate how the relational capital of a person within an organization affects the extent to which she or he conducts exploration activities. Our theory separates out a negative effect that comes from aligning goals with other organizational members from a positive effect that stems from acquiring knowledge from them. Our data from 150 members of the R&D teams of three leading R&D-intensive firms support the theoretical model. By developing and testing this theory, we contribute to the literature on exploration, which lacks understanding of the antecedents of individual exploration in organizations. We also contribute to relational capital literature, which has focused on organizational and group-level exploration, but which has shown inconsistent findings regarding the relationship between relational capital and exploration. A reason for this may be that this body of research has emphasized positive effects of relational capital for exploration only, and has not accounted for the different mechanis...

Abstract: The aim of this paper is to suggest new avenues for trust research by critiquing the extant literature on this topic. We analyse the most influential research on intraorganizational trust from the perspective of a classic industrial sociology framework from the 1970s – Alan Fox’s work on frames of reference and trust dynamics. Our analysis of intraorganizational trust studies leads us to three conclusions. First, the large majority of intraorganizational trust research has strong unitarist underpinnings, which support a managerial agenda that is potentially detrimental to employees’ (and indeed managers’) long-term interests. Second, most of this research fails to explain how trust in organizations is embedded in societal and field-level institutions, hence it would benefit from looking ‘beyond the factory gates’ for a more complete understanding of trust dynamics in organizations. In this connection, we argue that Fox’s pluralist and radical perspectives, which are under-represented in intraorganizationa...

Abstract: Motivated by the question of how to develop viable new markets and value chains in the resource-constrained settings of least developed countries, we adopted multi-year qualitative methods to examine the intervention of a nongovernmental organization (NGO) in developing the dairy value chain in Bangladesh. Consistent with the theoretical premise that markets and value chains are social orders, we found that the NGO’s success relied on building the social structure of a market wherein market participants could negotiate relationships and norms of production and exchange and embed them in practices and technologies. To establish social structure among participants as a means of market building, the NGO acquired relevant knowledge, then used contextual bridging (transferring new meanings, practices and structures into a given context in a way that is sensitive to the norms, practices, knowledge and relationships that exist in that context), brokering relationships along the value chain (facilitating introduc...

Abstract: What is the sovereign consumer that occupies such a central role in organizational discourse whose satisfaction has become an organizational imperative? Our research draws from extended fieldwork in the world of commercial ethnography. Our analysis shows how ethnography is implicated in the organizational fetishization of consumers, that is, how in the process of understanding and managing markets, a quasi-magical fascination with amalgams of consumer voices, images, and artefacts comes about. We offer several contributions. First, we demonstrate the pertinence of (primarily anthropological) theories of the fetish to organizational sensemaking. Second, we describe a distinctive process of organizational market sensemaking that is sensuous, magical, and analogical. Third, we offer a subtle critique of commercial ethnography, a popular research practice that aims to bring ‘real’ consumers to life inside the firm.

Abstract: The case presented here shows how a set of Lacanian concepts can be useful for analysing the behaviour of employees’ representatives in a factory belonging to a large globalized and financialised corporation and threatened with closure. We identify a central characteristic of this organization (the obliteration of symbolic authority) to identify the psychic processes the employees’ representatives go through as a result of this characteristic and the impact in terms of their difficulties in exerting resistance. We rest our analysis on the distinction Lacan makes between utterance and enunciation and make use of the concepts of master signifier, symbolic authority, fantasy and superego. We show that in this case the absence of symbolic authority leads the staff representatives to be taken over by the fantasy of a tyrannical and unbarred Other that has the absolute power to close down the factory at any time, and to feel guilty that they never do enough, a typical sense of guilt resulting from the superego’...

Title: Management Control, Results-Oriented Culture and Public Sector Performance: Empirical Evidence on New Public Management
Author-Name: Frank H. M. Verbeeten
Author-Name: Roland F. Speklé
Abstract: New Public Management (NPM) has been guiding public sector reform for over 25 years. Its position on the design of effective management control rests on three key ideas: (1) performance improvement requires a results-oriented culture that emphasizes outcomes rather than inputs or processes; (2) public sector organizations need to introduce performance management based on targets, monitoring and incentives; and (3) public sector organizations should decentralize decision rights and reduce their reliance on rules and procedures. Focusing on the particularly influential version of NPM as advocated by the OECD, we examine the validity of these ideas theoretically and empirically. We conclude that NPM’s reform programme should be reconsidered. Although the evidence indicates that a results-oriented culture is positively associated with performance, we find little support for the assumed benefits of NPM-type performance contracting. In addition, the results suggest that both the effects of decentralization and ...

Author-Name: Giovan Francesco Lanzara
Abstract: This article investigates a form of governance that makes online social production possible. Drawing on the concepts of capability and routine, we develop a dynamic, process-oriented view that departs from past research focused on static comparative analysis. We theorize that online social production systems develop a collective governance capability to steer the process of integrating distributed knowledge resources to the production of value. Governance mechanisms emerge from individual and collective learning that is made possible by new technology, and they evolve over time, as routines are developed to respond to new problems faced by a growing production system. Using Wikipedia as a paradigmatic example of online social production, we characterize governance as an evolving, enabling and embedded process and discuss implications for a dynamic theory of governance.

Abstract: We propose and test the proposition that state ownership represents an important mechanism of institutional-based trust production in market development that requires analysis in its own right, particularly following periods of financial crisis when the state’s role as a regulator is often viewed as ineffective or corrupt. To test the proposition that state ownership and state regulation act as distinct sources of institutional-based trust production, we examine individual choices of market participation and avoidance in Russia’s market for bank deposits. To analyze the consequences of institutional-based trust, we look at individual preferences to keep savings in a private bank, in a state bank, or in cash outside of the banking system. To analyze antecedent conditions, we measure an individual’s trust in political actors and government agencies. Our results support the proposition that the state produces institutional-based trust in the Russian banking system through its roles as both an owner and a reg...

Title: Repairing Trust in an Organization after Integrity Violations: The Ambivalence of Organizational Rule Adjustments
Author-Name: Peter Eberl
Author-Name: Daniel Geiger
Author-Name: Michael S. Aßländer
Abstract: This paper investigates how an organization attempts to repair trust after organizational-level integrity violations by examining the influence of organizational rules on trust repair. We reconstruct the prominent corruption case of Siemens AG, which has faced the greatest bribery scandal in the history of German business. Our findings suggest that tightening organizational rules is an appropriate signal of trustworthiness for external stakeholders to demonstrate that the organization seriously intends to prevent integrity violations in the future. However, such rule adjustments were the source of dissatisfaction among employees since the new rules were difficult to implement in practice. We argue that these different impacts of organizational rules result from their inherent paradoxical nature. To address this problem, we suggest managing an effective interplay between formal and informal rules.

Title: Can Audit (Still) be Trusted?
Author-Name: Frank Mueller
Author-Name: Chris Carter
Author-Name: Andrea Whittle
Abstract: This paper analyses audit as an exemplar of an expert system. The paper explores the premise that systemic trust in audit has been damaged and requires repair, looking specifically at the role of the institutionalized mechanism of the public inquiry. This is examined empirically in relation to the interaction between the heads of the Big Four accounting firms in the UK and the House of Lords Economic Select Committee in the course of the recent parliamentary investigation into the UK audit market, prompted by the global financial crisis. In particular, the paper seeks to understand how there can be transfer of trust, following Sztompka (1999), between different levels and between agents in a system. In this case, the Big Four – as privileged market participants – require re-legitimation from agents that are part of the political and legal apparatus. We therefore argue that re-legitimation of the Big Four’s privileged market position is dependent on transfer of trust.

Title: Reorienting and Recalibrating Inter-organizational Relationships: Strategies for Achieving Optimal Trust
Author-Name: Merieke Stevens
Author-Name: John Paul MacDuffie
Author-Name: Susan Helper
Abstract: Drawing upon longitudinal, dyadic, comparative case-based research, we analyze the pursuit of optimal trust, i.e. trust that is neither excessive nor insufficient, by introducing the concepts of reorientation and recalibration. First, we show that large deviations from optimal trust are best addressed by reorientation which deals with both too much as well as too little trust. Reorientation processes include substantial efforts to change parties’ attributions of the intentions underlying past behavior, to reestablish social equilibrium among the parties, and to make structural changes via adjustments to goals and incentives. Reorientation is necessary when imbalance occurs in the powerful and opposed forces associated with excessive trust (faith, favoritism, contentment, loyalty) vs insufficient trust (skepticism, impartiality, exigency, opportunism). Second, we demonstrate that there is an effective path to maintaining optimal trust via practices we call recalibration, wherein small deviations are addres...

Title: Institutionalizing Precariousness? The Politics of Boundary Work in Legalizing Agency Work in Germany, 1949–2004
Author-Name: Markus Helfen
Abstract: The legalizing of agency work in Germany is used as an illustrative case for exploring and theorizing how contests about regulating organizations’ labor practices are played out through the politics of boundary work. By combining the idea of inter-field relations from the theory of strategic action fields with considerations about boundary work within and between organizational fields, this paper explains the recent proliferation of agency work as the outgrowth of a long-term legalization contest. By taking a historical perspective, it illuminates how the boundary work of (former) incumbents and (new) challengers modulates institutional dynamics. Based on qualitative primary and secondary material, the findings reveal how the politics of boundary work facilitate power reversals in organizational fields by allowing defeated parties to survive in a field’s niches, to cross a field’s boundaries, and to rebuild their intervention capacity as well as by making incumbent coalitions erode over time.

Title: Labour out of Control: The Political Economy of Capitalist and Ethical Organizations
Author-Name: Mathieu O’Neil
Abstract: Digitally networked voluntary associations such as free software projects and Wikipedia can be distinguished from capitalist firms in two respects. First, their predominant logic is ‘ethical’. Participation is primarily motivated by self-fulfilment and validated by a community of peers, rather than by earning wages. Second, their governance is ‘modular’, understood in a design sense (decomposable blocks sharing a common interface), but also in political economy terms: participants oppose restricted ownership and control by individually socializing their works into commons. In recent years capitalist-centralized firms have increasingly engaged with ethical-modular organizations, in some cases paying wages to participants (such labour is thus both ‘alienated’ or sold, and ‘communal’, as workers freely cooperate to produce commons). This article reviews the literature dealing with the relationship of these two organizational types. It argues that the manner in which scholars approach a central characteristic...

Title: Understanding Motivation and Social Influence in Stakeholder Prioritization

Abstract: Insight into organizational responses to stakeholder claims and influence attempts is critical to understand the challenges currently facing managers and organizations. Drawing on Kelman’s (1958) model of social influence, we advance the field’s understanding of the factors driving firm-level prioritization of competing stakeholder claims by developing a theoretical framework that accounts for both the stakeholder attributes that are important to relevant decision makers, and the decision makers’ motivations for accepting or rejecting the influence attempts of varying stakeholders. Our framework distinguishes itself from existing research by focusing on stakeholder prioritization, not salience, recognizing that stakeholder-related decisions result from group interaction and that important decision makers are not limited to those found within the classic boundaries of the firm. Consequently, we argue that decision makers are simultaneously stakeholders with attributes that might be relevant to other decisi...

Title: The Aesthetics of Leadership: Beau Geste as Critical Behaviour

Author-Name: Ghislain Deslandes
Abstract: This paper focuses on the role of beau geste in organizations, showing that it is endowed with a specifically critical dimension as it challenges both the established order and customary practices. We also scrutinize its unique role that consists in critically resisting economic norms. Analysing the beau geste actually offers an opportunity to broaden the scope of our vision of leadership by relying on aesthetics rather than conventionally viewing the leader as an artist. In the first part, we thus concentrate on the way leadership scholars have so far dealt with aesthetics. In the second part, through a series of examples and by adopting a historical perspective, we describe the defining features of the beau geste in organizations: gratuity effect, impact on the common good, size effect and surprise effect. We then analyse how beau geste indeed constitutes a form of provocation against an ‘organized’ world in which economic rationality seems to prevail. In the conclusion, we outline future prospects for ...

Title: Organization Theory and the Study of European Union Institutions: Lessons and Opportunities
Author-Name: Zuzana Murdoch
Abstract: Most scholarship in modern organization theory maintains a near-exclusive focus on private-sector settings. In contrast, this article argues that complex public-sector organizational systems – such as the European Union (EU) – can provide a very relevant laboratory to both fine-tune organization theoretical propositions and test them empirically. I first draw attention to the value-added of organization theory for the study of EU institutions. Then, I turn to these institutions’ capacity to present a springboard for theoretical development in organization theory, and bring forward a number of avenues for further research on the intersection of EU studies and organization theory that can push forward both research fields.

Author-Name: Julia Balogun

Abstract: This paper explores how frontline workers contribute to an organization’s realized strategy. Using a workplace studies approach, we analyse the work of museum tour guides as a salient example of workers engaged in frontline work. Our findings demonstrate the subtle and intricate nature of the embodied work of frontline workers as they ‘bring into being’ the strategic aims of an organization. We identified five elements as central to this process: (1) the situated physical context; (2) audience composition; (3) the moral order; (4) the talk, actions and gestures of the guide; and (5) the corresponding talk, actions and gestures of the audience. Drawing on these categories, we find frontline workers to demonstrate ‘interactional competence’: assessing and making use of the physical, spatial and material specifics of the context and those they are interacting with, and enlisting interactional resources to uphold a moral order that brings these others in as a working audience, encouraging them to respond in p...

Title: Regulators, Conformers and Cowboys: The Enterprise Discourse, Power and Resistance in the UK Passive Fire Protection Industry
Author-Name: Stephanie Russell
Author-Name: Darren McCabe
Abstract: This article draws on industry-level research to explore the enterprise discourse in the UK passive fire protection industry. It highlights the theoretical weaknesses of the enterprise discourse by questioning the assumption that employers and managers necessarily support enterprise. It examines how employers, not just employees, may seek to resist or evade enterprise and how, far from offering a united front, employers may oppose each other. The article points towards the need for industry-level studies due to the limitations and potentially misleading insights that can flow from organization-level studies. Overall, it is argued that there may be more common ground between employees and employers in terms of opposition to enterprise than has previously been suggested.

Abstract: This study explores the relations between organizational spatiality, gender, and class. It examines the work performed by managers and architects on the one hand, and by various groups of female employees on the other, in constructing, reproducing, and challenging gender-class identities through space-related means. Three types of gender-class spatial work are identified―discursive, material, and interpretive-emotional―to highlight the role of space in constructing and reconstructing inequality regimes within organizations. Applying insights from Lefebvre’s spatial theory, we analyze the case of the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs’ new headquarters, demonstrating how the spatial work of various actors is both gendered and gendering. We also show how space is enacted by women from different social groups in accordance with their habitus and with the aim of distinguishing themselves from others.

Author-Name: Maddy Janssens
Abstract: Drawing on Fairclough’s comprehensive social theory of discourse as text, social practice and discursive practice, the paper examines how discourses of diversity are implicated in the power dynamics in the Belgian branch of an international automobile company. Our analysis shows how diversity discourses are interlocked with occupations. On the one hand, speakers’ occupational practices are conditional for the emergence of multiple, occupation-distinct discourses of diversity. On the other, in their discursive practice, speakers not only construct diversity but at once deploy it as a symbolic currency to reaffirm their own occupational practices and related subject positions warranting voice in the workplace. Our study contributes to the extant critical diversity literature and the organizational scholarship on work by showing how the power dynamics of diversity cannot be adequately conceptualized without attending to occupational discursive and non-discursive practices.

Title: Configurable Bureaucracy and the Making of Modular Man
Author-Name: Alison Hirst
Author-Name: Michael Humphreys
Abstract: The flexibility of people in modern societies rests upon their capacity to divide themselves into separate modules of thought and action, and deploy them in ways that fit their purposes. The practice of ‘informatizing’ work by converting tasks into software-based processes entails the modular design of work, because software has a modular form. We use the concept of modularity to analyse the implications of informatization in the empirical context of a ‘shared service centre’ providing professional services. We make three contributions. First, informatization enlarges the scope for organizational flexibility, because the organization can be treated as a configuration of modules which can be reshuffled to suit changing circumstances. Second, employees must attempt to deploy enhanced modular capabilities, by executing any given set of processes, in a flexible, unemotional and time-efficient fashion. Third, given the ability to informatize complex service work, and the existence of organizational templates w...

Abstract: Global expansion in the boundaries of professional work, the introduction of managerial concepts and thinking, and changes in the organizational form of professional service firms all impact the process by which professionals come to identify with their profession. The focus of this paper is on transnational professional careers and professional identity development, which remain an under-researched aspect of how globalization affects the professions. Based on original survey data from Australia, we chart the influence of social and organizational contexts on professional identity development for migrant and local accounting professionals respectively. Findings suggest that unlike the “boundaryless” opportunities associated with globe-trotting professionals, the majority of professional migrants are significantly constrained by the organizational and inter-subjective settings in which they work. Theoretically, we extend the concept of professional identity development to include not only formative early c...

Author-Name: Graham Sewell
Author-Name: Laurent Taskin
Abstract: We draw on the geographical concepts of social space, territoriality, and distantiation to examine an apparent tension inherent in telework: i.e., using information and communication technologies to work away from traditional workplaces can give employees a greater sense of autonomy while simultaneously placing new constraints on the way they conduct themselves in settings that were previously beyond the reach of managerial control. We draw on a longitudinal case study of a Belgian biopharmaceutical company to show how technical and professional teleworkers developed broadly similar strategies of spatiotemporal scaling to cope with this tension. We conclude by considering how these scaling strategies allowed employees to cope with the demands of ‘hybrid’ work that is conducted both at home and in traditional settings.

Abstract: Drawing from a qualitative, empirical study of work experiences in a North American organic supermarket, we introduce the notion of ‘enchanting work’, a polyvalent concept referring to the aura found in certain forms of service work in contrast to the disenchantment commonly associated with it. Enchanting work, because of its unique stance vis-a-vis workplace critique and commitment, can inform the study of work by moving beyond the dichotomy of meaningful versus alienated work. Our findings show how enchanting work can be found on three different levels to (1) infuse otherwise mundane work processes with meaning, (2) obscure organizational control mechanisms and divert attention from precarious work conditions, and (3) recruit the participation of workers for creating an enchanted workplace. We discuss the implications of our results for understanding contemporary worlds of work and explore both the emancipatory and ideological ramifications of enchanting work.

Title: Collaborative Institutional Agency: How Peer Learning in Communities of Practice Enables and Inhibits Micro-Institutional Change
Author-Name: E. N. Bridwell-Mitchell
Abstract: Research on micro-institutional change typically characterizes agents as being involved in social conflicts to defend the institutional status quo or to mobilize against it. However, agency inside organizations can be precipitated by the need to resolve practice dilemmas in uncertain and ambiguous institutional contexts. The findings from a comparative case study of two public schools in the United States undergoing state-mandated reform demonstrate that, when agency is born of uncertainty and ambiguity rather than political conflict and struggle, micro-institutional change depends on the dynamics of agents’ peer learning in communities of practice. In some cases, agents’ communities are organized to effectively seed new ideas and generate social pressures needed to encourage the uptake of new ideas. In other cases, the pattern of agents’ interactions in communities results in persistent cognitive and social disorganization so that newly seeded ideas cannot take root or spread. I refer to the particular d...

Title: Rationalizing Violation: Ordered Accounts of Intentionality in the Breaking of Safety Rules
Author-Name: J. S. Busby
Author-Name: M. Iszatt-White
Abstract: Regulative rules are central to the efforts made in organizations to ensure orderliness in the presence of physical danger. The reportedly routine violation of safety rules in organizations therefore brings into question the longstanding association of rules with organizational order, and the literature is sharply divided on whether rule violation represents a dangerous disorder or a reasonable way of getting by. This study is an attempt to carry out a more interpretive analysis, looking at how organizational members construct a sense of order in the presence of rule violation – and in particular how they do so by using a concept of intentionality to maintain accountability yet avoid rules becoming taboos. We find that the way people explain intentions attests to several senses of order that otherwise appear to be lost when rules are violated, such as predictability, purposefulness and progressiveness. This indicates that rules do not maintain, symbolize and constitute order simply because they are normat...

Abstract: In this paper we address identity issues in relation to senior employees in the UK investment banking sector. Drawing on in-depth material, the study demonstrates their marginal concerns about identity issues or engagement in what is typically viewed as identity work. Instead they had what we refer to as an identity minimalism orientation and met potential challenges to identity with what we conceptualize as teflonic identity manoeuvring. In so doing they were able to deflect attention away from themselves, enabling them to circumvent identity concerns. These employees drew upon material resources, specifically money, to rationalize this disposition and social (in particular, dress codes) and discursive resources (around professionalism) to bolster and sustain this disposition.

Abstract: This paper explores how men who perform intimate labour negotiate perceptions of themselves and their work through complex intersections of masculinity, proximity and propriety. Its focus is on the ways in which embodied organizational negotiations are shaped by gendered perceptions of bodily propriety in three examples of physically, sexually and/or emotionally intimate forms of labour: male massage therapists; men who work in sex shops; and men working as Santa Claus performers. While ostensibly quite different forms of work, each is shaped by the expectation that a ‘quality’ interaction with customers or clients will be based upon the nurturance of a close physical, sexual and/or emotional bond between the service provider and recipient, at the same time as maintaining appropriate bodily boundaries and professional distance. Mediating both imperatives requires a careful negotiation of being appropriately close while at the same time understanding that social perceptions of their work, themselves as wor...

Title: Secret Societies: Intimations of Organization
Author-Name: Martin Parker
Abstract: This paper uses the secret society to pose questions about the politics, epistemology and ontology of organizing. Against assumptions of transparency, or the possibility of hermeneutic understanding, I suggest that much organizing is actually invisible and opaque. The paper begins with a consideration of the characteristics of historical and contemporary organizational conspiracies, and then moves on to elaborate what sort of ‘facts’ need to be claimed about a secret society to bring it into existence. After a section on the politics of contemporary organizational conspiracies, the paper concludes with some speculations on what the example of the secret society can tell us about the paranoia required by contemporary organizational researchers, as well as the ontology of organizations. After all, we have still never seen an organization.

Title: Identity Threats, Identity Work and Elite Professionals
Author-Name: Andrew D. Brown
Author-Name: Christine Coupland
Abstract: Elite professionals opportunistically employ threats to their work identities to author preferred selves. Predicated on understandings that identities are subjectively available to people as in-progress narratives, and that these are often insecure fabrications, we investigate the identity work of members of a UK-based professional Rugby League club. The research contribution we make is to demonstrate that professionals use identity threats as flexible resources for working on favoured identities. We show that rugby players authored identity threats centred on the shortness of their careers, injury and performance, and how these were appropriated (made their own) by men to develop desired occupational and masculine identities. In so doing, we also contribute to debates on how professionals’ identity discourse is an expression of agency framed within relations of power.

Title: Repairing Trust in Organizations and Institutions: Toward a Conceptual Framework
Author-Name: Reinhard Bachmann
Author-Name: Nicole Gillespie
Author-Name: Richard Priem
Abstract: Trust plays a fundamental role in facilitating social exchange, yet recent global events have undermined trust in many of society’s institutions and organizations. This raises the pertinent question of how trust in organizations and institutions can be restored once it has been lost. The emerging literature on trust repair is largely focused at the micro level, with limited examination of how these processes operate at the macro level and across levels. In this introductory essay, we show how the papers in this special issue each advance our understanding of macro-level trust repair. We draw on these papers, as well as the extant interdisciplinary literature, to propose an integrated conceptual model of six key mechanisms for restoring trust in organizations and institutions, highlighting the merits, limits and paradoxes of each. We conclude that no single mechanism can be relied on to rebuild organizational trust and identify a future research agenda for advancing scholarly understanding of organizationa...

Title: Encompassing Stability and Novelty in Organization Studies: An Events-based Approach
Author-Name: Anthony Hussenot
Author-Name: Stéphanie Missonier
Abstract: The stability versus novelty relationship remains a conundrum in organization studies, partly owing to conventional views of time and temporality. In this article, we address organization as a stability-novelty intertwinement through the lens of organizational events. The advantage of an events-based approach is that stability and novelty are expressed as parts of the same acts, and not different acts, which tends to be the assumption among mainstream theories of organization change. The events-based approach developed for this article shows how the organization may be defined as a structure of past and anticipated events, defined and redefined on an ongoing basis. From a case study of the development of a competency management tool in a bank, we show how the intertwinement between stability and novelty is articulated through events throughout the project and how every event is both an act of stability and an act of change.

Title: Calculability as Politics in the Construction of Markets: The Case of Socially Responsible Investment in France
Author-Name: Stéphanie Giamporcaro
Author-Name: Jean-Pascal Gond
Abstract: This article examines some of the processes by which power constitutes calculability and, in so doing, shapes the construction of markets. We combine insights from performativity studies about calculability with Lukes’ ‘radical view of power’ to investigate how multiple facets of power are mobilized to influence the creation and activities of calculative agencies in the process of market construction. An in-depth longitudinal study of the French socially responsible investment market shows how organizations acting as calculative agencies become sites of power through calculability. We identify how power is exercised over, through and against these calculative agencies by a variety of actors in order to build their position in the socially responsible investment market. Our results complement the broader question of the ‘government of economic life’ by showing how micro-level power games interact with the macro-politics of market building through calculative agencies. In so doing, our article sheds light o...

Title: The Evolution of Organizational Diversity in Banking: Savings Banks’ Consolidation and Sector Coordination in France and Italy, 1980–2012
Author-Name: Olivier KE Butzbach
Abstract: Savings banks were a key component of the banking industry in Western European countries in the early 1980s – a distinct, not-for-profit form of banking organizations existing alongside joint-stock banks. After 1980, three decades of banking consolidation and pro-market regulatory reforms were widely expected to make savings banks disappear. Yet, in some countries at least, savings banks have survived, as persistently distinct organizational forms. Moreover, in countries as similar as France and Italy, organizational diversity as epitomized by the survival of savings banks has taken two apparently diverse routes. To solve this double puzzle, this article builds on the “new organizational synthesis” in organizational theory and on the comparative neo-institutional literature, and draws on a comparative case study analysis of savings banks consolidation in France and Italy, from 1980 to 2012. The study contributes to the literature on the co-evolution of institutions and organizations by focusing on meso-le...

Abstract: In this article, we aim to revitalize the concept of role for advancing theory on identity work in organizations. Our article makes three contributions. First, we offer a critical review of how roles have been conceptualized in studies on identities, and develop a theoretical frame for understanding how people in organizations engage in transitions within and between roles that emerge and evolve in relational interaction and mediate their identity work. Second, we operationalize this frame in a longitudinal study of an organizational change initiative focusing on strategic rebranding in an industrial firm. We elucidate how roles and identities co-evolve over time and how roles and role transitions figure in the organization-based identity work of individuals. Third, we consider the implications of viewing roles as mediators in identity work. We highlight identity-related trade-offs made by individuals when they become associated with particular roles and show how they become disillusioned as organizationa...

Title: Abductive Reasoning: How Innovators Navigate in the Labyrinth of Complex Product Innovation
Author-Name: Danielle D. Dunne
Author-Name: Deborah Dougherty
Abstract: Complex innovation processes such as drug discovery present challenges to innovators because they must proceed with limited feedback but face a system that involves enormous amounts of information and unknown interdependencies. Organizational scholars suggest that abductive reasoning fits complex situations and may address many of the challenges of complexity. Abductive reasoning is a form of reasoning that generates and evaluates hypotheses in order to make sense of puzzling facts. Existing research on abductive reasoning makes a number of important contributions, but does not explain how innovators can use abductive reasoning to formulate hypotheses for possible new products and then use these hypotheses to navigate in the labyrinth of complex product innovation. We interviewed 85 scientists and managers working in the biopharmaceutical industry and use grounded theory building to develop a new framework. Our framework identifies three social mechanisms that explain how innovators use abductive reasonin...

Title: Should Environmental Concern Pay Off? A Heideggerian Perspective
Author-Name: Mollie Painter-Morland
Author-Name: René ten Bos
Abstract: Organizations often motivate their environmental efforts by arguing that ‘good ethics is good business’. Though instrumental arguments of this nature put environmental concerns firmly on the corporate agenda, it comes at a price. Such reasoning relies on age-old fact-value distinctions, from which perspective rational subjects must gather the facts on how to treat the environment as a useful object. According to this logic, means-to-an-end relationships are the primary motivation for all action. Drawing on the insights of Martin Heidegger, we show how the preoccupation with gathering facts to justify environmental initiatives on the basis of ‘efficiency’ impoverishes our thinking about what is essential to our existence. Heidegger’s thinking allows us to appreciate how our belonging to a particular ethos orientates us in the world in meaningful ways. We therefore advocate an approach to organizational environmentalism that goes beyond ‘the business case’, without appealing to abstract normative principles...

Title: Interpretation of Multiple Institutional Logics on the Ground: Actors’ Position, their Agency and Situational Constraints in Professionalized Contexts
Author-Name: Graeme Currie
Author-Name: Dimitrios Spyridonidis
Abstract: Our study examines how interdependent actors in a professionalized context interpret the co-occurrence of a professional logic and a policy-driven logic. The empirical setting comprises two hospitals in the English National Health Service. Two issues stand out. First, our study shows that any logic is variegated and ambiguous, so policymakers and organizational managers cannot assume that they are easily blended. Second, it shows how nurse consultants exhibit agency in blending these two logics in pursuit of positional gain in professional and managerial organization. They can do so because of their ambiguous status level: in comparison to doctors, their status as nurses is low; within the nursing profession their status is high. Theoretically, by focusing upon interpretation of multiple institutional logics at the micro level, our study renders visible the agency of interpreting actors, interdependency of actors, their interpretation of institutional logics, situational context, and the effect of, and up...

Title: NGOs, Management and Development: Harnessing Counter-Hegemonic Possibilities
Author-Name: Emanuela Girei
Abstract: Over the last decade, development management thinking, tools and practices have gained a prominent position in international development. In response to recent calls to problematize development management, this article, drawing on 14 months of empirical work with a Ugandan NGO, illuminates the spread of managerialism in the indigenous NGO sector and explores whether and how management thinking and practice have shaped the work and the role of NGOs in international development. This research shows how development management orthodoxy narrows the possibility for NGOs to engage in transformative practice and in social change agendas, while it wittingly or unwittingly supports the expansion of the political and cultural hegemony of western donors.

Title: Articulating Globalization: Exploring the Bottom of the Pyramid (BOP) Terrain
Author-Name: Suparna Chatterjee
Abstract: Notwithstanding the ‘yawns of familiarity’ that globalization produces in some circles, there is little doubt that ‘globalization’ continues to provide direction and momentum to much of the present social and political configurations. With this in mind, the present study attempts to come to terms with globalization in one particular site: the much acclaimed bottom/base of the pyramid (BOP) approach. Employing Stuart Hall’s notion of articulation, I examine some of the ‘foundational’ BOP texts to understand how and to what ends globalization is constituted within the BOP project. Extrapolating from themes like markets, capitalism, poverty, and technology, the article attempts to highlight what remains unsaid and inexplicit about ‘globalization.’ At one level, the article explores the ‘metapragmatics of globalization’ (how account/talk about global phenomenon are put to use in different contexts), and, at another level, it offers a critical examination of some of the underlying themes of the BOP proposition...

Abstract: The literature on corporate social performance advocates that firms address social issues based on instrumental as well as moral rationales. While both rationales trigger initiatives to increase corporate social performance, these rest on fundamentally different and contradicting foundations. Building on the literature on organizational ambidexterity and paradox in management, we propose in this conceptual article that ambidexterity represents an important determinant of corporate social performance. We explain how firms achieve higher levels of corporate social performance through the ambidextrous ability to simultaneously pursue instrumentally and morally driven social initiatives. We distinguish between a balance dimension and a combined dimension of ambidexterity, which both enhance corporate social performance through distinct mechanisms. With the balance dimension, instrumental and moral initiatives compensate for each other – which increases the scope of corporate social performance. With the combi...

Author-Name: Michelle O’ Toole
Author-Name: Christopher Grey
Abstract: Although cultural control and resistance in organizations have been widely researched, this has invariably been within the context of paid work. This paper examines how they operate within voluntary work, using the case of the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI). Here, volunteers undertake the dangerous work of sea rescues, working for local lifeboat stations. While the RNLI deploys standard techniques of cultural control, the combination of volunteering, localism and dangerous work creates the possibility of complex and ambiguous forms of resistance to cultural control, thereby extending our understanding of these phenomena.

Author-Name: Rick Delbridge
Author-Name: Jeffrey J. Sallaz
Abstract: Organizations are spaces and places of work. In this introductory essay to the Special Issue of Organization Studies dedicated to ‘Worlds of Work’, we lay out our vision for placing the study of work and workers back at the centre of organization studies. We advance four inter-related work-world metaphors or ways of seeing organizations: as physical worlds, as worlds of hierarchy, as spaces of innovation, and as fields of actors. Research that puts work at the centre of organizational analysis, and places organization within its context of economy, politics and society, will provide important new insights into the experience of work and nature of contemporary organization. Such an agenda will be founded on both a recognition of the socially constructed nature of these phenomena and their dialectics, tracing how these tensions play out in new and hybrid forms.

Title: ‘Give It Back, George’: Network Dynamics in the Philanthropic Field
Author-Name: Mairi Maclean
Author-Name: Charles Harvey
Abstract: This paper assumes a network dynamics perspective to explore the charitable sector campaign known as ‘Give it Back, George’, which overturned a threatening tax change announced in the UK Budget 2012. We consider network activity from diverse viewpoints. Collaboration by disparate players enhanced the campaign’s legitimacy, high-status actors with a tertius iungens strategic orientation eschewing the limelight while others took centre stage. While extant research has shown how lower-status actors may profit from the networks of prominent individuals, we demonstrate that the reverse may apply. We suggest that elite actors who activate ties and bring together disconnected others are often less visible than apparent dominant actors. Social movements are not always reformist but may be deployed by elite incumbents to preserve the status quo. The story we narrate here is therefore less concerned with field transformation than with field preservation at the elite level when faced with threatening change.

Title: A Dynamic Theory of Network Failure: The Case of the Venice Film Festival and the Local Hospitality System
Author-Name: Anna Moretti
Author-Name: Francesco Zirpoli
Abstract: Organizational and sociological research dealing with network governance has mainly focused on network advantages rather than on their problems or dysfunctionalities. This focus has left the field of network failure partially unexplored. We argue that although there have been some attempts to explicitly theorize network failures, the existing explanations, which are based on structural or social conditions, are not exhaustive. In this article we report the results of our empirical investigation on an underperforming network formed by the world-famous Venice Film Festival and its local hospitality system. We inductively derive a dynamic theory of network failure premised on the interplay of the network’s static dimensions (opportunism and ignorance) and dynamic dimensions (framing and mobilizing), and the role of institutions.

Abstract: We investigate how an intermediary organization, PRADAN, introduces and promotes market-based activities in tribal villages as a means to improve the social and economic conditions of rural women and their families in two districts in India. We draw from the literature on institutional logics and focus on the strategies and activities of PRADAN – an NGO working in poor rural areas in Northern India – to show how PRADAN instrumentally used a market logic and a community logic to develop new social structures in these rural communities. Moreover, we show what effect this had on beneficiaries and their families and how difficult it has been to convince rural communities and gain their trust. On the basis of these findings we show how logics can be deployed as a means to alter institutional arrangements. We find that the simultaneous enactment of both community and market logics was critical in the development of new social structures (Self-Help Groups). Finally, we show how the introduction of market-based a...

Title: Dynamics of Social Capital: Effects of Performance Feedback on Network Change
Author-Name: Andrew Parker

Abstract: We present a theory of social capital dynamics. In particular, we examine how individuals in organizations respond to events such as performance evaluations by changing whom they interact with and the extent to which they utilize their contacts. We argue that positive performance feedback from supervisors increases levels of self-efficacy and results in the creation of new social capital as well as the increased utilization of existing social capital (i.e., forming new ties with sources of information and aid, and increasing interactions with existing contacts). In addition, negative feedback decreases self-efficacy, resulting in reallocation of social capital utilization to concentrate on a small number of existing frequently-accessed contacts (i.e., decreasing interactions with some contacts while increasing interactions with others). Our arguments highlight the role of individual agency in social capital dynamics and clarify the role that individual performance evaluations can play in the evolving stru...

Author-Name: Babita Bhatt
Abstract: While the past decade has produced a number of insights into the process of institutional change, scholars still lack a comprehensive understanding of the germinal stages of institutional entrepreneurship. More specifically, further knowledge is needed into what factors cause certain individuals to initiate norm-breaking behaviour while others continue to adhere to societal expectations. Prior work seeking to inform this question has focused either on individual-level or environmental-level explanations. Comparatively, we employ a social network perspective as a ‘meso-level’ lens into the space where actors and their environment intersect. Based upon our qualitative findings, we propose that social ties can serve as an important factor in enabling (heterophilic ties) as well as constraining (homophilic ties) institutional change. However, our data also suggest that these network forces are highly dynamic and contingent upon tie frequency, the sequencing of tie contact, and the prevailing social norms in w...

Title: A New Order of Things: Network Mechanisms of Field Evolution in the Aftermath of an Exogenous Shock
Author-Name: Leonardo Corbo
Author-Name: Raffaele Corrado
Author-Name: Simone Ferriani
Abstract: This study examines the role of a major environmental shock in triggering change in the social structure of an organizational field. Based on the longitudinal analysis of changing network configurations in the global airline industry, we explore how logics of attachment shift before, during and after an exogenous shock and how the rewiring of network ties in response to the shock may act as a countervailing force to the network dynamics that drive field stratification. Using the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 as a natural experiment, our work reveals how shocks may affect key mechanisms of network evolution thus altering tie distribution and access among members of the field. Overall this article contributes to emergent literature on field dynamics by exposing the evolution of interorganizational dynamics when external events produce unsettled times that render extant logics brittle and open prospects for change.

Abstract: In this paper, we illustrate the link between social network structures, dominant cognitive frames on network purpose and the innovative power of a network, through a mixed-method comparative analysis of two knowledge translation networks (KTNs) in the English National Health Service (NHS). Our findings illustrate several challenges for networked forms of organization linked to different manifestations of social networks (centralized/decentralized) and dominant cognitive frames (polarizing/loosely clustered). Our paper contributes a better understanding of how dominant frames on network purpose emerge alongside the development of network structure itself, and explores how this interplay between dominant frames and social networks impacts upon the collaborative work that supports the network’s innovative power.

Title: The Burden of History in the Family Business Organization
Author-Name: Daniel Hjorth
Author-Name: Alexandra Dawson
Abstract: In this article we focus on the study of history through the use of narratives, within the context of the prevalent form of organization worldwide: the family business. Specifically we consider the dilemma of the impossible gift of succession using Nietzsche’s discussion of the burden of history and paralleling the story of a family business succession with that of Shakespeare’s King Lear. This way, we seek to make a contribution to organizational studies by answering recent calls to engage more with history in studies of business organizations. By implication, the study also initiates an integration of family business studies into organization studies.

Title: Complicating Abandonment: How a Multi-Stage Theory of Abandonment Clarifies the Evolution of an Adopted Practice
Author-Name: Peter Younkin
Abstract: This article presents a process-model for the abandonment of a practice. This complements earlier research on adoption and abandonment by allowing for fluctuations in the level of commitment across time and by demonstrating the persistent role for both institutional pressure and performance-based concerns on the maintenance of a practice. It also provides a novel means for identifying differences in the method of abandonment through the introduction of a concept of decommitment. Further, it helps resolve the question of how firms respond when faced with conflicting internal and external evidence of the success of an adopted practice. Using the divestiture of unrelated business segments by 100 U.S. firms between 1970–96, I estimate post-adoption commitment to a practice and the likelihood of a given firm decommitting. I find that treating abandonment as a process clarifies the evolving role of institutional and performance-based concerns and helps identify when a given firm is more subject to either source...

Title: Emotions in Institutional Work: A Discursive Perspective
Author-Name: Johanna K. Moisander

Abstract: This article focuses on the dynamics and interplay of meaning, emotions, and power in institutional work. Based on an empirical study, we explore and elaborate on the rhetorical strategies of emotion work that institutional actors employ to mobilize emotions for discursive institutional work. In an empirical context where a powerful institutional actor is tasked with creating support and acceptance for a new political and economic institution, we identify three rhetorical strategies of emotion work: eclipsing, diverting and evoking emotions. These strategies are employed to arouse, regulate, and organize emotions that underpin legitimacy judgments and drive resistance among field constituents. We find that actors exercise influence and engage in overt forms of emotion work by evoking shame and pride to sanction and reward particular expedient ways of thinking and feeling about the new institutional arrangements. More importantly, however, the study shows that they also engage in strategies of discursive i...

Title: Medium and Message: Globalization and innovation in the production field of Indian fashion
Author-Name: Mukti Khaire
Author-Name: Erika V. Hall
Abstract: How do unconventional innovations become accepted in creative industries? To uncover the process by which conventions changed in the field of Indian fashion, we analysed the content of all 586 articles on fashion published in India’s leading fashion magazine during a 20-year period. The results of this exploratory analysis indicate that a regulatory change triggered economic liberalization in India, and the resultant globalizing forces facilitated interdiscursivity in the fashion media. As a result, the conventions of the global fashion paradigm permeated the Indian media discourse, gained acceptance, and came to co-exist with the previous “local” model of fashion and its conventions. This process increased the visibility of innovations that were previously peripheral in the field. The findings offer initial insights into the processes of change in creative industries, which are characterized as being relatively difficult to alter. The results have implications for organizational research in the areas of ...

Title: Mainstreaming Innovation in Art Worlds: Cooperative links, conventions and amphibious artists
Author-Name: Gerardo Patriotta
Author-Name: Paul M. Hirsch
Abstract: We extend Becker’s conception of art worlds to articulate the boundaries which enable and constrain innovation in art. Synthesizing network and institutional approaches to art innovation, we argue that new conventions develop through a cooperative process involving mainstreamers, mavericks, outsiders, and novices – whose interactions produce novel ways of linking artists to those who consume their products. We emphasize the role of amphibious artists in bridging mainstream and maverick social types, thereby reducing the distance between ‘outside’ and ‘inside’, and crossing the more permeable boundaries separating them. We illustrate the framework with a case of innovation in the film art world: the mainstreaming of American independent cinema.

Title: Wishing Upon a Star: How apprentice-master similarity, status and career stage affect critics’ evaluations of former apprentices in the haute cuisine industry
Author-Name: Barbara Slavich
Author-Name: Fabrizio Castellucci
Abstract: This article explores how the similarity between a master’s and former apprentice’s products influences critics’ evaluations of creative professionals’ work. Through apprenticeships with well-known masters, creative professionals manage the competing demands for novelty and familiarity typical of creative industries and find their optimal balance. To gain positive evaluations, creative workers must demonstrate their offerings’ comparability with their former master’s, yet some degrees of novelty. An analysis of international haute cuisine chefs reveals an inverted U-shaped relationship between similarity of apprentice’s and master’s products, and critics’ evaluations. Furthermore, the analysis shows that apprenticeships with high-status masters and those that occur late in the apprentice’s career change this inverted U-shaped relationship into a positive one. The article concludes by highlighting the consequences of being a mainstream or a maverick with respect to the master in the creative industry and b...

Title: Beyond ‘the Eye’ of the Beholder: Scent innovation through analogical reconfiguration
Author-Name: Gazi Islam
Author-Name: Nada Endrissat
Author-Name: Claus Noppeney
Abstract: The current paper examines analogical processes as drivers of innovation in the creative industries. Based on a longitudinal case study of a signature perfume label, we argue that analogies embody cultural schemas in diverse material modalities, a process commonly referred to as analogical schematization. We highlight the role of materiality to ground these analogical processes, bridging embodied cognition and material products. We extend knowledge in this area by showing, among perfumers, how analogies work not only vertically from idea to concrete product but also horizontally across modalities, leveraging material affordances in a process that we label analogical reconfiguration. We discuss the implications of understanding innovation as being driven by analogical processes where materiality is key in creating novel, yet seemingly familiar, products in the creative industries.

Abstract: We present the first elaboration of the field-level institutional repair work enacted by government inquiry reports into severe and protracted breaches of the institution of medicine in the English National Health Service. Our examination of the interplay between the rhetorical argumentation strategies communicated, the modes and types of institutional work conveyed, and the institutional pillars targeted for repair enhances understanding of field-level institutional repair work in three ways. First, our analysis of forensic and deliberative rhetoric reveals how these communicate aligned ethos, logos, and pathos appeals in a tactical buttressing manner that simultaneously harnesses maintenance, adapted creative and disruptive modes of institutional work. Ensuing repair work is primarily directed to the regulatory and normative pillars of the breached institution, though their consequential effects seek to realign the cultural-cognitive pillar. Second, adapted creative and disruptive modes interact to gene...

Title: Coopetition as a Paradox: Integrative Approaches in a Multi-Company, Cross-Sector Partnership
Author-Name: Lea Stadtler
Author-Name: Luk N. Van Wassenhove
Abstract: Coopetition is paradoxical in that the simultaneous cooperation and competition can give rise to important synergies as well as tensions. To circumvent these tensions, scholars primarily suggest structural, separation-centred strategies. Such strategies are helpful, but incomplete, as total separation would not allow exploitation of the synergies that coopetition may offer. Based on an in-depth case study of a pioneering multi-company, cross-sector partnership, we explore how employees cope with the remaining tensions. Illustrating employees’ sense-making processes, we show how they build on the organisational and the boundary-spanning task contexts and develop paradoxical frames. Juxtaposing the competitive and collaborative logics, these frames shape the employees’ understanding of who they are (i.e. a nested identity) and what they should do (i.e. contextual segmentation). This juxtaposition allows the employees to navigate emerging tensions by adopting both logics (i.e. integrating behaviour) and by c...

Title: Contestation about Collaboration: Discursive Boundary Work among Professions

Author-Name: Trish Reay
Abstract: We examine how professions responded to a potential change in jurisdictional boundaries by analyzing the written submissions of five professional associations in reaction to a government proposal to strengthen interprofessional collaboration, relating these responses to the professions’ field positions. We identify four foci for framing used by the professions to discursively develop their boundary claims: (1) framing the issue of interprofessional collaboration (issue framing), (2) framing of justifications for favored solutions (justifying), (3) framing the profession’s own identity (self-casting), and (4) framing other professions’ identities (altercasting). We find that professions employed these foci differently depending on two dimensions of their field positions – status and centrality. Our study contributes to the literature by identifying distinctive ways through which the foci for framing may be mobilized in situations of boundary contestation, and by theorizing how field position in terms of st...

Abstract: We examine the processes and mechanisms of translating broader field-level change to the local community, drawing on insights from the inhabited institutions perspective and community-based institutionalism. In particular, we develop the concept of linking organizations as key actors in institutional change that connect the broader field and community levels. We use multiple forms of qualitative data, collected over a two-year time frame, to study the processes of a community foundation, the ‘Rainbow Wellness Foundation’, as a linking organization that engaged five community coalitions to embed a new wellness approach, locally. Our findings suggest that linking organizations interpret the central tenets of the approach, define them locally around relevant aims, and regulate community organizations’ adherence, to ensure legitimacy with the field. In addition, by engaging and negotiating with the community and helping manage ambiguity, linking organizations enable local ‘filling-in’ of these models with pra...

Title: Organizations and Violence: The Child as Abject-Boundary in Ireland’s Industrial Schools
Author-Name: Kate Kenny
Abstract: What role do organizations play in the enactment of large-scale violence against a specific group of people? In this paper, I depart from existing literature that focuses on violence within organizations, and instead emphasize the influence of external actors. Specifically, I examine the ways in which supporting organizations can first legitimate, and then actively maintain, violence against a group of vulnerable people. Drawing upon a unique, recently-published archive of data, these ideas are developed through an analysis of a case study in which large-scale violence was carried out on a vulnerable group: Ireland’s industrial school children. I draw on Kristeva’s notion of abjection to show how an excluded, distasteful ‘other’ is discursively co-constructed such that violence is seen as acceptable, and then actively maintained in the abject position as a boundary object that encompasses shared meanings across different organizations. Contributions include a framework for understanding the role of organi...

Title: ‘Fantasy of Fusion’ as a Response to Trauma: European Leaders and the Origins of the Eurozone Crisis
Author-Name: Mark Stein
Abstract: In this paper I explore a new approach to the understanding of trauma. I call into question the widely held assumption that trauma tends to engender feelings of dejection, lethargy and helplessness. Instead, I argue that it can lead to a quite different, active and over-optimistic response that involves an attempt at fusion with those who have inflicted, or might yet inflict, trauma. Drawing on concepts from psychoanalysis, I introduce the term ‘fantasy of fusion’ to encapsulate this idea. This concept is illustrated by an examination of the role of European leaders in the crucial decision to launch the single currency, and an exploration of its ramifications in creating the conditions for the eurozone crisis. The contribution of this paper is threefold. First, calling into question the assumption that trauma leads to feelings of helplessness, this paper introduces and develops the novel idea of ‘fantasy of fusion’. Second, it sheds further light on the challenges of leadership. Third, it provides a new d...

Abstract: This paper focuses on the question of the extent to which the institutional founding environment affects organizational success after a radical institutional change. We analyse firms founded in the German Democratic Republic (GDR) that experienced the fall of the Iron Curtain in 1990 and focus on how the institutional environment of their founding period influences their failure rates. Results show that organizational failure rates vary after institutional change due to differences in institutional founding conditions. This variation is influenced by the degree of (dis)similarity between the imprinted past and the present institutional context. Discussing the time-varying effect of institutional founding conditions, we contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of imprinting and organizational failure in situations of institutional change.

Abstract: This article aims to shed light on the drivers underlying the role and scope of intentional governance of the structural dynamics of whole interorganizational networks. Prior research has distinguished networks that are emergent from networks that are orchestrated. While empirical studies have shown situations in which the role and scope of intentional governance of whole interorganizational networks has changed in time, and there is a growing interest regarding the endogenous drivers of network dynamics, the dimensions that influence intentional governance of network structure dynamics and the way this is carried out remain still to be elucidated. In order to pinpoint these drivers, we leverage the models of network structure dynamics elaborated within studies conducted at the intersection between network research and complexity science to propose a multilevel interpretive framework that clarifies the role and scope of intentional agency at different structural levels of interorganizational networks.

Abstract: This paper aims to contribute to the literature on ‘institutional maintenance work’. Focusing on the institutional disruption resulting from a regulatory project of market rationalization, it enriches the description and analysis of the specific institutional maintenance work performed by powerful actors who engage in resistance against what they perceive as a threat to their discretion. Built on an in-depth qualitative study, our case concerns an attempt to change the form of over-the-counter markets as part of a recent financial reform. The paper contributes to the expanding literature on the maintenance of institutions by suggesting, in particular, that the creation of incommensurables should be added to the list of strategies available to powerful incumbents seeking to resist institutional change. Bridging the gap between the literatures on institutional maintenance and commensuration, it also demonstrates that specific institutional changes can usefully be understood as changes in commensuration syst...

Title: Disappearing into the Object: Aesthetic Subjectivities and Organizational Control in Routine Cultural Work
Author-Name: Michael Siciliano
Abstract: Taking a labor process approach to organizations in cultural industries, this article compares expressive and routine workers (audio engineers and studio attendants) within a US music-recording organization. I describe a practical control strategy that aims to reproduce the pleasurable feel of expressive work among routine cultural workers. Because this strategy depends upon workers’ aesthetic experiences of technological objects, I term this strategy aesthetic enrollment. Drawing upon theories of aesthetic experience and Callon and Law’s enrollment processes, I theorize this strategy as a form of control. Engineers come to love their ability to express creativity at work and appear captivated by the organization’s aesthetically compelling technical artifacts (music equipment or “gear”). Among rehearsal hall attendants, management provides similar aesthetically appealing, expressive technologies. These objects afford experiences among routine staff that resemble those found in more expressive occupations,...

Abstract: The emergence and proliferation of network forms of organization has sparked interest and debate in organization studies. We have learned much about the effects of networks but our understanding of how they are formed, how they change, and how networks can themselves possess agential properties that make them complex social actants is limited. In selecting papers for this special issue, we were persuaded by arguments that our understanding of networks and their transformative power can benefit from greater attention to culture and discourse, which provide meaning and direction to network participants and are indispensable agentic resources. The special issue contains two sets of papers. The first set debates the articulation between the organized and emergent dynamics of networks and its impact on knowledge exchanges and innovation. The second set seeks to inform our understanding of the manifestations of power in network dynamics. For each section, we provide a tentative research agenda. Our hope is that...

Title: Reflexivity of Routines: An Ethnomethodological Investigation of Initial Service Encounters at Sushi Bars in Tokyo
Author-Name: Yutaka Yamauchi
Author-Name: Takeshi Hiramoto
Abstract: This study reconsiders the meaning and implications of reflexivity for the theory of routines. Due to their mundane nature, routines tend to be considered unambiguous phenomena that everyone can readily understand. The performative theory of routines has challenged this view by suggesting there is no guarantee that participants have the same understanding of a routine. Nonetheless, this theory has yet to explain how routines are possible in relation to divergent understandings. Through empirical analyses of customer-provider interactions videotaped at sushi bars, this study shows how participants themselves exhibit and use their understandings of routines within the routine performance. That is to say, understandings of a routine are a reflexive part of the routine performance. It is not necessary to assume that divergent understandings are reconciled prior to the routine performance. Reflexivity helps clarify how routines are possible without a priori shared understanding.

The article demonstrates distinct opportunities offered by practice theory in researching the multiple lines of conflict and cooperation over local organizational practices, policies and strategies that emerge in the face of global HQ demands. Extant literature concentrates on how transfer outcomes are shaped by institutional or cultural distance at the national level and inter-unit relationships, often taking the subsidiary as a unit of analysis. Therefore, intra-unit conflicts over global practice sharing are under-researched, particularly how such conflicts are shaped by actors’ differential situatedness in the immediate societal context of the subsidiary. In explicating a practice theory agenda for the study of MNCs, we contribute to an understanding of how actors’ social positioning within and outside the firm, combined with their career opportunities, shape both th...

Title: Sensemaking, Sense-Censoring and Strategic Inaction: The Discursive Enactment of Power and Politics in a Multinational Corporation
Author-Name: Andrea Whittle

Author-Name: Peter Lenney
Abstract: In this paper we contribute to knowledge of power and politics in international business by developing the understanding of the role of discourse and sensemaking in the subsidiary–headquarters relationship. Based on an ethnographic action research study in a British subsidiary of an American multinational corporation, we conduct an ethnomethodologically informed discourse analysis of the accounts, stories and metaphors through which power and politics in the subsidiary–headquarters relationship were created as social facts. We then broaden the analytic frame to trace longitudinally how these facts led the subsidiary managers to hide, dilute or restrict their ‘local sense’ from the headquarters, including their knowledge of the local market and their preferred strategic direction for the firm: a process we term sense-censoring. We reveal how the subsidiary used power and politics as reasoning procedures to decide against pursuing a preferred course of action, despite a strongly held belief to the contrary,...

Title: Knowledge Assimilation at Foreign Subsidiaries of Japanese MNCs through Political Sensegiving and Sensemaking

Author-Name: Carry Mak
Abstract: We analyse political sensegiving and sensemaking by expatriates and host country employees through exportive, contestative and integrative stages of knowledge assimilation at two China-based subsidiaries of different Japanese MNCs. Comparative case study analysis indicated that efforts by expatriates and HQ-based experts to convey, routinize and standardize home country practices during the exportive and contestative stages, while involving traditional ‘one way’ knowledge transfer, can provide a foundation for a subsequent integrative stage, during which host country employees’ locally embedded knowledge is assimilated despite geopolitical asymmetry between home and host countries. Without this foundation, knowledge assimilation can remain ‘frozen’ at the contestative stage, with host country employees resisting importation of good practices from the HQ, and expatriates marginalizing host country employees’ contributions unless these are exceptionally compelling.

Title: Stereotype-Based Managerial Identity Work in Multinational Corporations
Author-Name: Alexei Koveshnikov
Author-Name: Eero Vaara

Abstract: The paper advances our understanding of managerial identity work in the context of HQ–subsidiary relations. We argue that a key part of this identity work is related to cultural stereotypes. On the basis of an analysis of two Finland-based MNCs operating in Russia, the paper elucidates three forms of stereotype-based identity work with enabling or constraining power implications. The first form, stereotypical talk, refers to identity work whereby managers enact their stereotypical conceptions of ‘the other’ to bolster their self-image and ‘inferiorize’ ‘the other’. The second form, reactive talk, is identity work that emerges as a reaction to stereotypical talk whereby managers aim at renegotiating the proposed social arrangement for their own benefit. Finally, the third form, self-reflexive talk, refers to identity work whereby managers attempt to go beyond the social arrangement produced through stereotypical and reactive talk by distancing themselves in a self-reflexive manner from essentialist cultura...

Title: Subsidiary Initiative Taking in Multinational Corporations: The Relationship between Power and Issue Selling

Author-Name: Jens Gammelgaard
Abstract: This paper investigates the political maneuvering that accompanies subsidiary initiative taking in multinational corporations. On the basis of an explorative empirical investigation of subsidiary initiative taking in the French subsidiaries of six German MNCs, the paper explores the activities that subsidiaries undertake to sell their initiatives, and the relationships among issue selling, subsidiary power and headquarters’ hierarchical power. The findings suggest that the use of issue-selling tactics is common when subsidiaries engage in initiative taking. In addition, the paper demonstrates that a low degree of issue selling is needed to obtain approval of an initiative in less asymmetrical headquarters–subsidiary power relationships (i.e. relationships in which subsidiaries are relatively powerful). In cases where power relationships are highly asymmetrical, issue selling is a necessity, but it is hardly a sufficient condition for obtaining headquarters’ approval. This renders issue selling to a second...

Title: The Network Firm as a Political Coalition
Author-Name: Josh Whitford
Author-Name: Francesco Zirpoli
Abstract: The article uses a qualitative case study of fifteen years in the production network that revolves about Fiat Auto to depict the “network firm” as a political coalition. The analysis touches on Fiat’s radical outsourcing of production in the 1990s, a short-lived and ill-fated alliance with General Motors in 2001, a descent to the brink of bankruptcy in 2004, a return to profitability by 2007, and, finally, the acquisition of control of Chrysler in 2009. The article reconstructs James March’s classic Carnegie model of the firm in light of the blurring of organizational boundaries. By marrying that model with ideas drawn from the literatures on organizational networks, social movements, and organizational politics, the article demonstrates that strategic decision-making at Fiat and at key suppliers shaped, and was shaped by, an interplay of frames and relational embedding within and across organizational boundaries. This shows how coalitional politics shape and are shaped by the shifting boundaries of the f...

Author-Name: Phillip H. Kim

Abstract: Our study explores the discursive strategies of legitimation that organizations employ as they occupy different positions in an emergent institutional field. By examining both the frame-alignment strategies and the frame targets of two organizations in the U.S. wireless telegraphy field, we show how an organization’s position – and its positional changes over time – affects the discursive strategies it uses to promote or protect its goals in the face of pressure from other field actors. Our results indicate that three distinct field positions – peripheral, central, and niche – are associated with three different legitimation strategies – which we label “robust,” “co-optive,” and “focused” – around which the discursive strategies coalesced. Organizations at the periphery attempt to break in to a field by employing a diverse range of frame-alignment strategies targeted toward a variety of relevant field actors. Those in a central position target fewer actors, but pursue a similar variety of frame-alignment ...

Title: Intermediary Organisations and the Hegemonisation of Social Entrepreneurship: Fantasmatic Articulations, Constitutive Quiescences, and Moments of Indeterminacy
Author-Name: Pascal Dey
Author-Name: Hanna Schneider
Author-Name: Florentine Maier
Abstract: The rapid rise of alternative organisations such as social enterprises is largely due to the promotional activities of intermediary organisations. So far, little is known about the affective nature of such activities. The present article thus investigates how intermediary organisations make social entrepreneurship palatable for a broader audience by establishing it as an object of desire. Drawing on affect-oriented extensions of Laclau and Mouffe’s poststructuralist theory, hegemonisation is suggested as a way of understanding how social entrepreneurship is articulated through a complementary process of signification and affective investment. Specifically, by examining Austrian intermediaries, we show how social entrepreneurship is endowed with a sense of affective thrust that is based on three interlocking dynamics: the articulation of fantasies such as ‘inclusive exclusiveness’, ‘large-scale social change’ and ‘pragmatic solutions’; the repression of anxiety-provoking and contentious issues (constitutiv...

Title: Bringing History into the Study of Routines: Contextualizing Performance
Author-Name: Alistair Mutch
Abstract: The focus on routines as ‘generative systems’ often portrays them as patterns of action relatively divorced from their context. History can help to supply a deeper and richer context, showing how routines are connected to broader structural and cultural factors. But it also shows that routines themselves have a history. This is explored using the illustration of the history of one particular organizational routine, that of the visitation of local organizational units by central church bodies, in three times and places: 15th century Italy, 18th century England and 18th century Scotland. This illustration shows that similar routines can be found but these are given very different inflections by the broader social, cultural and political context. Attention is drawn in particular to the differential involvement of lay actors and the implications for broader impacts. The case is made for analytical narratives of emergence of routines which can reconnect organizational routines both with their own history and w...

Title: Are We Sucked into Fairy Tale Roles? Role Archetypes in Imagination and Organization
Author-Name: Paul Moxnes

Abstract: This research is an attempt to understand and measure mythological roles in attributional processes. Drawing upon Carl Jung’s work on the archetype we, first, argue how role archetypes from fantasy dramas and worldwide fairy tales populate organizational life, and further, contend that they have extensive influence on how group members sort their judgments of each other. In the second part of the article, our understanding of role archetypes is aided by quantitative measurements: participants in 31 consecutive leadership development classes are asked which fellow classmates they spontaneously associate with each of seven good and seven bad fairy tale roles (deep roles), if any. Our main question is to evaluate the magnitude of agreement on the assignment of roles. Results give strong support to the assumption that group members quite easily categorize fellow members into stereotypes identified by fairy tale roles. Given the evidence in the present analysis, we posit that the role imagoes most frequently a...

Title: Ruin and Organization Studies
Author-Name: Christian De Cock
Author-Name: Damian O’Doherty
Abstract: In this paper we offer a preliminary study of the various ways in which ‘ruin’ has significance for organization studies. One important motif associated with both modern and romantic treatments of ruins concerns the revelatory impressions they make. In this respect the tradition of ruin writing will talk of their ‘beauty’, their ‘strangeness’ or their capacity to ‘intimidate’, which somehow never fails to strike a responsive nerve in us. In order to attend to this elusive phenomenon we must necessarily breach some of the self-imposed boundaries of our ‘discipline’. Taking up this challenge we follow W. G. Sebald in his use of contiguity as both method and textual structuring device, allowing us to drift across iconic ruin images, ruin theories and our own ruinous research experiences. This helps us learn how to ‘dwell’ in the ruin – without any impatient reaching after fact or explaining away ruins in the terms of an established tradition of theorizing in organization – and open up new analytic spaces and...

Title: Integrating Dialectical and Paradox Perspectives on Managing Contradictions in Organizations

Abstract: We present a typology and process model that integrate dialectical and paradox perspectives on managing contradictions in organizations. Whereas paradox research depicts tensions between contradictory elements as irreconcilable and best managed through acceptance and synergy, the dialectical perspective portrays the relationship of such elements as adversarial and transformed through conflict. Our integrated typology and process model account for both dialectical and paradox approaches to managing contradictions and also identify two approaches, assimilation and adjustment, which combine the two. The model also identifies a key contingency, the expected distribution of power between contradictory elements, as a key influence on actors’ approaches to managing contradictions. For paradox researchers our integrated model emphasizes the need for more attention to the political, institutional, and social contexts of contradictions, practices for managing conflict, and transformation of organizational contradic...

Title: Becoming Salient: The TMT Leader’s Role in Shaping the Interpretive Context of Paradoxical Tensions
Author-Name: Eric Knight
Author-Name: Sotirios Paroutis
Abstract: How do paradoxical tensions become salient in organizations over time? Ambidexterity and paradox studies have, thus far, primarily focused on how tensions inside organizations are managed after they have been rendered salient for actors. Using a longitudinal, embedded case study of four strategic business units within a media organization, we theorize the role of the top management team leader’s practices in enabling tensions to become salient for their respective lower-level managers when there are initial differences in how tensions are interpreted across levels. Our findings extend a dynamic equilibrium model of organizing by adding interpretive context as an enabling condition that shapes the emergence of salience through the provision of a constellation of cues that guide sensemaking. Informed by a practice-based perspective on paradox, we also contribute a conceptual model of leadership as practice, and outline the implications for ambidexterity studies.

Title: Knots in the Discourse of Innovation: Investigating multiple tensions in a reacquired spin-off
Author-Name: Mathew L. Sheep
Author-Name: Gail T. Fairhurst
Author-Name: Shalini Khazanchi
Abstract: We examine the case of a corporate spin-off, in which its reacquisition by the parent firm radically changed its structure and culture. Employing a discourse lens, we study paradoxical tensions of innovation as key members “talk into being” the paradoxical circumstances of their environment. From our analysis, we develop the concept of tensional “knots,” discursive formulations in which members construct tensions, not only as co-occurring, but as Gordian (inseparable) entanglements of interdependence. Knotted tensions can be amplifying (exacerbating) or attenuating (improving) in their effects on one another, but with very different consequences to innovative action. Specifically, knotted tensions and the way in which members manage them set up counter-intuitive logics that serve to justify courses of innovative action or inaction. We propose a process model advancing understanding of interlinked tensions in more complex ways than current paradox theory allows. We conclude with a discussion of our contrib...

Title: We have to do this and that? You must be joking: Constructing and responding to paradox through humor
Author-Name: Paula A. Jarzabkowski
Author-Name: Jane Kirsten Lê
Abstract: This paper adopts a practice approach to paradox, examining the role of micro-practices in shaping constructions of and responses to paradox. Our approach is inductively motivated. During an ethnographic study of an organization implementing paradoxical goals we noticed a strong incidence of humor, joking, and laughter. Examining this practice closely, we realized that humor was used to surface, bring attention to, and make communicable experience of paradox in the moment by drawing out some specific contradiction in their work. Humor thus allowed actors to socially construct paradox, as well as—in interaction with others—construct potential responses to the multiple small incidences of paradox in their everyday work. In doing so, humor cast the interactional dynamics that were integral in constructing two response paths: (i) entrenching a response, whereby an existing response was affirmed, thereby continuing on a particular response path, and (ii) shifting a response, whereby actors moved from one respo...

Abstract: We studied an interprofessional collaboration to understand how professionals engaged with paradox in collective decision-making. At the beginning of our study, we observed vicious cycles in which conflict led to negative tension. Professionals were holding tightly to a particular pole of the paradox, and the higher-status pole was consistently overrepresented in collective decision-making. By the end of our study we observed the presence of virtuous cycles, where conflict led to more positive tension, and where professionals engaged in collective decision-making with more equal representation of conflicting approaches. We call this change process protecting the paradox and we identify three strategies that support this process: (1) promoting equality of both poles, (2) strengthening the weaker pole, and (3) looking beyond the paradox by focusing on desired outcomes. We contribute to the paradox literature by showing how vicious cycles can be shifted to virtuous cycles, how professionals and managers can ...

Title: Anger and Organization Studies: From Social Disorder to Moral Order
Author-Name: Dirk Lindebaum
Author-Name: Yiannis Gabriel
Abstract: In this essay, we oppose current conceptualizations of anger as, at least, a temporary individual psychological disorder and as the cause of a social disorder. We develop the view that anger can be a profoundly moral emotion aimed at maintaining moral order and restoring social order when this has been ruptured. Moral anger is distinguished from other types of anger, like the ones arising from routine frustration, break-downs of communication and ego violations. Through a close reading of the jury drama Twelve Angry Men, we demonstrate that moral anger has an information dimension, signaling a rupture of a moral code, as well as an energic dimension, as a source of energy aimed at putting right a wrong. We conclude that a world without anger would be, possibly, a compliant and quiescent world but not a just world.

Title: Boredom and Organization Studies
Author-Name: Rasmus Johnsen
Abstract: Even if people may always have been bored, ‘boredom’ as a phenomenon is not a universal feature of human existence. Rather it is deeply connected to organization as a reaction to the gradual emergence in Western culture of the management and administration of time. As an acquired capacity of those able to tell and endure time in an organized manner, boredom is a perceived loss of meaning inferred by the lived experience of a discrepancy between the involvement with transient means in everyday life and their value in a larger vision of existence. But boredom also signifies a concurrent protest against such a loss, which potentially leads new possibilities with it. In this essay, I explore the connection between boredom and organization, focusing on these two interrelated aspects of the phenomenon: how boredom can be understood as an experience of a loss of meaning, but also how this loss itself can be viewed as an imperative towards meaning that remains the source of new forms of organizing.

Abstract: Organization theorists have predominantly studied identity and organizing within the managed work organization. This frames organization as a structure within which identity work occurs, often as a means of managerial control. In our paper our contribution is to develop the concept of individuation pursued through prefigurative practices within alternative organizing to reframe this relation. We combine recent scholarship on alternative organizations and new social movements to provide a theoretical grounding for an ethnographic study of the prefigurative organizing practices and related identity work of an alternative group in a UK city. We argue that in such groups, identity, organizing and politics become a purposeful set of integrated processes aimed at the creation of new forms of life in the here and now, thus organizing is politics is identity. Our study presents a number of challenges and possibilities to scholars of organization, enabling them to extend their understanding of organization and ide...

Title: Democratic Business Ethics: Volkswagen’s Emissions Scandal and the Disruption of Corporate Sovereignty
Author-Name: Carl Rhodes
Abstract: There is an established body of politically informed scholarly work that offers a sustained critique of how corporate business ethics is a form of organizing that acts as a subterfuge to facilitate the expansion of corporate sovereignty. This paper contributes to that work by using its critique as the basis for theorizing an alternative form of ethics for corporations. Using the case of the 2015 Volkswagen emissions scandal as an illustrative example, the paper theorizes an ethics that locates corporations in the democratic sphere so as to defy their professed ability to organize ethics in a self-sufficient and autonomous manner. The Volkswagen scandal shows how established organizational practices of corporate business ethics are no barrier to, and can even serve to enable, the rampant pursuit of business self-interest through well-orchestrated and large-scale conspiracies involving lying, cheating, fraud and lawlessness. The case also shows how society, represented by individuals and institutions, is ab...

Abstract: Drawing on the relational perspective of artistic innovation, which suggests that different types of ties (weak vs. strong) lead to different outcomes in terms of the development and implementation of new artistic ideas, this study uses an in-depth case study of Italian choreographer Mauro Bigonzetti to explore the role of the relational work artists deploy to develop and implement their artwork. We investigate how artists engage in specific relational actions (broadening, bonding, embedding and dis-embedding) with producing organizations, and how these actions lead to innovation over time. The findings suggest that artistic innovation moves through four stages – proximal innovation, fuzzy innovation, established innovation and maintained innovation – sustained by an artist’s oscillation between a network characterized by strong ties with few organizations and a network characterized by weak ties with many organizations, depending on the artist’s quests for inclusion and differentiation. In this process, ...

Abstract: Creative industries are among the fastest-growing and most important sectors of European and North American economies. Their growth depends on continuous innovation, which is important in many industries and also challenging to manage because of inherent tensions. Creative industries, similar to many industries, depend not only on novelty to attract consumers, but also on familiarity to aid comprehension and stabilize demand for cultural products. Agents in the creative industries play with these tensions, generating novelty that shifts industries’ labels and boundaries. This tension and agency makes them a valuable setting for advancing theoretical ideas on who drives innovation, from mavericks that challenge conventions to mainstreams that build upon them. We trace this history and then turn to the five papers in the special issue, which examine in depth how mavericks, misfits, mainstreams and amphibians in various creative domains, from artistic perfumery to choreography, engage with innovation and add...

Title: Trusted to Deceive: A Case Study of ‘Strategic Deception’ and the Normalization of Lying at Work
Author-Name: Sarah Jenkins
Author-Name: Rick Delbridge
Abstract: Lying is an endemic feature of social life but has remained under-researched in organization studies. This paper examines the case of VoiceTel, a market leader in the high-quality virtual reception business that practised ‘strategic deception’ (Patwardhan et al., 2009). Receptionists concealed that they were not physically located in their clients’ premises and lying was an intrinsic and enduring feature of their work. We adapt and extend Ashforth and Anand’s (2003) ‘normalization of corruption’ framework to develop a new model of the ‘normalization of lying’. We examine how lying becomes institutionalized, rationalized and socialized into the structure and culture of an organization such that it becomes embedded, maintained and strengthened over time as a legitimate and integral part of the job. Our model of normalization integrates organizational and group levels to examine the significance and interaction of ‘bottom-up’ as well as ‘top-down’ processes. Employees gained recognition from their proficienc...

Title: Identity Paradoxes: How Senior Managers and Employees Negotiate Similarity and Distinctiveness Tensions over Time
Author-Name: Suresh Cuganesan
Abstract: Employee identity is shaped by a need to feel similarity to, as well as distinctiveness from, others in organizations. While this paradoxical tension is important we know little about how it is managed over time, especially when senior managers prioritize one element of the paradox over the other. Consequently I investigate how senior managers and employees negotiate the similarity–distinctiveness identity paradox over time, doing so through a longitudinal case study of a police organization undergoing change. The study contributes to prior paradox literature in two significant ways. First, it reveals how senior managers and employees negotiate tensions in employee identity between similarity and distinctiveness as an emergent and cyclical process of identity regulation and heterogeneous identity work. This shows how the balance between similarity and distinctiveness is both elusive to achieve for all organizational participants and difficult to sustain over time. Second, it highlights how defensive appro...

Title: The Interplay between Intuition and Rationality in Strategic Decision Making: A Paradox Perspective
Author-Name: Giulia Calabretta
Author-Name: Gerda Gemser
Author-Name: Nachoem M. Wijnberg
Abstract: Both intuition and rationality can play important roles in strategic decision making. However, a framework that specifically accounts for the interplay between intuition and rationality is still missing. This study addresses this gap by using a paradox lens and conceptualizes the intuition–rationality duality as a paradoxical tension. We draw on seven case studies of innovation projects to empirically derive a three-step process for managing this intuition–rationality tension through paradoxical thinking. Our empirical data suggest that management of the tension starts with preparing the ground for paradoxical thinking by creating managerial acceptance for the contradictory elements of rational and intuitive approaches to decision making. The process then continues by developing decision-making outcomes through the integration of intuitive and rational practices. Finally, the outcomes of paradoxical thinking are embedded into the organizational context. For each step of the model, we indicate a set of pra...

Title: On Bandit Organizations and Their (IL)Legitimacy: Concept Development and Illustration
Author-Name: Carl Cederström
Author-Name: Peter Fleming
Abstract: Outlaw organizations are neglected in organization studies. This is understandable given the presumption of illegitimacy they attract. Our article challenges the presumption by positing the concept of ‘bandit organizations’, demonstrating how some can build impressive levels of legitimacy among their audience. The case of Christopher ‘Dudas’ Coke, a philanthropic Jamaican drug cartel leader, and his ‘Shower Posse’ gang, is used to investigate how contemporary bandit organizations foster legitimacy. By placing ‘shadow economy’ organizations like this in the spotlight, we seek to extend scholarship on organizational legitimacy, while avoiding any undue romanticization of criminal organizations.

Title: Translating Institutional Logics: When the Media Logic Meets Professions
Author-Name: Josef Pallas
Author-Name: Magnus Fredriksson
Author-Name: Linda Wedlin
Abstract: This article presents results from a case study of media activities in a Swedish governmental agency where we illustrate a) how the media logic is translated and become embedded in the studied agency, and b) how different professional groups inside the organization shape the translation process. Theoretically we do this by re-visiting the notion of translation. Translation theory focuses on the local enactment and embeddedness of institutional models, ideals and practices. Institutional logics literature, on the other hand, focuses on the creation and flow of field-level meaning systems. By combining these two theoretical perspectives we are able to form a framework for understanding the local embeddedness and enactment of field-level institutional logics. The result of our study suggests that institutional logics – once they become introduced in a given context – consist of four elements that are interpreted and enacted differently inside organizations. We identify three local, profession-based value sys...

Title: Transcendence through Rhetorical Practices: Responding to Paradox in the Science Sector
Author-Name: Rebecca Bednarek
Author-Name: Sotirios Paroutis
Author-Name: John Sillince
Abstract: Organizations are often required to meet contradictory but interrelated objectives. An important response to such paradoxes is transcendence: the ability to view both poles of the paradox as necessary and complementary. Despite the centrality of transcendence to existing frameworks within the paradox literature, we still know little about its practice. We address this gap by surfacing and analysing rhetorical practices across three science organizations. We outline four rhetorical practices that constitute transcendence (Ordering, Aspiring, Signifying, and Embodying) as well as the underlying features of these practices that explain how they construct a response to paradox. In particular, we show that transcendence entailed balancing the enabling features of focus (paradoxical content/context), time (stability/change) and distance (maintaining/reducing). Finally, we develop a dynamic view of transcendence as a process of oscillation, showing how these practices are bundled together and interrelate to cons...

Title: In the Shadows of Time: A Case Study of Flexibility Behaviors in an Interorganizational Project
Author-Name: Rik Ligthart
Author-Name: Leon Oerlemans
Author-Name: Niels Noorderhaven
Abstract: We use a longitudinal examination of the production of a complex vessel to develop theory concerning operational flexibility behaviors within interorganizational projects. We find that operational flexibility behaviors are enabled by trust between project participants, sense of urgency, and the availability of resources. These enablers are in turn positively influenced by positive experiences in previous interactions (“shadow of the past”) and expectations of possible future collaboration (“shadow of the future”), the temporary nature of interorganizational projects and slack in project tasks, respectively. The positive effect of enablers on operational flexibility is weakened by the time pressure project participants experience. The latter is also caused by the temporariness of interorganizational projects. Based on our findings, we propose that the different time dimensions play a crucial role in explaining flexibility behaviors in interorganizational projects: the temporariness that is an essential cha...

Title: Trust, Reciprocity, and Actions: The Development of Trust in Temporary Inter-organizational Relations
Author-Name: Anna Swärd
Abstract: This paper focuses on the development of trust in temporary inter-organizational relations. One specific form of such relations is public construction projects established by competitive tendering. In this context, previous studies have suggested that the shadow of the future only moderates behavior to a limited extent and trust may seem hard to come by. The present in-depth case study adds to the theorizing of trust dynamics by demonstrating that reciprocal norms at the industry level, as well as reciprocal norms developing during project execution, contribute to the development of trust. The study connects trust, reciprocity, and actions, giving insight into the interplay between trust and reciprocity, the interplay between reciprocal norms at the industry level and the project level, and the role of small and large actions in the trust process.

Abstract: Recent studies of temporary organizing and project-based work explain how organizational actors establish and maintain clear role structures and harmonious relations in the face of precariousness by engaging in stabilizing work practices. This focus upon ‘order’ undervalues conflict-ridden negotiations and power struggles in temporary organizing. This paper demonstrates that in temporary organizing conflict and order may exist in tandem. Drawing close to the collaborative dynamics in a large-scale global project, we analyse the political struggles over role patterns and hierarchic positioning of client and agent in the temporary organization of the Panama Canal Expansion Program (PCEP). In such projects, the agent typically takes the position of project leader. In this case however, the client was formally in charge, while the agent was assigned the role of coach and mentor. The diffuse hierarchy triggered project partners to engage in both harmony-seeking social and discursive practices and to enter into...

Title: To Continue or not to Continue? Drivers of Recurrent Partnering in Temporary Organizations
Author-Name: Mark Ebers
Author-Name: Indre Maurer
Abstract: While research has provided ample evidence that temporal (dis-)continuity in partnering is highly consequential for the governance and performance outcomes of temporary organizations, we know much less about the conditions that drive the members of temporary organizations to engage in recurrent partnering. Focusing on project organizations, the present research offers theoretical arguments and related empirical evidence that illuminate when and why project-leading organizations expect to continue collaboration with the same project partner in future projects. Specifically, we show that expectations of recurrent collaboration are a function of backward-looking experiential learning and forward-looking opportunity cost assessments. Our findings contribute to better understanding of temporality in temporary organizations by uncovering a set of factors conducive to explaining when and why the same partners engage in temporary sequences of projects.

Title: The Anthropophagic Organization: How Innovations Transcend the Temporary in a Project-based Organization
Author-Name: Patricia Prado
Author-Name: Jonathan Sapsed
Abstract: This article shows how innovations in projects may be diffused successfully within a large project-based organization (PBO) and how they ‘live on’ through their adaptation. We draw on the metaphorical notion of anthropophagy, literally ‘human cannibalism’, which is used to explain the appropriation of otherness resulting in ongoing organizational life. Prior organization literature has stressed the difficulties of the transition from the temporary to the permanent, especially the failure of database-oriented approaches, and argued that these barriers may be overcome with repeatable standardized templates. In contrast we show that multiple innovations may be adopted within the same PBO, which manifest as differentiated, combined forms. Cases in the large energy and engineering company, Petrobras, show a systematic innovation process involving subject experts, but centrally a database containing records of 1104 mandatory and discretionary innovations. The article analyses these data, process documentation a...

Abstract: This paper investigates the relationship between a permanent organization and a series of temporary organizations. It draws on an in-depth study of the process through which a Danish film production company, seeking to balance innovation and persistence in a troubled industry, struggles to realize a novel children’s film and its sequels. The study reveals tensions at different levels as well as boundary work and boundary roles that address them, bringing in shadows of past and future projects. The study extends the understanding of the dialectic between temporary and permanent organizing by emphasizing how ongoing work at different boundaries affects the permanent and temporary organizing’s connectedness and outcomes. It also challenges the overly bracketed view of temporary organizations, suggesting a temporality perspective on temporariness.

Author-Name: Joost Luyckx

Abstract: In this study, we explicitly engage with the historical dimension of discursive legitimation to understand how a sense of legitimacy is maintained for a controversial actor over a long period of time. Analyzing articles in The Economist that address opposition against multinational corporations during the current wave of globalization, we identify and situate the different multinational corporation-related controversies and discursive legitimation strategies in their specific historical context. Our historical interpretation suggests three phases, each representing the discursive creation of particular actor images that either legitimize multinational corporations or de-legitimize its opponents. From our findings, we propose that, over time, the nature of discursive legitimation changes and introduce ‘discursive antagonism’ and ‘discursive co-optation’ as two different forms of legitimation. We further reflect on our present understanding of multinational corporations, reinterpreting their current politic...

Title: Englishization, Identity Regulation and Imperialism
Author-Name: Mehdi Boussebaa
Author-Name: Andrew D. Brown
Abstract: What are the power/identity implications of the increasing Englishization of non-Anglophone workplaces around the world? We address this question using an analytical framework that combines a focus on micro/meso-level processes of identity regulation with attentiveness to the macro-level discourse of English as a global language. Drawing on reflexive fieldwork conducted at a major French university, we show how Englishization is bound up with processes of normalization, surveillance and conformist identity work that serve to discipline local selves in line with the imperative of international competitiveness. Concomitantly, we also show that Englishization is not a totalizing form of identity regulation; it is contested, complained about and appropriated in the creative identity work of those subject to it. Yet, moving from the micro/meso- to the macro-level, we argue that Englishization is ultimately ‘remaking’ locals as Anglophones through a quasi-voluntary process of imperialism in the context of a US-...

Title: ‘It Sends a Cold Shiver down my Spine’: Ghostly Interruptions to Strategy Implementation
Author-Name: Justine Grønbæk Pors
Abstract: This paper offers new theoretical and empirical understanding of interruptions to strategy implementation by drawing attention to their ghostly nature. The paper proposes a theoretical framework for thinking about the ghostly by combining Freud’s concept of the uncanny with theorizing in cultural geography on collapses of linear time as well as with Avery Gordon’s sociological work on ghostly matters. Empirically, the paper examines the ghostly nature of strategy interruptions through a detailed analysis of conversations between middle managers at a strategy seminar in a Danish local government. I portray the uncanny moments where the familiar account of organizational purposes is not so self-evident anymore, but all of a sudden appears rather disturbing. I show how middle managers envision other, darker futures and express the feeling that something else, something different from before, must be done, although they cannot say exactly what. Going beyond previous accounts of strategy interruption, for exam...

Title: When Bureaucracy Meets the Crowd: Studying “Open Government” in the Vienna City Administration
Author-Name: Martin Kornberger
Author-Name: Renate E. Meyer
Author-Name: Christof Brandtner
Author-Name: Markus A. Höllerer
Abstract: Open Government is en vogue, yet vague: while practitioners, policy-makers, and others praise its virtues, little is known about how Open Government relates to bureaucratic organization. This paper presents insights from a qualitative investigation into the City of Vienna, Austria. It demonstrates how the encounter between the city administration and “the open” juxtaposes the decentralizing principles of the crowd, such as transparency, participation, and distributed cognition, with the centralizing principles of bureaucracy, such as secrecy, expert knowledge, written files, and rules. The paper explores how this theoretical conundrum is played out and how senior city managers perceive Open Government in relation to the bureaucratic nature of their administration. The purpose of this paper is twofold: first, to empirically trace the complexities of the encounter between bureaucracy and Open Government; and second, to critically theorize the ongoing rationalization of public administration in spite of cons...

Title: Whistleblowing, Parrhesia and the Contestation of Truth in the Workplace
Author-Name: Richard Weiskopf
Author-Name: Yvonne Tobias-Miersch
Abstract: In this paper, we develop an approach to the study of whistleblowing as a critical practice that is involved in the contestation of truth and power in the workplace. We situate our analysis in the context of practice-based thinking and specify the social practice of whistleblowing with reference to Michel Foucault’s concept of ‘parrhesia’ (frank speech). We then introduce the case of Guido Strack, a former European Union official who worked as section leader at the Office des Publications Officielles des Communautés Européenne from 1995 to 2002. Strack spoke out against malpractice in the EU in 2001 and officially reported alleged financial misconduct in 2002. In our analysis, we focus on the interplay between and effects of different modes of truth-telling in the context of this specific organization – a context marked by the uneasy coexistence of different normative and discursive frames. We argue that the parrhesiastic modality of truth-telling threatens the established ‘working solutions’ that reconci...

Abstract: Recently, the state and future of organization theory have been widely debated. In this Perspectives issue, we aim to contribute to these debates by suggesting that organizational scholarship may benefit from greater understanding and consideration of societal institutions and their effects on the collective organizing of work. We also illustrate that the literature on comparative institutionalism, a strand of institutional thought with a rich tradition within Organization Studies, provides useful insights into these relations. We highlight several of these insights and briefly introduce the articles collected in the associated Perspectives issue of Organization Studies on comparative institutionalism1. We end with a call for greater cross-fertilization between comparative institutionalism and organization theory at large.

Author-Name: Ram Mudambi
Abstract: The study of power and politics in multinational companies (MNCs) has been a niche area of study for both scholars of organization studies (OS) and international business (IB). Further, the awareness of each research community with regard to the efforts of the other has been rather superficial. Hence, bridge-building efforts to cross-fertilize ideas developed in IB and OS in order to enhance our understanding of the nature and role of politics and power in the MNC are overdue. In order to develop the basis for integration, we trace the conceptual developments in the two disciplines, that enables us to highlight particularly promising opportunities for integrative advances. Using a typology which differentiates among four ‘faces’ of power in the study of management and organization, we discuss how focusing on each of these four dimensions may help us to both see and make sense of different aspects of power relations and facets of politics in MNCs. We then use the ‘four faces’ framework to outline how OS an...

Abstract: The relationship between the temporary and the permanent is a central issue in studies of temporary organizing. Recent research highlights that projects, as key forms of temporary organizations, both constitute and are constituted by their wider institutional contexts. However, there is still a lack of more detailed understanding of the actors and their activities through which projects produce and advance institutional change. To address this issue, we draw on extensive fieldwork to study the activities that constitute establishment of the Innovation University. This endeavour gained the status of a spearhead project and advanced nationwide university reform in one northern European country. Our central contribution is two-fold. We sediment a more robust approach to institutions within project literature by defining them as widely shared beliefs and practices that actors enact and (re)produce through their various activities. On this basis, we develop a model of an institutional project for regulative ch...

Title: The Paradox of Controversial Innovation: Insights From the Rise of Impressionism
Author-Name: Hélène Delacour
Author-Name: Bernard Leca
Abstract: This article considers the strategies developed by a coalition of innovators and supporters to contribute to the consecration of a controversial innovation that transgresses the established codes. It does so through the analysis of Impressionism (1874–1900) that provoked a dramatic shift from classical to modern art. The case study suggests that such consecration can be achieved while claiming the distinctiveness of the controversial innovation, instead of toning it down. The findings reveal the importance of distributed strategies developed by loosely coordinated coalition members. More specifically, they point to simultaneous, and potentially contradictory, strategies: strategies aimed to enforce the distinctiveness of this controversial innovation, and strategies aimed to extend support for it, insisting that contradictory tensions between those strategies can prove useful in achieving consecration. Overall, the article contributes to research on the consecration of controversial innovations, as well a...

Title: ‘Brand-Centred Control’: A Study of Internal Branding and Normative Control
Author-Name: Monika Müller
Abstract: In this article I present brand-centred control as a new form of normative control and examine the ways in which it affects employees. To do so, I draw on the results of a qualitative case study of a consumer products company with a strong corporate culture and brand, and examine internal branding as an extension of culture management. The key insights of the case study show that brand-centred control – unlike traditional normative control that typically works inside the company – also engages an external audience (customers, fans, and the wider public) as an additional source of normative control. As employees internalise the brand image of this external audience, they turn into brand representatives even in absence of face-to-face interactions with others and in their private lives. Brand-centred control thus blurs the boundaries between work and employees’ private lives in unprecedented ways. I discuss the ways in which employees respond to and resist brand-centred control and point to further research...

Title: The Gentle Art of Retroduction: Critical Realism, Cultural Political Economy and Critical Grounded Theory
Author-Name: Claes Belfrage
Author-Name: Felix Hauf
Abstract: This article, first, proposes critical grounded theory (CGT) as a way to develop systematically an array of methods and theoretical propositions into a coherent critical methodology for organization studies (and beyond). Second, it demonstrates CGT’s usefulness through a case study of competing recovery projects from the Icelandic financial crisis. CGT is developed in engagement with the emerging paradigm of cultural political economy (CPE) and its preferred method of critical discourse analysis (CDA). CPE analyses the evolution of ‘economic imaginaries’ in both their structural/material and semiotic/discursive dimensions. This requires a critical realist, multi-dimensional research strategy which emphasizes ethnographic methods and substantial theoretical and historical work. The proposed methodology of CGT enables a retroductive research process that combines deductive theoretical deskwork with inductive fieldwork enabled by grounded theory tools to analyse organizational process, stability and change.

Based on an understanding of colour as aesthetic force and medium of transformation, the essay presents a montage of scenes that set up encounters with what colour does: how it affects organization, and how it is affected by organization; how it organizes what is given to perception, knowledge and organization itself, and how it is reorganized in return.

Abstract: Research highlights how coexisting institutional logics can sometimes offer opportunities for agency to enterprising actors in organizational fields. But macro- and micro-level studies using this framework diverge in their approach to understanding the consequences of institutional complexity for actor autonomy, and correspondingly in the opportunities they identify for agents to resist, reinterpret or make judicious use of institutional prescriptions. This paper seeks to bridge this gap, through a longitudinal, comparative case study of the trajectories of four ostensibly similar change initiatives in the same complex organizational field. It studies the influence of three dominant institutional logics (professional, market and corporate) in these divergent trajectories, elucidating the role of mediating influences, operating below the level of the field but above that of the actor, that worked to constrain or facilitate agency. The consequence for actors was a divergent realization of the relationship b...

Title: Computer Games and Organization Studies

Abstract: Computer games and organizations are becoming increasingly interwoven in the 21st century. Sophisticated computer games connected by networks are turning into spaces for organizing. Therefore, it may not be surprising that conventional organizations are now scrounging these games for novel ways to enhance efficiency. The result is the formation of game/organization hybrids; uneasy recontextualizations of partly incompatible ideas, values and practices. We begin this essay by elucidating what it is socially that makes something a game by exploring the notion’s anthropological foundations. We then introduce two examples of actual game/organization hybrids; raiding in computer games and gamification in formal organizations. We conclude by discussing the implications of such hybridization and suggest venues for how organization and management scholars can benefit from studying computer games and theories of play.

Title: Managerial Networks and Exploration in a Professional Service Firm
Author-Name: Michelle Rogan
Author-Name: Marie Louise Mors
Abstract: A firm’s growth and survival depends on the ability of its managers to explore for new business and knowledge; yet, exploration is challenging for most large, established firms. Extending prior research into networks and exploration, we propose that a key characteristic of managers’ external networks – the extent to which their networks include relationships built using predominately individual rather than firm resources – is positively related to managers’ abilities to explore for new business and knowledge in large firms. We propose that networks with more individual ties provide more diverse knowledge, enable greater autonomy and ease access to resources from contacts, hence facilitating exploration. Analysis of an original dataset of external networks of 77 senior managers in a large global consulting firm provides support for our arguments. We find that individual ties are positively related to exploration and, furthermore, that the positive (negative) relationship between sparse (dense) networks and...

Title: Sensitivity of Alliance Termination to Prealliance Conditions: Expectation Effects of Alliance Partners
Author-Name: Jungwon Min
Abstract: Alliances are formed according to firms’ expectations about postalliance value generated by partners, which are based on certain conditions during the processes of selecting a partner and forming an alliance (i.e., the prealliance conditions). This study predicts that alliance terminations are likely to occur when such expectations are not satisfied, which is likely when partners’ postalliance characteristics are inferior to their prealliance levels, or when firms have heightened expectations of alliance partners because they have forgone superior potential partners before alliance formation. Results of an analysis using data of codeshare alliances in the global airline industry show that alliance termination results from reduced market complementarity or a reduced number of common partners relative to prealliance levels, and from the presence of not-chosen prealliance potential partners characterized by high market complementarity or large numbers of common partners. The results also show a general prope...

Title: Whistle While You Work? Disney Animation, Organizational Readiness and Gendered Subjugation
Author-Name: Martyn Griffin
Author-Name: Nancy Harding
Author-Name: Mark Learmonth
Abstract: This paper introduces the concept of ‘organizational readiness’: socio-cultural expectations about working selves that prepare young people (albeit indirectly and in complex and multi-faceted ways) for their future life in organizations. This concept emerges from an analysis of Disney animations and how they constitute expectations about working life that may influence children through their representations of work and gendered workplace roles. The paper’s exploration of Disney’s earlier animations suggests they circulated norms of gender that girls should be weak and avoid work. In contrast, its contemporary productions circulate gender norms that suggest girls should be strong and engage in paid work. In this reading, the continued circulation of earlier alongside contemporary animations may convey to young viewers a paradox: girls must and must not work; they must be both weak and strong. We thus offer new insights into the puzzle of the continued relegation of women to the sidelines in organizations; ...

Title: Tower Cranes and Organization Studies

Abstract: This is a paper about different ways of revealing materials, and a theory of organization. It moves through a kaleidoscope of perspectives which reveal the tower crane as made through its relations with a series of different ways of seeing – engineering and mathematics, capitalist economics, and a workplace labour process. It employs a wide variety of sources, including some interviews that I have done with crane drivers. I then move into an account of the modernist fascination with technology, particularly Soviet constructivism. The latter provides the theoretical scaffolding which allows me to see the crane as a temporary stabilization of structure, and structure as an arrangement of planes and lines of force which allows certain moves just as it prevents others. This is a way of saying that an adequate understanding of ‘organization’ requires thinking multiples and relations. Nodding towards Deleuze and Guattari towards the end, I suggest that cranes are good to think with for these multiple purposes, ...

Abstract: In this paper we examine the management of internal complexity in federations as a means of shedding new light on how the challenges inherent in governing these forms of inter-organizational networks are managed. Our analysis reveals that these networked organizations differed as a function of their approach to four complexity management activities: perspective shifting, shaping interactions, managing standards and constructing commitment. Based on the use of these four activities we identify three approaches to complexity management in this study – leveraging complexity, suppressing complexity and disengaging from complexity. Each of these approaches differed in their focus on differentiation or integration in the implementation of complexity management activities. We found that only leveraging complexity went beyond separate management activities aimed at differentiation or integration and employed policies and activities that possessed the capacity to optimize both simultaneously. In doing so, our stud...

Title: A Resource Dependence Perspective on Low-Power Actors Shaping Their Regulatory Environment: The Case of Honda
Author-Name: Ei Shu
Author-Name: Arie Y. Lewin
Abstract: The central focus of this paper is a largely unexplored research domain relating to how low-power for-profit actors can shape their political and regulatory environment and create economic opportunities that affect their survival and growth. The paper builds on and extends the concept of “negotiating the environment” and on how organizations create their environment, with an emphasis on low-power actors. Resource dependence theory (RDT) has been very influential in exploring the many ways in which firms can decrease or overcome resource vulnerabilities in their environment with a focus on high-power actors (large companies, resource-rich companies, industrial associations, and political power of highly endowed companies). However, whether and how low-power actors can shape their political, regulatory, and economic environment was not central to RDT analysis, which is the focus of this paper. The empirical context for this research is the emergence and enactment of automobile emissions standards in Japan f...

Abstract: Why are some organizations famous? We argue that fame results from a conjunction of several audience-specific reputations. Expert reputation (i.e. reputation among members of a knowledgeable group, such as a cultural elite or critics) acts as a mediator for achieving fame for organizations held in high esteem by their peers and clients. Based on a unique database of 103 architectural companies in France, our analysis uses structural equation modelling (SEM) combined with mediation effects to reveal that expert reputation can lead to fame by mediating peer and client reputations. We contribute to the literature by explaining why only some organizations already reputed among peers and clients are famous in society at large.

Abstract: The article seeks to further our understanding of the process of organizing nascent social ventures. It builds upon current research on the political and collaborative nature of the social entrepreneurial process, and takes an ANT-inspired processual approach to follow the organizational practices carried by a nascent social venture in its efforts to mobilize stakeholders, bring about collaboration and ultimately secure resources. It draws upon empirical material generated during the first year of a social venture I founded and continue to chair. Findings highlight the adaptive and fluid nature of the organizational practices involved in nascent organizations and indicate that the capacity to continuously adjust the qualities of the eventual venture to the stakes of potential partners is instrumental to start up the venture. The article suggests the notion of tinkering to underscore the fluidity, the ongoing and piecemeal everyday work of such organizing processes. Further, findings highlight the extent t...

Abstract: This paper uses data from a longitudinal, seven-year, cross-national study to explore the translation of a trade union idea. The aim of the paper is to examine and explicate the nature of the translation work undertaken to translate a trade union idea in a multi-organizational setting. In examining how the idea of the learning representative initiative was translated into the New Zealand context we draw upon a narrative analysis to reveal the complexities of the dynamic and ongoing translation of the idea and identify the nature of the translation work required. As such we contribute to the literature on the translation of ideas firstly by explicating the concept of real-time translation work in a novel empirical context, and secondly theoretically, by drawing attention to the distinctive characteristics of trade union translation work. In doing so we argue that translation work in this distinctive socio-political context requires ongoing vigilance and proprietorship of the idea by trade union actors and ...

Title: Guardians of the Internet: Building and Sustaining the Anonymous Online Community
Author-Name: Felipe G Massa
Abstract: Online communities have displaced or become complements to organizations such as churches, labor unions and political groups which have traditionally been at the center of collective action. Yet, despite their growing influence and support of faster, cheaper and more flexible organizing, few empirical studies address how online communities are built and become enduring agents of social change. Using Internet-based ethnographic methods, this inductive field study examines how an online community called Anonymous transitioned from being a small gathering of contributors focused on recreation to becoming a community of trolls, activists and hackers incubating myriad projects. Findings reveal that the interplay of digital technology and a culture of transgression supported experimentation that culminated with the adoption of a resilient organizing platform that enabled several community factions to coexist in continuous engagement. This paper infuses community building research with an important emphasis on t...

Title: That’s What Friends Are For: Hospitality and affective bonds fostering collective empowerment in an intentional community
Author-Name: Carine Farias
Abstract: Processes of collective empowerment are essentially concerned with the production of social and emotional configurations fostering a mutual awareness that social change is both desirable and feasible. Using an ethnographic study of an intentional community of activists, this paper analyses how friendship practices produce enduring forms of empowerment based on democratic praxis. The analysis shows that nurturing affective bonds of friendship facilitates the prefiguration of alternative ways of life through the experience of living together. This is supported by the cultivation of hexis as a political frame, which reassesses the centrality of human beings’ otherness and fosters complex equality within relationships.

Abstract: Social movement scholars and activists have recognized the difficulties of mobilizing people for the long haul, moving from the exuberance of the protest to the dull and ordinary work necessary to produce sustainable change. Drawing on ethnographic work in La Juanita, in Greater Buenos Aires, we look at local actions for and from the neighborhood in order to resist political domination, taken by people who have been unemployed for long periods of time. We identified concrete and local practices and interventions—which we call mundane and everyday politics – that are embedded in a territory and go beyond the typical practices of social movements and the expected infrapolitical activity in allowing the disfranchised to engage in the political process.

Title: Disobedience of Immoral Orders from Authorities: An Issue Construction Perspective
Author-Name: Bidhan Lalit Parmar
Abstract: The purpose of this study is to examine how disobedience to immoral orders from an authority emerges in organizations. Using organizational discourse analysis to analyze the verbal communication of the original participants in Stanley Milgram’s obedience to authority experiments, I show how participants constructed the same experimental situation differently by analyzing their communication. Disobedient participants were more likely to display two different communication patterns: assessing consequences or self-referential objections. In contrast, obedient participants were more likely to seek guidance on the experimental procedure and interrupt the learner’s protests. Overall, I present a process model of how disobedience emerges in situations. This study’s findings also expand our understanding of moral imagination, moral decision making, and employee voice in organizations primarily by demonstrating how people can exercise agency in equivocal situations by constructing the situations they face.

Title: Rethinking Collective Action: The Co-Evolution of the State and Institutional Entrepreneurs in Emerging Economies
Author-Name: Tricia D. Olsen
Abstract: Why do groups form to influence policy outcomes? Classic notions of collective action tell us that a small number of homogeneous individuals are more likely to organize and thus achieve their preferred policy outcomes. Yet, this is not always reflected in the empirical record as external factors, such as the state, influence the costs of organizing. Instead, the traditional collective action literature largely assumes a purely rational or passive state. While the institutional entrepreneurship literature highlights the key role these actors can play in shaping institutions and, at times, organizational fields, it does not seek to explain why change agents appear in some instances and not others. This article seeks to fill this theoretical gap by drawing on the co-evolution literature, which helps explain the variation in group formation by underscoring how the state and institutional entrepreneurs shape one another. Utilizing rich qualitative data from the microfinance industry in Brazil and Mexico, this ...

Abstract: Emerging multinational enterprises (EMNEs) often engage in strategic-asset-seeking foreign direct investment (FDI) for competitive catch-up. This study explores the linkages between an EMNE’s competitive scenario consisting of a configuration of its awareness-motivation-capability (AMC) conditions and the comparative institutional advantages of its strategic-asset-seeking destination. Our configurational analyses of Chinese FDIs in the technology-intensive industries of OECD countries reveal a taxonomy of four distinct asset-seeking strategies of EMNEs. Our findings shed novel insights into the strategic variations within EMNEs based on a theoretically and methodologically extended AMC framework. This study also extends the varieties of capitalism literature by addressing the implications of comparative institutional advantages for foreign entrants, rather than domestic incumbent firms.

Title: Better Together: Using Meta-Analysis to Explore Complementarities between Ecological and Institutional Theories of Organization
Author-Name: Michel W. Lander

Abstract: While sharing intellectual ancestry, organizational ecology and institutionalism are rarely used conjointly to explain population dynamics. A rapprochement would nevertheless be fruitful, as the parsimonious models developed by ecologists are better able to explain organizational founding and failure when enriched with institutional variables. We present a meta-analysis of density dependence theory, which predicts a non-monotonic relationship between population density and organizational vital events. We show that ecology and institutionalism are ‘better together’ by extending this ecological framework in four institutionalism-inspired ways. First, we show that the effects of density on organizational vital rates are moderated by two conceptions of time: ecological ‘clocks’ and institutional ‘eras’. Second, we argue that the socio-political legitimacy of organizational forms, a concept with strong institutional roots, exacerbates density-related founding while attenuating failure. Third, we illustrate how...

Abstract: Through the development of CSR ratings, metrics and management tools, corporate social responsibility is currently materialized at an unprecedented scale within and across organizations. However, the material dimension of CSR and the inherent political potential in this materialization have been neglected. Drawing on insights from actor-network theory and the critical discussion of current approaches to power in CSR studies, we offer an alternative sociomaterial conceptualization of power in order to clarify how power works through materialized forms of CSR. We develop a framework that explains both how power is constituted within materialized forms of CSR through processes of ‘assembling/disassembling’, and how power is mobilized through materialized forms of CSR through processes of ‘overflowing/framing’. From this framework, we derive four tactics that clarify how CSR materializations can be seized by marginalized actors to ‘recover’ CSR. Our analysis aims to renew CSR studies by showing the potential ...

Title: Does Diffusion Make an Institutionally Contested Practice Legitimate? Shareholder Responses to Downsizing in Japan, 1973–2005
Author-Name: Jiwook Jung
Author-Name: Eunmi Mun
Abstract: Despite predictions to the contrary, institutionally contested practices are sometimes disseminated broadly. Does diffusion indicate they have achieved legitimacy in the eyes of key constituents? The conventional view regards diffusion as a process of legitimization and suggests that unconventional practices gain legitimacy following diffusion. Building on recent studies that view diffusion as an outcome of political struggle, we instead argue that political contestation ramps up as controversial practices are disseminated, making it difficult for them to gain wide acceptance. Their diffusion threatens the stability of preexisting institutional arrangements, and constituents who remain supportive of the status quo react negatively. We test our argument by examining shareholders’ response to downsizing in Japan, a practice that is highly controversial given the deeply entrenched norm of lifetime employment. Our analysis of panel data on 1,791 Japanese firms between 1973 and 2005 shows that neither domestic...

Author-Name: Andrew D. Brown
Abstract: How are people’s identities disciplined by their talk about humour? Based on an ethnographic study of a New York food co-operative, we show how members’ talk about appropriate and inappropriate uses of humour disciplined their identity work. The principal contribution we make is twofold. First, we show that in their talk about humour people engaged in three types of identity work: homogenizing, differentiating and personalizing. These were associated with five practices of talk which constructed co-op members as strong organizational identifiers, respectful towards others, flexible rule followers, not ‘too’ serious or self-righteous, and as autonomous individuals. Second, we analyse how this identity work (re)produced norms regulating the use of humour to fabricate conformist selves. Control, we argue, is not simply a matter of managers or other elites seeking to tighten the iron cage through corporate colonization to manufacture consent; rather, all organizational members are complicit in defining discou...

Title: Becoming the Leader: Leadership as Material Presence
Author-Name: Jackie Ford

Author-Name: Sue Richardson
Abstract: This paper seeks to understand leaders as material presences. Leadership theory has traditionally explored leaders as sites of disembodied traits, characteristics and abilities. Our qualitative, mixed method study suggests that managers charged with the tasks of leadership operate within a very different understanding. Their endogenous or lay theory understands leadership as physical, corporeal and visible, and as something made manifest through leaders’ material presence. This theory-in-practice holds that leadership qualities are signified by the leader’s physical appearance: the good leader must look the part. Actors consequently work on their own appearance to present an image of themselves as leader. They thus offer a fundamental challenge to dominant exogenous, or academic, theories of leadership. To understand the unspoken assumptions that underpin the lay theory of leadership as material presence, we interrogate it using the new materialist theory of Karen Barad and the object relations theory of ...

Abstract: While there has been a growing body of research on workplace dignity, the majority of studies tend to focus on how dignity is experienced by organizational members, paying considerably less attention to consequences for organizations. In this study, we explore the influence of workplace dignity on employee work behaviors that affect organizational performance. Framing our inquiry with Sharon Bolton’s yet-untested multidimensional theory of dignity, we analyze Randy Hodson’s content-coded ethnographic data to reveal that increases in workplace dignity tend to predict increases in employee engagement, yet have mixed effects on counterproductive workplace behaviors. Following a post-hoc ethnographic reimmersion, we identify the critical role of safe and secure working conditions in enabling and constraining employees’ ability to redress or resist workplace indignities with counterproductive workplace behaviors.

Title: The Psychological Foundations of Supervisor–Subordinate Information Asymmetry

Author-Name: Nagarajan Ramamoorthy
Abstract: Information asymmetry in an employment relationship is much researched in the organization studies literature because of its consequences for employment contracts, compensation, and rent appropriation by the involved parties. However, its psychological antecedents have not been adequately addressed so far. We conceptually investigate the psychological drivers of supervisor–subordinate information asymmetry by primarily invoking social exchange theory. Whereas agency theory examines how information distribution is driven by self-interest seeking, social exchange theory emphasizes how individuals may be motivated to fulfill social obligations and not by exclusive self-interest seeking. This paper advances several propositions regarding the influence of a subordinate’s and supervisor’s psychological variables, such as relational identification, disposition for relational trust, assumed similarity, and the shaping techniques used by a supervisor on information asymmetry. In doing so, it highlights the underly...

Abstract: Team identity has received little research attention even though an increasing number of firms are moving to team-based organizations and there is evidence that teams form identities. We explore the extent to which team identity can be institutionalized as a central organizing principle of team-based firms. We argue that managerial and stakeholder interventions shape the self-construction of team identity as well as the team’s commitment to specific work objectives. We also suggest that team identity becomes isomorphic to organizational identity because of pressures related to: (1) the presence of a dense network of managers and stakeholders, which orients teams towards a focus on certain aspects of the higher-order identity; (2) the use of team routines and regular feedback loops, which force alignment with the organizational identity; and (3) the use of coordinating roles aimed at promoting, ratifying and reinforcing the convergence of identity within the team.

Abstract: Despite the increasing deployment of formalized boundary spanning roles and practices, the mechanisms and dynamics of their legitimation remain under-explored. Using the Bourdieusian lens, we theorize legitimation of boundary spanning as accumulation, mobilization and conversion of several forms of capital unfolding in a configuration of intersecting fields. Drawing on a qualitative longitudinal case study of a collaborative partnership between a university and healthcare organizations, we describe changes in the structure, sources and mutual convertibility of capital assets over time. We also analyse the implications of this evolution for the relationships between the intersecting fields and the social trajectory of boundary spanners. We argue that legitimation of boundary spanning roles and practices is a highly transformative, collective and political process that increases the capital endowments and authority of individual boundary spanning agents but may lead to the erosion of the very same roles and...

Title: Partners for Good: How Business and NGOs Engage the Commercial–Social Paradox
Author-Name: Garima Sharma
Author-Name: Pratima Bansal
Abstract: Businesses and NGOs are collaborating more frequently to address social issues with commercial solutions, yet not all collaborations work well. We wanted to know why some collaborations struggle where others succeed. We studied five projects in India in which businesses bought goods and services from NGOs that employed disadvantaged people. Two of these five projects met the expectations of both parties, whereas the other three did not. By drawing on the paradox literature, we argue that the project’s success indicates that the business and NGO engaged the commercial-social paradox. We found that in the projects that worked well, the two parties held fluid categories, i.e. they saw differences between business and NGO as contextual and aimed to find creative workarounds to emergent problems. In the projects that did not work well, businesses and NGOs imposed categorical imperatives, i.e. they saw sharp differences that they intensified by imposing standardized and familiar solutions on their partner. We c...

Title: Co-constructing a Sense of Community at Work: The Emergence of Community in Coworking Spaces
Author-Name: Lyndon E. Garrett

Author-Name: Peter A. Bacevice
Abstract: As more individuals are working remotely, many feel increasingly isolated and socially adrift. To address this challenge, many independent workers are choosing to work in coworking spaces – shared spaces where individuals do their own work but in the presence of others with the express purpose of being part of a community. In this qualitative, single case study, we analyze how members of a coworking space work together to co-construct a sense of community through their day-to-day interactions in the space. We apply a relational constructionist lens to unpack the processes of ‘community work’ as an interactive, agentic process. We identify three types of collective actions, or interacts, that contribute to a sense of community: endorsing, encountering, and engaging. These interacts represent different forms of community work that members interactively accomplish to maintain a desired community experience. The rapidly growing coworking movement offers insights, as uncovered in this study, on how to integrat...

Title: Sober Intoxication: Institutional Contradictions and Identity Work in the Everyday Life of Four Religious Communities in Italy
Author-Name: Simona Giorgi
Author-Name: Stefania Palmisano
Abstract: This study explores how organization members manage institutional contradictions in their everyday life without aiming at change-oriented agency. Drawing on interviews, observations, and archival data from four religious communities in Italy, we find that when organization members experience institutional contradictions between two logics that provide conflicting identity prescriptions but to which they are emotionally attached, they engage in identity work that helps them ameliorate – but not eliminate – tensions that surface when identity elements do not align. More specifically, identity work proved integral to reaching a temporary identity truce, or reconciliation of experienced contradictions, through distancing from illegitimate others and embedding of one’s identity within an established tradition. These findings draw attention to the role of contradictions in institutional maintenance, extending theory that has tended to focus on the experience of contradictions as a source of institutional change...

Title: Money is the Root of All Evil – Or Is It? Recreating Culture through Everyday Neutralizing Practices
Author-Name: Carine Farias
Abstract: Alternative organizations exist within the prevalent social order which they simultaneously attempt to resist. To construct and maintain alternative cultural practices, they must continuously deal with symbolic threats. By illuminating processes of cultural creation stemming from the day-to-day neutralization of threats associated with money, this ethnographic study of an intentional community moves the question of boundaries beyond issues of exclusion/inclusion. Instead, it argues for a full appreciation of the role of transgression and disorder in the shaping of organizational cultures. Two sets of everyday neutralizing practices – distancing and re-appropriating – have been identified as factors that facilitate the emergence of a relational and politicized culture of exchange.

Title: A Culture of Uncertainty: Interaction and Organizational Memory in Software Engineering Teams under a Productivity Scheme
Author-Name: Nahoko Kameo
Abstract: Drawing on an ethnography of software engineering teams that introduced a new and empowerment-centered productivity scheme, this study delineates how, despite management’s affirmation of its commitment, software engineers produced and reproduced a ‘culture of uncertainty’ characterized by constant doubt about how long the scheme would last. Engineers shared previous experiences of failed productivity schemes and collectively used this organizational memory to understand their new situation. Workers drew on this organizational memory in everyday interaction to sustain a culture in which everyday management decisions served as indicators of management’s potential abandonment of the scheme; as a result, workers remained uncommitted to the scheme. Workers interactionally employed organizational memory as a resource that they used to interpret and respond to changes. Analysis of this process shows the links between organizational memory, culture creation, and culture’s influence on productivity scheme changes.

Title: Griping and Joking as Identification Rituals and Tools for Engagement in Cross-Boundary Team Meetings
Author-Name: Vanessa Pouthier
Abstract: This article explores the role of griping and joking behaviors in cross-boundary teams. Those socio-emotional behaviors often go unnoticed in studies of team communication, as does more broadly the work of building relationships. Given the growing recognition that the quality of connections among team members significantly influences the quality of coordinating and knowledge-sharing practices in cross-boundary teams, this seems an important lacuna to address. Drawing on a qualitative study of a cross-occupational team responsible for palliative care and oncology patients, I illustrate how those mundane, recurrent communicative activities, which may appear tangential to the task at hand, have important relational and emotional consequences for the functioning of cross-boundary teams. Based on the observed characteristics and effects of a variety of griping and joking behaviors, I propose to conceptualize those communicative activities as identification rituals. I discuss the implications of this work for b...

Title: Organizational Responses to Institutional Pressures: Reconfiguration of Spaces in Nanosciences and Nanotechnologies
Author-Name: Nicolas Battard
Author-Name: Paul F. Donnelly
Author-Name: Vincent Mangematin
Abstract: The literature on organizational responses to institutional pressures describes responses ranging from compliance to resistance via different modes of decoupling. However, although these studies provide a greater understanding of the phenomenon, they tend to consider the different elements separately. Through a comparative case study of six research teams in the area of nanosciences and nanotechnologies, we offer three contributions. Our first contribution is to the decoupling literature by way of a complementary and cohesive framework, which shows that organizations vary in their responses by reconfiguring their physical (policy and materiality), mental (meaning) and social (identity) spaces, and that each space can be reconfigured at the core or periphery, or not be reconfigured. Our second and third contributions are through descriptions of two modes of organizational responses to institutional pressures and two factors explaining the variety of responses.

Title: Towards a Performative Theory of Resistance: Senior Managers and Revolting Subject(ivitie)s
Author-Name: Nancy Helen Harding
Author-Name: Jackie Ford
Author-Name: Hugh Lee
Abstract: This article develops a performative theory of resistance. It uses Judith Butler’s and Karen Barad’s theories of performativity to explore how resistance (to organizational strategies and policies) and resistants (those who resist such strategies and policies) co-emerge, within and through complex intra-actions of entangled discourses, materialities, affect and space/time. The article uses empirical materials from a case study of the implementation of a talent management strategy. We analyse interviews with the senior managers charged with implementing the strategy, the influence of material, non-sentient actors, and the experiences of the researchers when carrying out the interviews. This leads to a theory that resistance and resistants emerge in moment-to-moment co-constitutive moves that may be invoked when identity or self is put in jeopardy. Resistance, we suggest, is the power (residing with resistants) to say ‘no’ to organizational requirements that would otherwise threaten to render the self abject.

Title: Being an Early-Career CMS Academic in the Context of Insecurity and ‘Excellence’: The Dialectics of Resistance and Compliance
Author-Name: Alexandra Bristow

Author-Name: Olivier Ratle
Abstract: Drawing on a dialectical approach to resistance, we conceptualise the latter as a multifaceted, pervasive and contradictory phenomenon. This enables us to examine the predicament in which early-career Critical Management Studies academics find themselves in the current times of academic insecurity and ‘excellence’, as gleaned through this group’s understandings of themselves as resisters and participants in the complex and contradictory forces constituting their field. We draw on 24 semi-structured interviews to map our participants’ accounts of themselves as resisters in terms of different approaches to tensions and contradictions between, on the one hand, the interviewees’ Critical Management Studies alignment and, on the other, the ethos of business school neoliberalism. Emerging from this analysis are three contingent and interlinked narratives of resistance and identity – diplomatic, combative and idealistic – each of which encapsulates a particular mode (negotiation, struggle, and laying one’s own p...

Title: Resistance through Difference: The Co-Constitution of Dissent and Inclusion
Author-Name: Suzanne Gagnon
Author-Name: David Collinson
Abstract: This article argues that the discursive construction of difference can shape resistance in organizations. Drawing on an inductive study of international teams in a global leadership programme, the paper reveals how difference is discursively produced and reproduced in team members’ talk. In conditions of normalizing control, the majority of teams engage in individuating practices that reinforce internal differences, preclude group cohesion and marginalize certain members. One team, however, explicitly resists programme stipulations in ways that express members’ heterogeneity and simultaneously reinforce group solidarity and inclusion. Referring to these oppositional practices as ‘resistance through difference’, the article describes how dissent challenges the hierarchies and disciplinary practices embedded in the leadership programme, and theorizes the co-constitution of inclusion and resistance. By examining the construction of difference not as ‘a problem’, but as a productive resource, the paper also a...

Title: Beyond the Hidden/Public Resistance Divide: How Bloggers Defeated a Big Company
Author-Name: David Courpasson
Abstract: In recent decades, organizational research on resistance has been largely characterized by a strict divide between hidden and public forms of resistance. We contend that this division impedes a full understanding of how resistance can be efficacious. We suggest that hidden and public forms of resistance are in fact interrelated and mutually reinforced along processes of struggle. In order to study this relationship, we analyze the four-and-a-half-year struggle of a group of dismissed employees against their former employer. This study aims to contribute to the literature in three ways. First, we show that the development of public resistance is nourished by discrete individualistic and non-confrontational expressions of dissent. Second, we demonstrate how the efficacy of resistance is influenced by the meaningfulness of the resisting space constituted by the blog, because of the intricacies between private lives and public roles. Finally, we show that the outcome of resistance is also influenced by the po...

Title: Effectiveness of CEO Power Bundles and Discretion Context: Unpacking the ‘Fuzziness’ of the CEO Duality Puzzle
Author-Name: Krista B. Lewellyn
Author-Name: Stav Fainshmidt
Abstract: Decades of research on the effectiveness of CEO duality as a governance mechanism have produced inconsistent results, providing support and non-support for agency and stewardship theories. To better understand the duality puzzle, we first conceptualize CEO duality as a governance mechanism conferring structural power and board discretion upon a CEO. We then use the concept of complementarity and open-systems logic to evaluate the effectiveness of CEO duality in conjunction with other, concurrent sources of CEO power and discretion. Using fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis and data on 241 U.S. firms, we show that CEO duality combines in a variety of ways with other sources of CEO power into power bundles, and that particular power bundles configure with elements of the organizational and industry discretion context into four effective and four ineffective governance configurations. Consequently, our study suggests that the effectiveness of either a dual or separated leadership structure is reinforc...

Title: The Values of Strategy: Valuation Practices, Rivalry and Strategic Agency
Author-Name: Martin Kornberger
Abstract: The concept of value is held dear by strategy theorists and practitioners alike as they share a concern about value creation, value propositions, value add, value chains, shareholder value and a plethora of other value constructs. Yet, despite its centrality, the concept of value has attracted limited attention in strategy scholarship. Most commonly, notions of value as profit or utility, inherited from economic theory, are assumed rather than analyzed. This paper advances the discussion of value in the strategy discourse by conceptualizing value as a correlate of valuation practices. Following this view, value is neither understood as the property of an object nor as a subjective preference; rather, values are constituted through valuation practices including rankings, ratings, awards, reviews and other valuation mechanisms that bestow values upon things in the first place. The paper explores this idea through analyzing valuation practices and their constitutive mechanisms; and it exploits this idea for ...

Title: The Spectacle and Organization Studies

Abstract: The aim of this essay is to revisit Guy Debord’s critical theory of the spectacle as formulated 50 years ago in the ‘Society of the Spectacle’ in light of the contemporary production of spectacles. Debord’s arguments about appearance, visibility and celebrity are echoed in the way organizations increasingly focus on their brand, image, impression, and reputation. Yet, the role of spectacles in organizational life has remained under-researched in organization studies. As the boundaries between fact and fiction, reality and representation, substance and appearance become increasingly blurred, questions about the production and effects of spectacles seem more pertinent than ever. Are representations faithful mirrors of reality, or attempts to conceal reality? Do they replace reality, or bring new realities into being? By articulating three possible understandings of the spectacle, as fetishism, hyper-reality or performativity, this essay invites organization scholars to examine the organization of the real a...

Title: Culture, Conditions and Paradoxical Frames

Abstract: Organizational contexts establish conditions that seem paradoxical, but it is unclear when and why individuals notice and respond to paradoxes. This paper examines how culture and conditions interact to shape whether individuals adopt paradoxical frames. We used cooperation and competition among American and Chinese people as an empirical setting. Using lay categories as a theoretical framework, we predicted that specific types of conditions, colleagues’ outperforming and out-helping each other, can be interpreted as instances of both cooperation and competition. Study 1 found that Chinese people were more likely than Americans to adopt paradoxical frames in just these types of conditions and that the cross-cultural difference was attributed to differences in paradox mindset. Study 2 found that in just these types of conditions, Chinese people were more likely to engage in simultaneously cooperative and competitive behavior and this was attributed to differences in the use of paradoxical frames. Thus, cul...

Title: The Human Capital Hoax: Work, Debt and Insecurity in the Era of Uberization
Author-Name: Peter Fleming
Abstract: Human capital theory – developed by neoclassical economists like Gary Becker and Theodore Schultz – is widely considered a useful way to explain how employees might enhance their value in organizations, leading to improved skill, autonomy and socio-economic wellbeing. This essay argues the opposite. Human capital theory implies that employees should bear the costs (and benefits) of their investment. Highly individualized training and work practices are an inevitable corollary. Self-employment, portfolio careers, the ‘gig economy’ and on-demand business models (including Uber and Deliveroo) faithfully reflect the assumptions that inform human capital theory. I term this the radical responsibilization of the workforce and link it to growing economic insecurity, low productivity, diminished autonomy and worrying levels of personal debt. The essay concludes by proposing some possible solutions.

Author-Name: Simon Stevens
Abstract: If I were to say that the architecture in our public spaces is ‘really speaking to us’, you would be forgiven for thinking this is a piece about the aesthetics of our cities. In some ways in fact, it is, but not in any artistic sense. I am not discussing a collection of monuments, town houses or grandiose buildings. Alas, the architecture I talk of is more humble and yet perhaps more sinister. There is a message encoded into it, within our parks, streets and centres, which seems to be part of a wider narrative. This essay is an attempt to read it, find out what it says, and consider how that may affect our concept of autonomy, but also, to encourage us to reflect on how we choose to read it: to think on what theoretical framework we should discuss homelessness. The aim is not to necessarily reconceptualize something then, but is more in the tradition of making the familiar seem unfamiliar: not only in what we think, but how we come to think what we do and the extent to which the former is limited by the l...

Title: Tether or Stepping Stone? The Relationship between Perceived External Reputation and Collective Voluntary Turnover Rates
Author-Name: Erin E. Makarius

Author-Name: Aino Tenhiälä
Abstract: Signaling theory suggests that resources such as firm reputation can send multiple signals that create dual pressures on stakeholders. These tensions are apparent when examining the relationship between a firm’s reputation and the collective voluntary turnover rates it experiences. On the one hand, a favorable reputation may tether employees to the firm due to the perceived desirability of working for a reputable company, resulting in lower voluntary turnover rates. On the other hand, a favorable reputation may make employees believe they are more marketable and thus may serve as a stepping stone relating to higher voluntary turnover rates. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether and when reputation acts as a signal of desirability or a signal of ease of movement in predicting collective voluntary turnover rates. We find some evidence for an overall tethering effect for more reputable firms. In addition, our findings demonstrate that reputation is more likely to result in stepping stone effect...

Title: Positive and Negative Power: Thoughts on the Dialectics of Power
Author-Name: Veljko Rus
Abstract: Positive power (induction), as an ability to initiate activity, and negative power (resis tance), as an ability to stop some activity, are treated in this paper as two closely related poles of the same power cycle. The paper further demonstrates how existing theoretical treatments of power phenomena have been reduced to an analysis of positive power and have consequently been unable to treat the contradictory interdependency of positive and negative power.Leadership as a power-implementing practice cannot avoid resistance. However, suc cessful leadership can provoke greater induction than resistance. Attempts to avoid resistance completely would provoke secondary effects which would lead towards the deterioration of powerless as well as powerful entities.Authority is treated in this paper as a specific state of equilibrium between conditionally tolerated positive power and conditionally tolerated negative power. Authority can, therefore, be treated as a unity of contradictions.

Author-Name: Geert Hofstede
Abstract: A dramatic case description of events in a Dutch company which is put under pressure to change its policy illustrates how managerial behaviour is subject to the prevailing climate of opinion in society. The clash of interests both inside and outside the organiza tion and the mobilization of consumer opinion by external pressure groups compelled management to revise its policy position. The case is analysed from the point of view of the value systems of various actors inside and outside the company, and of the cultural specificity of the Dutch environment in which it took place. It is also considered as an example of 'garbage can' decision-making. Its consequences are explored for the management of both business corporations and civic action groups.

Author-Name: Lena Kolarska
Author-Name: Howard Aldrich
Abstract: Albert Hirschman's contribution in Exit, voice, and loyalty provided a framework within which investigators could simultaneously examine people's responses to deteriorating organizational performance and administrators' responses to members' or customers' responses. Traditional analyses focussed on exits — people ceasing to buy a firm's products or leaving the organization — and on competition between organizations as remedies for declining performance. Hirschman added the concept of voice — people expressing dissatisfaction through some form of overt protest. Underlying his model was an implicit assumption of administrators' responsiveness to exit and voice, whereas we posit that there are many conditions under which managers and leaders are highly unresponsive. These conditions are highlighted in nonmarket economies, and we draw illustrative material from Poland to support our arguments.

Title: Societal Differences in Organizing Manufacturing Units: A Comparison of France, West Germany, and Great Britain
Author-Name: Marc Maurice

Abstract: The literature has largely tended to consider organizations as distinct from societal processes and institutions, and to emphasize convergent and 'culture-free' elements of organization. By cross-national comparisons of closely matched factories in France, West Germany, and Great Britain, this paper shows that more pervasive differences exist than are usually recognized. Organizational processes of differentiation and inte gration can be seen to consistently interact with processes of educating, training, recruiting, and promoting manpower, so that both develop within an institutional logic that is particular to a society, and bring about nationally different shapes of organiza tion. Organizational differences can thus be considered as linked to different extents and dimensions of professionalty. Comparisons show that a multidimensional concept of professionality is called for, in contrast to the one-sided emphasis on the social status and formal knowledge dimension usually found in the literature.

Title: Organizations as Instruments of Social Change in Postindustrial Societies
Author-Name: Albert Cherns
Abstract: There are two ways of looking at the relationship between organizations and society. One features the impact of society on the organization, the social environment; the other attends to the impact on society of the organization and its appetite for resources. The first shows organizations lagging in their cultural prescriptions, the second shows them leading. Both are right. The relationship is circular. Because the work organization, is the principal agent of distribution of society's resources, both material and immaterial, it is a splendid fulcrum for a sociotechnical Archimedes.

Title: A Power-Strategy Alternative to Organization Development
Author-Name: Finn Borum
Abstract: In this article assumptions implied in the organization development (OD) literature about organizations, members of organizations, and the external consultant are pointed out on the basis of studies of the literature. These assumptions are criticized and a set of alternative assumptions is formulated.In the light of this, a strategy for change is formulated which constitutes an alternative to OD strategies, both in purpose and in the phases of change.According to the alternative strategy, power is regarded as the crucial variable, in connection with organizational change. The 'power' strategy prescribes the strengthen ing of a party's power bases prior to negotiations with the 'opponent' and formalization of mechanisms for the regulation of conflicts; this is contrary to the OD strategies, which imply confrontation, a change in perceptions and attitudes, and solution of conflicts.The 'alternative' strategy is exemplified and discussed with reference to an action research project, which the author carried ...

Title: Indirect Participation, Influence, and Power: Some Danish Experiences1
Author-Name: Reinhard Lund
Abstract: This paper compares the indirect (representative) participation of workers in the processes of employers' decision making as these processes mirror the nature of enter prise organization. Hereby some major hindrances to an extension of workers' influ ence, power, and participation in employers' decision making are highlighted. This article presents an in-depth study of three decisions covering the areas of daily business, investments, and organizational structure in a manufacturing company in Denmark. The implications of the results for theories on influence, power, and participation are discussed.

Title: Technological Implications Theory: A Japanese Test
Author-Name: Robert M. Marsh
Author-Name: Hiroshi Mannari
Abstract: Previous theory and research in England, Canada, and the United States indicates that the nature of the dominant type of technology used in an organization has important causal implications for many aspects of the social structure of the organization. This study of industrial manufacturing firms in Japan consists of one factory in each of three types of technology: small-batch production (Sake Company), mass production assem bly line (Electric Factory), and automated continuous process (Petroleum Company). A fourth factory (Shipbuilding Factory) combines aspects of unit and mass production technology.Of the thirteen hypotheses derived from seven more general propositions about the relationships between technology, organizational structure, and employee behaviour and attitudes, and tested, eight are fully and four partially confirmed. These findings are interpreted as supporting technological implications theory, and as a further indication of the greater importance of technological and structural variable...

Title: Institution Building for Social and Organizational Change: An Appreciation
Author-Name: S.R. Ganesh
Abstract: The study of institution building and institutionalization has engaged the attention of a variety of scholars from several disciplines. However, institution building as a distinct body of knowledge has emerged only in the last decade. The bulk of the literature has been put together as a result of the efforts of a consortium of American scholars working within a common framework developed in the context of aid to the less developed countries through the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). Unfortunately, while this literature has done much to provide considerable guidance and thrust to institution-building (IB) efforts, it has the danger of producing a cleavage in the social science contributions to this area. True to the spirit in which the various scholars developed the IB model in the United States, this paper attempts to synthesize various relevant streams in this important area of human endeavour. In doing so, it goes beyond the existing models and reports a general processual ...

Title: Formal Structure: A Review of the Empirical Relationships Between Task Differentiation, Role Prescription, and Authority Dispersion
Author-Name: Eric J. Walton
Abstract: The utility of the view of formal structure as a series of dimensions has been questioned because of the several inconsistencies in the empirical outcomes among various studies. Interrelations among three dimensions of formal structure are considered on the basis of 25 major empirical studies. A framework is developed from the substantive focus of the measures of task differentiation, role prescription, and authority dispersion. The application of this scheme, together with some secondary analysis of the empirical outcomes, explicates the relationships, produces consistency among the various studies, and highlights those areas where empirical evidence is lacking. In addition, the review indicates that the substantive meaning of variables and the content realm to which concepts are addressed cannot be disregarded, particularly if integrative models of different levels of analysis are to be the focus of future research.

Title: Centrally Planned Development: A Comparison of Polish Factories with Equivalents in Britain, Japan, and Sweden
Author-Name: Bolec Kuc
Author-Name: David J. Hickson
Author-Name: Charles J. McMillan
Abstract: The first data collected by Aston Programme methods in Eastern Europe are reported from Poland. In a sample of factories matched for size, product, and unit status with equivalents in Britain, Japan, and Sweden, striking results are obtained. First, relation ships among size, interorganizational dependence, and technology, and structural characteristics of formalization, specialization, and centralization continue to support the hypothesis that these relationships will be similar in all societies. Second, and more importantly for this particular cross-national comparison, the Polish factories are found to be uniquely and uniformly formalized, functionally specialized, and centralized, to a high degree. This distinctiveness is attributed to the dual effects of an economy which is both a late developer and state planned.

Title: Contingency and Choice in Organization Theory
Author-Name: Georg Schreyögg
Abstract: From reconstructing and reviewing the paradigm of contingency theory, its inherent economic determinism is rejected as being misleading. Supported by considerable evidence, 'scope of choice' is suggested to be crucial for the understanding of the nexus between environmental circumstances and organizational structure. Using the idea of 'scope of choice', consequences for further theorizing are outlined. An action-oriented approach is suggested which also allows for rational reasoning on normative issues. Some proposals for interpreting organizational structure as a subject of decision pro cesses are discussed. Special attention is given to the concept of strategic choice as a possible means of orienting organization research. Finally, issuing from the idea of 'scope of choice', normative questions are considered in an attempt to 'recall' the obligation of practical (normative) reasoning in organizational choice.

Author-Name: Jo Wheeler
Author-Name: Roger Mansfield
Author-Name: Dave Todd
Abstract: The concept of organizational dependence is examined and its possible implications for different aspects of organizational structure are considered. It is argued that the implica tions of dependence in different environmental sectors will be different and a number of propositions are advanced concerning the effects of dependence upon customers and owners. Empirical evidence from a study of 78 companies in the United Kingdom is considered and most of the propositions are found to be supported. The study appears to confirm that greater predictive power can be obtained by disaggregating the concept of dependence and examining different environmental sectors separately.

Title: Data Aggregation in Organizational Research: The Temporal Dimension
Author-Name: John R. Kimberly
Abstract: This article focusses on an important but often overlooked dimension of aggregation in organizational research, the temporal dimension. As more researchers begin to appreciate the dynamic quality of their subject matter, longitudinal studies will become more common. Lacking fully developed research paradigms, however, such studies are likely to encounter a number of problems. In this paper, three particular problems, the interval problem, the differential period problem, and the morphogenetic problem, are discussed in the context of two concrete studies. The kinds of issues each problem poses are identified and possible solutions are proposed.

Author-Name: Mohamed Badran
Author-Name: Bob Hinings
Abstract: Access to 31 state-owned organizations engaged in a variety of industries in Egypt enables the function of work organizations in a less-developed country to be examined. The utilization of public enterprises by government in political and developmental strategies has a considerable impact upon their form and authority. They are shown to be highly structured and highly centralized (using Aston measures) in a way similar to organizations in other socialist and developing countries. In addition, size and techno logy together appear to exert a bureaucratizing effect.

Title: The Schismatic Metaphor and Its Implications for Organizational Analysis
Author-Name: Gareth Morgan
Abstract: This article investigates the possibility of studying organizations upon the basis of a schismatic metaphor, which presumes that there is a fundamental tendency within organizations towards disintegration as a result of endogenously generated change. The metaphor specifically sets out to provide an alternative to the traditional mechanical and organismic metaphors, which assume that social systems are functionally unified and essentially stable, by focusing upon strains and tensions which often work towards the incompatible ends of unity and fission. It suggests that these strains and tensions can account for patterns of internal differentiation, the decentralization of power and control, patterns of conflict, and many other important organizational characteristics. Systematically developed, the schismatic metaphor offers an opportunity to view orga nizations from a perspective which elevates the importance of many variables which are either neglected or taken for granted within the context of traditional...

Title: Processes of Decision Making in a Trade-Union Branch
Author-Name: Gill Ursell
Author-Name: Nigel Nicholson
Author-Name: Paul Blyton
Abstract: Whether the loci of power are to be found within the rank and file membership or the branch leadership in a British trade union are investigated by focussing upon the decision-making processes attendant upon four decisions. Comparison of the processes characterizing different decisions reveals significant shifts in the loci of power within the branch structure. Some decisions are shown to favour more bureaucratic handling with minimal membership participation, while others tend to draw authority away from the branch leadership. Tendencies to bureaucratic elitism are shown to be inhibited by (a) the leadership's dependence upon membership support for the implementation of many decisions, and (b) ambiguities and tensions in the formal organizational structure which are revealed under conditions of extreme pressure. Attention is also paid to the theoretical issue of whether decision type can be seen to affect organizational structure, or vice versa.

Title: Economic and Institutional Conditions for Successful Employee Action: Ten Cases in the French Textile Industry
Author-Name: Sabine Erbès-Seguin
Abstract: The aim of the research presented in this article was twofold: to try to assess the impact of legal intervention in the economic sphere in France, and to analyse the relation between the strategies of employers in cutting their workforces and worker action on employment issues. The intention was to evaluate the chances of, and the conditions for, the emergence of a right to work, which at present can only be considered an 'antiright'. One of the most clear-cut findings was the verification that the treatment of problems of employment varies according to the type of economic process occurring in the enterprise, and according to the particular aspect of employment affected.

Title: Industrial Democracy in Europe: Differences and Similarities Across Countries and Hierarchies
Author-Name:  IDE International Research Group
Abstract: This article attempts to present the focus, methodology, and preliminary results of an international collaborative research project on industrial democracy involving twelve countries in Europe including Yugoslavia and Israel. Rather than explaining variations in participation, power, and influence in terms of contingencies such as personal attributes and characteristics of participants, on the one hand, or structural and tech nological features of organization, on the other hand, the research looks at both de jure and de facto participation in terms of participative structure (PS), power distribution (PO), and their outcomes (O).Initial findings with respect to differences and similarities across countries are presented. One of the main conclusions to be derived from the research is that, whereas all countries reveal a consistent hierarchy in the organizations studied, political and economic environments institutionally reflected in de jure participation can, however, significantly modify hierarchical pat...

Author-Name: Kieron Walsh
Author-Name: Bob Hinings
Author-Name: Royston Greenwood
Author-Name: Stewart Ranson
Abstract: This article examines the way in which recent critiques of the concept of power, notably by Clegg and Lukes, can be taken into account in the study of organizations. It is argued that this can best be done if we utilize the concepts of values and interests as well as the concept of power. Doing so allows us to consider the way in which advantage is distributed in an organization, and the contexts in which power is and is not used. Six patterns of organizational action are identified, using the concepts of values and interests, and their consequences for the exercise of power are examined. In conclusion it is argued that an understanding of power must utilize elements of both bureaucratic and political models of organizations.

Title: A Concept of Administrative Futures
Author-Name: Kenneth Cabatoff
Abstract: The problems of development in new organizations are examined by considering a case study — Radio-Québec, the educational television authority of the Canadian province of Quebec.The typical process of organizational growth and development is one wherein the initial confusion, uncertainties, and inefficiencies come to be replaced by a degree of goal certainty, efficiency in the performance of the organization's tasks, and more 'self- confidence' with respect to the organization's role in its operating environment.Yet in Radio-Québec these 'normal' processes of bureaucratic growth and development seemed not to occur. Instead of development leading to less confusion in the perfor mance of organizational tasks, it led to a breakdown of internal consensus. The Radio-Québec managing elite was forced, in effect, to create an entirely 'new' organiza tion a second time.The study demonstrates that growth of maturity may be accompanied by dysfunctions produced by attempts to bring about more rapid developments of th...

Title: Implementation Structures: A New Unit of Administrative Analysis
Author-Name: Benny Hjern
Author-Name: David O. Porter
Abstract: This article argues that a multiorganizational unit of analysis, an implementation structure, should be used when describing and evaluating the implementation and administration of programmes.Programmes are implemented by clusters of parts of public and private organizations. An implementation structure is the administrative entity which programme implementors use for accomplishing objectives within programmes. An organizationally rooted analy sis is therefore inadequate to rationalize the activities surrounding programme imple mentation.This article defines implementation structures and argues the advantage of using a multiorganizational analytic perspective over the perspective of single organizations.

Abstract: The recent interest in the literature on interorganizational relations is briefly reviewed and the so-called 'political economy' perspective is suggested as a helpful approach in conceptualizing the environments of organizations as a network in continuous negotia tions. A case study is presented of the negotiations between the British Government and the Ford Motor Company over the siting of a major engine plant in South Wales. The case study highlights the importance of choice and manipulation of environments; the extent to which organizations can control their environments; the importance of under standing organizational power; and the market position of the organization.

Author-Name: Jean de Kervasdoué
Abstract: This article summarizes the story of a failure in research, and shows how this failure led to new directions of inquiry. The first part of the article explains how an attempt in France to replicate an American study designed to link the organizational structure of hospitals to the adoption of innovations by these institutions failed. It was not possible to find identical measures for similar concepts in the two countries. Questions are raised on the adequacy of the methodological and theoretical assumptions shared by students of organization. The second part of the article uses French data to explore the relation ship between the pattern of diffusion of innovations and the structure of knowledge in the medical field, a structure which has been produced and negotiated through time.

Title: Contributions of Organizational Sociology: Part I: Contributions to Sociology — A Liberal View
Author-Name: Cornelis J. Lammers
Abstract: 'Sociology of organizations' is often considered to be just a name for the general social-scientific approach to the study of organizations. However, a case can be made for a one-sided, purely sociological analysis of organizations and interorganizational trans actions on the grounds that such a sociological speciality forms an essential part of sociology at large and, in addition, contributes to various other sociological specialities. As a distinct subdiscipline organizational sociology developed in the 1960s as a 'horizon tal' approach, claimed to be more theoretical, more fruitful, and more economical than the 'vertical' study of organizations. With the aid of a fourfold classification of its 'outputs' it is argued that organizational sociology has produced a wide variety of fruitful theories and findings which justify the claim that there remains a definite need for such a speciality closely tied to its 'mother discipline'. In a sequel — to appear in OS 2/4 — the contributions of organizational socio...

Abstract: Problems associated with the use of Aston psychometrically based measures are evalu ated in the light of experience gained in and the findings of an empirical study of 45 electrical engineering companies in the UK in which the Aston methodology was used. It is shown that (a) the unidimensionality of multi-item measures must be clearly established if loss of information is to be avoided, (b) scales constructed by aggregation of a number of subscales suggested by factor analysis should not be given general labels beyond the description of subscales included in the final scale, and (c) abbreviated scales based on the original study may only reflect sample-specific relationships and may not be used as proxies of original scales in the study of other samples. The objectivity of factor analysis is also addressed.

Title: Competition and Monopoly in Interest Representation: A Comparative Analysis of Trade Union Structure in the Railway Industries of Great Britain and West Germany
Author-Name: Wolfgang Streeck
Author-Name: Peter Seglow
Author-Name: Pat Wallace
Abstract: This article analyses some of the causes of the emergence and the stability of monopolies of representation of industrial unions in competition with sectional interest associations of specific occupational groups. As its empirical point of reference, the article takes the trade union systems in the railway industries of Great Britain and West Germany. In both countries, there are three railway unions whose areas of jurisdiction largely correspond to each other cross-nationally: one industrial union, one union of loco motive engine drivers, and one union for administrative staff. However, while in West Germany the proportion of the industrial union (GdED) in the total number of unionized railway workers increases at the expense of the sectional competitors, in Great Britain it has for a long time been declining. This divergent development of two otherwise similar trade union systems — a development which in Great Britain has led to the establishment of three sectional monopolies of representation, while in...

Title: Organizational Development and Change in a Union-Management Context: The Voluntary Establishment of Joint Health and Safety Committees in Britain
Author-Name: P.B. Beaumont
Author-Name: D.R. Deaton
Abstract: The organizational development literature has very largely ignored the role of trade unions, with the result that the traditional organizational change models are held to be unsuitable for analysing the establishment and maintenance of joint problem-solving structures. Accordingly in this article we draw on the mainstream industrial relations literature in order to develop a model which seeks to identify the relevant structural characteristics of plants that had voluntarily established joint health and safety commit tees. This model is tested by performing a multivariate analysis of data obtained from a survey of 970 establishments in the manufacturing sector in Britain.

Title: Workers Control Over the Organization of Work: French and English Maintenance Workers in Mass Production Industry
Author-Name: Pierre Dubois
Abstract: This article is concerned with the theory of joint control, and seeks to indicate the power relationships between participants in the organization of work. It is based on a compari son of monographs about similar French and English factories and shows the effects of trade union regulation (which is more powerful in England) on the division and pace of work among workers engaged in maintenance. It establishes that English maintenance workers sustain a stricter demarcation in favour of skilled men, and that they have preserved a monopoly over the greater part of the jobs requiring any sort of skill and strongly resist delegation of these jobs to their mates, to process workers, or to contractors' men. The article goes on to show that the English workers are more successful in resisting nonstop working and thus in preserving relatively large opportuni ties for overtime.

Title: Contributions of Organizational Sociology
Author-Name: Cornelis J. Lammers
Abstract: A case is made for the stance that sociologists who study organizations have been and are rendering more valuable services to organizational theory and practice by maintain ing the sociology of organization as a more or less distinct speciality than by simply joining hands with others in an interdisciplinary approach to the field. Some typical features of the sociological 'touch' in organizational analysis are singled out, namely (1) the view that organizations are recalcitrant tools, (2) the view that organizations form part and parcel of society, (3) the interest in cultural aspects and cultural determinants of organizational forms and processes, and (4) a specific ethos: problem orientation. Finally, the contributions of organizational sociology to practical and societal concerns are discussed. It is concluded that these contributions are of an indirect rather than of a direct kind.

Title: Corporate Goals, Managerial Objectives, and Organizational Structures in British and West German Companies
Author-Name: Andreas Budde
Author-Name: John Child
Author-Name: Arthur Francis
Author-Name: Alfred Kieser
Abstract: Arguments regarding the presence of similarities and differences in management and organization across countries draw attention to the potential relevance of culture, contextual contingencies, and economic-cum-political system. These are examined by reference to comparisons of corporate goals, managerial objectives, and modes of organizational structuring (particularly around the investment decision process) in British and West German companies. The findings reinforce the view that in capitalist systems high profitability and growth are dominant corporate goals. In some respects, the structure adopted by companies in the two countries appeared to match their contingent conditions, although differences in decision making were consistent with a culturalist explanation. Where contrasts emerged in the objectives and opinions held by senior managers it was not always clear whether these were more likely to be a reflection of cultural factors rather than, for example, the generally greater success of the German...

Title: Can the Manager's Mind Be Nationalized?
Author-Name: Yair Aharoni
Author-Name: Ran Lachman
Abstract: The 'raison d'être' of nationalization of enterprises is usually the achievement of national and collective goals. Adherence to such goals by the executives of the publicly owned enterprises is a key to their achievement. Yet, in many cases, the executive's adherence to public sector goals is taken for granted. This study examines the existence of expected differences in goal perceptions and attitudes among top executives of industrial enterprises affiliated with the public and private sectors in Israel. Almost no differences were found between the perceptions of these two groups of executives. The lack of differences indicates that mere affiliation with nationalized enterprises does not secure 'nationalization' of the executives' goal commitments and goal pursuit, and that the achievement of the nationalization objectives may be hindered.

Title: The Power of Organization or the Organization of Power?
Author-Name: David Knights
Author-Name: John Roberts
Abstract: This article presents some of the problems that need to be resolved if organization is to be developed to its full potential. Our central argument is that both management and staff typically act on the basis of a false understanding of the nature of power. Power is typically treated as if it were an individual possession, rather than as a relationship between people. Consequently, managers ignore or attempt to deny their ultimate dependence on staff, and use their power coercively. Staff respond with various coun tercoercive strategies. The result is a series of vicious circles which seriously undermine the productive potential of the relationship between management and staff.

Title: Comments on 'Contingency and Choice in Organization Theory' (Georg Schreyögg, OS 1/4: 305-326)
Author-Name: Lex Donaldson
Abstract: In Organization Studies 1/4, Schreyögg has argued that the contingency-design approach to the study of organizations has a number of shortcomings. These are related to the neglect of the analysis of political processes and of historically specific institution al settings. The present reply points out that a number of the supposed inadequacies of the contigency-design framework are based on a mischaracterization. Further, many of the issues addressed in a political action analysis are different from those examined in design research. Only the pursuit of contigency-design enquiries can provide the answers sought on the consequences of structural arrangements.

Title: Interlocking Interests and Collaboration with the Enemy: Corporate Behaviour in the Second World War
Author-Name: Ad Teulings
Abstract: The author presents a study of the functioning of Dutch industry, exemplified by the case of Philips, under German occupation during the Second World War. It is shown that economic collaboration with German economic institutions had its forerunners in peacetime arrangements, especially in patent pools with German enterprises and in cartels. The importance of patent pools as a vehicle for internationalization and their relative immunity from conflicts between nation-states is underlined. When German authors argue that up to 1943 the international economy was functioning'as if there was no war', then this is another way of saying that the international economy was an autonomous supersystem, for which no rules were effective other than the normal rules of economic behaviour under capitalism. But at the national level the exigencies of a totalitarian state do not allow much functional autonomy. Thus, one may conclude that whenever a state is labelled totalitarian, normal economic behaviour is, by definition, ...

Title: Electricity and Resistance: A Case Study of Innovation and Politics
Author-Name: David C. Wilson
Abstract: This article presents a case study of decision making in a British chemical organization. The initial problem is one of whether the generation of electricity is a feasible prop osition in addition to the production of chemicals. This issue acts as a platform for protracted political debate as soon as questions of career succession and career interests are aroused. The focus shifts from economic criteria to those of career aspirations. The decision spans four years, from 1964 to 1968, and data for the case study were collected over a three-year period, from 1976 to 1979. Existing notions of decision making are examined for their adequacy in explaining the events that took place and modifications to these concepts are explored in the analysis of the case study. It is found that hoth the effects of the organization and the specific individuals within it, combine simultaneously to produce the events of this decision. The article begins with a short introduction of existing decision making theories, follows wi...

Title: The Management of Hard Times: Budget Cutbacks in Public Sector Organizations
Author-Name: Todd D. Jick
Author-Name: Victor V. Murray
Abstract: Writing on organizational change to date has been implicitly predicated on an assump tion of organizations either growing or remaining stable in size and resources. However, the most likely future for most organizations, especially those in the public sector, is one of cutback and decline. The major changes such organizations face are those related to how to survive on less money. On this particular matter, comparatively little is known though interest is, perhaps understandably, starting to grow among organization theor ists and, to a much lesser extent, among organization researchers.The present article reviews the existing literature on organizational decline in public sector organizations. It makes a conceptual distinction between (a) the strategic deci sion responses regarding what to cut, if one must cut. and how to prevent having to make further cuts, and (b) the behavioural responses within the organization to the cuts that are made. A second major distinction is made between the 'objective' condi...

Title: Research Note: Bureaucracy in Hospitals: An Empirical Test of Hall's Theory in One Organizational Type
Author-Name: Jan Jozef Pool
Abstract: In a study in six general hospitals in The Netherlands, Hall's dimensional model of bureaucracy was tested for its applicabilitv in one type of organization. A pilot study with a group of staff nurses provided a reliable version of the original questionnaire translated and adapted to the hospital organization. But an individual analysis showed that the dimensional model had only a partial empirical basis, and the assumed indepen dence of the six dimensions was not confirmed. In a second study, the number of dimesions was reduced to five. Here data were also analysed at group level. The conclusion was reached that the dimensions of hierarchy of authority, impersonality, and rules/procedures can be reliably measured. Again independence was not found. It is suggested that in this type of organization. bureaucracy can better be approached as an integral concept. The scale has an acceptable degree of validity. Before firm conclusions on the applicability of the dimensional model can be drawn, further research ...

Abstract: This article summarizes the results of a research project on the organizational aspects of the legitimacy crisis at West German universities during the late 1960s. Theories on bureaucratization and professionalization were used to deduce relevant propositions. These were tested by causal analysis and decomposition into direct and indirect effects. The results exemplify problems arising when using the results of empirical research to guide policy recommendations. Proposals are put forward to integrate empirically tested causal models and action research into research strategies.

Title: Divisionalization and Size: A Theoretical and Empirical Critique
Author-Name: Lex Donaldson
Abstract: Previous work on large business organizations in advanced industrial countries has established that the substitution of a multidivisional for a functional structure is related to the degree of diversification. However, there also exists some theory and evidence which asserts the importance of size for divisionalization. This article examines the issue theoretically and empirically and concludes that divisionalization is more closely associated with diversification than with size, and that the former relationship predominates statistically. The argument from diversification is shown to be more cogent theoretically than that from size.

Title: Organization Theory and Federalism: Interorganizational Networks and the Political Economy of The Federalist
Author-Name: Herman L. Boschken
Abstract: The Federalist collection of papers, written by three co-founders of the American Constitution, Hamilton, Madison, and Jay, appeared periodically in 1787 and 1788 in New York. The papers were an attempt to persuade the polity of a pivotal state to accept a new form of government. This article is a theoretical inquiry into the congruence of The Federalist to modern concerns of organization theory. Its purpose is to look at this conceptual cornerstone of American government as a guide for the design and reorganization of present-day public organizations. The article points out areas of concern to modern administration and then links The Federalist logic to them through the notion of interorganizational networks. Following this, this article illustrates the congruency by addressing the problems of differentiation and integration. Some might view The Federalist as limited to the American setting, but in fact its creation occurred in light of European precedents and the rise of the administrative state. It, th...

Title: Scapegoating in Complex Organizations: The Results of a Comparative Study of Symbolic Blame-Giving in Italian and French Public Administration
Author-Name: Giuseppe Bonazzi
Abstract: A preliminary distinction is made between expressive and instrumental scapegoats. The latter are defined as the product of a rational strategy adopted by one or more power holders to prevent the blame for an incident from reaching higher hierarchical levels. The basic assumption in this article is that symbolic blame-giving processes within complex organizations must satisfy certain requirements in order to be credible. They can, thus, be studied in terms of purposive organizational behaviour and not solely as the emotional outcome of collective psychological dynamics. The analysis of five cases of scapegoating in the French political-administrative systems leads to the construction of a typology. The analysis of a number of Italian cases, however, shows that the French typology requires expansion in order to allow comparison with Italy. Possible means of achieving this comparison are suggested in the conclusion.

Data from a study of 66 companies in The Netherlands go beyond the Aston dependence scales to construct indices for three different types of commercial binding mechanisms as used by companies: (1) striving for active control of 'partners', (2) reacting to relations of dependence, and (3) safeguarding production rationality. Mintzberg's hypothesis regarding external control is tested and a new one regarding commercial ties and autonomy is offered. The existence of a large variety of interorganizational control mechanisms is em phasized.

Title: Effective In-House Personnel Research Units: Findings from Six U.K. Case Studies
Author-Name: Allan P. O. Williams
Author-Name: Rosalie Silverstone
Abstract: More needs to be known about the conditions under which in-house personnel research units make an impact on organizational problem-solving processes. This article attempts to identify the key variables by using a common framework to study six diverse units. A model is presented to highlight the main findings, and suggestions are made as to how a more quantitative study could operationalize the variables in the model.

Title: Research Note: Research Models Underlying Situational Dependency
Author-Name: Walter J. M. Kickert
Abstract: Some remarks on contingency theory will be made based on its definition as a theory on situation-dependent organizing. The main purpose of this article is to make a few comments on the way in which contingency studies have dealt with the concept of 'situational dependence'. The comments focus on the possible research models that might underlie the crucial concept 'situational dependency'. A set of interpretations of the concept of 'situational dependency' is presented and what type of empirical research model is implied by each of these interpretations and what their implications are for (e.g. statistical) data-processing techniques is shown. These insights are applied to existing empirical contingency research.

Title: Research Note: The Incompatibility of Comparisons: Comparative Studies of Organizations and the Cumulation of Scientific Knowledge
Author-Name: Marian J. Kostecki
Author-Name: Krzysztof Mreła
Abstract: If comparability is a prerequisite to statements about similarities/dissimilarities between objects, then the compatibility of comparative analyses is a prerequisite for a cumulative picture of the findings of many studies which are treated jointly. This issue is important because, although no single study solves all of the problems of organizational sociology, the results of several such studies together could significantly contribute to the development of theory. However, due to mutual incompatibility, the cumulation of scientific knowledge of organizations does not occur to the extent that the growing number of empirical studies would imply. This article presents some preliminary exemplifications of a technique for detecting incompatibilities. It is suggested that a satisfactory solution to the problem of incompatibility may be found not in the standardization of research methods but in the translatability of research concepts at a theoretical level.

Abstract: This article evaluates a causal model of organizational structure using heterogeneous samples of organizations from the US and Iran. The results indicate that theoretical models of organizational structure are clearly relevant to the Third World, and the remarkable similarity of the causal estimates obtained suggests that organizational structure may well be 'culture free'. The most important differences in these data concern the effects of technology and the results suggest that technology may prove to be an essential determinant of organizational structure in many non-Western countries.

Title: Interorganizational Co-operation and the Implementation of Labour Market Training Policies: Sweden and the Federal Republic of Germany
Author-Name: Laurence J. O'Toole, Jr
Abstract: In this article a theory of interorganizational co-operation is utilized to render some cases of local implementation understandable. The policy studied is labour market training and placement. Data from four locales in Sweden and the Federal Republic of Germany are analysed. In each nation one more- and one less-successful community are examined. First, the author compares the administrative requirements of the labour market task with the two national policies to assess their suitability. Then reasons for the degree of policy success and degree of interorganizational co-operation observed are sought. Perceived common interest in the locale and the presence of an interorganiza tional facilitative agent seem to be among the factors which affect co-operation. Some conclusions and implications for policy makers, implementers, and students of administration are sketched.

Abstract: This article reports the results of a longitudinal investigation of how interpretative schemes of organizational members change through time, and whether any contextual factors are related to this change. In an exploratory study of two bureaux of an American state highway department, which are different in terms of work demands, interpersonal interactions, and subordinate-superior relations, multidimensional scaling methodology is utilized to detect any changes in the perception of interpersonal interaction, which is assumed to represent the interpretative schemes of organization members. Results show that during a period of five years neither the perception of interpersonal interaction nor the contextual variables changed to a considerable degree. The only change which occurred is related to the surface articulation of interpersonal interaction, which is directly influenced by the day-to-day activities of the members.

Title: Capital Accumulation and the Du Pont Company: An Historical Analysis
Author-Name: Stephen J. McNamee
Abstract: This paper examines the construction of external environments on the part of the Du Pont Company through the four stages of capital accumulation: monopolization, diversification, research and development, and foreign expansion. This construction is viewed as a rationalizing strategy to reduce environmental uncertainty. Two main types of environmental uncertainty are identified. Material uncertainty pertains to uncertain ty regarding the flow of resources through the organization. Symbolic uncertainty pertains to uncertainties of meaning attached to organizational activities. Material construction of environmental conditions provided the Du Pont Company with a means of capital accumulation, while symbolic construction of environmental conditions provided the Du Pont Company with a means of capital legitimation

Title: Gender and Organizations: A Selective Review and a Critique of a Neglected Area
Author-Name: Jeff Hearn
Author-Name: P. Wendy Parkin
Abstract: This paper has two linked tasks: one strategic, the other tactical. The first is to provide a critical review of the state of knowledge within organization theory of the topic of gender and organizations. This is seen as a necessary project both because of the relative neglect of the topic and the scatter and variety of relevant literature. A second task, that is tactical in nature, is the reapplication of the typology of organizational analyses developed by Burrell and Morgan. The topic is reviewed in terms of functionalist, interpretive, radical structuralist, and radical humanist paradigms, together with the consideration of feminist critiques. Specific discussion is given to the questions of work and the division of labour, power and authority, and sexuality. The paper is concluded with a brief analysis of the implications of this literature for the general development of organization theory, and the specific implications for women and men researchers.

Title: Some Social Psychological Effects of Direct and Indirect Participation in Ten Swedish Companies
Author-Name: Sigvard Rubenowitz
Author-Name: Flemming Norrgren
Author-Name: Arnold S. Tannenbaum
Abstract: Sweden has introduced schemes of participation widely in its industrial and business organizations. We present in this article data concerning some of the social psychological effects of two forms of participation, indirect and direct, in ten Swedish factories. Indirect participation entails decision making through representatives of the employees; direct participation entails decision making by the employees them selves.Theories propose that participation has the effect of enhancing member reactions such as sense of commitment, favourable attitude and satisfaction in the company and of reducing dysfunctional reactions such as absenteeism. The data from these companies appear consistent with the above theories insofar as direct participation is concerned but not with respect to indirect participation. The data support the view that participation is likely to have the predicted effects on the reactions of members to the extent that participation is felt as a personal experience. Members are likely to feel ...

Title: Research Note: Linguistic Analysis of an Open-ended Questionnaire in an Organizational Study
Author-Name: Lars Engwall
Abstract: This paper discusses methods of data collection when opinions of organization members are required for a study. The advantages and disadvantages of rigorously structured questionnaires and open-ended questions are examined. Methods to increase the reliability in the analysis of open-ended questions are suggested. An application from a Swedish newspaper company demonstrates how qualitative and quantitative methods can be combined in the analysis of unstructured information. The results point to , differences in orientation between different occupational groups in the company. In addition the results indicate that qualitative and quantitative methods provide similar results. Finally, the feedback of the results to interviewees has pointed to the usefulness of the method both for research and as a tool in organizational development.

Abstract: This research note uses the Aston measure of Functional Specialization to examine the effect of the inclusion of smaller organizations than are normally present in studies employing this measure on the relationship between size and specialization. The presence of organizations between 25 and 100 employees raises the magnitude of the correlation coefficient slightly. A regression analysis is also carried out that implies that the prediction of specialization from size is somewhat sensitive to sample size. A correlation analysis of the size-specialization relationship is also undertaken for discrete size ranges.

Title: Interactions between the Educational and Employment Systems in the German Democratic Republic and the Soviet Union
Author-Name: Anna-Jutta Pietsch
Abstract: This paper investigates the consequences for employment in the GDR and USSR of expansion and changes in education. As in many Western countries, change in education disturbed the balance between systems of education and employment. In East Germany, efforts to remodel the employment system by changing the organi zation of work to fit the qualifications of employees began after an imbalance had been produced by raising the qualifications of skilled workers to a uniquely high level. In the Soviet Union the same imbalance is now occurring. An excess of applicants over places in universities was followed by an attempt to provide an alternative to university by expanding vocational training. In turn, this is raising skills beyond the level required by the existing organization of work, and is being followed by an attempt to change the latter by introducing so-called 'brigade organization'. This is intended to increase the autonomy and responsibility of production workers by what might be described as a partial ...

Title: Scarcity in the Environment: Organizational Perceptions, Interpretations and Responses
Author-Name: Gail Nottenburg
Author-Name: Donald B. Fedor
Abstract: Extant models of organizational decline tend to oversimplify the processes underlying the formulation of organizational responses to scarcity in the environment. A model is presented that attempts to enrich this area by using the organization's myth system as a reference point. A number of phases are considered: (a) organizational success and the perceived cause of the success; (b) the elaboration of this 'recipe for success' into a myth system which deeply impacts information gathering mechanisms and resource allocations in the organization; (c) the detection and interpretation of information indicative of scarcity in the environment; (d) the attribution of the scarcity to internal or external causes; and (e) the further discrimination of this attribution to enable formulation of a coping strategy.

Abstract: An empirical study of successful and unsuccessful phases of the life cycle revealed two very significant differences. First, successive successful phases showed gradual and continual increases in the sophistication of their information processing and decision making methods. Unsuccessful phases showed no such continuous development. Second, successful phases revealed few differences in innovation-related variables, while unsuccessful phases demonstrated more significant differences, alternating between greater extremes of innovation and stagnation.

Title: Research Review
Author-Name: S.R. Ganesh
Author-Name: T. Rangarajan
Abstract: The present paper is a 'state of art' review of the organization behaviour research in India during the last decade. It identifies three dominant themes in the literature, viz. person themes, process themes, and action themes. Over 50 percent of the research is still on person themes with its moorings in psychology. Only 14 percent of the work centres around organizational processes and a third is descriptive writings of interventions primarily by outside consultants with very few planned research elements. Based on this, the article explores the implications in a historical perspective and attempts to place Indian work in the international context. It concludes that future work in OB in India has to be rooted in the organizational realities of the country and not based on imported concepts.

Title: The Management and Power Structure of Chinese Enterprises during and after the Cultural Revolution; with Empirical Data Comparing Chinese and European Enterprises
Author-Name: Oiva Laaksonen
Abstract: During the history of Communist China, the management and structure of enterprises have undergone great changes, reaching their culmination during the Cultural Revolution and afterwards under the new administration which followed the late Chairman Mao-Zedong. The main shifts in recent years have been: from the use of ideology in guiding organizations towards the use of economic rewards; a move towards decentralization of enterprise management; and one towards a limited free market system in the economy.The paper is divided into two main parts. First we analyse the development of the power structure in Chinese enterprises since the Cultural Revolution, and in the second part we study how the changes in the power structure appear in the influence of different interest groups in decision making at the end of 1980, comparing the results of the IDE study of European enterprises with interview and personally administered questionnaire data collected in China. On the whole, European personnel appear to exercise ...

Title: Managerial Orientations and Workers' Job Responses in Labour-Owned and Private Industrial Plants in Israel
Author-Name: Bilha Mannheim
Abstract: The study compares the managerial orientations and workers' attitudes in labour- owned enterprises to those in privately owned enterprises in Israel. Data were collected by means of closed questionnaires from production managers and 847 production workers in a representative sample of 57 industrial plants stratified by size and sector of ownership. Contrary to the expectations derived from the formal ideology of labour control, no differences were found in the orientations of line managers to workers and in the work centrality, job satisfaction and identification with the enterprise of workers in labour-owned plants as compared to privately owned plants. It was found, however, that in small plants managerial orientations explain more variance of workers' responses, especially of work centrality, in labour as compared to private plants. In large plants, these stronger relationships were not found.The findings are discussed in terms of their implications for labour ownership and worker outcomes, both from a...

Title: The Impact of Organizational Culture on Approaches to Organizational Problem-Solving
Author-Name: Paul Bate
Abstract: This paper shows how organizational culture can act as an obstacle to change and problem resolution. The introduction describes how the author's interest in 'problem cultures' arose, and the next two sections attempt to define and refine the definition and methodology of organizational culture. The main section summarizes the problematical characteristics of those cultures studied: six cultural orientations are identified and their effects examined. A number of issues are then discussed: by what process does culture shape behaviour? What evidence is there for the wider existence of the cultural orientations described? A 'universal-variable' thesis or organizational culture is put forward, and the concluding remarks seek to establish a relationship between organizational culture and orientations to change.

Title: Research Note: The Kibbutz as a Situation for Cross-Cultural Research1
Author-Name: Uri Leviatan
Abstract: It is argued that the kibbutz society comprises a unique combination of similarities and differences with other societies which makes it a fruitful area for cross-cultural research. The similarities lie in the personal characteristics of individuals, in the pattern of relationships between key variables and in some global features of the kibbutz communities. The differences centre upon the principles of organization and the conduct of kibbutz communities. The similarities thus facilitate comparison between kibbutzim and other industrial societies while the differences allow for the expansion of theories and further generalizations and experimentation with alternative solutions to social problems of industrial society. Finally, the paper presents some problems and difficulties in employing the kibbutz as part of cross-cultural research and suggests possible remedies to these problems of comparison.

Title: Sex and Organizational Analysis
Author-Name: Gibson Burrell
Abstract: The focus of the paper is on the process of organizational desexualization which has taken place over a long historical period and upon the resistance which this process has engendered amongst organizational subordinates. The eradication of the high level of sexual activity which took place in pre-industrial organizations was sought by those in positions of authority and the paper considers the variety of mechanisms which were developed to attain this expulsion. These mechanisms are well entrenched in contemporary organizations, yet have met with considerable resistance from lower-order organizational members. The paper considers certain forms of resistance in this light in an attempt to suggest a dialectical approach to sexuality. It is concluded that the issue of sex is one which organizational analysis has avoided for too long.

Title: Structural Dimensions of University Departments and their Context: The Case of West Germany
Author-Name: Rudi K. Bresser
Abstract: This study applies the Aston methodology for measuring formal organizational structures to a sample of 35 West German university departments. Three structural dimensions are developed, namely academic control, bureaucratic control, and nonworkflow proportion, and they differ considerably from the original Aston findings. The structural dimensions and many structural and contextual variables show score levels which differ across scientific fields. It is demonstrated that these differences can be explained by the varying levels of paradigm development represented by the departments analysed.

Title: Alternative Explanations of Interorganizational Cooperation: the Case of Joint Programmes and Joint Ventures in Sweden
Author-Name: Anders Edström
Author-Name: Bengt Högberg
Author-Name: Lars Erik Norback
Abstract: Two alternative explanations of interorganizational cooperation are analysed. One is based on an open-systems approach (an outside-in explanation) where cooperation is viewed as a means to manage existing interdependencies with the environment. The other is an inside-out perspective, interpreting cooperation as a means to acquire resources that are necessary in order to establish new interdependencies. The two approaches imply different predictions as to the choice of partners and the type of resources pooled by the partners. This study attempts to reconcile the two explanations, and argues that they are contingent upon the strategic role of cooperation, as expressed by the significant actors of the cooperating organizations.

Title: Research Note: Trade Unions, Conflict, and the Nature of Work in Residential Service Organizations
Author-Name: Patricia Yancey Martin
Abstract: Conflicts involving trade unions in fourteen small residential service organizations (RSOs)—children's homes, old peoples' homes, and probation hostels—in a western county in England over a 20-month period are studied via a grounded theory methodology. Results indicate that (1) multiple and competing unions stimulate intraworker conflict and complicate labour-management relations; (2) unions representing RSO workers are pragmatic and work-conditions oriented in their collective bargaining activities; and (3) unions' efforts to negotiate the 'nature of work' for their members are based on the 'ideology of service' which pervades British society and views persons dependent on the state for 'basic human needs' as 'deserving' to have those needs met. This 'service ideology' is both exploited by the unions to define workers' jobs and used by management and society to prevent organized RSO workers from employing the 'strike' as a collective bargaining option. Union efforts to negotiate work in RSOs are viewed a...
